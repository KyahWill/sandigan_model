Dr. Normando Legaspi and Angelita Legaspi by virtue of a court decision dated March 21, 1994.&nbsp; The undersigned repeatedly insisted that they have to vacate the property subject of the writ and gave them a period of fifteen (15) days to prepare and bring or take out all their belongings but the intervenor Milagros Pascual told the undersigned that she will first relay this matter to her lawyer.<br></blockquote>The undersigned is initially returning this writ of possession for the information and guidance of the Honorable Court.<br></blockquote>Complainant claimed he made several follow-ups for respondent to implement the writ, but the latter failed and refused to do so.<br><br>On 04 August 2003, respondent filed an urgent motion/manifestation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> asking the court <i>a quo </i>to issue an order directing either the continuance or discontinuance of the implementation of the writ of possession considering that he was informed of the <i>certiorari</i> case filed by defendants in the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On 08 August 2003, the court<i> a quo</i> issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> directing the continuance of the implementation of the writ of possession until such time that a restraining order will be issued by the trial court against the implementation of the same.<br><br>Up until recently, the writ of possession appears not to have been implemented.&nbsp; Complainant claimed that respondent sheriff’s act of willfully and unlawfully refusing to implement the writ of possession for more than one (1) year despite follow-ups, constitutes gross neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming of a public official.&nbsp; A complaint was, thus, filed against Sheriff Tobillo.<br><br>On 30 March 2004, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) required<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> respondent to file his comment within ten (10) days from receipt.<br><br>On 03 May 2004, respondent filed an urgent <i>ex parte</i> motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> for extension of time to file answer, and was favorably acted upon by OCA on 17 June 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In his answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> respondent denies that he refused to implement the writ of possession.&nbsp; He maintained that he sought the proper guidelines from the court by filing an Urgent Motion/Manifestation asking the court to issue an order directing the continuance or discontinuance of the implementation of the writ of possession, as he received a copy of the petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>filed by defendant Milagros Pascual in the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; He stated that complainant did not make any formal effort to pursue his legal actions.&nbsp; He also stated that on 28 November 2003, the duty to implement the writ of possession was transferred to the <i>Ex Officio</i> Sheriff.&nbsp; He likewise maintained that the filing of the instant administrative complaint is premature, considering that the court has yet to rule on the motion filed by complainant to cite respondent for indirect contempt.<br><br>In his reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> complainant averred he was constrained to file the administrative complaint because respondent refused to implement the writ despite follow-ups.&nbsp; He said he informed respondent that the writ of possession should be implemented considering that the Court of Appeals has not issued any restraining order to stop the implementation of the writ.<br><br>On 21 December 2004, the OCA submitted the following recommendations:<br><blockquote>Respectfully submitted is our recommendation that the instant case be RE-DOCKETTED as a regular administrative matter and respondent Sheriff Alejandro L. Tobillo be ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of P10,000.00 with a stern warning that a repetition of similar acts shall be dealt with severely.<br></blockquote>We agree in the findings of the OCA except for the recommended penalty.<br><br>Sheriffs play an important role in the administration of justice.&nbsp; They are tasked to execute final judgments of the courts.&nbsp; If not enforced, such decisions become empty victories of the prevailing parties.&nbsp; As agents of the law, sheriffs are called upon to discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence because in serving the court’s writs and processes and implementing its orders, they cannot afford to err without affecting the integrity of their office and the efficient administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The duty of sheriffs to promptly execute a writ is mandatory and ministerial.&nbsp; Sheriffs have no discretion on whether or not to implement a writ.&nbsp; There is no need for the litigants to “follow-up” its implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Sheriffs ought to know that they have a sworn responsibility to serve writs of execution with utmost dispatch.&nbsp; When writs are placed in their hands, it is their ministerial duty to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to execute them in accordance with their mandate.&nbsp; Unless restrained by a court order, they should see to it that the execution of judgments is not unduly delayed.&nbsp; Accordingly, they must comply with their mandated ministerial duty as speedily as possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Their unreasonable failure or neglect to perform such function constitutes inefficiency and gross neglect of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the court perceives a bit of lackluster attitude on the part of the respondent sheriff in the enforcement of the writ of possession in Civil Case No. R-4240.&nbsp; It appears that the decision was rendered on 01 March 1994 and respondent implemented the writ of possession dated 10 October 2002 by serving a copy thereof to defendants on 16 October 2002 and to intervenor Milagros Pascual on 17 October 2002, but the same remained unacted upon as intervenor Pascual told him she would still consult her lawyer.&nbsp; From then on, respondent sheriff did not make any action on the writ.&nbsp; It was only on 23 and 25 July 2003 when he tried to enforce the writ again but failed to do so as intervenor Milagros Pascual informed him that she had filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and injunction in the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Instead of proceeding with the implementation of the writ, respondent filed a manifestation in the lower court asking whether he would continue with the implementation of the writ.&nbsp; Despite receipt of the order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated 08 August 2003 directing the continuance of the implementation of the writ, respondent implemented the subject writ only on 15, 22 and 29 September and 14 October 2003.&nbsp; The writ remained unimplemented as the occupants refused to vacate the subject land.<br><br>Pursuant to the writ issued, respondent should have ousted defendants/intervenors from the subject lot.&nbsp; He failed to do so.&nbsp; That the occupants refused to vacate the premises as they would still consult a lawyer and that they filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court of Appeals, were not valid excuses.&nbsp; The pendency of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with any court is not sufficient excuse to defer the implementation of the said writ more specifically that the trial court had already ordered him to continue implementing the writ.&nbsp; Indeed, it was incumbent upon him to proceed without haste and to put the winning parties in possession of the premises and employ such means as may be necessary to enforce the writ.<br><br>The fact that respondent handed a copy of the writ to the defendants and filed his return does not mean that he had already discharged his duty.&nbsp; The essence of his job was to give the plaintiffs full control and possession of the subject lot.&nbsp; He miserably failed to do this.<br><br>Respondent’s procrastination which resulted in the long delayed execution of the court’s judgment is truly deplorable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> A judgment, if left unattended would be an empty victory for the prevailing party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Rendered inutile is a decision left unexecuted or delayed indefinitely because of the sheriff’s inefficiency, negligence, misconduct or ignorance.&nbsp; Moreover, the parties who are prejudiced tend to condemn the entire judicial system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>All employees in the judiciary should be examples of responsibility, competence, and efficiency.&nbsp; As officers of the court and agents of the law, they must discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence.&nbsp; Any conduct they exhibit tending to diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary will not be condoned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Time and again we have ruled that high standards are expected of sheriffs who play an important role in the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This was further expounded in the case of <i>Vda.
