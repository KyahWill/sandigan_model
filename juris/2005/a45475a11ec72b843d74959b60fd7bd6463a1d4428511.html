The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 29 June 1990 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 19, Cauayan, Isabela, in Civil Case No. 19-300 in favor of herein private respondents for collection of a sum of money with damages.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Facts</span><br><br>In 1982, the National Power Corporation (NPC) entered into an agreement with ROMAGO ELECTRIC CO., INC. (ROMAGO), under Contract No. Sp80DLC-502, for the erection and installation of NPC's 69 KV 3-Phase Transmission Lines from Santiago-Jones, Jones-Saguday and Cauayan-Roxas, Isabela, for an agreed consideration of P2,657,856.40.<br><br>Subsequently, on 07 June 1982, ROMAGO subcontracted the project to BICC Construction, an unregistered loose partnership composed of Soledad Cac, Delfin Inciong, Joephil Bien and Renato Cunanan, for and in consideration of the sum of P1,614,387.99. Under the subcontract agreement, the following documents, collectively termed therein as "Contract Documents," were incorporated into and made part of the contract "as though fully written out and set forth herein," to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE I<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOCUMENTS COMPRISING THE CONTRACT</span><br></div><br>The following documents are hereby incorporated and made part of this Contract as though fully written out and set forth herein insofar as they are not inconsistent with the terms thereof:<br><ol><li> National Power Corporation's Specification No. Sp80DLc – 502<br><br></li><li>Any and all plans, drawings, and schedules prepared by National Power Corporation.<br><br></li><li> SUB-CONTRACTOR'S proposal dated March 8, 1982.<br></li></ol>The documents mentioned above shall collectively be referred to as "Contract Documents."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Also in the aforementioned agreement, the subcontractor's obligations are defined in its Article II, to wit:<br><blockquote>SUB-CONTRACTOR shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Contract and Contract Documents, fully and faithfully furnish all labor, tools, equipment and necessary materials (except NPC supplied) and proceed to completely perform the Erection and Installation of the 69 KV, 3 Phases Transmission Lines (Schedule II) under the 7th Power Loan.<br><br>SUB-CONTRACTOR shall commence the work starting March 23, 1982 and shall complete the same within two hundred forty (240) calendar days plus any extension of time duly granted by National Power Corporation under the provisions of the Contract Documents.<br><br>Except as otherwise provided for herein, all provisions of the National Power Corporation's Specifications No. Sp80DLc-502, with reference to obligations, responsibilities of Contractor thereunder are hereby made applicable to the SUB-CONTRACTOR under this Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>In the course of the construction, the NPC granted ROMAGO a Contract Price Adjustment (CPA) amounting to P250,778.65.<br><br>Under the provision governing the CPA, as embodied in GP-08<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the "Plans and Specifications":<br><blockquote>GP-08 CONTRACT PRICE ADJUSTMENT<br><br>Adjustment of contract prices will be made should any or both of the following conditions occur as embodied in P.D.

Payment was nonetheless released to ROMAGO by virtue of a sworn affidavit executed by ROMAGO's Vice President for Finance Eduardo Cruz who certified that "there does not exist any lien or encumbrances against" the said NPC-ROMAGO contract.<br><br>It appears that on 04 October 1983, Mariano Cac, authorized representative and husband of Soledad Cac, one of the partners of BICC Construction, was paid the amount of P38,712.70 "in full payment of accounts including retention of various works at NPC-Isabela" under defendant's Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 23162 dated 03 October 1983.<br><br>When BICC's demands for payment were ignored by ROMAGO, the partners, thru Mrs. Soledad Cac as lone plaintiff, filed a complaint for collection of sum of money with damages.<br><br>In its pre-trial order of 23 November 1988, the lower court summed up the issues agreed upon by the parties, as follows:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">1.

"While it is true that National Power Corporation's Specification No. Sp80DLC-502 were among those Contract Documents forming part of the Subcontract. . ., it would be gross judicial error to read the grant of the CPA in the Subcontract. These Contract Documents were incorporated in the Subcontract for the purpose of binding private respondents in fulfilling the obligations and responsibilities of petitioner in the latter's contract with NPC. . . ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The petitioner further hypothesizes that "(h)ad the parties intended that private respondents shall be entitled to share in the CPA that may be granted by NPC to petitioner, the Subcontract could have expressly stipulated. But it did not. ... Moreover, in Art. I of the Subcontract, it provides that the Contract Documents incorporated shall only be considered fully written insofar as they are not inconsistent with the terms thereof. NPC Contract No. Sp80DLC-502 being inconsistent to the unequivocal silence of the Subcontract with respect to the grant of CPA, private respondents are not entitled to grant of the CPA."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>For its part, however, the Court of Appeals ruled that the private respondents' claim under the CPA is meritorious.<br><br>The appellate court clarified that the provision of the CPA is not found in the NPC-Romago contract,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> but in the NPC's "Plans and Specifications."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On the other hand, the "obligations and responsibilities" averred to by the petitioner "are, in appellant's own words, those flowing from "the provisions of the x x x contract entered into between NPC and ROMAGO...'" Thus, the phrase "obligations and responsibilities" should only qualify the main contract and not the other Contract Documents.<br><br>The records of the present case sustain the findings of the Court of Appeals. Thus, the petition must fail.<br><br>Contrary to the petitioner's asseverations that the CPA was not intended to be made applicable to the Romago-BICC subcontract, it must be remembered that the petitioner and the private respondents expressly agreed what documents were going to be incorporated in the principal subcontract. We agree with the appellate court that the qualifying phrase "obligations and responsibilities" contained in the Romago-BICC subcontract was applicable only to the NPC-Romago contract. What is more, the CPA is not found in the NPC-Romago contract,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> but in the NPC's "Plans and Specifications"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which was expressly included as part of the "Contract Documents," to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE I<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOCUMENTS COMPRISING THE CONTRACT</span><br></div><br>The following documents are hereby incorporated and made part of this Contract as though fully written out and set forth herein insofar as they are not inconsistent with the terms thereof:<br><ol><li> National Power Corporation's Specification No. Sp80DLc – 502<br><br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Any and all plans, drawings, and schedules prepared by National Power Corporation.</span><br><br></li><li> SUB-CONTRACTOR'S proposal dated March 8, 1982.<br></li></ol><br>The documents mentioned above shall collectively be referred to as "Contract Documents."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>As propitiously pointed out by the Court of Appeals, the NPC prepared a document entitled, "Plans and Specifications," paragraph GP-O8 of which deals with contract price adjustment:<br><blockquote>It must be stressed herein that among the documents which were incorporated into and made part of the ROMAGO-BICC contract (Exh. "D") "as though fully written out and set forth" therein are "[A]ny and all plans, drawings, and schedules prepared by the National Power Corporation." Relative thereto, appellant makes no denial of the fact that in connection with the project in question, there was prepared by the NPC a document entitled "Plans and Specifications" (Exhs. "E" to "E-5"), paragraph GP-O8 of which deals on contract price adjustment, thus:<br><blockquote>"GP-O8 CONTRACT PRICE ADJUSTMENT<br><br>Adjustment of contract prices will be made should any or both of the following conditions occur as embodied in PD No. 454 as amended by PD No. 459:<blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">(a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">If during the effectivity of the contract, the cost of labor, materials, equipment rentals and supplies for construction should increase or decrease due to the direct acts of the Philippine Government. The increase of prices of gasoline and other fuel oils, and of cement shall be considered as direct acts of the Philippine Government. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">If during the effectivity of the contract, the costs of labor, equipment rentals, construction materials and supplies used in the project should cause the sum total of the prices of bid items to increase or decrease by more than five percent (5%) compared with the total contract price." (Exh. "E-5-A).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>And assuming for the sake of argument that the qualifying phrase "obligations and responsibilities" applies to the other Contract Documents, upon closer inspection of the provisions granting the CPA, it is quite evident that said provision consequently requires an obligation or responsibility on the part of the petitioner that in the event of a decrease in the cost of labor, materials, equipment rentals and supplies for construction, etc., the reduction of the contract price will be for the account of the petitioner. The provision respecting the grant of CPA does not merely provide for the probability of receipt of additional payment, but it also involves an obligation on the part of the petitioner and the private respondents to return any excess payment received from the NPC in the event of any decrease in the cost of labor, materials, equipment rentals and supplies for the construction of said transmission lines.<br><br>The petitioner's view that the CPA provision is inconsistent with the tenor of the subcontract is indefensible. In contrast, the inverse is true. Contrary to the petitioner's assertions, there is nothing in the subcontract that supports the claimed inconsistency. Had the parties to the subcontract intended to restrict the application of the CPA provision, they would have particularly stated so. Alas, they only made a sweeping statement as to what documents were to be deemed read into the subcontract. To borrow the words of the petitioner, the unequivocal silence of the subcontract with respect to the non-applicability of the CPA necessitates the entitlement of the private respondents to said adjustment.<br><br>Finally, the petitioner relies heavily on the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">MC Engineering, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In said case, we held that:<br><blockquote>In a subcontract transaction, the benefit of a main contractor is not unjust even if it does less work, and earns more profit, than the subcontractor. The subcontractor should be satisfied with its own profit, even though less than the main contractor's, because that is what it bargained for and contracted with the main contractor. Article 22 of the Civil Code is not intended to insure that every party to a commercial transaction receives a profit corresponding to its effort and contribution. If a subcontractor knowingly agrees to receive a profit less than its proportionate contribution, that is its own lookout. The fact that a subcontractor accepts less does not make it dumb for that may be the only way to beat its competitors. The winning subcontractor cannot be allowed to later on demand a higher price after bagging the contract and beating competitors who asked for higher prices. Even if the subcontractor incurs a loss because of its low price, it cannot invoke Article 22 of the Civil Code to save it from financial loss. Article 22 is not a safety net against bad or overly bold business decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Its reliance is misplaced. Upon a thorough review of the facts of the above-quoted case, it is quite evident that its particulars are not on all fours with the circumstances of the case at bar.<br><br>In the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">MC Engineering, Inc., </span>MC Engineering, Inc. and Surigao Coconut Development Corporation entered into a contract for the restoration of the latter's building, land improvement, electrical and mechanical works which were damaged by a strong typhoon. The next day, MC Engineering, Inc. entered into a subcontract agreement with Gerent Builders. The subcontracted work covered only the restoration of the building and improvement portion of the original contract. Two months later, Surigao and MC Engineering, Inc., entered into another agreement amending Section 7 of the original contract by increasing the price of the civil works,<span style="font-style: italic;"> i.e.,</span> building and land improvement, to P854,851.51. When the subcontracted work was completed, subcontractor Gerent received the payment of the works done under the subcontract. Subsequently, however, Gerent claimed an additional P632,590.13 as its shares in the adjusted contract price pertaining to the civil works, alleging that the subcontract is subject to the re-adjustment provided for in Section 7, as amended, plus P166,252.00 for additional works outside the scope of the subcontract. MC Engineering, Inc. refused to pay Gerent, thus, the latter filed a complaint in court.<br><br>This Court ruled in favor of MC Engineering, Inc., as it found that the main contract between MC Engineering, Inc. and Surigao clearly provides that "as a condition precedent for any upward or downward adjustment in the contract price, there must first be a true valuation of the materials and labor costs to be determined through evaluation and inspection by representatives of petitioner and Sucodeco. A similar provision is found in the subcontract requiring, before any change in the subcontract price, for a true valuation to be determined by Sucodeco, petitioner and respondent Gerent. The records establish that respondent Gerent was responsible for making the estimates of the actual cost of the civil works which served as basis for the original price of the main contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The evidence adduced, however, revealed that the parties did not undertake any true valuation of the cost of civil works. We held:<br><blockquote>. . . The price increase could not have been based on a true valuation because no true valuation was ever made as required by the main contract and subcontract. There is no substantial evidence to support respondent Gerent's assertion that the price increase was based on a second estimate that Gerent allegedly supplied petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, though, the provisions pertaining to the CPA are quite clear the adjustment in the contract price,<span style="font-style: italic;"> i.e., </span>increase or decrease, is dependent on the application of appropriate official indices, as compiled and issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines, and not on the acts of any of the parties to the contract or subcontract. In fact, there is no issue as to the occurrence of any of the scenarios envisioned under the provisions of GP-08 that necessitated the increase as stated in the contract as well as in the subcontract.<br><br>Anent the third and fourth assigned errors, the petitioner asserts that whatever claims the private respondents may have against it, including the CPA, has been extinguished when Mariano Cac received from the petitioner a check for P38,712.70 representing "full payment of accounts including retention for various works at NPC-Isabela... ." This is so due to the fact that said authorized representative or agent had the authority to bind the private respondents. By signing and receiving, he released the petitioner from whatever claims private respondents had against the former in connection with the subcontract, including the CPA.<br><br>Petitioner Romago's position is untenable.<br><br>The very same petition that the petitioner filed with the Court clearly negates its position. Said pleading expressly states that "...the CPA is not included in the computation." This is precisely because the petitioner believes that the private respondents are not entitled to the CPA, hence, "there is no basis for including it."<br><br>Said CPA not being part of the subcontract price of P1,614,387.99, the release mentioned in the cash voucher cannot, therefore, be construed as a release of the CPA. In fact, nowhere in the computation prepared by petitioner's finance manager, Narita Chalak, provides for the payment of the CPA, to wit:<br>  <br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">RE: BICC CONSTRUCTION</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Total Actual Billing of BICC to Romago -- ---</td><td width="21%"><div align="right">P1,355,713.22</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Less:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(1) Withholding tax .0045%</td><td width="32%">- P     6,100.70</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(2) Total payments made</td><td>- 1,143,387.76</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(3) Material Accountability</td><td> -       8,076.61</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">(4) NPC Material Acct.</td></tr><tr><td width="28%">   Local </td><td width="19%">-P14,631.75</td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td>   Foreign</td><td>-  64,373.79</td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td>   Surcharge fee</td><td>-  16,093.44</td><td>        95,098.98</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Penalty for 33 days</td><td>        64,337.46</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">(P1,317,000.55)</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Total Balance Due BICC including Retention  -</td><td><div align="right">P  38,712.71</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"> <br></td><td><div align="right">===========</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">(Paid per CDV #23162 ) – 10-3-83.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></td><td> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>As to the final issue regarding the amount of CPA the private respondents are entitled to, we disagree with the petitioner that the private respondents are only entitled to the amount of P134,755.10 representing 70% of the CPA claimed by petitioner Romago from NPC <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span> tax due thereon and P38,712.70, the amount received by BICC contained in Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 23162.
