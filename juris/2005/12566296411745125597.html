 of 9 August 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 138, Makati City, 
in Criminal Case No.99-026 finding accused-appellant Rogelio Moreno y 
Reg (hereafter ROGELIO) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special 
complex crime of robbery with rape and sentencing him to suffer the 
penalty of death and to pay the amounts of P200,000 as moral damages and
 P1,000 representing the value of the personal property taken from the 
victim Marites Felix (hereafter MARITES).<br>
  <br>
  The accusatory portion of the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> reads as follows:<br>
  <br>
  <blockquote>That on or about the 8th day of January 1999 in the City

    <br>
    CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon arraignment on 25 January 1999, ROGELIO, with the assistance of counsel <i>de oficio</i>, entered a plea of not guilty.<br>
  <br>
  At the pre-trial, the only fact the parties could agree on was that 
ROGELIO was wearing a Burger Machine T-shirt at the time he was 
arrested.&nbsp; Thereafter trial ensued.<br>
  <br>
  The victim, 20-year-old MARITES, testified that at about 12:45 A.M. of
 8 January 1999, as she was walking along ABC Commercial Complex, 
Makati, after her duty as service crew of the Burger Machine outlet 
located at Guadalupe Nuevo, Makati, she noticed a man behind her.&nbsp; 
Suddenly, the man put his arms around her and pointed a fan-knife at her
 neck.&nbsp; Since the place was illuminated by streetlights and lights 
coming from the ABC Commercial Complex, MARITES noticed the tattoos in 
his arms and recognized him to be accused-appellant ROGELIO. Prior to 8 
January 1999, ROGELIO would pass by their Burger Machine outlet twice a 
week, but there was never an occasion that he bought something from 
Burger Machine. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br>
   <br>
   ROGELIO dragged MARITES and at the same time ordered her to follow 
him to the side of ABC Complex, which is about five arms-length away 
from EDSA.&nbsp; MARITES removed her ring from her bag and gave it to 
ROGELIO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The latter told her, “<i>Mamaya na iyan</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> “[T]hat will come later on because I will give it back to you but you have to follow me first.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br>
  <br>
  ROGELIO grabbed MARITES’s long-sleeved shirt, unbuttoned it, and 
pushed her to the vacant space behind the car then parked on the side of
 ABC Complex.&nbsp; He again pointed his knife at her throat and pulled down 
her pants.&nbsp; To her plea for mercy, he replied “<i>Huwag kang maingay, kundi papatayin kita.</i>”&nbsp; ROGELIO then removed his pants and again uttered “<i>Huwag kang maingay kundi sasaksakin kita.</i>”&nbsp; Still, she told him that he could get her bag if he needed money, but he replied, “I do not need money.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br>
   <br>
   ROGELIO ordered MARITES to open her legs apart or else he would kill 
her.&nbsp; MARITES was forced to obey him.&nbsp; ROGELIO then went on top of her 
with his right hand holding her throat, inserted his sexual organ into 
hers, and kept on pumping.&nbsp; After he was through, ROGELIO went again on 
top of MARITES and ordered her to put his organ inside her vagina. 
MARITES said, “<i>Ayoko.</i>”&nbsp; At this point, she heard someone nearby 
running.&nbsp; ROGELIO forthwith put on his shorts and snatched the shoulder 
bag of MARITES, which contained her ATM card, P200 cash, a small Bible, 
coupons of Burger Machine and T-shirt with Burger Machine markings.&nbsp; He 
then ran away towards the direction of the other side of EDSA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br>
  <br>
  The vendors who saw MARITES crying as she was walking inquired about 
what happened to her.&nbsp; They brought her back to the Burger Machine 
outlet and called the police. MARITES joined the police in the search 
for&nbsp; ROGELIO around the vicinity and to the place where the incident 
happened.&nbsp; One of the two policemen saw her ring in said place. They 
continued to search the vicinity until they reached Laperal Compound.&nbsp; 
As they were approaching Guadalupe Bridge, several persons who were 
talking to each other scampered away upon seeing MARITES and the police 
officers.&nbsp; One of them was ROGELIO, who immediately went inside a house 
and turned off its lights.&nbsp; With the assistance of the barangay <i>tanod</i>,
 the police went to the back portion of the house and saw ROGELIO, who 
at the time was wearing a hat and a blue jacket with his head bowed 
down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br>
   <br>
   Upon seeing ROGELIO, MARITES exclaimed: “He is the one.” ROGELIO 
refused to remove his hat when she tried to remove it.&nbsp; After finally 
succeeding in removing his hat, MARITES confirmed: “He [was] the one who
 raped me.”&nbsp; She then removed his jacket and saw under it her T-shirt 
with Burger Machine prints at the left sleeve and catsup stains in the 
front and upper parts of the shirt.&nbsp; This was the shirt she used in 
working at their Burger Machine outlet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br>
  <br>
  The police brought ROGELIO and MARITES to the police station where 
MARITES was investigated. At 9:00 A.M. of the following day, MARITES was
 examined by Dr. Aurea P. Villena, a medico-legal officer of the 
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br>
   <br>
   Dr. Aurea P. Villena testified that she conducted an examination on 
MARITES and found that MARITES sustained contusions on her breasts.&nbsp; She
 also noted the following:<br>
  <br>
  <blockquote>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <br>
  SPO3 Quillano Molmisa of the Makati Police Station corroborated the 
testimony of MARITES that upon receiving her complaint for rape, he, 
together with the latter and SPO4 Alejandro Alisangco, proceeded to the 
Laperal Compound in Guadalupe, which was known to the police officers as
 a hiding place of criminals in that area.&nbsp; ROGELIO ran away upon seeing
 MARITES and the police officers.&nbsp; ROGELIO was later found hiding in a 
kneeling position in Laperal Compound. MARITES was hysterical as she 
positively identified ROGELIO. SPO3 Molmisa brought ROGELIO to the <i>Ospital ng Makati</i> for medical examination before bringing him to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br>
  <br>
  Accused-appellant ROGELIO, 19 years old and a resident of Laperal 
Compound, Guadalupe Viejo, Makati City, put up the defense of alibi.&nbsp; He
 testified that on or about 12:45 A.M. of 8 January 1999, he was 
sleeping in a folding bed located outside the house owned by his uncle, 
with whom he had been living.&nbsp; ROGELIO was roused from sleep by the 
police. MARITES approached him, took off his hat and was hysterical when
 she pointed to him saying, “<i>Iyan nga po iyon, iyan nga po iyon.” “Ikaw ang nangholdap sa akin at nang rape.”</i>&nbsp; Then the policemen tied his hands and brought him to the <i>Ospital ng Makati</i>, together with MARITES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br>
  <br>
  ROGELIO did not deny the fact that he was wearing a T-shirt with 
Burger Machine prints at the time of his arrest.&nbsp; According to him it 
had been with him for almost a year prior to the incident.&nbsp; It was given
 to him as a souvenir by a friend who worked at the Burger Machine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br>
  <br>
  Zaldy Carino, a 17-year-old neighbor and friend of ROGELIO for three 
years prior to the incident, testified that between 5:00 and 8:00 P.M. 
of 7 January 1999 he was playing basketball with ROGELIO and the 
latter’s friends.&nbsp; ROGELIO was wearing a Burger Machine T-shirt the 
whole time that they were playing basketball.&nbsp; After winning the game, 
ROGELIO bought some <i>merienda</i> for his playmates, since he was the 
one who placed the bet.&nbsp; They stayed in ROGELIO’s house until about 
10:00 P.M. when ROGELIO told them that he was going to sleep. After 
Zaldy and his friends left, ROGELIO slept in a folding bed located 
outside the house of his uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br>
  <br>
  Between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M. of the following day, Zaldy was awakened 
when he heard noises.&nbsp; He went out of the house and went to the place 
where the noise was coming from.&nbsp; He found out that it came from the 
place where ROGELIO was sleeping, and he saw ROGELIO being beaten up by 
four persons, including a barangay <i>tanod</i>.&nbsp; Zaldy also saw MARITES
 shouting, crying and claiming that the T-shirt worn by ROGELIO was 
hers.&nbsp; ROGELIO and another person by the name of Inteng were taken away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br>
  <br>
  After evaluating the evidence offered by the parties, the trial court 
gave full faith and credit to the version of the prosecution, convicted 
ROGELIO of robbery with rape and appreciated against him the aggravating
 circumstance of nocturnity.&nbsp; It disregarded ROGELIO’s defenses of 
denial and alibi in view of his positive identification by MARITES as 
her assailant.&nbsp; Accordingly, in its Decision of 9 August 1999, the trial
 court decreed as follows:<br>
   <br>
   <blockquote>FOR THE REASONS GIVEN, the Court finds accused Rogelio 
Moreno y Reg, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed the 
special complex crime of robbery with rape, defined and penalized under 
Articles 293 and 294 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic 
Act No. 7659. Applying Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, considering
 the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity and absent
 any mitigating circumstance, the Court imposes the penalty of death 
upon said accused.&nbsp; Accused is ordered to pay the complainant 
P200,000.00 as and for moral damages plus P1,000.00 representing the 
value of the personal properties taken but not recovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>
   <br>
   <br>
   In his Appellant’s Brief, ROGELIO claims that the trial court committed the following errors:<br>
   <br>
   <blockquote>
     <blockquote>
       <p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; … IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGE HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br>
           <br>
        </p>
       <p>II.&nbsp; … IN NOT DECLARING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT’S 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WAS VIOLATED WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED AND BROUGHT TO 
THE POLICE STATION FOR CUSTODIAL INVESTIGATION WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF
 AN INDEPENDENT AND COMPETENT COUNSEL OF HIS CHOICE.<br>
          <br>
        </p>
       <p>III.&nbsp; … IN APPRECIATING THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF NOCTURNITY IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME CHARGED.</p>
     </blockquote>
   </blockquote>
   <br>
   <br>
   As to the first assigned error, ROGELIO banks on the alleged absence 
of resistance and struggle by MARITES as evidenced by the absence of 
injuries on her person.&nbsp; He likewise argues that it was improper to 
charge him with robbery with rape, since the taking of the victim’s 
property was a mere afterthought and an independent act from the alleged
 commission of the crime of rape.<br>
   <br>
   Anent the second assigned error, ROGELIO alleges that when he was 
arrested, he was not informed of his right to remain silent, and when he
 was forced by the policemen to undress and admit the crime, he was not 
assisted by an independent and competent counsel.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, on the third assigned error, ROGELIO maintains that the trial
 court erred in appreciating against him the aggravating circumstance of
 nocturnity because the place where the rape took place was not covered 
with darkness, and there is no evidence that nighttime was deliberately 
sought after by him to carry out a criminal intent.<br>
  <br>
  In the Appellee’s Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) 
argues that ROGELIO’s conviction was based on the direct testimony of 
MARITES and not on his alleged admission; in fact, no evidence on his 
alleged admission was presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; The OSG supports 
the trial court in convicting him of robbery with rape, as the law does 
not differentiate whether rape is committed before, during or after the 
robbery, it being enough that rape accompanied robbery.<br>
   <br>
   The OSG also agrees on the existence of the aggravating circumstance 
of nighttime, since ROGELIO waited until 12:45 A.M. of the day in 
question to accomplish his evil design.&nbsp; It further asserts that even if
 the rape and robbery were considered independently, ROGELIO’s sentence 
for the rape would still be death because such crime was committed with 
the use of deadly weapon and attended by nocturnity.&nbsp; Hence, it prays 
that the challenged decision of the trial court be affirmed.&nbsp; It, 
however, recommends that compensatory damages in the amount of P75,000 
be awarded to MARITES and the moral damages be reduced to P50,000.<br>
   <br>
   We are convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that ROGELIO&nbsp; succeeded 
in having carnal knowledge of MARITES with the use of force and 
intimidation.&nbsp; When he first put his arms around her, he had a fan-knife
 in his possession directed towards her neck.&nbsp; As he was on top of her, 
his hand was on her throat and he threatened to stab and kill her should
 she create a noise.&nbsp; Fear of further injury overpowered and stifled her
 attempt to resist the sexual assault. MARITES might have failed to 
resist ROGELIO’s advances, but such failure was a manifestation of 
involuntary submission, not of consent.&nbsp; In any event, force or 
intimidation itself is sufficient justification for a woman’s failure to
 offer resistance.&nbsp; It is well settled that physical resistance need not
 be established in rape when intimidation is exercised upon the victim 
and the latter submits herself against her will to the rapist’s advances
 because of fear for her life and personal safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 Thus, the law does not impose a burden on the rape victim to prove 
resistance. What needs only to be proved by the prosecution is the use 
of force or intimidation by the accused in having sexual intercourse 
with the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br>
  <br>
  This court has frequently held that in rape cases, the conduct of a 
woman immediately following the alleged assault is of utmost importance.
 In this case, MARITES immediately reported the incident to the police, 
accompanied them in looking for her assailant, and upon seeing him she 
immediately identified him as her rapist.&nbsp; Thereafter, she underwent 
police investigation and submitted to a physical examination of her 
private parts by a medico-legal officer.&nbsp; Her conduct negated 
fabrication or prevarication on her part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br>
  <br>
  We cannot, however, sustain ROGELIO’s conviction of robbery with rape.<br>
  <br>
  The special complex crime of robbery with rape defined in Article 293 
in relation to paragraph 2 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as 
amended, employs the clause “when the robbery shall have been 
accompanied with rape.”&nbsp; In other words, to be liable for such crime, 
the offender must have the intent to take the personal property of 
another under circumstances that makes the taking one of robbery, and 
such intent must precede the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 If the original plan was to commit rape, but the accused after 
committing the rape also committed robbery when the opportunity 
presented itself, the robbery should be viewed as a separate and 
distinct crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br>
  <br>
  A painstaking assessment of the evidence in this case convinces us 
that ROGELIO committed two separate offenses of rape and theft, and not 
the special complex crime of robbery with rape.&nbsp; Immediately after 
ROGELIO put his arms around MARITES and directed the knife at her neck, 
he dragged MARITES to the vacant space in ABC Commercial Complex and 
removed her clothes.&nbsp; These acts clearly showed that ROGELIO had in mind
 sexual gratification.&nbsp; This intent was further established by the fact 
that when MARITES offered to give her ring to ROGELIO, the latter did 
not take it and instead replied, “<i>Mamaya na iyan</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>; “That will come later on because I will give it back to you but you have to follow me first.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 Again, when ROGELIO removed his pants, MARITES told him to get her bag 
if he needed money; but ROGELIO replied “I do not need money.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 After giving vent to his lustful desire, he snatched the victim’s 
shoulder bag, which was then on her right foot, and then he ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 Clearly then, the taking of personal property was not the original evil
 plan of ROGELIO.&nbsp; It was an afterthought following the rape.<br>
   <br>
   Significantly, the constitutive element of violence or intimidation 
against persons in robbery was not present at the time of the snatching 
of the shoulder bag of MARITES.&nbsp; The force or intimidation exerted by 
ROGELIO against the victim was for a reason foreign to the fact of the 
taking of the bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It was 
for the purpose of accomplishing his lustful desire.&nbsp; Hence, it cannot 
be considered for the purpose of classifying the crime as robbery.&nbsp; 
Accused-appellant may thus be held liable for simple theft only, in 
addition to the crime of rape.<br>
  <br>
  The alibi and denial of ROGELIO cannot prevail over the testimony of 
MARITES positively identifying him.&nbsp; MARITES had an adequate look at 
ROGELIO’s features during the assault.&nbsp; She deliberately looked at 
ROGELIO’s face while he was pumping on top of her.&nbsp; She was determined 
to never forget his face and to make him pay for the crime he has done.&nbsp;
 MARITES even emphasized in her testimony that she had the occasion to 
see the tattoos in ROGELIO’s arms, his pimpled face and the triple V 
prints on his shirt, which was later found in ROGELIO’s knapsack.&nbsp; She 
recognized him as one who would pass by the Burger Machine outlet in 
Guadalupe twice a week.&nbsp; Indeed, it is the most natural reaction for 
victims of criminal violence to strive to see the looks and faces of 
their assailants and observe the manner in which the crime was 
committed.&nbsp; Most often the face and body movements of the assailant 
create lasting impressions which cannot be easily erased from the 
victim’s memory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br>
  <br>
  It is doctrinally settled that alibi and denial are worthless and 
cannot prevail over positive identification that is categorical, 
consistent and without any showing of ill-motive on the part of the 
witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Accused’s bare denial amounted to nothing more than negative and self-serving evidence unworthy of weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
 His defense of alibi will not prosper either for his failure to prove 
that he was at some other place at the time the crime was committed and 
that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis </i>at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> He claimed he was sleeping in Laperal Compound which is just a 5-minute walk from the <i>locus criminis</i>.&nbsp; It was not therefore impossible for him to be at the crime scene at the time the crime was committed.<br>
  <br>
  However, the trial court erred in appreciating the aggravating 
circumstance of nocturnity or nighttime.&nbsp; For nocturnity to be properly 
appreciated, it must be shown that it facilitated the commission of the 
crime and that it was purposely sought for by the offender.&nbsp; By and of 
itself, nighttime is not an aggravating circumstance. In the instant 
case, no sufficient evidence was offered to prove that ROGELIO 
deliberately sought the cover of darkness to accomplish his criminal 
design.&nbsp; In fact, the victim testified that there were streetlights and 
lights from the ABC Commercial Complex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
 That the crime scene was dark is negated by the victim’s testimony that
 he was able to see the face of the accused and even the “marking NFC 
and the nos. 555” in his dark shirt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Moreover, the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity was not alleged in the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
 Section 8 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which
 took effect on 1 December 2000, requires that the complaint or 
information must specify the qualifying and aggravating circumstances 
attending the commission of the crime charged.&nbsp; This provision being 
favorable to the accused may be given retroactive effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br>
  <br>
  We do not subscribe to the assertion of the OSG that should rape be 
considered as a separate offense, it would be qualified by the 
circumstance of “use of a deadly weapon” in the commission thereof.&nbsp; A 
reading of the information discloses no allegation that the rape was 
committed with the use of a deadly weapon.&nbsp; The circumstance “armed with
 a bladed weapon” alleged in the information refers to the robbery.&nbsp; 
Hence, it cannot serve to qualify the crime of rape.<br>
   <br>
   The issue of failure by the arresting officers to inform ROGELIO of 
his constitutional rights and to afford him the benefit of counsel 
during the custodial investigation requires strong and convincing 
evidence because of the presumption that the law enforcers acted in the 
regular performance of their official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Besides, even granting <i>arguendo</i>
 that the constitutional requirements were not observed, the same is of 
no significance because it does not appear that ROGELIO executed a 
statement or confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> 
Then, too, as correctly pointed out by the OSG, the conviction of 
ROGELIO was not on the basis of any extrajudicial confession but on the 
testimony of MARITES and other evidence.<br>
  <br>
  Now, on the penalty.<br>
  <br>
  For the crime of rape, now punished under Article 266-A of the Revised
 Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 8353 otherwise known as the 
Anti-Rape Law, which is the governing law in this case, the penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp;
 As to the civil aspect of the case, the trial court’s award of P200,000
 as moral damages should be reduced to P50,000 conformably with the 
current jurisprudence.&nbsp; In rape cases, moral damages are awarded without
 need of proof of the victim’s mental, physical, and psychological 
sufferings, for these are too obvious to still require their recital at 
the trial by the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> MARITES is also entitled to an award of P50,000 as indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>.<br>
  <br>
  For the crime of theft, the penalty shall be based on the value of the
 thing stolen.&nbsp; Except for the money in the amount of P200, no evidence 
was presented by the prosecution as regards the value of the other 
stolen personal properties.&nbsp; Hence, the basis of the penalty is P200.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Under Article 309(4) of the Revised Penal Code, any person guilty of theft shall be punished by <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium period to <i>prision correccional</i>
 in its minimum period if the value of the property stolen is over P50 
but does not exceed P200.&nbsp; Since there are neither mitigating nor 
aggravating circumstance, we shall impose the penalty in its medium 
period,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which is <i>arresto mayor</i>
 in its maximum period whose duration is four (4) months and one (1) day
 to six (6) months.&nbsp; As to the award of P1,000 representing the value of
 the personal properties taken from MARITES, the same should&nbsp; be reduced
 to P200 representing the actual cash contained in the stolen bag 
MARITES, there being no sufficient proof as regards the actual value of
