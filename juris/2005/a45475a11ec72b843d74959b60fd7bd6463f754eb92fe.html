The case was docketed as SEC Case No. 4246.<br><br>In the petition before the SEC, petitioners alleged, inter alia, that respondents-minority stockholders committed acts of mismanagement, fraud and conflict of interest as directors and officers of the bank.<br><br>On account of the following specific allegations of petitioners in their petition before the SEC, to wit:<br><blockquote>5.0 Since respondents, particularly respondent Mercedes Coloma (who was manager of the bank for 18 years) assumed their position, there has been no declaration of cash dividend to the stockholders despite the big income of the bank as shown in its latest financial statement hereto attached as Annex “X”.

Santos in the amount of P20 million.<br><br>Attached to the complaint for perjury were Minutes of Board Meetings and Stockholders’ Meetings approving declaration of dividends and proof of payment through Schedules of Dividends, cashier’s checks, and Planters Development Bank checks issued to stockholders covering the period from May 3, 1981 to March 6, 1990,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which documents, private respondents averred, indicated that from March 3, 1981 to July 27, 1990, a total of P1,960,564.00 in stock and cash dividends was declared and consequently received by all bank stockholders including petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In their Counter-Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> petitioners stated that the questioned allegations in their SEC petition, prepared by their counsel and couched in legal language, hence, not their choice, were made in good faith in the course of an intracorporate controversy.<br><br>As adverted to above, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for perjury was filed against petitioners before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Mandaluyong City, docketed as Criminal Case No. 57794.

Cuevas, by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of January 20, 1999, reversed the February 18, 1998 Resolution of then Secretary Bello and directed the refiling of the Information for perjury against the petitioners upon the following ratiocination:<br><blockquote>The sweeping allegation of respondents that there were no dividends distributed since Coloma took over the management of the bank cannot be explained by their allegation in their counter-affidavit where they claim that the previous statement is merely on account of what they can recall. This is not the way that they worded their fifth cause of action.<br><br>We agree with the motion that the statement alleging no dividends w[ere] distributed was to make sure that the respondent’s petition with the SEC will be acted on favorably. With the knowledge that this fact could be properly verified with the records at their disposal as majority stockholders, the intent to assert a falsehood becomes apparent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners moved for a reconsideration of then Secretary Cuevas’ resolution which was, by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of January 26, 2000, denied. A copy of said Resolution was received by petitioners on February 1, 2000.<br><br>On March 27, 2000, petitioners filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA. The verification and certification against non-forum shopping appended to the petition was signed only by petitioner Leonardo Andres.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioners subsequently filed, however, an Amended Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on March 31, 2000 to which was appended a verification and certification against non-forum shopping signed by all of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of April 7, 2000, the CA dismissed the original petition, ratiocinating that the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached thereto was signed by petitioner Leonardo Andres only and that there was no showing that he was duly authorized by the other petitioners to execute the same in accordance with Section 1 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated April 17, 2000 which was denied for lack of merit by the CA by Resolution of November 14, 2001.<br><blockquote>Petitioners <span style="font-weight: bold;">move to reconsider by submitting an amended petition embodying a new certification against forum-shopping signed by all of them.</span><br><br>We have time and again ruled that <span style="font-weight: bold;">subsequent compliance does not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ipso facto</span> warrant a reconsideration.</span> This is especially true now in view of hundred (sic), nay, thousands of petitions filed with this Court, making it imperative for Us to enforce the Rules. While it is true that litigation is not a game of technicalities, it is equally true that every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure to insure an orderly and speedy administration of justice.<br><br>Moreover, We have earnestly <span style="font-weight: bold;">looked into the substance of the petition by going over the assailed Resolution </span>of public respondent dated January 26, 2000, affirming the earlier Resolution dated January 20, 1999 and ordering the refiling of the information for perjury against petitioners. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We find no grave abuse of discretion in both Resolutions.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Underscoring in the original; emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners thus come before this Court via petition for review on certiorari assigning to the CA the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DEPARTED FROM THE ACCEPTED AND USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN ISSUING THE RESOLUTIONS DATED APRIL 7, 2000 AND NOVEMBER 14, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners argue that they filed,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> as a matter of right</span> pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 10 in relation to Section 2 of Rule 1 of the Rules of Court, their Amended Petition containing a new verification and certification of non-forum shopping signed by all of them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the reglementary period</span> under Section 4 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioners’ argument is well-taken.<br><br>Section 2 of Rule 10 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Amendments as a matter of right.</span> – A party may amend his pleading once as a matter of right at any time<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> before a responsive pleading is served or, in the case of a reply, at any time within ten (10) days after it is served.</span> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Under this provision, a party is given the right to file an amended pleading within the time and upon the conditions specified and without the necessity of obtaining leave of court since a party may amend his pleading once, whether a new cause of action or change in theory is introduced, as a matter of right at any time before a responsive pleading is served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Moreover, amendment of pleadings is favored and should be liberally allowed in the furtherance of justice in order to determine every case as far as possible on its merits without regard to technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This principle is generally recognized in order that the real controversies between the parties are presented, their rights determined and the case decided on the merits without unnecessary delay to prevent circuity of action and needless expense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>No doubt this Court has held that the certificate of non-forum shopping should be signed by all the petitioners or plaintiffs in a case, and that the signing by only one of them is insufficient and constitutes a defect in the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> For the attestation requires personal knowledge by the party executing the same, and the lone signing petitioner cannot be presumed to have personal knowledge of the filing or non-filing by his co-petitioners of any action or claim the same as or similar to the current petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, however, petitioners filed an Amended Petition filed within the 60-day reglementary period for the filing of a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. As amended, the petition had complied with Sec. 1 of Rule 65. The CA maintained its dismissal of the petition, however, when it denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>In holding that petitioners merely substantially complied with the requirements for the verification and certification of non-forum shopping, the CA indeed erred. As petitioners contend,<br><blockquote>x x x the appellate court inaccurately ruled in its Resolution dated November 14, 2001 that “petitioners move(d) to reconsider [the April 7, 2000 Resolution] <span style="font-style: italic;">by embodying a new certification</span> against forum-shopping signed by all of them.” On the strength of such wrong premise, the Court of Appeals then dismissed the petition on the ground that “subsequent compliance does not ipso facto warrant a reconsideration.” The error of the Court of Appeals at once becomes apparent in that: (i) the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioners did not file a motion for reconsideration of the April 7, 2000 by embodying a new certification. The record clearly shows that the new certification had long been filed with and submitted to the Court of Appeals,</span> as in fact, the same had been filed with the said Court even before the issuance of the April 7, 2000 Resolution; and hence, (ii)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> there was no “subsequent compliance” to speak of because the petitioners filed the Amended Petition as a matter of right</span>, the same having been filed well within the 60-day period provided by the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The appellate court’s procedural <span style="font-style: italic;">faux </span>pas notwithstanding, on the merits, the petition fails.<br><br>In support of their prayer for injunctive relief, petitioners argue that the CA erred in affirming the January 20, 1999 and January 26, 2000 Resolutions of then Secretary Cuevas ordering the refiling of the information for perjury against them.<br><br>As a general rule, the Court will not issue writs of prohibition or injunction, preliminary or final, to enjoin or restrain criminal prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In extreme cases though, the following exceptions to the rule have been recognized:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; when the injunction is necessary to afford adequate protection to the constitutional rights of the accused;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; when it is necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions;<br>(3)&nbsp; when there is a prejudicial question which is subjudice;<br>(4)&nbsp; when the acts of the officer are without or in excess of authority;<br>(5)&nbsp; where the prosecution is under an invalid law; ordinance or regulation;<br>(6)&nbsp; when double jeopardy is clearly apparent;<br>(7)&nbsp; where the Court has no jurisdiction over the offense;<br>(8)&nbsp; where it is a case of persecution rather than prosecution;<br>(9)&nbsp; where the charges are manifestly false and motivated by the lust for vengeance; and<br>(10) when there is clearly no prima facie case against the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has been denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners have not shown, however, that the case at bar falls within any of the recognized exceptions above set forth.<br><br>Consistent with its policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, and to leave to the investigating prosecutor sufficient latitude of discretion in the exercise of determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence as will establish probable cause for filing of an information against a supposed offender,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court finds no reason to disturb the finding of the appellate court that no grave abuse of discretion attended then Justice Cuevas’ resolution finding probable cause for perjury against petitioners to hale them into court.<br><br><i>Notatu dignum</i> is petitioners’ ventilating before this Court the merits of their defenses. The issue of whether they acted in good faith is best determined, however, during the trial proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of their evidence. The presence or absence of the elements of the crime is evidentiary in nature and is a matter of defense that may be passed upon after a full-blown trial on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In fine, the validity and merits of a party’s defense or accusation, as well as admissibility of testimonies and evidence, are better ventilated during trial proper than at the preliminary investigation level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As for petitioners’ suggestion that the DOJ should have deferred to the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC as what was involved was a dispute among stockholders of the bank, a corporation duly registered with the SEC, and the allegedly perjurious statements were made by them in connection with that case, the same is unavailing. Suffice it to state that the fact that the parties involved in the controversy are all stockholders or that the parties involved are the stockholders and the corporation does not necessarily place the dispute within the loop of jurisdiction of the SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Apart from the fact that perjury and intracorporate disputes are two entirely different matters with entirely different elements, the SEC has no jurisdiction over criminal cases like perjury.<br><br>At all events, under Section 5.2 of Republic Act No. 8799, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> otherwise known as the Securities Regulation Code, which amended Section 5 of Presidential Decree 902-A,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> whether the issue is intracorporate or not is no longer material, the SEC having been divested of its jurisdiction thereover.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>Costs against petitioners.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Corona, </i>and <i>Garcia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, J., </i>on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo </span>at 44-45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 2-111.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 46-73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 74-75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 74-78.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 76.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp;  <br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" colspan="2" valign="top">Board/Stockholders Resolution&nbsp; Date Number</td> <td valign="bottom" width="5%">&nbsp;%</td> <td valign="bottom" width="16%"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common Amount&nbsp;</span> </td> <td valign="bottom" width="5%">%</td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="bottom" width="12%">Preferred Amount&nbsp; </td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="bottom" width="15%">Total</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="22%">a.3-07-81</td> <td width="25%">19-1981 stocks </td> <td>100</td> <td>P707,000.00</td> <td>… </td> <td>…</td> <td>P707,000.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>b.5-03-81</td> <td>6-1981 cash</td> <td>14</td> <td>154,980.00</td> <td>2 </td> <td>1,826.00</td> <td>156,806.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>c.1-24-82</td> <td>13-1982 cash</td> <td>14 </td> <td> 154,980.00</td> <td>2</td> <td>1,826.00</td> <td>156,806.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>d.2-28-82</td> <td>26-1982 stock</td> <td>40</td> <td>442,600.00</td> <td>…</td> <td>…</td> <td>442,800.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>e.1-02-83</td> <td>4-1983 cash </td> <td>14</td> <td>154,980.00</td> <td>2</td> <td>1,826.00</td> <td>156,806.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f. 7-27-90</td> <td>4-1990</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>6-1990 cash</td> <td>15</td> <td>338,520.00</td> <td>2</td> <td>1,826.00&nbsp;</td> <td>340,346.00</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 79-83.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 84-87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 84-87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 88-92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 93-106.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 123-129.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 107-109.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 110-114.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 112-113.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 115.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 118-141.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 138.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 41-42.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 143-148.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 44-45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> SEC. 4. <i>When and where petition filed.</i> – The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution.
