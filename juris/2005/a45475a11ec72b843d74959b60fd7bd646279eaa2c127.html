				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Alabang Country Club Inc. (ACCI), a stock, non-profit corporation that operates and maintains a country club and various sports and recreational facilities for the exclusive use of its members, seeks to set aside the appellate court's Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of August 14, 2002 as well as its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of March 6, 2003 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.  The appellate court reversed and set aside the National Labor Relation Commission's (NLRC) Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of March 15, 2002, and ordered the reinstatement of herein  sixty-three (63) respondents-members of a duly registered labor organization - Alabang Country Club Independent Employees Union (the Union), without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and the payment of their full backwages including attorney's fees.<br><br>Sometime in 1993, Francisco Ferrer, then President of ACCI, requested its Internal Auditor, Irene Campos-Ugalde, to conduct a study on the profitability of ACCI's Food and Beverage Department (F &amp; B Department).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Ugalde made use of the audited figures in the financial statements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> prepared by Sycip Gorres Velayo &amp; Co. (SGV&amp;Co.) for the years 1989-1993 in reflecting the total revenue and costs and expenses of the F &amp; B Department.  However, while SGV&amp;Co. deducted the entire "undistributed operating costs and expenses" consisting of "general and maintenance costs" from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">total income of ACCI</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Ugalde allocated a percentage of these expenses and charged the same against the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">total revenue of the F &amp; B Department</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Consequently, her report showed that from1989 to 1993, F &amp; B Department had been incurring substantial losses in the aggregate amount of Eight Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand One Hundred Thirty-Five Pesos (P8,727,135.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Her report further showed that:<br><ol type="1"><li> It was only in 1993 when the losses dropped as compared to the 1992 figures.

(La Tasca), for it to operate the F &amp; B Department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Under the agreement, La Tasca would pay ACCI fifteen (15%) percent of its gross sales net of sales tax plus the expenses for light and water in the amount of five (5%) percent of monthly gross sales net of sales tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Also on December 1, 1994, ACCI sent its F &amp; B Department employees individual letters informing them that their services were being terminated effective January 1, 1995;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and that they would be paid separation pay equivalent to one hundred twenty five (125%) percent of their monthly salary for every year of service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> ACCI also informed them that La Tasca agreed to absorb all affected employees immediately with the status of regular employees without need of undergoing a probationary period, and  that all affected employees would receive the same salary they were receiving from ACCI at the time of their termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On December 11, 1994, the Union, with the authority of individual respondents, filed before the NLRC a complaint for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, regularization and damages with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction against ACCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Union then filed a notice of strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> ACCI, finding that the requirements under the Labor Code had not been complied with, suspended on December 28, 1994 those who participated in the strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The Union averred, however, that no strike was actually held and that it was caught by surprise when, upon reporting for work on December 28, 1994, employees of La Tasca "brought their equipment and took over the posts held by most of [the individual respondents]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As scheduled, ACCI ceased operating its F &amp; B Department by January 1, 1995 as La Tasca began operating its own F &amp; B business at the Alabang Country Club.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, respondent union and individual respondents informed that the F &amp; B Division had been reporting gaining profits as shown by the Statement of Income and Deficit prepared by SGV&amp;Co.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> They thus argued that compliance with the standards for losses in <i>Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to justify their retrenchment were not met by ACCI.<br><br>ACCI averred, however, that it may exercise management prerogatives to adopt a cost-saving and cost-consciousness program to improve efficiency in its operations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> prevent losses, and concentrate on core businesses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and to lay-off workers and contract out their jobs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the complaint for illegal dismissal before the Labor Arbiter, forty-seven (47) of the individual respondents accepted separation benefits from ACCI at 125% of their monthly salary for every year of service, on account of which they executed Waivers and Quitclaims in favor of ACCI:  Marilou Abadiano, Ernesto Banal, Benedicto Catalan, Abner Cavestany, Romulo Dalaygon, Elena dela Cruz, Ernesto Dereza, Gina Dumalaon, Mario Franche, Annalissa Garcia, Rolando Gannaban, Aniceto Glean, Perlita Henares, Jaime Hidalgo, Leodegario Humirang, Elpidio Ibuos, Jr., Roberto Lanon, Arnold Layug, Joel Linaogo, Eduardo Llenas, Joselito Lorino, Ferdinand Mabitasan, George Marasigan, Perla Marges, Cynthis Mathay, Werlito Navarro, Cristina Olegario, Cristina Omayao, Nenen Ortigoza, Eleonor Palima, Maria Pantalita, Eduardo Peralta, Richard Perez, Jovito Pidlaoan, Pacita Pilongo, Benjamin Pintor, Narciso Quizana, Agrifino Reyes, Dennis Reyes, Eduardo Rubina, Aristeo Santos, Roberto Solante, Armando Suarez, Dolores Valiente, Remedios Umali, Ingersol Pomida and Floro Macabit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>By decision of April 30, 1999, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal on the ground that a business entity has the right to reduce its work force if necessitated by compelling economic factors which endanger its existence or stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Labor Arbiter in fact found that the study made by Ugalde which was a more detailed version of the financial statements prepared by SGV&amp;Co. clearly established that the F &amp; B Department was incurring losses, thus justifying ACCI to exercise its inherent prerogative to retrench its workers to prevent further losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the NLRC acknowledged the right of ACCI to regulate, according to its own discretion and judgment, all aspects of employment including the lay-off of workers because of losses in the operation of its business, lack of work and considerable reduction in the volume of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It thus dismissed the appeal.<br><br>Private respondents' motion for reconsideration of the NLRC's dismissal of the appeal was denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of April 28, 2000.<br><br>Private respondents thereupon brought their case, via petition for certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> before the Court of Appeals, alleging that the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion and utter ignorance of the law in completely disregarding the audited financial statements prepared by SGV&amp;Co. showing that ACCI's F &amp; B Department had been consistently earning profits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the petition before the appellate court, fifteen (15) of the individual respondents received their separation package equivalent to 125% of their monthly salary for every year of service, on account of which they executed Waivers and Quitclaims in favor of ACCI:  Ronaldo Ibarra, Ma.

It held that due to ACCI's failure to prove by sufficient and competent evidence that its alleged losses were substantial, continuing and without any immediate prospect of abating them, the bona fide nature of the retrenchment appeared doubtful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Passing on ACCI's financial status, the appellate court, citing <i>Bogo-Medellin Sugarcane Planters Association, Inc. v.

Since La Tasca won in the bidding and pursuant to our agreement with the same, La Tasca shall, effective January 1, 1995, be operating all our Food and Beverage outlets.  As a consequence thereof, please be informed that effective January 1, 1995, your services shall be terminated as effective said date <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACCI shall cease to operate all Food and Beverage outlets</span>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> cited by respondents, this Court held that retrenchment on the ground of serious business losses is allowed subject to the conditions that (1) the losses expected should be substantial and not merely <span style="font-style: italic;">de minimis</span> in extent; (2) the substantial losses apprehended must be reasonably imminent as such imminence can be perceived objectively in good faith by the employer; (3) retrenchment must be reasonably necessary and likely to effectively prevent the expected losses; and (4) the alleged losses, if already realized and the expected imminent losses sought to be forestalled, must be proven by sufficient and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>This Court, however, views the case as one involving <span style="text-decoration: underline;">closure of a business undertaking, not retrenchment</span>.  While retrenchment and closure of a business establishment or undertaking are often used interchangeably and are interrelated, they are actually two separate and independent authorized causes for termination of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Retrenchment</span> is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reduction of personnel</span> for the purpose of cutting down on costs of operations in terms of salaries and wages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> resorted to by an employer because of losses in operation of a business occasioned by lack of work and considerable reduction in the volume of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Closure of a business or undertaking</span> due to business losses is the reversal of fortune of the employer whereby there is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete cessation of business operations</span> to prevent further financial drain upon an employer who cannot pay anymore his employees since business has already stopped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>One of the prerogatives of management is the decision to close the entire establishment or to close or abolish a department or section thereof for economic reasons, such as to minimize expenses and reduce capitalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>While the Labor Code provides for the payment of separation package in case of retrenchment to prevent losses, it does not obligate the employer for the payment thereof if there is closure of business due to serious losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In the present case, when petitioner decided to cease operating its F &amp; B Department and open the same to a concessionaire, it did not reduce the number of personnel assigned thereat. It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">terminated the employment of all personnel assigned at the department.</span><br><br>As in the case of retrenchment, however, for the closure of a business or a department due to serious business losses to be regarded as an authorized cause for terminating employees, it must be proven that the losses incurred are substantial and actual or reasonably imminent; that the same increased through a period of time; and that the condition of the company is not likely to improve in the near future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>As did the appellate court, this Court finds that the study report submitted by the internal auditor of petitioner, the only evidence submitted to prove its alleged losses, is self-serving<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and falls short of the stringent requirement of the law that the employer prove sufficiently and convincingly its allegation of substantial losses.<br><br>In contrast, part of the evidence presented by respondents are audited financial statements prepared by SGV&amp;Co. for 1989 to 1993 which show a positive net income for the F &amp; B Department ranging from P959,533 - P2,911,810 and, except for the year 1992, marked increases in annual net income per year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Moreover, for the year 1994, its last year of operation, the F &amp; B Department posted an annual net income of P1,562,385.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In claiming that the F &amp; B Department had been losing, petitioner's internal auditor deducted from the department's annual income the undistributed operating costs and expenses.  However, the study report failed to provide the necessary details on how the undistributed operating costs and expenses charged to the F &amp; B Department was arrived at, including the basis, for example, of allocating association dues and real estate tax directly to the F &amp; B Department as expenses.<br><br>Petitioner's failure to prove that the closure of its F &amp; B Department was due to substantial losses notwithstanding, this Court finds that individual respondents were dismissed on the ground of <span style="font-weight: bold;">closure or cessation of an undertaking</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not due to serious business losses or financial reverses</span>, which is allowed under Article 283 of the Labor Code:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Art. 283.  Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel.</span> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to</span> the installation of labor-saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the closing or cessation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title</span>, by serving a written notice on the worker and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before its intended date thereof.  In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.  In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in cases of closures or cessation of operations of the establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses</span>, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (½) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.  A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered as one (1) whole year.  (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The closure of operation of an establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses includes both the complete cessation of operations and the cessation of only part of a company's activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>For any bona fide reason, an employer can lawfully close shop anytime.  Just as no law forces anyone to go into business, no law can compel anybody to continue the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It would be stretching the intent and spirit of the law if a court interferes with management's prerogative to close or cease its business operations just because the business is not suffering from any loss or because of the desire to provide the workers continued employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>While petitioner did not sufficiently establish substantial losses to justify closure of its F &amp; B Department on this ground, there is basis for its claim that the continued maintenance of said department had become more expensive through the years.  An evaluation of the financial figures appearing in the audited financial statements prepared by the SGV&amp;Co. shows that ninety one to ninety six (91% - 96%) percent of the actual revenues earned by the F &amp; B Department comprised the costs and expenses in maintaining the department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Petitioner's decision to place its F &amp; B operations under a concessionaire must then be respected, absent a showing of bad faith on its part.<br><br>In fine, management's exercise of its prerogative to close a section, branch, department, plant or shop<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> will be upheld as long as it is done in good faith to advance the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of employees under the law or a valid agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>While the closure of F &amp; B Department is found to be justified, petitioner is, under the above-quoted provision of Art. 283 of the Labor Code, mandated to pay separation pay computed from the time individual respondents commenced their employment until the time the department ceased operations, in an amount equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (½) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.  In petitioner's case, it in fact voluntarily doled out to some of individual respondents separation pay equivalent to one month and a quarter (1¼) for every year of service, a fraction of a year being considered as one year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Respondents not having been illegally dismissed, they are not entitled to backwages.<br><br>By petitioner's information, it had paid, during the pendency of the case, the separation package of sixty-two (62) of the sixty-three (63) individual respondents on account of which they executed Releases, Waivers and Quitclaims in its favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>A waiver or quitclaim is a valid and binding agreement between the parties, provided that it constitutes a credible and reasonable settlement and the one accomplishing it has done so voluntarily and with a full understanding of its import.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> As the waivers and quitclaims executed by individual respondents who had been given their separation pay were duly notarized, the certificate of acknowledgement in each of them serves as <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">evidence</span> of their due execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Not one of individual respondents who executed the waivers or quitclaims has come forward to challenge the reasonableness of the settlement and/or voluntariness of the execution of the documents.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED.</span>  The assailed Decision of August 14, 2002 and the Resolution of March 6, 2003 of the Court of Appeals are hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE.</span><br><br>Petitioner, Alabang Country Club, Inc., is hereby ORDERED to pay the remaining individual respondent, Filipino Dizon, who does not appear to have received separation package equivalent to one month and a quarter (1¼) for every year of service, as agreed upon by petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Garcia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Corona, J.</i>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo</span> at 58-70.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 74-89.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id. </span>at 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 142-155.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid.</span><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Id.</span> at 97.

This is so because some of the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the F &amp; B are not included in the item "Departmental Costs and Expenses: Food and Beverage" but were included in the "Undistributed Operating Costs and Expenses".
