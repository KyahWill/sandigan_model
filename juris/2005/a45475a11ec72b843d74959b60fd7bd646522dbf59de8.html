Aquino set aside the Labor Arbiter’s June 30, 1997 Resolution of dismissal on the ground that jurisdiction over the person of respondent in the consolidated cases was not acquired, hence, the judgment in the said cases with respect to him is null and void, and consequently, the application of the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> – basis of the dismissal of his complaint was inappropriate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On account of the NLRC decision dated May 21, 1998, petitioner-corporation, by March 1, 1999 letter of counsel, directed respondent to go back to work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter eventually dismissed respondent’s complaint, however, for lack of merit, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of July 20, 1999, holding that, inter alia, respondent should have reported back to work and/or inquired into the results of the investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the charges against him;&nbsp; and that the belated filing of respondent’s complaint partakes of a “fishing expedition.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the NLRC, by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of February 29, 2000, affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter, holding that petitioner, in the exercise of its business judgment, was granted leeway insofar as it concerned the movement, transfer or reassignment of its personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondent’s motion for reconsideration of the decision having been denied by the NLRC by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated May 11, 2000, he filed a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> with the appellate court.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of September 30, 2002, the appellate court reversed the NLRC decision, it holding that respondent was denied due process and was dismissed without cause when he was replaced by Rufino Hornilla and instructed to go on leave indefinitely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In reversing the NLRC decision, the appellate court noted that it was on account of respondent’s replacement as Operations Manager and the instruction for him to go on indefinite leave that it took almost a year for him to file the complaint for illegal dismissal.&nbsp; Hence, the appellate court concluded, he should not be faulted for laches.&nbsp; Nor, said the appellate court, could respondent be deemed to have abandoned his work on receipt of petitioner’s counsel’s return to work March 1, 1999 letter because prior thereto he had considered himself illegally terminated as in fact he had filed on January 29, 1997 the complaint for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Hence, the present petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari.</span><br><br>Petitioners insist that respondent was not illegally dismissed, “management [having] merely opted to reorganize,” hence, the award to him of full backwages, reinstatement or separation pay, and attorney’s fees is bereft of factual and legal basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The March 1, 1999 letter of petitioner to respondent, quoted below, to wit:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is to give NOTICE that per records of our client, your employment was <span style="font-weight: bold;">regarded as TERMINATED effective FEBRUARY 21, 1996</span> considering: (1) the filing of our client of the 1996 case entitled “Dynamic Signmaker Outdoor Advertising Services, Inc. vs. Bigkis Manggagawa sa Dynamic Signmaker Outdoor Services, Inc.” docketed as NLRC Case No. RAB-IV-2-7865-96-R, wherein you were named as one of the respondents; and (ii) the filing, also, by our client of the 1996 criminal case against you for “Frustrated Arson”, docketed as Crim. Case No. 96-13151, and pending with the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo City, Branch 73.</span><br><br>FURTHER, this is to give NOTICE for you to REPORT back to your work IMMEDIATELY considering the judgment of the National Labor Relations Commission in RAB-IV-8738-97-RI (CA No. 013754-97), dated May 21, 1998, which rendered as “null and void”, insofar as you are concerned, the decision in the said NLRC Case No. RAB-IV-2-7865-96-R.&nbsp; And should you fail to report, the same shall be regarded to mean that you are no longer interested about your employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>belies petitioners’ claim, however.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Res ipsa loquitor.&nbsp;</span> It confirms that respondent’s employment was terminated as early as February 21, 1996 (when he was instructed to go on indefinite leave and his salary was since then withheld), not for any of the just<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> or authorized<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> causes under the Labor Code, but on account of the filing against him by petitioner corporation of a labor case (NLRC Case No. RAB-IV-2-7865-96-R, one of the two consolidated cases) and a criminal case.<br><br>Petitioners want this Court to believe that when respondent was instructed to go on leave, the leave was never described as without pay, and that petitioner corporation simply needed time to transfer him to a position of equal salary and rank without demotion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Surely, this Court recognizes that management has wide latitude to regulate, according to its own discretion and judgment, all aspects of employment, including the freedom to transfer and reassign employees according to the requirements of its business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The scope and limits of the exercise of management prerogatives, must, however, be balanced against the security of tenure given to labor. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>If exercised in good faith for the purpose of advancing business interests, not of defeating or circumventing the rights of employees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the managerial prerogative to transfer personnel from one area of operation to another is justified.<br><br>This Court finds it difficult, however, to attribute good faith on the part of petitioners.&nbsp; Respondent was instructed to go on indefinite leave.&nbsp; He was asked to return to work only after more than three years from the time he was instructed to go on indefinite leave<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> during which period his salaries were withheld, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only after the NLRC promulgated its decision of May 21, 1998 reversing the labor arbiter’s dismissal of his complaint</span>.<br><br>This Court upholds then the appellate court’s finding that respondent was constructively dismissed:<br><blockquote>There is no doubt, therefore, that the petitioner in this case was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effectively terminated from employment by respondent when he was replaced as Operations Manager and instructed to take a leave indefinitely</span>.&nbsp; Petitioner was neither transferred nor reassigned to another office or position contrary to what public respondent seems to allude.&nbsp; Petitioner was simply replaced and instructed to take a leave indefinitely.&nbsp; “In cases of illegal dismissal, the burden is on the employer to prove that there was a valid ground for dismissal.” Medenilla vs. Philippne Veterans Bank, 328 SCRA 1, 7.&nbsp; We failed to extract from the record any evidence to show that there exists valid and just cause to terminate herein petitioner from employment.&nbsp; In fact during the pendency of the complaint for illegal dismissal by the petitioner against private respondents, the latter in a letter dated March 1, 1999, ordered petitioner to report back to work immediately.&nbsp; This in itself proves that herein private respondents believe that there exists no valid and just grounds (sic) to terminate herein petitioners from his employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It upholds too the award to respondent of attorney’s fees in the amount of P50,000.00, he having been forced to litigate and thereby incur expenses to protect his rights and interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Clutching at straws, petitioners fault the appellate court for failure to recognize the final and executory nature of the June 24, 1996 NLRC Decision rendered in the consolidated cases and for affirming the nullification of said decision, with respect to respondent, which could be attacked only by direct action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioners’ position, the validity of a judgment or order of a court or quasi-judicial tribunal which has become final and executory may be attacked when the records show that it lacked jurisdiction to render the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> For <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a judgment rendered against one in a case where jurisdiction over his person was not acquired is void, and a void judgment maybe assailed or impugned at any time </span>either <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span> or<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">collaterally</span> by means of a petition filed in the same or separate case, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by resisting such judgment in any action or proceeding wherein it is invoked</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;
