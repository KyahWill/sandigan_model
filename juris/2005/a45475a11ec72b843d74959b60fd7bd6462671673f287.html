withholding of payment is sanctioned by Section 8.2 of the NEDA Board Approval Guidelines on the Procurement of Consultancy Services for government projects (Implementing Rules and Regulations) which provides:<br><blockquote>To guarantee the faithful performance of the consultant under Contract, the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> final payment </span>shall be withheld until after a Certificate of Completion indicating satisfactory completion of the Consultancy Services shall have been issued by the concerned government agency.&nbsp;

CANCHELA WERE PREMATURE<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE MONETARY AWARD BY RESPONDENT ARBITRATOR WAS IN ACCORD WITH THE TENOR OF THE AGREEMENT AS THERE WAS NO BASIS AT ALL FOR THE AWARD THEREOF<br></blockquote>Petitioner asserts that the claims of private respondents are premature as they failed to obtain the decision of the Secretary of Health prior to arbitration, a mandatory requirement under Article 12 of the Agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]<br><br></sup>But even granting that the claims were ripe for arbitration, petitioner asserts that the CIAC should have dismissed the petition on the ground that the State is immune from suits, the Agreements, being to promote the health and well-being of the citizens, having been entered into pursuant to the State's sovereign and governmental power.<br><br>With respect to the monetary award, petitioner contends that private respondents are only entitled to the A &amp; E services it rendered in the amount of P2,749,960.40 which is 6% of the total cost of the project, taking into account the deletion of the provision on construction supervision;&nbsp; and no interest on the principal is due as it did not incur any delay and the Agreements contained no express stipulation on interest.<br><br>Private respondents, on the other hand, counter that, as correctly held by the Court of Appeals and the Sole Arbitrator, they did not fail in their duty to go through the mode of settling their claims for payment as stipulated in the Agreements and that the records clearly establish the factual and legal bases for the award in their favor.<br><br>In compliance with the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of this Court requiring the parties to submit their respective memoranda, petitioner filed its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">raising for the very first time</span> the argument that the Agreements are void from the beginning for failure to include therein a certification of availability of funds which is required under existing law.&nbsp; As such, petitioner concludes that the consultancy fees cannot be based on the project fund allocation but on the basis of the reasonable value or on the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">quantum meruit</span>.<br><br>Petitioner thus additionally prays that the Sole Arbitrator's Decision be nullified.<br><br>As reflected above, the failure of the respective chief accountants to issue a certification of availability of funds for respondents' services subject of the Agreements was not raised before the CIAC or the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It is settled that an issue which was neither averred in the complaint nor raised during the trial cannot be raised for the first time on appeal as it would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice and due process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> save on exceptional circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp;

Being government contracts, they are governed and regulated by special laws, failure to comply with which renders them void.<br><br>P.D. 1445 (The Auditing Code of the Philippines) provides that no contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and unless the proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current fiscal year is available for expenditure on account thereof, subject to verification by the auditor concerned.&nbsp;

The issuance of such certification is thus a condition<span style="font-style: italic;"> sine qua non</span> to entering into any contract or incurring any obligation that may be chargeable against the authorized allotment in any department, office or agency.&nbsp;
