				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent Elias O. Lelina, Jr., presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court of Cabarroguis, Quirino, Branch 31, stands administratively charged for gross misconduct in two separate administrative complaints filed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mga Umaasang Mamamayan ng Quirino,</span> docketed as A.M. OCA IPI No. 99-860-RTJ, and Onofre G. Dulay, docketed as A.M. OCA IPI No. 99-588-RTJ. <br><br>An anonymous letter was sent by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mga Umaasang Mamamayan ng Quirino</span> to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on February 25, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> requesting for an investigation on the alleged violation of the Anti-Graft Law and other illegal activities committed by respondent judge in the province of Quirino.&nbsp; On June 1, 1998, through an Indorsement Letter from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), the matter was referred to the NBI for discreet investigation.&nbsp; The NBI submitted its Investigation Report on July 27, 1999 to the OCA for information and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The report stated that respondent judge usually asked for money or parcels of land in exchange for favorable decision.&nbsp; There were incidents when respondent judge would carry his .45 caliber pistol while inside the courtroom, tucked in his waist, for the purpose of intimidating others.&nbsp; According to the NBI, respondent judge was guilty of serious misconduct as a judge and committed the following acts:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Extorting money from a party litigant who has a case before his court;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Using intemperate language unbecoming of a judge;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Failure to pay debt;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">4)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Oppression or unwarranted display of authority;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">5)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Acting as counsel for all the parties with opposing interest on a parcel of land in pursuance of his personal self-interest.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The NBI recommended disbarment and the filing of administrative charges for serious misconduct and inefficiency.<br><br>The second case stems from the letter-complaint filed by Onofre G. Dulay with the OCA dated July 11, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Onofre's charges against respondent judge can be summed up as follows:<blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Respondent judge arbitrarily cited him, his mother Victoria Gacote Dulay, and his aunt, Marita G.

No. RTJ-99-1516 and were referred to then Court of Appeals Associate Justice Romeo Callejo, Sr. for report and recommendation.&nbsp; Investigative proceedings were conducted.&nbsp; However, upon the appointment of Justice Callejo, Sr. to the Supreme Court, the case was re-assigned to Court of Appeals Justice Conrado M. Vasquez, Jr. per resolution of this Court dated November 13, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On the complaint filed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Mga Umaasang Mamamayan ng Quirino,</span> Justice Vasquez reported that the alleged complainants never came forward nor did they execute any affidavit or sworn statement to substantiate their claims.&nbsp; The only evidence submitted to support the complaint was the uncorroborated sworn statement of Editha Dumlao, who was not presented as a witness during the investigation, and the report of the NBI, which was based on second-hand information.&nbsp; Thus, he recommended the dismissal of the complaint.<br><br>Anent the complaint filed by Onofre Dulay, Justice Vasquez reported that Onofre's statement of facts were not accurate; that Onofre failed to prove that he was ordered to give 160 square meters of home lot to respondent judge.&nbsp; On the contrary, evidence shows that Agnes Mariano is the registered owner of the lot after Onofre gave her the property as payment for his debts.&nbsp; Neither was Onofre able to prove that respondent judge prepared the pleadings filed by his opponents. <br><br>However, the investigating justice found adequate evidence showing that respondent judge committed improprieties in dealing with Onofre which warrants disciplinary sanctions.<br><br>Based on his findings, the investigating justice recommended:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, it is respectfully recommended that the complaint of the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Mga Umaasang Mamamayan ng Quirino</span> be <span style="font-weight: bold;">dismissed</span> for lack of merit.&nbsp; As for the complaint of Onofre G. Dulay, it is further recommended that, for violation of the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Code of Judicial Conduct</span>, Judge Elias O. Lelina, Jr. be <span style="font-weight: bold;">dismissed from service with forfeiture of all of the benefits</span> as the High Court may determine, and be <span style="font-weight: bold;">disqualified from reinstatement or appointment</span> to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>We sustain the findings of the investigating justice.<br><br>In administrative proceedings, the complainant has the burden of proving the allegations in the complaint with substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> It must be remembered that while this Court has the duty to ensure that judges and other court personnel perform their duties with utmost efficiency, propriety and fidelity, it is also our obligation to see to it that they are protected from unfounded suits that serve to disrupt rather than promote the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thus, administrative complaints that are clearly motivated by intentions other than the advocacy of judicial competence are promptly written off.<br><br>As held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pangan v. Ganay, et al.</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>Furthermore, even in an administrative case, the Rules of Court require that if the respondent Judge should be disciplined for grave misconduct or any graver offense, the evidence against him should be competent and should be derived from direct knowledge. The judiciary to which the respondent belongs demands no less. Before any of its members could be faulted, competent evidence should be presented, especially since the charge is penal in character.<br><br>Indeed, while it is our duty to investigate and determine the truth behind every matter in complaints against Judges and other court personnel, it is also our duty to see to it that they are protected and exonerated from baseless administrative charges. The Court will not shirk from its responsibility of imposing discipline upon its magistrates, but neither will it hesitate to shield them from unfounded suits that only serve to disrupt rather than promote the orderly administration of justice.<br></blockquote>However, as to the complaint filed by Onofre Dulay against respondent judge, although the investigation revealed that most of the allegations were based on misrepresentation of facts by Onofre, sufficient evidence however exists which shows that respondent judge was guilty of gross misconduct.<br><br>Although every office in the government is a public trust, no position exacts greater demand on moral righteousness and uprightness of an individual than a seat in the judiciary.&nbsp; A magistrate of law must comport himself at all times in such manner that his conduct, official or otherwise, can bear the most searching scrutiny of the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> prescribes that judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, <span style="font-style: italic;">but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Thus, judges are to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all their activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Likewise, they are mandated not to allow family, social or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment, <span style="font-style: italic;">nor convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Code clearly prohibits judges or members of their families from asking for <span style="font-style: italic;">or accepting</span>, any gift, bequest, loan or favor in relation to anything done or to be done or omitted to be done by him or her in connection with the performance of judicial duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Respondent judge failed to live up to these standards.&nbsp; Despite knowledge of Onofre and Mariano's intentions in offering the business to his daughters, respondent judge allowed his daughters to accept the offer of business partnership with persons who have pending cases in his court.<br><br>Respondent judge is guilty of gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct for which he is administratively liable.&nbsp; Under Section 11, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, gross misconduct is a serious charge punishable by: 1) dismissal from service; 2) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or 3) a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.&nbsp; We find that suspension from office for six (6) months without salary and other benefits is commensurate penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>respondent Judge Elias O.
