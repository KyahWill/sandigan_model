				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A judgment of acquittal made by a competent court on a valid information after the accused has entered a plea bars an appeal by the prosecution. Only a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion or denial of due process to the State can justify a review (through a petition for certiorari) of such decision by this Court. In acquitting private respondent in the present case, the Sandiganbayan has not been shown to have acted arbitrarily or whimsically. Equally important, the herein accused, Commissioner Bienvenido A. Tan Jr., has not been proven to have exceeded his discretion in the exercise of his functions. Taking into account the relevant facts and applicable laws in this very perplexing subject of taxation, this Court cannot fault him for abating an excessive and erroneous tax assessment. Quite the contrary, he has acted fairly and sensibly under the circumstances.<br><center><br><b><u><u>The Case</u></u></b><br></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking to nullify and set aside the January 23, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Sandiganbayan (SB) in Criminal Case No. 20685. The dispositive part of the Resolution reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated 02 March 2001 is hereby RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE, and the accused is hereby ACQUITTED of the charge in the instant case.<br><br>"The bailbond of the accused is hereby cancelled and the Hold Departure order previously issued by the court is hereby lifted and set aside."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]<br></sup><br></blockquote><u><b><center><u>The Facts</u><br><br></center></b></u>The facts are narrated by the SB in its original Decision dated March 2, 2001, as follows:<br><blockquote>"Pursuant to Letter of Authority No. ATD-035-STO dated January 2, 1986 and Memorandum of Authority dated March 3, 1986, an investigation was conducted by [Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)] examiners on the ad valorem and specific tax liabilities of [San Miguel Corp. (SMC)] covering the period from January 1, 1985 to March 31, 1986. The result of the investigation showed that [SMC] has a deficiency on specific and ad valorem taxes totaling P342,616,217.88 broken down as follows:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td width="50%">'Specific Tax</td><td style="text-align: left;" width="50%">P  33,817,613.21</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>Ad Valorem Tax</td><td style="text-align: left;">P308,798,604.67'</td></tr></tbody></table><br>"On the basis of these findings, the BIR sent a letter dated July 13, 1987 to SMC demanding the payment of its deficiency tax in the amount of P342,616,217.88. Apparently, the letter was received by the SMC, as it protested the assessment in its letter dated August 10, 1987 with the information: 1) that the alleged specific tax deficiency was already paid when the BIR approved SMC's request that its excess ad valorem payments be applied to its specific tax balance; 2) that the computation of the ad valorem tax deficiency was erroneous since the BIR examiners disallowed the deduction of the price differential (cost of freight from brewery to warehouse) and ad valorem tax.<br><br>"The protest was denied by the BIR thru a letter dated October <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>, 1987 signed by accused Commissioner Bienvenido Tan, Jr., but the original assessment of P342,616,217.88 was reduced to P302,[0]51,048.93 due to the crediting of the taxpayer's excess ad valorem tax deposit of P21,805,409.10 with a reiteration of the payment of the x x x assessed specific and ad valorem tax as reduced.<br><br>"On October 27, 1987, herein accused referred the matter to Jaime M. Maza, Assistant BIR Commissioner, Legal Service Division and thereafter different BIR officials also reviewed the case of SMC and rendered varying legal opinions on the issue x x x<br><br>"On the part of Alicia P. Clemeno, Chief, Legislative Ruling and Research Division, she recommended the reduction of SMC's tax liability, first to P21,856,985.29, and later to P22,000,000.00. Balbino E. Gatdula, Jr., Assistant Revenue Service Chief, Legal Service, supported the demand for ad valorem tax deficiency from SMC. In a letter dated August 31, 1988, SMC, thru a certain Avendano offered the amount of P10,000,000.00 for the settlement of the assessment. This was concurred in by Juanito Urbi, Chief, Prosecutor Division, BIR in a Memorandum dated December 20, 1988. Jaime Maza, Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service, BIR, also gave his concurrence to the recommendation that the offer of SMC for P10,000,000.00 in compromise settlement be accepted. The recommendation was approved by accused Bienvenido Tan; and accordingly, in a letter dated December 20, 1988, SMC was informed that its offer to compromise was accepted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Subsequently, the SB reversed its original March 2, 2001 Decision with its now assailed January 23, 2002 Resolution. The antecedents leading to the Petition before this Court are narrated by the SB in this manner:<br><blockquote>"In our Decision of March 2, 2001, herein accused Bienvenido A. Tan, former Commissioner of the [BIR], was convicted for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act [(RA)] No. 3019 as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the dispositive portion of which states as follows:<br><blockquote>'WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered convicting the accused for Violation of Section 3(e) of [(RA)] 3019 as amended, and appreciating in his favor the presence of the mitigating circumstance of age, accused being over seventy (70) years old, and in the absence of aggravating circumstances to offset the same, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum to fifteen (15) years as maximum. He is further disqualified perpetually from holding public office.<br><br>'As the Court finds the compromise agreement to have been entered into illegally, the [BIR] is hereby ordered to collect from [SMC] the amount of P292,951,048.93 representing its tax liabilities covering the period from January 1, 1985 to March 31, 1986.<br><br>'SO ORDERED.'<br></blockquote>"In his Motion for Reconsideration filed on March 12, 2001, accused seeks to reconsider aforesaid Decision and posits the following grounds: (1) the Court erred in holding that the assessment contained in the letter of accused dated 08 October 1987 was final and executory; (2) corollarily, the Court erred in holding that the referral of the 08 October 1987 assessment to the Assistant Commissioner for further study was uncalled for, given that there was no request for a reconsideration of the 08 October 1987 assessment; (3) the Court erred in not holding that the specific tax assessment of [P]33,817,613.21 had been paid through the application of SMC's excess ad valorem tax deposits to its unpaid specific tax; (4) the Court erred in not holding that the abatement of SMC's ad valorem tax was proper on the ground that there exists a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of said assessment; [(5)] the Court erred in holding that accused exercise of his authority under Section 204 of the [National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)] to abate the assessment of ad valorem tax was improper; and [(6)] the Court erred in holding that there was a compromise of the SMC tax case which resulted in undue injury to the government.<br><br>"In its Comment, the prosecution asserts that (1) the assessment contained in the letter of SMC dated October 8, 1987 was final and executory; (2) the referral of the 08 October 1987 assessment to the Assistant Commissioner for further study was uncalled for given that there was no request for a reconsideration from SMC; (3) SMC's total tax due and collectible as Specific Tax of [P]33,817,613.21 has not been settled; (4) the Court correctly held that the abatement of SMC's ad valorem taxes is improper; and (5) the Court is correct in ruling that there was a compromise of SMC's tax which resulted in undue injury to the government.<br><br>"Thereafter, the accused and the prosecution made a further exchange of pleadings elaborating on their respective positions on the matter.<br><br>"The Motion is impressed with merit. After a careful and exhaustive review of the pleadings, the records and the evidence, we reconsider our Decision dated March 2, 2001 and hereby acquit the accused of the charge in the instant case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Sandiganbayan</u></b><br></center><br>In acquitting herein private respondent, the SB adduced several reasons.<br><br><i>First</i>, the SB failed to give weight to the October 27, 1987 meeting between Commissioner Tan and SMC's representatives -- a meeting which resulted in the referral of the assessment to Tan's subordinates for further review and study. The referral showed that the disputed assessment had not yet become final and executory.<br><br><i>Second</i>, notwithstanding the prosecution's observation that the BIR rejected SMC's protest against the inclusion of the water component of beer, private respondent unequivocally approved SMC's application of its excess ad valorem deposit to complete the payment of its specific tax deficiency.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the abatement of SMC's ad valorem taxes is proper. The tax base for computing them should not include the ad valorem tax itself and the price differential. Reliance upon Executive Order (EO) No. 273 is not misplaced, because that law simply affirms general principles of taxation as well as BIR's long-standing practice and policy not to impose a tax on a tax. Moreover, nothing precludes private respondent from applying EO 273 on an assessment made prior to its effectivity, because that law was merely intended to formalize such long-standing practice and policy.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, after inquiring into the discretionary prerogative of private respondent to compromise, the SB found no reason to conclude that he had acted contrary to law or been impelled by any motive other than honest good faith. The compromise he had entered into regarding SMC's tax did not result in any injury to the government. No genuine compromise is impeccable, since the parties to it must perforce give up something in exchange for something else. No basis existed to hold him liable for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]<br><br></sup><b><u><center><u>The Issues</u><br></center><br></u></b>Petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><center>"A.<br></center><br>"The respondent court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when, in upholding private respondent's act in ruling upon SMC's Motion for Reconsideration, it disregarded Section 228 (previously Section 246) of the NIRC.<br><center><br>"B.<br></center><br>"The respondent court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when, in upholding private respondent's act in accepting SMC's offer of compromise of P10,000,000.00 for its tax liability of P302,051,048.93, it disregarded Sections 124 and 228 of the NIRC.<br><center><br>"C.<br></center><br>"The respondent court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it declared the validity of private respondent's act of approving SMC's application of the excess ad valorem to its specific tax deficiency despite its being contrary to law.<br><center><br>"D.<br></center><br>"The respondent court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it acquitted private respondent for violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019 despite the overwhelming evidence proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>We shall tackle the foregoing issues <i>seriatim</i>, with the exception of the third issue that will be discussed ahead of the second.<br><b><u><center><br><u>The Court's Ruling</u><br></center><br></u></b>The Petition has no merit.<br><center><br><b><u>First Issue:<br><i>Viability of SMC's Motion for Reconsideration</i></u></b><br></center><br>Section 229 of the NIRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> provides thus:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 229. Protesting of assessment. -- When the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative finds that proper taxes should be assessed, he shall first notify the taxpayer of his findings.  Within a period to be prescribed by implementing regulations, the taxpayer shall be required to respond to said notice. If the taxpayer fails to respond, the Commissioner shall issue an assessment based on his findings.<br><br>"Such assessment may be protested administratively by filing a request for reconsideration or reinvestigation in such form and manner as may be prescribed by implementing regulation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the assessment; otherwise, the assessment shall become final and unappealable.<br><br>"If the protest is denied in whole or in part, the individual, association or corporation adversely affected by the decision on the protest may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty (30) days from receipt of the said decision; otherwise, the decision shall become final, executory and demandable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner argues that "on October 8, 1987, a final decision was rendered by private respondent as to SMC's tax liability totaling P302,051,048.93 x x x." Since SMC did not appeal to the CTA, this decision became final and could no longer be compromised by private respondent. We disagree.<br><br>A careful reading of the quoted tax provision readily shows that the "Motion for Reconsideration" filed by SMC was aptly ruled upon by private respondent. Despite the use of the phrase "finally decided," his October 8, 1987 letter to SMC did not constitute a final assessment.<br><br><i>First</i>, the phrase "finally decided" referred not to the total amount of deficiency <u>specific</u> and <u>ad valorem taxes</u>, but to the reduction of such assessment. The reduction was the result of SMC's protest, by way of two requests for reconsideration dated June 9, 1987 and August 10, 1987. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, the rules on statutory construction did not apply; the October 8, 1987 letter was not even a law. <i>Grantia argumenti</i> that the letter partook of the nature of a final assessment, its finality was suspended by private respondent's handwritten note on the bottom left of the second page, extending the tender of payment for another 15 days from October 27, 1987, because of a referral of the assessment to the BIR's Legal Service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, SMC filed on November 2, 1987 a <i>timely</i> request for reinvestigation -- technically not a motion for reconsideration. Under Section 229 of the NIRC, this request was a proper administrative protest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> done within 30 days from receipt of the assessment and substantiated by facts and law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The assessment was received by SMC only on October 26, 1987. Its request for reinvestigation was in turn received by the BIR on November 10, 1987, well within the 30-day period allowed by Section 229; thus, the assessment had not yet become final.<br><br>Moreover, a day after SMC's receipt of the assessment, the SB found that a meeting had indeed been held between private respondent and the representatives of SMC, resulting in the suspension of the alleged finality of the assessment. The meeting partook of the nature of an oral, in advance of the written, request for reinvestigation. In both instances, the taxpayer's request was not merely <i>pro forma</i>; it had the effect of suspending -- not interrupting -- the 30-day period for appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>We do not agree with petitioner's contention that, contrary to the finding of the SB in its March 2, 2001 Decision, no conference had been held on that date. A careful perusal of the Decision would, however, reveal that the date of the supposed conference was not indicated with certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> And even if it were, the conference was supposed to have been held between SMC's representatives and BIR officials, other than private respondent, on the computation (not the assessment) that was followed by SMC and that bore the alleged approval by the BIR.<br><br><i>Third</i>, after SMC's request for reinvestigation, no other issuance emanated from the BIR that could be considered a decision. Therefore, no appeal to the Tax Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> could have been made under Section 229 of the NIRC, since the protest filed with the BIR had not been acted upon. Appealable to the Tax Court is a decision that refers not to the <i>assessment</i> itself, but to one made on the <i>protest against such assessment.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The commissioner of internal revenue's action in response to a taxpayer's request for reconsideration or reinvestigation of the assessment constitutes the decision, the receipt of which will start the 30-day period for appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Section 229 does not prevent a taxpayer from exhausting administrative remedies by filing a request for reconsideration, then a request for reinvestigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Furthermore, under Section 7(1) of RA 1125<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Tax Court exercised exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review not the <i>assessments</i> themselves, but the <i>decisions involving disputed ones</i> arising under the NIRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><i>Fourth</i>, quite obviously, no decision could as yet be made by the BIR, because the protest filed by SMC had been referred by private respondent to several top BIR officials for further review. In fact, various intra-office Memoranda were issued in 1988 involving the chiefs of the (1) Legislative Ruling and Research and (2) Prosecution Divisions of the BIR, as well as its assistant commissioners for legal service and excise tax. Had the assessment already become final in 1987, there would then be no more reason to reinvestigate and study the merits of SMC's protest in 1988.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>, totally misplaced is petitioner's reference to the 180-day period from the submission of documents, within which time the BIR should act upon the protest, followed by a 30-day period of appeal to the Tax Court. This provision did not exist in either 1987 or 1988. It appeared only in a much later law, RA 8424, as Section 228 -- again erroneously referred to by petitioner as the basis for the present controversy.<br><br>Consequently, there was no legal impediment either to the referral of the protest by private respondent to his subordinates or to the action taken by them -- a process that lasted for more than 180 days. Neither was there a need to make a 30-day appeal to the Tax Court due to the BIR's inaction on the protest within the 180-day period.<br><br>The assessment was clearly not yet final, executory or demandable. While it is pending with the commissioner of internal revenue, it cannot yet serve as the basis of collection by distraint or levy or by judicial action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> No grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the SB for upholding private respondent's act of reinvestigation upon SMC's request.<center><br><u style="font-weight: bold;">Second Issue:<br><i>Application of the Ad Valorem Tax<br>to the Specific Tax Deficiency</i></u><br></center><br>In like manner, no grave abuse of discretion was committed when the SB upheld private respondent's approval of SMC's application of its excess <u>ad valorem tax</u> deposits to its <u>specific tax</u> deficiency.<br><br><i>First</i>, the approval given by private respondent was correct. <u>Ad valorem taxes</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and <u>specific taxes</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> are both excise taxes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> on alcohol products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The payment by installment of a portion of the total <u>specific tax</u> deficiency of SMC, in addition to the application of its excess and unused <u>ad valorem tax</u> deposits to the remaining portion, fully covered the total net <u>specific tax</u> shortfall. BIR committed an oversight in failing to credit the amount of deposits to the <u>specific tax</u> deficiency, as well as an error in crediting the same amount to a subsequent <u>ad valorem tax</u> liability. A confusion was thus created when it issued a later assessment for the same <u>specific tax</u> deficiency, this time inclusive of increments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Proper was the BIR officials' abatement or cancellation of the <u>specific taxes</u> of SMC, after the amount of its <u>ad valorem tax</u> deposits had already been credited to it.<br><br>To state that the balances of accounts pertaining to different tax deposits could only be applied to cover certain tax liabilities upon the approval of a request for tax credit is to validate the proposition that the acceptance of payment by installment of a portion of the <u>specific tax</u> deficiency was indeed tantamount to the approval of the request. No law or regulation prevented such approval.<br><br>Private respondent's letter states a condition: should the final computation of <u>specific</u> and <u>ad valorem</u> taxes yield a different result, the difference plus penalties would be paid in addition to them. Obviously, this condition referred solely to the discrepancy, not to the application, and had nothing to do with the approval that was given.<br><br><i>Second</i>, such approval had the concurrence of top tax officials within the Bureau. Not only was there a presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> also, their collective conclusion was controlling. Besides, the disclosure of the change in beer formulation was timely and voluntary; no attribution of bad faith or fraud could be made. A change in technology that would result in a change in the manner of computing taxes was well within the realm of tax administration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on which private respondent had reasonable discretion to rule.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the law and revenue regulations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> allowed pre-payment schemes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> whereby excise taxes on alcohol products could be paid in advance of the dates they were due. Since the equivalent value of <u>specific taxes</u> by way of advance <u>ad valorem tax</u> deposits had already been paid, the government lost nothing. It was a simple request properly granted for applying the advance deposits made on one type of excise tax to another type. Granting such request was well within private respondent's authority to administer tax laws and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Again, the assessment was not final, demandable or executory at the time.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, in a letter to the Blue Ribbon Committee of the Senate, no less than the succeeding commissioner of internal revenue declared that the abatement of the <u>specific tax</u> deficiency through the proposed application was proper. Even if the new commissioner had admittedly been advised by private respondent, there remained the unrebutted presumptions of good faith and regularity in the performance of official functions.<br><center><br><b><u>Third Issue:<br><i>Acceptance of the P10 Million Alleged Compromise</i></u></b><br></center><br>The SB did not gravely abuse its discretion when it upheld private respondent's acceptance of SMC's compromise offer of P10 million.<br><br>In computing its <u>ad valorem tax</u> liabilities for the taxable period involved in the present case, SMC deducted from its brewer's gross selling price the <u>specific tax</u>, price differential, and <u>ad valorem tax</u>. The BIR allowed the deduction of the <u>specific tax</u>, but not the deduction of the price differential and <u>ad valorem tax</u>, thus increasing the tax base and consequently the <u>ad valorem tax</u> liabilities of SMC for the said period.<br><br>Prior to and during the taxable period involved in the present case, several changes were made in the NIRC of 1977, particularly its provisions pertaining to fermented liquor. We must therefore trace the NIRC's pertinent history to be able to rule properly on the validity of SMC's deduction of both the price differential and the <u>ad valorem tax</u> from the brewer's gross selling price.<br><br>Section 147(A) of the NIRC, as amended by PD 1959<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> in 1984, provides for the collection of a <u>specific tax</u> on each liter of the volume capacity of fermented liquor. In addition to the provision on the <u>specific tax</u>, the first paragraph of its Section 147(B) provides for the levying, assessment and collection of an <u>ad valorem tax</u>. The latter tax is equivalent to a certain percentage of the brewer's gross selling price, net of the specific tax, of the product to be removed from the brewery or other place of manufacture. The <u>ad valorem tax</u> shall be paid by the brewer at the same time as the <u>specific tax</u>.<br><br>Added in 1984 were provisions of Section 186-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> governing the determination of the gross selling price of cigarettes, as well as the administrative requirements and penalties imposable. Such provisions shall apply to the determination of the gross selling price of fermented liquor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Basically, this means that the amount of tax due on the fermented liquor shall be determined by the price at which it is sold either wholesale in the factory of SMC or directly to the public through its sales agents. If the fermented liquor is sold or allowed to be sold wholesale by SMC in another establishment which it owns, the wholesale price in that establishment shall determine the tax applicable to the fermented liquor sold there. When the price is less than the cost of manufacture plus all expenses incurred, until the fermented liquor is finally sold by SMC, such cost plus expenses shall be the basis for determining the amount of tax to be collected.<br><br>In 1986, PD 1994 amended the NIRC of 1977 by renumbering, among others, Section 147 as Section 124.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In the new Section 124, the provisions on the <u>specific</u> and <u>ad valorem taxes</u> imposed on fermented liquors remained substantially the same, except for the tax rates.<br><br>On July 1, 1986, Section 4 of EO 22 amended said Section 124 by essentially providing that an <u>ad valorem tax</u> equivalent to a certain percentage of the brewer's wholesale selling price -- this time excluding the <u>ad valorem tax</u> -- shall be levied, assessed and collected on fermented liquors. It was only in 1988 that EO 273 renumbered Section 124 as Section 140, and thereby amended it further to exclude also from such wholesale price the value-added tax already imposed at the time upon the same articles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Price Differential Deduction</i></b></u><br><br>Section 110 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended in 1986 by PD 1994, explicitly provides that the excise taxes on domestic products shall be paid by the manufacturer or producer before the removal of those products from the place of production.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> "It does not matter to what use the article[s] subject to tax is put";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the excise taxes are still due, even though the articles are removed merely for storage in some other place and are not actually sold or consumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The intent of the law is reiterated in several implementing regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This means, therefore, that the price that should be used as the tax base for computing the <u>ad valorem tax</u> on fermented liquor is the price at the brewery. After all, excise taxes are taxes on property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> not on the sale of the property.<br><br>Verily, the price differential cannot be ascertained at the time the fermented liquor is removed from the brewery, because such ascertainment will involve amounts that cannot be determined with certainty in advance, and that vary from one commercial outlet to another. The price differential, according to SMC, represents the cost of discounts, promotions, rebates, and transportation. To require the inclusion of the price differential in, not its deduction from, the tax base for purposes of computing the <u>ad valorem tax</u> would certainly lead to the impossible situation of computing for such tax, because the price differential itself cannot be determined unless the fermented liquor is actually sold.<br><br>Hence, no <u>ad valorem tax</u> can ever be paid before the removal of the fermented liquor from the place of production. This outcome cannot be countenanced, for it would be contrary to what the law mandates --payment before removal. It follows that the tax base to be used should be net of the price differential. In other words, the gross selling price should be that which is charged at the brewery prior to the removal of the fermented liquor.<br><br><u><b><i>Ad Valorem Tax Deduction</i></b></u><br><br>The taxable period covered in this case is January 1, 1985 to March 31, 1986. Prior to the amendment of the NIRC of 1977 by EO 22 on July 1, 1986, the <u>ad valorem tax</u> was not excluded from the brewer's wholesale price.  Does this mean that such tax cannot be deducted? The answer is no.<br><br>A tax should not be imposed upon another tax. This is tax pyramiding, which has no basis either in fact or in law.<br><br>Private respondent has shown by mathematical analysis that the inclusion of the <u>ad valorem tax</u> in the tax base would only yield a circuitous manner of computation that will never end in just one <u>ad valorem tax</u> figure properly chargeable against a taxpayer.

However, where the petition demonstrate[s] mere errors in judgment not amounting to grave abuse of discretion or deprivation of due process, the writ of certiorari cannot issue.

Tan Jr. was charged with "having willfully, unlawfully and criminally cause[d] undue injury to the government by effecting a compromise of the tax liabilities' of SMC amounting to P302,051,048.93 for only P10,000,000, a "compromise [that] is grossly disadvantageous to the government." In no uncertain terms, the assailed Resolution of the Sandiganbayan acquitted him of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (the Anti-Graft Law).<br><br>Under the Constitution, no person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. To implement this constitutional mandate, the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> bars an appeal by the State from a judgment of acquittal, provided the following requisites are present: (1) a valid complaint or information was filed; (2) before a competent court; (3) the defendant pleaded to the charge; and (4) the accused was acquitted.<br><br>Petitioner alleges, however, that in acquitting the accused, the Sandiganbayan acted in a "capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner" equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>Indeed, the double jeopardy principle will not protect the accused, if the prosecution can show that the court gravely abused its discretion in rendering the judgment of acquittal. The prosecution's burden is heavy: to show grave -- not just ordinary -- abuse of discretion equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>This Court notes the tenacity of the Ombudsman and the Office the Special Prosecutor in doggedly pursuing what they believe is the public weal. But after a careful review of the assailed judgment and the relevant facts and laws, this Court cannot ascribe capricious or whimsical conduct on the part of the Sandiganbayan. The SB Resolution assessed the facts and applied the governing laws and jurisprudence. It analyzed the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense. It then concluded that the elements of the crime charged had not been sufficiently proven. Hence, it acquitted the accused.<br><br>Because of the importance of this case and the need to assist the government in collecting the correct amount of taxes, this Court even went further by inquiring whether private respondent (not just the Sandiganbayan) acted within the confines of his duties and prerogatives.<br><br>As can be seen from the foregoing discussions, Commissioner Bienvenido A. Tan Jr. acted fairly, honestly and in good faith in discharging his functions. To compromise a tax liability of more than P300 million for only P10 million may appear to be an arbitrary action grossly disadvantageous to the government. The fact remains, however, that the initial tax assessment of P300 million was correctly found by the SB to be overly excessive and erroneous. Under the circumstances, the abatement of the excessive and erroneous taxes was not only within the discretion of respondent; it was just and fair to all concerned. After all, the purpose of tax assessment is to collect only what is legally and justly due the government; not to overburden, much less harass, the taxpayers.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <b><i>DENIED</i></b>, and the assailed Resolution <i><b>AFFIRMED.</b></i> No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, Carpio Morales</i>, and <i>Garcia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 2-52.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Fourth Division.
