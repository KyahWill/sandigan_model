				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime in May 1992, Josephine Aguilar (Josephine) canvassed, via telephone, prices of cars from different car dealers listed in the yellow pages of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone directory.<br><br>On May 23, 1992, World Cars, Inc. (World Cars) sent its representative Joselito Perez (Perez) and Vangie Tayag (Vangie) to the Aguilar residence in New Manila, Quezon City bringing with them calling cards, brochures and price list for different car models, among other things. The two representatives discussed with Josephine the advantages and disadvantages of the different models, their prices and terms of payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

May 30, 1992, bringing with them a white 1992 Nissan California bearing Motor   No. GA16-099086 and Chassis No. WGLB12-D10269, and the documents bearing on the sale.<br><br>As Josephine and her husband Ferdinand Aguilar (the Aguilars) were being made to sign by the two representatives a promissory note, chattel mortgage, disclosures and other documents the dates of which were left blank and which showed that they would still be obliged to pay on installment in 12 months for the car even if checks in full payment thereof in 90 days were to be issued, the two replied that it was only for formality, for in case the checks were not cleared, the documents would take effect, otherwise they would be cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The Aguilars did sign the promissory note<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> binding them to be jointly and severally liable to World Cars in the amount of P301,992.00, payable in 12 months, with a monthly amortization of P25,166.00 and a late payment charge of 5% per month on each unpaid installment from due date until fully paid.<br><br>By Josephine's claim, at the time she and her husband signed the promissory note, its date, May 30, 1992, and the due date of the monthly amortization which was agreed to be every 3rd day of each month starting July 1992 were not reflected therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The Aguilars did execute too a chattel mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in favor of World Cars which embodied a deed of

1992 appearing in the chattel mortgage cum deed of assignment was not yet filled up at the time she and her husband signed it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After the Aguilars' signing of the documents, Perez asked Josephine to make the check payments payable to him, prompting her to call up Perez's boss, a certain Lily Paloma, to inquire whether Perez could collect payment to which Lily replied in the affirmative, the latter advising her to just secure a receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Josephine thus issued four Far East Bank and Trust

P370,000.00, Perez issued Josephine World Cars Provisional Receipt No. 5965.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Check No. 112704 which was made payable to World Cars represented payment of the premium on the car insurance, secured from Dominion Insurance which issued a policy in the name of Josephine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Josephine was subsequently issued on June 2, 1992 Official Receipt No. 61117975<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> by the Land Transportation Office covering the payment of the fees for the registration of the car.<br><br>In mid-June of 1992, Perez and Vangie went back to the Aguilar residence requesting that Check No. 112705 dated June 30, 1992 payable to Perez in the amount of P111,000.00 be cancelled and that two checks in the total amount of P111,000.00 be issued in replacement thereof, one in the amount of P4,150.00 to be made payable to Sunny Motors, which appears to be a sales outlet of World Cars, for processing fee of the documents, and the other in the amount of P106,850.00 to be again made payable to Perez. Josephine obliged and accordingly issued Check No. 112724<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> in the amount of P4,150.00 payable to Sunny Motors, and Check No. 112725<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in the amount of P106,850.00 payable to Perez.<br><br>Check Nos. 112703,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 112724<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and 112725<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> were in the meantime cleared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>No official receipt for the checks having been issued to Josephine, she warned Perez that if she did not get any by the end of July 1992, she would request for stop payment of the last check she issued in his name, Check No. 112706<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated July 30, 1992 in the amount of P111,000.00.            Perez failed to deliver any receipt to Josephine, drawing her to advise, by telefax, FEBTC Del Monte, Quezon City Branch a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated July 30, 1992 to stop the payment of Check No. 112706.<br><br>The clearing of Check No. 112706 having been stopped on Josephine's advice, Perez repaired to the Aguilar residence, asking the reason therefor. On being informed by Josephine of the reason, Perez explained that receipts were in Bulacan where the main office of World Cars is, and he had no time to go there owing to its distance.  Perez then advised Josephine that if she did not issue another check to replace Check No. 112706, the 12-month installment term of payment under the documents she and her husband signed would take effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Not wanting to be bound by the 12-month installment term, Josephine issued Check No. 112767<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated August 4, 1992 in the amount of P111,000.00 payable to Perez who issued her Sunny Motor Sales Provisional Receipt No. 5028.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Check No. 112767 was also later cleared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In September 1992, Josephine received a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated August 20, 1992 from Ana Marie Caber (Ana Marie), Account Specialist of Citytrust, advising her that as of August 20, 1992, her overdue account with it in connection with the purchase of the car had amounted to "P1,045.39" inclusive of past due charges.<br><br>Josephine at once informed Ana Marie that she had fully paid the car to which Ana Marie replied that "maybe not all of the papers have been processed yet," hence, she advised Josephine not to worry about it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In December 1992, Josephine received another letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated December 9, 1992 from Citytrust advising her that her account had been, as of December 9, 1992, overdue in the amount of P110,706.60 inclusive of unpaid installments for the months of August, September, October, November and December 1992 plus accumulated penalty charges; and that if she failed to arrange for another payment scheme, her account would be referred to its legal counsel for collection.<br><br>Josephine again called Ana Marie inquiring what was going on and the latter replied that no payment for the car had been received.  Josephine also called up World Cars and spoke to its Vice-President, a certain Domondon, who informed her that based on company records, the last payment had not been received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The spouses Aguilar thus filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for "annulment of chattel mortgage plus damages" against Citytrust and World Cars before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City.<br><br>In its Answer with Counterclaims and Crossclaim against World Cars,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Citytrust disclaimed knowledge of the alleged prior arrangement and the alleged subsequent payments made by the Aguilars to World Cars.  And it claimed that it accepted the endorsement and assignment of the promissory note and chattel mortgage in good faith, relying on the terms and conditions thereof; and that assuming that the Aguilars' claim were true, World Cars appeared to have violated the terms and conditions of the Receivables Financing Agreement (RFA) it executed with it, the pertinent portions of which read:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.

World Cars was thus declared as in default.<br><br>As defined in the Pre-trial Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated November 11, 1994, the issues of the case were:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether or not [the Aguilars] have duly paid the purchase price of the car, and if so, whether or not [they] can still be held liable to pay under the promissory note and the chattel mortgage.</li><br><li>Whether or not [Citytrust and World Cars] are liable to [the Aguilars] for damages and if so, how much.</li><br><li>Whether or not [the Aguilars] have fully paid the balance installment price of the [car] which was purchased from [World Cars].</li><br><li>Whether or not [the Aguilars] are entitled to the damages prayed for in the complaint.</li><br><li>Whether or not [Citytrust] is entitled to the cross-claim prayed for against [World Cars].</li><br><li>Whether or not [the Aguilars] are still liable for their unpaid obligations to [Citytrust].</li><br><li>Whether or not [World Cars] is liable to pay the unpaid obligations of [the Aguilars] if the latter will be able to prove that they already fully paid the price of the subject car.</li><br><li>Who among the parties is entitled to damages and attorney's fees, and if so, how much?<br></li></ol></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated January 12, 1999, Branch 77 of the Quezon City RTC found Perez to be an agent of World Cars, hence, an extension of its personality as far as the sale of the car to the Aguilars was concerned.<br><br>The trial court further found that Perez was authorized to receive payment for the car, hence, all payments made to him for the purchase of the car were payments made to his principal, World Cars; that the Aguilars had paid a total amount of P386,000.00 including their final payment on July 30, 2002, which date World Cars admitted to be the deadline therefor;  and that the Aguilars had no intention to be bound by the promissory note which they signed in favor of World Cars or its assignee nor by the terms of the Chattel Mortgage, the conforme in the undated Letter (Notice of Assignment) of World Cars and the Disclosure Statement of Loan/Credit Transaction having been predicated on the validity of the promissory note.<br><br>Moreover, the trial court held that the fact that on May 30, 1992, the same date of the promissory note, Josephine issued three checks to fully cover the purchase price of the car (the fourth represented payment of insurance premium), the last of which was still to mature on July 30, 1992, proves that the Aguilars signed the promissory note without intending to be bound by its terms.<br><br>In fine, the trial court held that the Aguilars had paid World Cars the full purchase price of the car, and Citytrust as the assignee of World Cars had no right to collect from them the amount stated in the Chattel Mortgage <span style="font-style: italic;">cum</span> Deed of Assignment which is simulated and, therefore, void, following Art. 1346 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 1346.

Josephine's testimony that before issuing the checks in the name of Perez, she verified from his supervisor and the latter confirmed Perez' authority to receive payment remains unrefuted by World Cars. In fact, World Cars admitted in its Answer with Counterclaim that "[w]hat was actually paid [by the Aguilars] and received by [it] was [Josephine's] check in the amount of P148,000.00 as <span style="font-weight: bold;">downpayment</span> for the said car."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  Parenthetically, as earlier stated, when Josephine spoke to World Cars' Vice President Domondon, the latter informed her that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">last</span> payment had not been received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  This information of Domondon does not jibe with the claim of World Cars that it received only Josephine's first check in the amount of P148,000.00 as downpayment.<br><br>As the above table of checks issued by Josephine shows, the check in the amount of P148,000.00, Check No. 112703 dated May 30, 1992, was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">payable to Perez</span>.<br><br>Since the Aguilars' payment to Perez is deemed payment to World Cars, the promissory note, chattel mortgage and other accessory documents they executed which<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> were to take effect only in the event the checks would be dishonored</span> were deemed nullified, all the checks having been cleared.<br><br>Since the condition for the instruments to become effective was fulfilled, the obligation on the part of the Aguilars to be bound thereby did not arise and World Cars did not thus acquire rights thereunder following Art. 1181 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1181. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In conditional obligations, the acquisition of rights,</span> as well as the extinguishment or loss of those already acquired, <span style="font-weight: bold;">shall depend upon the happening of the event which constitutes the condition.</span> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As no right against the Aguilars was acquired by World Cars under the promissory note and chattel mortgage, it had nothing to assign to Citytrust.  Consequently, Citytrust cannot enforce the instruments against the Aguilars, for an assignee cannot acquire greater rights than those pertaining to the assignor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>At all events, the Aguilars having fully paid the car before they became aware of the assignment of the instruments to Citytrust when they received notice thereof by Citytrust, they were released of their obligation thereunder.  The Civil Code so provides:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1626. The debtor who, before having knowledge of the assignment, pays his creditor, shall be released from the obligation.<br></blockquote>While Citytrust cannot enforce the instruments against the Aguilars, since under the RFA, specifically paragraph 5(a) thereof, World Cars guaranteed as follows:<br><blockquote>5. As further warranties, [World Cars] hereby agrees and shall be bound by the following:<br><br>a. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">World Cars guarantees to [Citytrust]</span> its successors, and assigns, <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">that it has full right and legal authority to make the assignment or discounting; that the installment papers so discounted by virtue of this agreement, are subsisting, valid, enforceable and in all respects what they purport to be; that the papers contain the entire agreement between the customers and [World Cars];</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>x x x<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">that it has absolute and good title to such contracts and the personalties covered thereby and the right to sell and transfer the same in favor of [Citytrust];</span> x x x  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>Citytrust's allegations in its Crossclaim against World Cars Inc., to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>6.
