FAILED TO STATE CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY THE FACTS AND LAW ON WHICH THE APPEALED ORDER WAS BASED, THEREBY RENDERING SAID ORDER NULL AND VOID.<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; . . . ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE COMPLAINT FAILED TO ALLEGE ULTIMATE FACTS ON WHICH [PETITIONER] RELIES ON HER CLAIM THEREBY DISMISSING THE CASE FOR LACK OF CAUSE OF ACTION.<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; . . . ERRED IN GIVING DUE COURSE TO THE MOTION TO DISMISS THAT CONTAINED A FAULTY NOTICE OF HEARING AS THE SAME IS MERELY ADDRESSED TO THE BRANCH CLERK OF COURT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of March 21, 2003 affirming the dismissal order of the trial court, the appellate court held that the elements of a cause of action are absent in the case:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><blockquote>Such allegations in the complaint are only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">general averments</span> of fraud, deceit and bad faith. There were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no allegations of facts</span> showing that the acts complained of were done in the manner alleged. The complaint <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not clearly ascribe the extent of the liability of each of [respondents].</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neither did it state any right or cause of action on the part of [petitioner] to show that she is indeed entitled to the relief prayed for.</span> In the first place, the record shows that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subject checks which she sought to cancel or revoke had already been dishonored</span> and stamped "ACCOUNT CLOSED." In fact, there were already criminal charges for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 filed against [petitioner] previous to the filing of the civil case for revocation/cancellation. Such being the case, there was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually nothing more to cancel or revoke</span>. The subject checks could no longer be negotiated. Thus, [petitioner's] allegation that the [respondents] were secretly negotiating with third persons for their delivery and/or assignment, is untenable.<br><br>In the second place, we find <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing on the face of the complaint to show that [petitioner] denied the genuineness or authenticity of her signature on the subject promissory notes and the allegedly signed blank checks</span>. She merely alleged abuse of trust and confidence on the part of [Alonzo]. Even assuming arguendo that such allegations were true, then [petitioner] cannot be held totally blameless for her predicament as it was by her own negligence that subject instruments/signed blank checks fell into the hands of third persons. Contrary to [petitioner's] allegations, the promissory notes show that some of the [respondents] were actually creditors of [petitioner] and who were issued the subject checks as securities for the loan/obligation incurred. Having taken the instrument in good faith and for value, the [respondents] are therefore considered holders thereof in due course and entitled to payment.</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x (Underscoring supplied)<br></div><br>Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari, petitioner faulting the appellate court:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> . . . . in sustaining the dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of failure to state a cause of action when there are other several causes of action which ventilate such causes of action in the complaint;<br><br></li><li> . . . . in finding that a requirement that a Decision which should express therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based does not include cases which had not reached pre-trial or trial stage;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; . . . in not finding that a notice of hearing which was addressed to the Clerk of Court is totally defective and that subsequent action of the court did not cure the flaw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In issue then is whether petitioner's complaint failed to state a cause of action.<br><br>A cause of action has three elements: (1) the legal right of the plaintiff, (2) the correlative obligation of the defendant, and (3) the act or omission of the defendant in violation of said legal right. In determining the presence of these elements, inquiry is confined to the four corners of the complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> including its annexes, they being parts thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> If these elements are absent, the complaint becomes vulnerable to a motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to state a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>As reflected in the above-quoted allegations in petitioner's complaint, petitioner is seeking twin reliefs, one for revocation/cancellation of promissory notes and checks, and the other for damages.<br><br>Thus, petitioner alleged, among other things, that respondents, through "deceit," "abuse of confidence" "machination," "fraud," "falsification," "forgery," "defraudation," and "bad faith," and "with malice, malevolence and selfish intent," succeeded in inducing her to sign antedated promissory notes and some blank checks, and "[by taking] undue advantage" of her signature on some other blank checks, succeeded in procuring them, even if there was no consideration for all of these instruments on account of which she suffered "anxiety, tension, sleepless nights, wounded feelings and embarrassment."<br><br>While some of the allegations may lack particulars, and are in the form of conclusions of law, the elements of a cause of action are present. For even if some are not stated with particularity, petitioner alleged 1) her legal right not to be bound by the instruments which were bereft of consideration and to which her consent was vitiated; 2) the correlative obligation on the part of the defendants-respondents to respect said right; and 3) the act of the defendants-respondents in procuring her signature on the instruments through "deceit," "abuse of confidence" "machination," "fraud," "falsification," "forgery," "defraudation," and "bad faith," and "with malice, malevolence and selfish intent."<br><br>Where the allegations of a complaint are vague, indefinite, or in the form of conclusions, its dismissal is not proper for the defendant may ask for more particulars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>With respect to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">checks</span> subject of the complaint, it is gathered that, except for Check No. 0084078,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> they were drawn all against petitioner's Metrobank Account No. 00703-955536-7.<br><br>Annex "D-8"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the complaint, a photocopy of Check No. 0085134, shows that it was dishonored on <span style="font-weight: bold;">January 12, 2000</span> due to "ACCOUNT CLOSED." When petitioner then filed her complaint on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 28, 2000</span>, all the checks subject hereof which were drawn against the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same closed account</span> were already rendered valueless or non-negotiable, hence, petitioner had, with respect to them, no cause of action.<br><br>With respect to above-said Check No. 0084078, however, which was drawn against another account of petitioner, albeit the date of issue bears only the year – 1999, its validity and negotiable character at the time the complaint was filed on March 28, 2000 was not affected. For Section 6 of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides:<br><blockquote>Section 6. Omission; seal; particular money. – <span style="font-weight: bold;">The validity and negotiable character of an instrument are not affected by the fact that </span>–<br><br>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">a) It is not dated; </span>or<br><br>(b) Does not specify the value given, or that any value had been given therefor; or<br><br>(c) Does not specify the place where it is drawn or the place where it is payable; or<br><br>(d) Bears a seal; or<br><br>(e) Designates a particular kind of current money in which payment is to be made.</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></div><br>However, even if the holder of Check No. 0084078 would have filled up the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">month</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">day</span> of issue thereon to be "December"and "31," respectively, it would have, as it did, become stale six (6) months or 180 days thereafter, following current banking practice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It is, however, with respect to the questioned <span style="text-decoration: underline;">promissory notes</span> that the present petition assumes merit.
