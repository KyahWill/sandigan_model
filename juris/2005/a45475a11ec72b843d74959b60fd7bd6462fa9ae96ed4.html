				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to set aside the Resolutions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals dated February 3, 1998 in CA-G.R. CV No. 56176 dismissing the appeal filed by the Philippine Rabbit Bus Liner, Inc., herein petitioner, for its failure to file the required appellant's brief within the reglementary period.<br><br>Petitioner is a corporation organized and existing under the Philippine laws and is engaged in business as a common carrier.<br><br>On October 17, 1983, petitioner's bus No. 309 collided with a ten-wheeler truck in Dolores, Mabalacat, Pampanga.&nbsp; As a result, several passengers were injured.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nelson Goimco, Sr., herein respondent and one of the passengers, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 65, Tarlac City, a complaint for breach of contract of carriage against petitioner, docketed as Civil Case No. 6977. Spouses Isabelo and Remegia Ladia (also impleaded herein as respondents), parents of Isabelo Ladia, Jr. who died, likewise instituted a similar complaint with the same court, docketed as Civil Case No. 7054.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two cases were consolidated and jointly heard by the trial court.<br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered a Joint Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant as follows: <br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td>(1)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Defendant is ordered to pay to plaintiff Nelson Goimco, Sr., the amount of P248,157.38 as and by way of actual damages; the amount of P100,000.00 as and by way of moral damages; the amount of P100,000.00 as and by way of exemplary damages; and the amount of P50,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Defendant is ordered to pay to the heirs of Isabelo Ladia, Jr., the amount of P50,000.00 for the death of Isabelo Ladia, Jr., the amount of P75,000.00 as and by way of actual damages, and amount of P15,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Third-party defendant First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company is ordered to pay to the defendant the amount of P50,000.00 by way of reimbursement of liabilities incurred by the defendant as a result of the accident.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;  </sup><br></blockquote>Both parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration of the Decision.&nbsp; Petitioner sought to be exonerated from all civil liabilities, while respondents asked for an award corresponding to the loss of income of respondent Nelson Goimco and the late Isabelo Ladia, Jr.<br><br>In an Order dated September 7, 1995, the trial court denied petitioner's motion but granted those of respondents Goimco and spouses Ladia, thus:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision of this court is hereby amended awarding the amount of P679,629,60 to Nelson Goimco and P100,980.00 to the heirs of Isabelo Ladia, Jr., for loss of income.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner then, through the law office of Escudero, Marasigan, Sta. Ana &amp; E.H. Villareal, interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On October 2, 1997, petitioner received a copy of the Order of the Appellate Court directing it to file its appellant's brief within fifteen (15) days or until October 17, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, despite notice, petitioner did not file the required appellant's brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, on February 3, 1998, the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal pursuant to Section 1 (3), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended.<br><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration alleging that "the expiration of the reglementary period fell during more or less at the time that the office log book (of its counsel), containing the schedules of hearings and deadlines for pleadings, motions and other documents, inadvertently got lost."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, its failure to file the appellant's brief was due to "its (counsel's) mistake or excusable negligence."<br><br>On July 29, 1998, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration, holding that its "counsel could have, with ordinary prudence, updated the schedule of hearings and deadlines for the filing of pleadings, briefs and other court papers within a lesser period of 4 months."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Hence, the instant petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br>This petition lacks merit.<br><br>What petitioner should have filed is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, not a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the same Rules. We have consistently held that <i>certiorari </i>is not a substitute for a lost appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The extraordinary writ of certiorari issues only for the correction of errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Grave abuse of discretion is such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment which is equivalent to an excess or lack of jurisdiction, meaning that the abuse of discretion must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>We find that in dismissing petitioner's appeal, the Court of Appeals did not gravely abuse its discretion.<br><br><b>Moreover, the right to appeal is not a natural right or a part of due process.</b> It is merely a procedural remedy of statutory origin and may be exercised only in the manner prescribed by the provisions of law authorizing its exercise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Hence, its requirements must be strictly complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7, Rule 44 of the same Rules provides: <br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. <i>Appellant's brief</i>. – It shall be the <b>duty</b> of the appellant to file with the court within forty-five (45) days from receipt of the notice of the clerk that all evidence, oral and documentary, are attached to record, seven (7) copies of his legibly typewritten, mimeographed or printed brief, with proof of service of two (2) copies thereof upon the appellee."<br></blockquote>Section 1 (e), Rule 50 likewise states:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1. <i>Grounds for dismissal of appeal.</i> – An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:<br><br>x x x<br><br><b>(e) Failure of the appellant to serve and file the required number of copies of his brief or memorandum within the time prescribed by these Rules;</b>"<br></blockquote>In <i>Casim v. Floredeliza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> we stressed that the above Rules are designed for the proper and prompt disposition of cases before the Appellate Court, for they provide for a system under which litigants may be heard in the correct form and manner <b>at the prescribed time</b> in an orderly confrontation before a court whose authority is unquestioned.<br><br>We note that petitioner's previous counsel is a large law firm with several lawyers in its roster.&nbsp; Yet it took said counsel <b>four (4) months, from the expiration of the reglementary period</b>, within which to file the appellant's brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is settled that failure to file brief for a client constitutes inexcusable negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Petitioner's flimsy excuse that it's counsel's logbook containing the schedules for the filing of pleadings and hearings was lost is, to say the least, most unpersuasive.&nbsp; Said counsel should have examined consistently the records of its cases to find out what appropriate actions have to be taken thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The notice to file the appellant's brief was in the records of the instant cases all along. Had counsel been efficient in the handling of its cases, the required appellant's brief could have been filed on time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its failure to do so is an inexcusable negligence.<br><br>It is settled that the mistakes, negligence, and omissions of counsel are binding upon his client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> So should it be in the instant cases.<br><br>On petitioner's insistence that it was denied due process, suffice it to say that there is no denial of due process where the adverse ruling was attributable to its counsel's negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, (Chairman), Corona, Carpio Morales,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, p. 28.&nbsp; Per Associate Justice Fermin A.
