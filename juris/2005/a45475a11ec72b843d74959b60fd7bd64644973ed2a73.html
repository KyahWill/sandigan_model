				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Rules require the legal representatives of a dead litigant to be substituted as parties to a litigation.&nbsp; This requirement is necessitated by due process.&nbsp; Thus, when the rights of the legal representatives of a decedent are actually recognized and protected, noncompliance or belated formal compliance with the Rules cannot affect the validity of the promulgated decision.&nbsp; After all, due process had thereby been satisfied.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the August 26, 2003 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the March 9, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 34702.&nbsp; The challenged Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the appeal is DISMISSED and the assailed decision accordingly AFFIRMED in toto.&nbsp; No costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, the trial court's affirmed Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br> <table Â ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">"a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh.

Domingo, Nueva Ecija.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent alleged that he had obtained a loan from them in the amount of P9,000 on June 29, 1974, payable after five (5) years; that is, on June 29, 1979.&nbsp; To secure the payment of the obligation, he supposedly executed a Deed of Sale in favor of petitioners.&nbsp; The Deed was for a parcel of land in Pinagpanaan, Talavera, Nueva Ecija, covered by TCT No. T-111802.&nbsp; The parties also executed another document entitled "<span style="font-style: italic;">Kasunduan.</span>" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Respondent claimed that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Kasunduan</span> showed the Deed of Sale to be actually an equitable mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Spouses De la Cruz contended that this document was merely an accommodation to allow the repurchase of the property until June 29, 1979, a right that he failed to exercise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On April 23, 1990, the RTC issued a Decision in his favor.&nbsp; The trial court declared that the parties had entered into a sale with a right of repurchase.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It further held that respondent had made a valid tender of payment on two separate occasions to exercise his right of repurchase.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Accordingly, petitioners were required to reconvey the property upon his payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Sustaining the trial court, the CA noted that petitioners had given respondent the right to repurchase the property within five (5) years from the date of the sale or until June 29, 1979.&nbsp; Accordingly, the parties executed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Kasunduan</span> to express the terms and conditions of their actual agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The appellate court also found no reason to overturn the finding that respondent had validly exercised his right to repurchase the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the March 9, 2004 Resolution, the CA denied reconsideration and ordered a substitution by legal representatives, in view of respondent's death on December 24, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioners assign the following errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote>"I.

Public Respondent Twelfth Division of the Honorable Court of Appeals likewise erred in denying [petitioners"] Motion for Reconsideration given the facts and the law therein presented."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Succinctly, the issues are whether the trial court lost jurisdiction over the case upon the death of Pedro Joaquin, and whether respondent was guilty of forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Jurisdiction</span><br></div><br>Petitioners assert that the RTC's Decision was invalid for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> They claim that respondent died during the pendency of the case.&nbsp; There being no substitution by the heirs, the trial court allegedly lacked jurisdiction over the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Rule on Substitution</span><br><br>When a party to a pending action dies and the claim is not extinguished,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Rules of Court require a substitution of the deceased.&nbsp; The procedure is specifically governed by Section 16 of Rule 3, which reads thus:<br><blockquote>"Section 16. <span style="font-style: italic;">Death of a party; duty of counsel.</span> -Whenever a party to a pending action dies, and the claim is not thereby extinguished, it shall be the duty of his counsel to inform the court within thirty (30) days after such death of the fact thereof, and to give the name and address of his legal representative or representatives.&nbsp; Failure of counsel to comply with this duty shall be a ground for disciplinary action.<br><br>"The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor heirs.<br><br>"The court shall forthwith order said legal representative or representatives to appear and be substituted within a period of thirty (30) days from notice.<br><br>"If no legal representative is named by the counsel for the deceased party, or if the one so named shall fail to appear within the specified period, the court may order the opposing party, within a specified time, to procure the appointment of an executor or administrator for the estate of the deceased, and the latter shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the deceased.&nbsp; The court charges in procuring such appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs."<br></blockquote>The rule on the substitution of parties was crafted to protect every party's right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The estate of the deceased party will continue to be properly represented in the suit through the duly appointed legal representative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Moreover, no adjudication can be made against the successor of the deceased if the fundamental right to a day in court is denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Court has nullified not only trial proceedings conducted without the appearance of the legal representatives of the deceased, but also the resulting judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In those instances, the courts acquired no jurisdiction over the persons of the legal representatives or the heirs upon whom no judgment was binding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>This general rule notwithstanding, a<span style="font-style: italic;"> formal</span> substitution by heirs is not necessary when they themselves voluntarily appear, participate in the case, and present evidence in defense of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> These actions negate any claim that the right to due process was violated.<br><br>The Court is not unaware of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chittick v. Court of Appeals,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in which the failure of the heirs to substitute for the original plaintiff upon her death led to the nullification of the trial court's Decision.&nbsp; The latter had sought to recover support in arrears and her share in the conjugal partnership.&nbsp; The children who allegedly substituted for her refused to continue the case against their father and vehemently objected to their inclusion as parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Moreover, because he died during the pendency of the case, they were bound to substitute for the defendant also.&nbsp; The substitution effectively merged the persons of the plaintiff and the defendant and thus extinguished the obligation being sued upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the present case is not similar, much less identical, to the factual milieu of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chittick.</span><br><br>Strictly speaking, the rule on the substitution by heirs is not a matter of jurisdiction, but a requirement of due process.&nbsp; Thus, when due process is not violated, as when the right of the representative or heir is recognized and protected, noncompliance or belated formal compliance with the Rules cannot affect the validity of a promulgated decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Mere failure to substitute for a deceased plaintiff is not a sufficient ground to nullify a trial court's decision.&nbsp; The alleging party must prove that there was an undeniable violation of due process.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Substitution in</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">the Instant Case</span><br><br>The records of the present case contain a "Motion for Substitution of Party Plaintiff" dated February 15, 2002, filed before the CA.&nbsp; The prayer states as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the Heirs of the deceased plaintiff-appellee as represented by his daughter Lourdes dela Cruz be substituted as party-plaintiff for the said Pedro Joaquin.<br><br>"It is further prayed that henceforth the undersigned counsel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for the heirs of Pedro Joaquin be furnished with copies of notices, orders, resolutions and other pleadings at its address below."<br></blockquote>Evidently, the heirs of Pedro Joaquin voluntary appeared and participated in the case.&nbsp; We stress that the appellate court had ordered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> his legal representatives to appear and substitute for him.&nbsp; The substitution even on appeal had been ordered correctly.&nbsp; In all proceedings, the legal representatives must appear to protect the interests of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> After the rendition of judgment, further proceedings may be held, such as a motion for reconsideration or a new trial, an appeal, or an execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Considering the foregoing circumstances, the Motion for Substitution may be deemed to have been granted; and the heirs, to have substituted for the deceased, Pedro Joaquin.&nbsp; There being no violation of due process, the issue of substitution cannot be upheld as a ground to nullify the trial court's Decision. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Forum Shopping</span><br></div><br>Petitioners also claim that respondents were guilty of forum shopping, a fact that should have compelled the trial court to dismiss the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> They claim that prior to the commencement of the present suit on July 7, 1981, respondent had filed a civil case against petitioners on June 25, 1979.&nbsp; Docketed as Civil Case No. SD-742 for the recovery of possession and for damages, it was allegedly dismissed by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija for lack of interest to prosecute.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Forum Shopping Defined</span><br><br>Forum shopping is the institution of two or more actions or proceedings involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Forum shopping may be resorted to by a party against whom an adverse judgment or order has been issued in one forum, in an attempt to seek a favorable opinion in another, other than by an appeal or a special civil action for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Forum shopping trifles with the courts, abuses their processes, degrades the administration of justice, and congests court dockets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Willful and deliberate violation of the rule against it is a ground for the summary dismissal of the case; it may also constitute direct contempt of court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The test for determining the existence of forum shopping is whether the elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> are present, or whether a final judgment in one case amounts to <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> in another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> We note, however, petitioners' claim that the subject matter of the present case has already been litigated and <span style="font-style: italic;">decided</span>.&nbsp; Therefore, the applicable doctrine is<span style="font-style: italic;"> res judicata</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Applicability of Res Judicata</span><br><br>Under <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all later suits and on all points and matters determined in the previous suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The term literally means a "matter adjudged, judicially acted upon, or settled by judgment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The principle bars a subsequent suit involving the same parties, subject matter, and cause of action.&nbsp; Public policy requires that controversies must be settled with finality at a given point in time.<br><br>The elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> are as follows: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) it must have been rendered on the merits of the controversy; (3) the court that rendered it must have had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and (4) there must have been -- between the first and the second actions -- an identity of parties, subject matter and cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Failure to Support Allegation</span><br><br>The onus of proving allegations rests upon the party raising them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> As to the matter of forum shopping and <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata,</span> petitioners have failed to provide this Court with relevant and clear specifications that would show the presence of an identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action between the present and the earlier suits.&nbsp; They have also failed to show whether the other case was decided on the merits.&nbsp; Instead, they have made only bare assertions involving its existence without reference to its facts.&nbsp; In other words, they have alleged conclusions of law without stating any factual or legal basis.&nbsp; Mere mention of other civil cases without showing the identity of rights asserted and reliefs sought is not enough basis to claim that respondent is guilty of forum shopping, or that <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;
