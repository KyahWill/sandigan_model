Yrastorza, Jr., requested that he be relieved as assisting judge in the RTC of Argao, Cebu to enable him to attend to the needs of his children as his wife is working abroad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On March 27, 2001, DCA Porferada recommended to this Court that Judge Llanos be allowed to resume hearing cases in his <i>sala</i> effective upon notice. DCA Porferada pointed out that as per records of the Statistical Reports Division of the OCA, Judge Llanos has decided 63 of the 82 cases and has resolved the incidents in 11 of the 13 cases he was directed to resolve.&nbsp; DCA Ponferada further recommended that the designation of Judge Yrastorza, Jr. as assisting judge in the RTC of Argao, Branch 26, be revoked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On June 26, 2001, we issued a Resolution:&nbsp; (1) allowing Judge Llanos to resume hearing cases in his <i>sala</i> effective upon notice; (2) directing him to submit, through the OCA, duly certified copies of his decisions/resolutions in the cases he was directed to decide/resolve; and (3) revoking the designation of Judge Yrastoza as assisting judge of the RTC of Argao, Cebu, Branch 26.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated August 15, 2001 addressed to DCA Zenaida N. Elepaño, then Acting Court Administrator, Judge Llanos stated that in partial compliance with our Resolution of April 11, 2000, he rendered decisions in the following cases:<br><blockquote>Criminal Cases Nos. AR-799; AR-1095; AR-1319; AR-1446; AR-1450; AR-1649; AR-1488; AR-1501; AR-1515; AR-1554; AR-1571; AR-1578; AR-1610; AR-1625; AR-1632; AR-1663; AR-1634; AR-1784; AR-1785; AR-1786; AR-1803;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AR-1824; AR-1931; AR-1251; AR-1948; AR-1951; AR-1968; AR-1972; AR-1997; AR-1998; AR-2006; AR-2008; AR-2019; AR-2129; AR-2031; AR-2047; AR-2052; AR-2098; and AR-2021.<br><br>Civil Cases Nos. AV-402; AV-654; AV-58; AV-657; AV-756; AV-784; AV-793; AV-799; AV-800; AV-851; AV-877; AV-896; AV-929; AV-979; AV-984; AV-985; AV-1005; AV-1040; AV-865; AV-856; AV-910; AV-774; Sp. Proc. A-270; and AV-1032.<br></blockquote>A follow-up audit and physical inventory of cases in the same court was conducted by the Judicial Audit Team of the OCA.&nbsp; The Team recommended that:<br><blockquote>“1. Hon. Epifanio C. Llanos, RTC, Branch 26, Argao, Cebu , be DIRECTED to EXPLAIN within ten (10) days from notice why no administrative sanction should be imposed upon him for his failure to decide the following cases despite the directive to him by the Court in its resolution dated 11 April 2000, to wit: Civil Cases Nos. AV-308, AV-497, AV-716, AV-726, and AV-730; the following cases within the reglementary period, to wit: AV-265, AV-704, AV-764, AV-883, AV-918, AV-1125, AV-1091 and SP-A-285 and to resolve within the reglementary period the motions in the following two (2) Civil Cases, to wit: Civil Cases Nos. AV-507, AV-689, and AV-1143.<br><br>2. The Financial Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator be AUTHORIZED to WITHHOLD the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) from the retirement benefits of Judge Epifanio C. Llanos which may serve as a contingent to any sanction that may be imposed on him for his failure to decide the thirteen (13) civil cases and to resolve the motions in two (2) civil cases, within the mandatory/reglementary period.<br><center><br>x x x”<br></center></blockquote>The above recommendation was adopted and indorsed to us by DCA Elepaño in her Memorandum dated September 4, 2002.<br><br>Meanwhile, Judge Llanos retired compulsorily on April 7, 2002.<br><br>In a letter of compliance dated February 19, 2003, Judge Llanos explained his delay in resolving the following cases:&nbsp; Civil Cases Nos. AV-730; AV-716; AV-308; AV-497; AV-726; AV-704; AV-883; AV-1125; and AV-1051 -&nbsp; He failed to decide these cases by reason of oversight and inadvertence.&nbsp; In Civil Case No. A-285, he did not decide this case on time since he was awaiting the result of Sp. Proc. No. A-270; and Civil Case No. AV-265 was not acted upon as he was very preparing for his compulsory retirement.<br><br>Judge Llanos disclosed that he has been suffering from internal bleeding caused by ulcers triggered by stress and overwork.&nbsp; Furthermore, he incurred financial obligations arising from hospital treatment abroad.&nbsp; He then asked that his application for retirement (after rendering thirty-four <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> years of service) be approved.<br><br>In her Report and Recommendation dated May 21, 2003, DCA Elepaño stated that Judge Llanos’ explanation is unsatisfactory and shows gross inefficiency on his part.&nbsp; That he is not in good health and is burdened with a heavy caseload will not exonerate him. These circumstances will only serve to mitigate the imposable penalty.&nbsp; Furthermore, Judge Llanos failed to explain why he did not decide Civil Case No. AV-918 within the prescribed period.&nbsp; He also failed to explain why he failed to resolve, within the mandatory period, the pending motions in Civil Cases Nos. AV-507, AV-689, and AV-1143. DCA Elepaño then recommended that he be held administratively liable for gross inefficiency and be fined in the amount of P40,000.00 which shall be deducted from his retirement benefits.<br><br>On July 2, 2003, we issued a Resolution requiring Judge Llanos to manifest within twenty (20) days from notice whether he is submitting the case on the basis of the pleadings and records already filed.<br><br>In a letter dated August 10, 2003, Judge Llanos manifested that he is submitting the matter for resolution on the basis of the pleadings and records already filed, but asked that the imposable penalty be reduced in view of his 34 years of dedicated service as a trial court judge.<br><br>Records show that Judge Llanos failed to decide within the reglementary period Civil Cases Nos. AV-308, AV-497, AV-716, AV-726, AV-730, AV-265, AV-704, AV-764, AV-883, AV-918, AV-1125, AV-1091, and APA-285.&nbsp; He also failed to resolve seasonably the pending incidents in Civil Cases Nos. AV-507, AV-689, and AV-1143.&nbsp; In sum, he failed to render decisions in thirteen (13) civil cases and to resolve the motions in three (3) other civil cases on time.<br><br>Section 15 (1), Article VIII of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>(1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.<br></blockquote>The office of a judge exacts nothing less than faithful observance of the Constitution and the law in the discharge of official duties.&nbsp; We agree with DCA Elepaño that the explanation proffered by Judge Llanos for his inability to dispose of thirteen (13) civil cases and motions in three (3) other civil cases is not satisfactory.<br><br>While we sympathize with Judge Llanos’ heavy caseload and his poor health, nonetheless, such factors cannot exonerate him from his administrative liability. They can only serve to mitigate the imposable penalty.<br><br>A judge must first seek from this Court an extension of the period within which to decide cases, without such extension, his failure to decide a case within the prescribed period constitutes gross inefficiency that warrants administrative sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Judge Llanos’ failure to render decisions and orders within the mandated period constitutes a violation of Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Our Administrative Circular No. 1, dated January 28, 1988, requires all magistrates to act promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before theirs courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> We cannot overstress this policy on prompt disposition or resolution of cases.&nbsp; Delay in case disposition is a major culprit in the erosion of public faith and confidence in the judiciary and the lowering of its standards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Thus, we find Judge Llanos guilty of gross inefficiency.&nbsp; But the recommended fine of P40,000.00 is, to our mind, too severe.<br><br>Under Section 9, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-100SC, gross inefficiency is a less serious charge punishable by suspension from office without <i>sala</i>ry and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months or a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As DCA Elepaño pointed out, Judge Llanos’ poor health and heavy workload during his final days on the bench may be considered as mitigating circumstances in imposing the penalty.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> retired Judge Epifanio C. Llanos is hereby found <b>GUILTY</b> of <b>GROSS INEFFICIENCY</b> and is <b>FINED</b> in the amount of Eleven Thousand Pesos (P11,000.00) to be deducted from the Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) we ordered withheld from his retirement benefits as per our Resolution dated October 9, 2002.&nbsp; The Chief of the Fiscal Management Office is <b>DIRECTED</b> to <b>IMMEDIATELY RELEASE</b> to retired Judge Llanos the remaining Thirty Nine Thousand Pesos (P39,000.00).<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Corona, Carpio-Morales</i>, and <i>Garcia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 1 Rollo, pp. 1-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 5-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Rollo at 19-20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Petallar v.
