				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Assailed in this petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> are the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals which set aside the December 22, 1998 order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of Judge Genis Balbuena of Branch 21, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Cebu City and ordered the transfer of Criminal Case No. CBU-45890 to Branch 9, RTC, Cebu City.<br><br>The antecedents follow.<br><br>On April 8, 1997, an information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for violation of paragraph 1, Article 189 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) was filed before Branch 21, RTC, Cebu City against petitioners Andrea Tan, Clarita Llamas, Victor Espina and Luisa Espina of Best Buy Mart, Inc. The information read:<br><blockquote>That on or about June 27, 1996 and sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, abovementioned accused, conspiring and mutually helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously distribute and sell counterfeit RAY BAN sunglasses bearing the appearance and trademark of RAY BAN in the aforesaid store wherein they have direct control, supervision and management thereby inducing the public to believe that these goods offered by them are those of RAY BAN to the damage and prejudice of BAUSCH AND LOMB, INC., the exclusive owner and user of trademark RAY BAN on sunglasses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>On January 21, 1998, respondent filed a motion to transfer the case to Branch 9, RTC, Cebu City. Administrative Order No. 113-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (A.O. No. 113-95) designated the said branch as the special court in Region VII to handle violations of intellectual property rights.<br><br>On March 2, 1998, petitioners filed a motion to quash<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the information on the ground that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the offense charged against them. The penalty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> provided by the RPC for the crime was within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC).<br><br>On March 6, 1998, respondent filed an opposition to the motion to quash,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> explaining that BP 129 had already transferred the exclusive jurisdiction to try and decide violations of intellectual property rights from the MTC and MTCC to the RTC and that the Supreme Court had also issued Administrative Order No. 104-96 (A.O. No. 104-96)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> deleting and withdrawing the designation of several branches of the MTC and MTCC as special intellectual property courts.<br><br>On December 22, 1998, the court a quo denied respondent's motion to transfer the case and granted petitioners' motion to quash. It ruled:<br><blockquote>Accused [wa]s charged for violation of Art. 189 of Revised Penal Code the penalty for which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prision correccional</span> in its minimum period or a fine ranging from P500.00 to P2,000.00, or both. Hence, within the jurisdiction of the metropolitan and municipal trial courts (Sec. 32(2), B.P. Blg. 129, as amended).<br><br>Administrative Orders Nos. 113-95 and 104-96, cited by plaintiff, cannot prevail over the express provisions of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended, jurisdiction of courts being a matter of substantive law.<br><br>If this Court has no jurisdiction over the case, the same is true with Branch 9 of the same court, Therefore, the motion to transfer the case to the latter should fail.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the motion to transfer is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">denied</span>, while the motion to quash is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">granted</span>. The case is thus <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dismissed</span>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Respondent received the order on January 21, 1999 but filed neither an appeal nor a motion for reconsideration. Rather, it filed a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in the Court of Appeals on March 23, 1999 or one (1) day beyond the period allowed in Section 4, Rule 65<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Respondent's procedural lapses notwithstanding, the appellate court gave due course to the petition and set aside the trial court order:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE, </span>the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GIVEN DUE COURSE</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>. The assailed Order of December 22, 1998 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">VACATED</span> and another is entered ordering the transfer of Crim. Case No. CBU-45890 to Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, and directing the public respondent to accordingly transmit the records thereof.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the present petition for review, centered on the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE PETITION OF RESPONDENT THAT IS FRAUGHT WITH FATAL INFIRMITIES.<br><br></li><li> THE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN REVERSING THE CORRECT RULING OF THE TRIAL COURT THAT THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE OFFENSE OF UNFAIR COMPETITION UNDER ARTICLE 189 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>There is no merit in the petition.<br><br>As to the first assigned error, petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred in giving due course to the petition for certiorari because respondent failed to appeal or file a motion for reconsideration of the trial court's order granting the motion to quash. Worse, respondent filed the petition in the appellate court one day after the reglementary period expired.<br><br>Needless to state, the acceptance of a petition for certiorari as well as the grant of due course thereto is, in general, addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Besides, the provisions of the Rules of Court, which are technical rules, may be relaxed in certain exceptional situations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Where a rigid application of the rule that certiorari cannot be a substitute for appeal will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, it is within our power to suspend the rules or exempt a particular case from its operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Under certain special circumstances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> a petition for certiorari may be given due course notwithstanding that no motion for reconsideration was filed in the lower court. The exception applies in this case since the order of the trial court was, as will be discussed later, a patent nullity.<br><br>Likewise, the one-day delay in the filing of the petition may be excused on the basis of equity to afford respondent the chance to prove the merits of the complaint.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Yao v. Court of Appeals,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote>In the interest of substantial justice, procedural rules of the most mandatory character in terms of compliance may be relaxed. In other words, if strict adherence to the letter of the law would result in absurdity and manifest injustice or where the merit of a party's cause is apparent and outweighs consideration of non-compliance with certain formal requirements, procedural rules should definitely be liberally construed. A party-litigant is to be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on mere technicalities.</blockquote>Hence, the only relevant issue left for our resolution is whether or not the jurisdiction over the crime allegedly committed by petitioners is vested on the RTC.<br><br>Section 5 (5) of the 1987 Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure in all courts. The limitations to this rule-making power are the following: the rules must (a) provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases; (b) be uniform for all courts of the same grade and (c) not diminish, increase or modify substantive rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As long as these limits are met, the argument used by petitioners that the Supreme Court, through A.O. Nos. 113-95 and 104-96, transgressed on Congress' sole power to legislate, cannot be sustained.<br><br>A.O. No. 113-95 designated special intellectual property courts to promote the efficient administration of justice and to ensure the speedy disposition of intellectual property cases.<br><br>A.O. No. 104-96,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> on the other hand, was issued pursuant to Section 23 of BP 129<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which transferred the jurisdiction over such crimes from the MTC and MTCC to the RTC and which furthermore gave the Supreme Court the authority to designate certain branches of the RTC to exclusively handle special cases in the interest of the speedy and efficient administration of justice. Accordingly, the RTC was vested with the exclusive and original jurisdiction to try and decide intellectual property cases.<br><br>The transfer of jurisdiction from the MTC and MTCC to the RTC did not in any way affect the substantive rights of petitioners. The administrative orders did not change the definition or scope of the crime of unfair competition with which petitioners were charged.<br><br>Both administrative orders therefore have the force and effect of law, having been validly issued by the Supreme Court in the exercise of its constitutional rule-making power. The trial court, being a subordinate court, should have followed the mandate of the later A.O. 104-96 which vested jurisdiction over the instant case on the RTC. Thus, the appellate court correctly found that the court a quo committed grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Furthermore, the order of the trial court was a patent nullity. In resolving the pending incidents of the motion to transfer and motion to quash, the trial court should not have allowed petitioners to collaterally attack the validity of A.O. Nos. 113-95 and 104-96. We have ruled time and again that the constitutionality or validity of laws, orders, or such other rules with the force of law cannot be attacked collaterally. There is a legal presumption of validity of these laws and rules. Unless a law or rule is annulled in a direct proceeding, the legal presumption of its validity stands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The trial court's order was consequently null and void.<br><br>The transfer of this case to Branch 9, RTC, Cebu City, however, is no longer possible. A.M. No. 03-03-03-SC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> consolidated the intellectual property courts and commercial SEC courts in one RTC branch in a particular locality to streamline the court structure and to promote expediency. The RTC branch so designated will try and decide cases involving violations of intellectual property rights, and cases formerly cognizable by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is now called a special commercial court. In Region VII, the designated special commercial court is Branch 11, RTC, Cebu City. The transfer of this case to that court is therefore warranted.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the Court of Appeals decision dated October 20, 2000 is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODIFICATION</span> that Criminal Case No. CBU-45890 shall be transferred to Branch 11, RTC, Cebu City. Let the records of the case be transmitted thereto and the case tried and decided with dispatch.<br><br>Costs against petitioners.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio-Morales,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Roberto A.
