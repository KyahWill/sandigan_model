In the absence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstance and it appearing that the accused is not disqualified from enjoying the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby sentences said accused JESUS MACAPAL, JR. y JACA to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffer an indefinite prison term of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of Reclusion Temporal as minimum to Reclusion Perpetua as maximum</span>.
