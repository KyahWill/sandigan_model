ERMITA, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS (DOTC), AND THE MANILA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY (MIAA), PETITIONERS, VS. HON. HENRICK F.

				<BR><STRONG>TINGA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminal III (NAIA 3) was conceived, designed and constructed to serve as the country's show window to the world. Regrettably, it has spawned controversies. Regrettably too, despite the apparent completion of the terminal complex way back it has not yet been operated. This has caused immeasurable economic damage to the country, not to mention its deplorable discredit in the international community.<br><br>In the first case that reached this Court, <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan v. PIATCO</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the contracts which the Government had with the contractor were voided for being contrary to law and public policy. The second case now before the Court involves the matter of just compensation due the contractor for the terminal complex it built. We decide the case on the basis of fairness, the same norm that pervades both the Court's 2004 Resolution in the first case and the latest expropriation law.<br><br>The present controversy has its roots with the promulgation of the Court's decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan v. PIATCO</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> promulgated in 2003 (2003 Decision). This decision nullified the "Concession Agreement for the Build-Operate-and-Transfer Arrangement of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminal III" entered into between the Philippine Government (Government) and the Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (PIATCO), as well as the amendments and supplements thereto. The agreement had authorized PIATCO to build a new international airport terminal (NAIA 3), as well as a franchise to operate and maintain the said terminal during the concession period of 25 years. The contracts were nullified, among others, that Paircargo Consortium, predecessor of PIATCO, did not possess the requisite financial capacity when it was awarded the NAIA 3 contract and that the agreement was contrary to public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>At the time of the promulgation of the 2003 Decision, the NAIA 3 facilities had already been built by PIATCO and were nearing completion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> However, the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> was silent as to the legal status of the NAIA 3 facilities following the nullification of the contracts, as well as whatever rights of PIATCO for reimbursement for its expenses in the construction of the facilities. Still, in his Separate Opinion, Justice Panganiban, joined by Justice Callejo, declared as follows:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Should government pay at all for reasonable expenses incurred in the construction of the Terminal? Indeed it should, otherwise it will be unjustly enriching itself at the expense of Piatco and, in particular, its funders, contractors and investors </span>â€”<span style="font-weight: bold;"> both local and foreign.</span> After all, there is no question that the State needs and will make use of Terminal III, it being part and parcel of the critical infrastructure and transportation-related programs of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>PIATCO and several respondents-intervenors filed their respective motions for the reconsideration of the 2003 Decision. These motions were denied by the Court in its <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 21 January 2004 (2004 Resolution).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> However, the Court this time squarely addressed the issue of the rights of PIATCO to refund, compensation or reimbursement for its expenses in the construction of the NAIA 3 facilities. The holding of the Court on this crucial point follows:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">This Court, however, is not unmindful of the reality that the structures comprising the NAIA IPT III facility are almost complete and that funds have been spent by PIATCO in their construction. For the government to take over the said facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as builder of the said structures. The compensation must be just and in accordance with law and equity for the government can not unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>After the promulgation of the rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan,</span> the NAIA 3 facilities have remained in the possession of PIATCO, despite the avowed intent of the Government to put the airport terminal into immediate operation. The Government and PIATCO conducted several rounds of negotiation regarding the NAIA 3 facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It also appears that arbitral proceedings were commenced before the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> although the Government has raised jurisdictional questions before those two bodies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Then, on 21 December 2004, the Government<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> for expropriation with the Pasay City Regional Trial Court (RTC), together with an <span style="font-style: italic;">Application for Special Raffle</span> seeking the immediate holding of a special raffle. The Government sought upon the filing of the complaint the issuance of a writ of possession authorizing it to take immediate possession and control over the NAIA 3 facilities.<br><br>The Government also declared that it had deposited the amount of P3,002,125,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (3 Billion)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in Cash with the Land Bank of the Philippines, representing the NAIA 3 terminal's assessed value for taxation purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> was raffled to Branch 117 of the Pasay City RTC, presided by respondent judge Hon. Henrick F. Gingoyon (Hon. Gingoyon). On the same day that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint </span>was filed, the RTC issued an <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> directing the issuance of a writ of possession to the Government, authorizing it to "take or enter upon the possession" of the NAIA 3 facilities. Citing the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Manila v. Serrano,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the RTC noted that it had the ministerial duty to issue the writ of possession upon the filing of a complaint for expropriation sufficient in form and substance, and upon deposit made by the government of the amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property subject to expropriation. The RTC found these requisites present, particularly noting that "[t]he case record shows that [the Government has] deposited the assessed value of the [NAIA 3 facilities] in the Land Bank of the Philippines, an authorized depositary, as shown by the certification attached to their complaint." Also on the same day, the RTC issued a <span style="font-style: italic;">Writ of Possession.</span> According to PIATCO, the Government was able to take possession over the NAIA 3 facilities immediately after the <span style="font-style: italic;">Writ of Possession</span> was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>However, on 4 January 2005, the RTC issued another <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> designed to supplement its 21 December 2004 Order and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Writ of Possession</span>. In the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span>, now assailed in the present petition, the RTC noted that its earlier issuance of its writ of possession was pursuant to Section 2, Rule 67 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. However, it was observed that Republic Act No. 8974 (Rep. Act No. 8974), otherwise known as "An Act to Facilitate the Acquisition of Right-of-Way, Site or Location for National Government Infrastructure Projects and For Other Purposes" and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (Implementing Rules) had amended Rule 67 in many respects.<br><br>There are at least two crucial differences between the respective procedures under Rep. Act No. 8974 and Rule 67. Under the statute, the Government is required to make immediate payment to the property owner upon the filing of the complaint to be entitled to a writ of possession, whereas in Rule 67, the Government is required only to make an initial deposit with an authorized government depositary. Moreover, Rule 67 prescribes that the initial deposit be equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation, unlike Rep. Act No. 8974 which provides, as the relevant standard for initial compensation, the market value of the property as stated in the tax declaration or the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), whichever is higher, and the value of the improvements and/or structures using the replacement cost method.<br><br>Accordingly, on the basis of Sections 4 and 7 of Rep. Act No. 8974 and Section 10 of the Implementing Rules, the RTC made key qualifications to its earlier issuances. <span style="font-style: italic;">First,</span> it directed the Land Bank of the Philippines, Baclaran Branch (LBP-Baclaran), to immediately release the amount of US$62,343,175.77 to PIATCO, an amount which the RTC characterized as that which the Government "specifically made available for the purpose of this expropriation;" and such amount to be deducted from the amount of just compensation due PIATCO as eventually determined by the RTC. <span style="font-style: italic;">Second,</span> the Government was directed to submit to the RTC a Certificate of Availability of Funds signed by authorized officials to cover the payment of just compensation. <span style="font-style: italic;">Third,</span> the Government was directed "to maintain, preserve and safeguard" the NAIA 3 facilities or "perform such as acts or activities in preparation for their direct operation" of the airport terminal, pending expropriation proceedings and full payment of just compensation. However, the Government was prohibited "from performing acts of ownership like awarding concessions or leasing any part of [NAIA 3] to other parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The very next day after the issuance of the assailed 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span>, the Government filed an <span style="font-style: italic;">Urgent Motion for Reconsideration</span>, which was set for hearing on 10 January 2005. On 7 January 2005, the RTC issued another <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span>, the second now assailed before this Court, which appointed three (3) Commissioners to ascertain the amount of just compensation for the NAIA 3 Complex. That same day, the Government filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Inhibition</span> of Hon. Gingoyon.<br><br>The RTC heard the <span style="font-style: italic;">Urgent Motion for Reconsideration</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Inhibition</span> on 10 January 2005. On the same day, it denied these motions in an <span style="font-style: italic;">Omnibus</span> Order dated 10 January 2005. This is the third <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> now assailed before this Court. Nonetheless, while the <span style="font-style: italic;">Omnibus Order</span> affirmed the earlier dispositions in the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span>, it excepted from affirmance "the superfluous part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> prohibiting the plaintiffs from awarding concessions or leasing any part of [NAIA 3] to other parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Thus, the present <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition</span> under Rule 65 was filed on 13 January 2005. The petition prayed for the nullification of the RTC orders dated 4 January 2005, 7 January 2005, and 10 January 2005, and for the inhibition of Hon. Gingoyon from taking further action on the expropriation case. A concurrent prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction was granted by this Court in a <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 14 January 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Government, in imputing grave abuse of discretion to the acts of Hon. Gingoyon, raises five general arguments, to wit:<br><br>(i) that Rule 67, not Rep. Act No. 8974, governs the present expropriation proceedings;<br><br>(ii) that Hon. Gingoyon erred when he ordered the immediate release of the amount of US$62.3 Million to PIATCO considering that the assessed value as alleged in the complaint was only P3 Billion;<br><br>(iii) that the RTC could not have prohibited the Government from enjoining the performance of acts of ownership;<br><br>(iv) that the appointment of the three commissioners was erroneous; and<br><br>(v) that Hon. Gingoyon should be compelled to inhibit himself from the expropriation case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Before we delve into the merits of the issues raised by the Government, it is essential to consider the crucial holding of the Court in its 2004 Resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan,</span> which we repeat below:<br><blockquote>This Court, however, is not unmindful of the reality that the structures comprising the NAIA IPT III facility are almost complete and that funds have been spent by PIATCO in their construction. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the government to take over the said facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as builder of the said structures. The compensation must be just and in accordance with law and equity for the government can not unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>This pronouncement contains the fundamental premises which permeate this decision of the Court. Indeed, <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan,</span> final and executory as it is, stands as governing law in this case, and any disposition of the present petition must conform to the conditions laid down by the Court in its 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution.</span><br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The 2004 Resolution Which Is</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Law of This Case Generally</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Permits Expropriation</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The pronouncement in the 2004 Resolution is especially significant to this case in two aspects, namely: (i) that PIATCO must receive payment of just compensation determined in accordance with law and equity; and (ii) that the government is barred from taking over NAIA 3 until such just compensation is paid.</span> The parties cannot be allowed to evade the directives laid down by this Court through any mode of judicial action, such as the complaint for eminent domain.<br><br>It cannot be denied though that the Court in the 2004 Resolution prescribed mandatory guidelines which the Government must observe before it could acquire the NAIA 3 facilities. Thus, the actions of respondent judge under review, as well as the arguments of the parties must, to merit affirmation, pass the threshold test of whether such propositions are in accord with the 2004 Resolution.<br><br>The Government does not contest the efficacy of this pronouncement in the 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> thus its application to the case at bar is not a matter of controversy. Of course, questions such as what is the standard of "just compensation" and which particular laws and equitable principles are applicable, remain in dispute and shall be resolved forthwith.<br><br>The Government has chosen to resort to expropriation, a remedy available under the law, which has the added benefit of an integrated process for the determination of just compensation and the payment thereof to PIATCO. We appreciate that the case at bar is a highly unusual case, whereby the Government seeks to expropriate a building complex constructed on land which the State already owns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> There is an inherent illogic in the resort to eminent domain on property already owned by the State. At first blush, since the State already owns the property on which NAIA 3 stands, the proper remedy should be akin to an action for ejectment.<br><br>However, the reason for the resort by the Government to expropriation proceedings is understandable in this case. The 2004 Resolution, in requiring the payment of just compensation prior to the takeover by the Government of NAIA 3, effectively precluded it from acquiring possession or ownership of the NAIA 3 through the unilateral exercise of its rights as the owner of the ground on which the facilities stood. Thus, as things stood after the 2004 Resolution, the right of the Government to take over the NAIA 3 terminal was preconditioned by lawful order on the payment of just compensation to PIATCO as builder of the structures.<br><br>The determination of just compensation could very well be agreed upon by the parties without judicial intervention, and it appears that steps towards that direction had been engaged in. Still, ultimately, the Government resorted to its inherent power of eminent domain through expropriation proceedings. Is eminent domain appropriate in the first place, with due regard not only to the law on expropriation but also to the Court's 2004 Resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan?</span><br><br>The right of eminent domain extends to personal and real property, and the NAIA 3 structures, adhered as they are to the soil, are considered as real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The public purpose for the expropriation is also beyond dispute. It should also be noted that Section 1 of Rule 67 (on Expropriation) recognizes the possibility that the property sought to be expropriated may be titled in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, although occupied by private individuals, and in such case an averment to that effect should be made in the complaint. The instant expropriation complaint did aver that the NAIA 3 complex "stands on a parcel of land owned by the Bases Conversion Development Authority, another agency of [the Republic of the Philippines]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Admittedly, eminent domain is not the sole judicial recourse by which the Government may have acquired the NAIA 3 facilities while satisfying the requisites in the 2004 Resolution. Eminent domain though may be the most effective, as well as the speediest means by which such goals may be accomplished. Not only does it enable immediate possession after satisfaction of the requisites under the law, it also has a built-in procedure through which just compensation may be ascertained. Thus, there should be no question as to the propriety of eminent domain proceedings in this case.<br><br>Still, in applying the laws and rules on expropriation in the case at bar, we are impelled to apply or construe these rules in accordance with the Court's prescriptions in the 2004 Resolution to achieve the end effect that the Government may validly take over the NAIA 3 facilities. Insofar as this case is concerned, the 2004 Resolution is effective not only as a legal precedent, but as the source of rights and prescriptions that must be guaranteed, if not enforced, in the resolution of this petition. Otherwise, the integrity and efficacy of the rulings of this Court will be severely diminished.<br><br>It is from these premises that we resolve the first question, whether Rule 67 of the Rules of Court or Rep. Act No. 8974 governs the expropriation proceedings in this case.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Application of Rule 67 Violates</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">the 2004 Agan Resolution</span><br><br>The Government insists that Rule 67 of the Rules of Court governs the expropriation proceedings in this case to the exclusion of all other laws. On the other hand, PIATCO claims that it is Rep. Act No. 8974 which does apply. Earlier, we had adverted to the basic differences between the statute and the procedural rule. Further elaboration is in order.<br><br>Rule 67 outlines the procedure under which eminent domain may be exercised by the Government. Yet by no means does it serve at present as the solitary guideline through which the State may expropriate private property. For example, Section 19 of the Local Government Code governs as to the exercise by local government units of the power of eminent domain through an enabling ordinance. And then there is Rep. Act No. 8974, which covers expropriation proceedings intended for national government infrastructure projects.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974, which provides for a procedure eminently more favorable to the property owner than Rule 67, inescapably applies in instances when the national government expropriates property "for national government infrastructure projects."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thus, if expropriation is engaged in by the national government for purposes other than national infrastructure projects, the assessed value standard and the deposit mode prescribed in Rule 67 continues to apply.<br><br>Under both Rule 67 and Rep. Act No. 8974, the Government commences expropriation proceedings through the filing of a complaint. Unlike in the case of local governments which necessitate an authorizing ordinance before expropriation may be accomplished, there is no need under Rule 67 or Rep. Act No. 8974 for legislative authorization before the Government may proceed with a particular exercise of eminent domain. The most crucial difference between Rule 67 and Rep. Act No. 8974 concerns the particular essential step the Government has to undertake to be entitled to a writ of possession.<br><br>The first paragraph of Section 2 of Rule 67 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value with authorized government depository. â€” Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon the possession of the real property involved if <span style="font-weight: bold;">he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand to the authorized government depositary</span>.</blockquote>In contrast, Section 4 of Rep. Act No. 8974 relevantly states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></span>â€” Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property for the right-of-way, site or location for any national government infrastructure project through expropriation, the appropriate proceedings before the proper court under the following guidelines:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Upon the filing of the complaint, and after due notice to the defendant, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property the amount equivalent to the sum of (1) one hundred percent (100%) of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR); and (2) the value of the improvements and/or structures as determined under Section 7 hereof;<br><br>. . .<br><br>c) In case the completion of a government infrastructure project is of utmost urgency and importance, and there is no existing valuation of the area concerned, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property its proffered value taking into consideration the standards prescribed in Section 5 hereof.<br></div><br>Upon completion with the guidelines abovementioned, the court shall immediately issue to the implementing agency an order to take possession of the property and start the implementation of the project.<br><br>Before the court can issue a Writ of Possession, the implementing agency shall present to the court a certificate of availability of funds from the proper official concerned.<br><br>. . .</blockquote>As can be gleaned from the above-quoted texts, Rule 67 merely requires the Government to deposit with an authorized government depositary the assessed value of the property for expropriation for it to be entitled to a writ of possession. On the other hand, Rep. Act No. 8974 requires that the Government make a direct payment to the property owner before the writ may issue. Moreover, such payment is based on the zonal valuation of the BIR in the case of land, the value of the improvements or structures under the replacement cost method,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or if no such valuation is available and in cases of utmost urgency, the proffered value of the property to be seized.<br><br>It is quite apparent why the Government would prefer to apply Rule 67 in lieu of Rep. Act No. 8974. Under Rule 67, it would not be obliged to immediately pay any amount to PIATCO before it can obtain the writ of possession since all it need do is deposit the amount equivalent to the assessed value with an authorized government depositary. Hence, it devotes considerable effort to point out that Rep. Act No. 8974 does not apply in this case, notwithstanding the undeniable reality that NAIA 3 is a national government project. Yet, these efforts fail, especially considering the controlling effect of the 2004 Resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> on the adjudication of this case.<br><br>It is the finding of this Court that the staging of expropriation proceedings in this case with the exclusive use of Rule 67 would allow for the Government to take over the NAIA 3 facilities in a fashion that directly rebukes our 2004 Resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan.</span> This Court cannot sanction deviation from its own final and executory orders.<br><br>Section 2 of Rule 67 provides that the State "shall have the right to take or enter upon the possession of the real property involved if [the plaintiff] deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is thus apparent that under the provision, all the Government need do to obtain a writ of possession is to deposit the amount equivalent to the assessed value with an authorized government depositary.<br><br>Would the deposit under Section 2 of Rule 67 satisfy the requirement laid down in the 2004 Resolution that "[f]or the government to take over the said facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as builder of the said structures"? Evidently not.<br><br>If Section 2 of Rule 67 were to apply, PIATCO would be enjoined from receiving a single centavo as just compensation before the Government takes over the NAIA 3 facility by virtue of a writ of possession. Such an injunction squarely contradicts the letter and intent of the 2004 Resolution. Hence, the position of the Government sanctions its own disregard or violation the prescription laid down by this Court that there must first be just compensation paid to PIATCO before the Government may take over the NAIA 3 facilities.<br><br>Thus, at the very least, Rule 67 cannot apply in this case without violating the 2004 Resolution. Even assuming that Rep. Act No. 8974 does not govern in this case, it does not necessarily follow that Rule 67 should then apply. After all, adherence to the letter of Section 2, Rule 67 would in turn violate the Court's requirement in the 2004 Resolution that there must first be payment of just compensation to PIATCO before the Government may take over the property.<br><br>It is the plain intent of Rep. Act No. 8974 to supersede the system of deposit under Rule 67 with the scheme of "immediate payment" in cases involving national government infrastructure projects. The following portion of the Senate deliberations, cited by PIATCO in its Memorandum, is worth quoting to cogitate on the purpose behind the plain meaning of the law:<br><blockquote>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN. CAYETANO). "x x x <span style="font-weight: bold;">Because the Senate believes that, you know, we have to pay the landowners immediately not by treasury bills but by cash.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Since we are depriving them, you know, upon payment, 'no, of possession, we might as well pay them as much, 'no, hindi lang 50 percent.</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x<br></div><br>THE CHAIRMAN (REP. VERGARA). Accepted.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x<br></div><br>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN. CAYETANO). Oo. Because this is really in favor of the landowners, e.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN (REP. VERGARA). That's why we need to really secure the availability of funds.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x<br></div><br>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN. CAYETANO). <span style="font-weight: bold;">No, no. It's the same. It says here: iyong first paragraph, diba? Iyong zonal â€“ talagang magbabayad muna. In other words, you know, there must be a payment kaagad.</span> (TSN, Bicameral Conference on the Disagreeing Provisions of House Bill 1422 and Senate Bill 2117, August 29, 2000, pp. 14-20)<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x<br></div><br>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN. CAYETANO).<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Okay, okay, "no. Unang-una, it is not deposit, 'no. It's payment."</span><br><br>REP. BATERINA. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It's payment, ho, payment." </span>(Id., p. 63)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>It likewise bears noting that the appropriate standard of just compensation is a substantive matter. It is well within the province of the legislature to fix the standard, which it did through the enactment of Rep. Act No. 8974. Specifically, this prescribes the new standards in determining the amount of just compensation in expropriation cases relating to national government infrastructure projects, as well as the manner of payment thereof. At the same time, Section 14 of the Implementing Rules recognizes the continued applicability of Rule 67 on procedural aspects when it provides "all matters regarding defenses and objections to the complaint, issues on uncertain ownership and conflicting claims, effects of appeal on the rights of the parties, and such other incidents affecting the complaint shall be resolved under the provisions on expropriation of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Given that the 2004 Resolution militates against the continued use of the norm under Section 2, Rule 67, is it then possible to apply Rep. Act No. 8974? We find that it is, and moreover, its application in this case complements rather than contravenes the prescriptions laid down in the 2004 Resolution.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rep. Act No. 8974 Fits</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">to the Situation at Bar</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">and Complements the</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">2004 Agan Resolution</span><br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974 is entitled "An Act To Facilitate The Acquisition Of Right-Of-Way, Site Or Location For National Government Infrastructure Projects And For Other Purposes." Obviously, the law is intended to cover expropriation proceedings intended for national government infrastructure projects. Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 8974 explains what are considered as "national government projects."<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <span style="font-style: italic;">National Government Projects.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">â€“</span> The term "national government projects" shall refer to all national government infrastructure, engineering works and service contracts, including projects undertaken by government-owned and controlled corporations, all projects covered by Republic Act No. 6957, as amended by Republic Act No. 7718, otherwise known as the Build-Operate-and-Transfer Law, and other related and necessary activities, such as site acquisition, supply and/or installation of equipment and materials, implementation, construction, completion, operation, maintenance, improvement, repair and rehabilitation, regardless of the source of funding.</blockquote>As acknowledged in the 2003 Decision, the development of NAIA 3 was made pursuant to a build-operate-and-transfer arrangement pursuant to Republic Act No. 6957, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which pertains to infrastructure or development projects normally financed by the public sector but which are now wholly or partly implemented by the private sector.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Under the build-operate-and-transfer scheme, it is the project proponent which undertakes the construction, including the financing, of a given infrastructure facility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Tatad v. Garcia,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court acknowledged that the operator of the EDSA Light Rail Transit project under a BOT scheme was the owner of the facilities such as "the rail tracks, rolling stocks like the coaches, rail stations, terminals and the power plant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>There can be no doubt that PIATCO has ownership rights over the facilities which it had financed and constructed. The 2004 Resolution squarely recognized that right when it mandated the payment of just compensation to PIATCO prior to the takeover by the Government of NAIA 3. The fact that the Government resorted to eminent domain proceedings in the first place is a concession on its part of PIATCO's ownership. Indeed, if no such right is recognized, then there should be no impediment for the Government to seize control of NAIA 3 through ordinary ejectment proceedings.<br><br>Since the rights of PIATCO over the NAIA 3 facilities are established, the nature of these facilities should now be determined. Under Section 415(1) of the Civil Code, these facilities are ineluctably immovable or real property, as they constitute buildings, roads and constructions of all kinds adhered to the soil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Certainly, the NAIA 3 facilities are of such nature that they cannot just be packed up and transported by PIATCO like a traveling circus caravan.<br><br>Thus, the property subject of expropriation, the NAIA 3 facilities, are real property owned by PIATCO. This point is critical, considering the Government's insistence that the NAIA 3 facilities cannot be deemed as the "right-of-way", "site" or "location" of a national government infrastructure project, within the coverage of Rep. Act No. 8974.<br><br>There is no doubt that the NAIA 3 is not, under any sensible contemplation, a "right-of-way." Yet we cannot agree with the Government's insistence that neither could NAIA 3 be a "site" or "location". The petition quotes the definitions provided in Black's Law Dictionary of "location'" as the specific place or position of a person or thing and "site" as pertaining to a place or location or a piece of property set aside for specific use.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Yet even Black's Law Dictionary provides that "[t]he term [site] does not of itself necessarily mean a place or tract of land fixed by definite boundaries."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> One would assume that the Government, to back up its contention, would be able to point to a clear-cut rule that a "site" or "location" exclusively refers to soil, grass, pebbles and weeds. There is none.<br><br>Indeed, we cannot accept the Government's proposition that the only properties that may be expropriated under Rep. Act No. 8974 are parcels of land. Rep. Act No. 8974 contemplates within its coverage such real property constituting land, buildings, roads and constructions of all kinds adhered to the soil. Section 1 of Rep. Act No. 8974, which sets the declaration of the law's policy, refers to "real property acquired for national government infrastructure projects are promptly paid just compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Section 4 is quite explicit in stating that the scope of the law relates to the acquisition of "real property," which under civil law includes buildings, roads and constructions adhered to the soil.<br><br>It is moreover apparent that the law and its implementing rules commonly provide for a rule for the valuation of improvements and/or structures thereupon separate from that of the land on which such are constructed. Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 8974 itself recognizes that the improvements or structures on the land may very well be the subject of expropriation proceedings. Section 4(a), in relation to Section 7 of the law provides for the guidelines for the valuation of the improvements or structures to be expropriated. Indeed, nothing in the law would prohibit the application of Section 7, which provides for the valuation method of the improvements and or structures in the instances wherein it is necessary for the Government to expropriate only the improvements or structures, as in this case.<br><br>The law classifies the NAIA 3 facilities as real properties just like the soil to which they are adhered. Any sub-classifications of real property and divergent treatment based thereupon for purposes of expropriation must be based on substantial distinctions, otherwise the equal protection clause of the Constitution is violated. There may be perhaps a molecular distinction between soil and the inorganic improvements adhered thereto, yet there are no purposive distinctions that would justify a variant treatment for purposes of expropriation. Both the land itself and the improvements thereupon are susceptible to private ownership independent of each other, capable of pecuniary estimation, and if taken from the owner, considered as a deprivation of property. The owner of improvements seized through expropriation suffers the same degree of loss as the owner of land seized through similar means. Equal protection demands that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed. For purposes of expropriation, parcels of land are similarly situated as the buildings or improvements constructed thereon, and a disparate treatment between those two classes of real property infringes the equal protection clause.<br><br>Even as the provisions of Rep. Act No. 8974 call for that law's application in this case, the threshold test must still be met whether its implementation would conform to the dictates of the Court in the 2004 Resolution. Unlike in the case of Rule 67, the application of Rep. Act No. 8974 will not contravene the 2004 Resolution, which requires the payment of just compensation before any takeover of the NAIA 3 facilities by the Government. The 2004 Resolution does not particularize the extent such payment must be effected before the takeover, but it unquestionably requires at least some degree of payment to the private property owner before a writ of possession may issue. The utilization of Rep. Act No. 8974 guarantees compliance with this bare minimum requirement, as it assures the private property owner the payment of, at the very least, the proffered value of the property to be seized. Such payment of the proffered value to the owner, followed by the issuance of the writ of possession in favor of the Government, is precisely the schematic under Rep. Act No. 8974, one which facially complies with the prescription laid down in the 2004 Resolution.<br><br>Clearly then, we see no error on the part of the RTC when it ruled that Rep. Act No. 8974 governs the instant expropriation proceedings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Proper Amount to be Paid</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">under Rep. Act No. 8974</span><br><br>Then, there is the matter of the proper amount which should be paid to PIATCO by the Government before the writ of possession may issue, consonant to Rep. Act No. 8974.<br><br>At this juncture, we must address the observation made by the Office of the Solicitor General in behalf of the Government that there could be no "BIR zonal valuations" on the NAIA 3 facility, as provided in Rep. Act No. 8974, since zonal valuations are only for parcels of land, not for airport terminals. The Court agrees with this point, yet does not see it as an impediment for the application of Rep. Act No. 8974.<br><br>It must be clarified that PIATCO cannot be reimbursed or justly compensated for the value of the parcel of land on which NAIA 3 stands. PIATCO is not the owner of the land on which the NAIA 3 facility is constructed, and it should not be entitled to just compensation that is inclusive of the value of the land itself. It would be highly disingenuous to compensate PIATCO for the value of land it does not own. Its entitlement to just compensation should be limited to the value of the improvements and/or structures themselves. Thus, the determination of just compensation cannot include the BIR zonal valuation under Section 4 of Rep. Act No. 8974.<br><br>Under Rep. Act No. 8974, the Government is required to "immediately pay" the owner of the property the amount equivalent to the sum of (1) one hundred percent (100%) of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the [BIR]; and (2) the value of the improvements and/or structures as determined under Section 7. As stated above, the BIR zonal valuation cannot apply in this case, thus the amount subject to immediate payment should be limited to "the value of the improvements and/or structures as determined under Section 7," with Section 7 referring to the "implementing rules and regulations for the equitable valuation of the improvements and/or structures on the land." Under the present implementing rules in place, the valuation of the improvements/structures are to be based using "the replacement cost method."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, the replacement cost is only one of the factors to be considered in determining the just compensation.<br><br>In addition to Rep. Act No. 8974, the 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> also mandated that the payment of just compensation should be in accordance with equity as well. Thus, in ascertaining the ultimate amount of just compensation, the duty of the trial court is to ensure that such amount conforms not only to the law, such as Rep. Act No. 8974, but to principles of equity as well.<br><br>Admittedly, there is no way, at least for the present, to immediately ascertain the value of the improvements and structures since such valuation is a matter for factual determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Yet Rep. Act No. 8974 permits an expedited means by which the Government can immediately take possession of the property without having to await precise determination of the valuation. Section 4(c) of Rep. Act No. 8974 states that "in case the completion of a government infrastructure project is of utmost urgency and importance, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and there is no existing valuation of the area concerned</span>, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property its <span style="font-weight: bold;">proferred value,</span> taking into consideration the standards prescribed in Section 5 [of the law]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The "proffered value" may strike as a highly subjective standard based solely on the intuition of the government, but Rep. Act No. 8974 does provide relevant standards by which "proffered value" should be based,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> as well as the certainty of judicial determination of the propriety of the proffered value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In filing the complaint for expropriation, the Government alleged to have deposited the amount of P3 Billion earmarked for expropriation, representing the assessed value of the property. The making of the deposit, including the determination of the amount of the deposit, was undertaken under the erroneous notion that Rule 67, and not Rep. Act No. 8974, is the applicable law. Still, as regards the amount, the Court sees no impediment to recognize this sum of P3 Billion as the proffered value under Section 4(b) of Rep. Act No. 8974. After all, in the initial determination of the proffered value, the Government is not strictly required to adhere to any predetermined standards, although its proffered value may later be subjected to judicial review using the standards enumerated under Section 5 of Rep. Act No. 8974.<br><br>How should we appreciate the questioned order of Hon. Gingoyon, which pegged the amount to be immediately paid to PIATCO at around $62.3 Million? The <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> dated 4 January 2005, which mandated such amount, proves problematic in that regard. While the initial sum of P3 Billion may have been based on the assessed value, a standard which should not however apply in this case, the RTC cites without qualification Section 4(a) of Rep. Act No. 8974 as the basis for the amount of $62.3 Million, thus leaving the impression that the BIR zonal valuation may form part of the basis for just compensation, which should not be the case. Moreover, respondent judge made no attempt to apply the enumerated guidelines for determination of just compensation under Section 5 of Rep. Act No. 8974, as required for judicial review of the proffered value.<br><br>The Court notes that in the 10 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Omnibus Order,</span> the RTC noted that the concessions agreement entered into between the Government and PIATCO stated that the actual cost of building NAIA 3 was "not less than" US$350 Million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The RTC then proceeded to observe that while Rep. Act No. 8974 required the immediate payment to PIATCO the amount equivalent to 100% of the value of NAIA 3, the amount deposited by the Government constituted only 18% of this value. At this point, no binding import should be given to this observation that the actual cost of building NAIA 3 was "not less than" US$350 Million, as the final conclusions on the amount of just compensation can come only after due ascertainment in accordance with the standards set under Rep. Act No. 8974, not the declarations of the parties. At the same time, the expressed linkage between the BIR zonal valuation and the amount of just compensation in this case, is revelatory of erroneous thought on the part of the RTC.<br><br>We have already pointed out the irrelevance of the BIR zonal valuation as an appropriate basis for valuation in this case, PIATCO not being the owner of the land on which the NAIA 3 facilities stand. The subject order is flawed insofar as it fails to qualify that such standard is inappropriate.<br><br>It does appear that the amount of US$62.3 Million was based on the certification issued by the LBP-Baclaran that the Republic of the Philippines maintained a total balance in that branch amounting to such amount. Yet the actual representation of the $62.3 Million is not clear. The Land Bank Certification expressing such amount does state that it was issued upon request of the Manila International Airport Authority "purportedly as guaranty deposit for the expropriation complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The Government claims in its Memorandum that the entire amount was made available as a guaranty fund for the final and executory judgment of the trial court, and not merely for the issuance of the writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> One could readily conclude that the entire amount of US$62.3 Million was intended by the Government to answer for whatever guaranties may be required for the purpose of the expropriation complaint.<br><br>Still, such intention the Government may have had as to the entire US$62.3 Million is only inferentially established. In ascertaining the proffered value adduced by the Government, the amount of P3 Billion as the amount deposited characterized in the complaint as "to be held by [Land Bank] subject to the [RTC's] orders,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> should be deemed as controlling. There is no clear evidence that the Government intended to offer US$62.3 Million as the initial payment of just compensation, the wording of the Land Bank Certification notwithstanding, and credence should be given to the consistent position of the Government on that aspect.<br><br>In any event, for the RTC to be able to justify the payment of US$62.3 Million to PIATCO and not P3 Billion Pesos, he would have to establish that the higher amount represents the valuation of the structures/improvements, and not the BIR zonal valuation on the land wherein NAIA 3 is built. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> dated 5 January 2005 fails to establish such integral fact, and in the absence of contravening proof, the proffered value of P3 Billion, as presented by the Government, should prevail.<br><br>Strikingly, the Government submits that assuming that Rep. Act No. 8974 is applicable, the deposited amount of P3 Billion should be considered as the proffered value, since the amount was based on comparative values made by the City Assessor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Accordingly, it should be deemed as having faithfully complied with the requirements of the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> While the Court agrees that P3 Billion should be considered as the correct proffered value, still we cannot deem the Government as having faithfully complied with Rep. Act No. 8974. For the law plainly requires direct payment to the property owner, and not a mere deposit with the authorized government depositary. Without such direct payment, no writ of possession may be obtained.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Writ of Possession May Not</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Be Implemented Until Actual</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Receipt by PIATCO of Proferred</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>The Court thus finds another error on the part of the RTC. The RTC authorized the issuance of the writ of possession to the Government notwithstanding the fact that no payment of any amount had yet been made to PIATCO, despite the clear command of Rep. Act No. 8974 that there must first be payment before the writ of possession can issue. While the RTC did direct the LBP-Baclaran to immediately release the amount of US$62 Million to PIATCO, it should have likewise suspended the writ of possession, nay, withdrawn it altogether, until the Government shall have actually paid PIATCO. This is the inevitable consequence of the clear command of Rep. Act No. 8974 that requires immediate payment of the initially determined amount of just compensation should be effected. Otherwise, the overpowering intention of Rep. Act No. 8974 of ensuring payment first before transfer of repossession would be eviscerated.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974 represents a significant change from previous expropriation laws such as Rule 67, or even Section 19 of the Local Government Code. Rule 67 and the Local Government Code merely provided that the Government deposit the initial amounts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> antecedent to acquiring possession of the property with, respectively, an authorized<br><br>Government depositary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> or the proper court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In both cases, the private owner does not receive compensation prior to the deprivation of property. On the other hand, Rep. Act No. 8974 mandates immediate payment of the initial just compensation prior to the issuance of the writ of possession in favor of the Government.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974 is plainly clear in imposing the requirement of immediate prepayment, and no amount of statutory deconstruction can evade such requisite. It enshrines a new approach towards eminent domain that reconciles the inherent unease attending expropriation proceedings with a position of fundamental equity. While expropriation proceedings have always demanded just compensation in exchange for private property, the previous deposit requirement impeded immediate compensation to the private owner, especially in cases wherein the determination of the final amount of compensation would prove highly disputed. Under the new modality prescribed by Rep. Act No. 8974, the private owner sees immediate monetary recompense with the same degree of speed as the taking of his/her property.<br><br>While eminent domain lies as one of the inherent powers of the State, there is no requirement that it undertake a prolonged procedure, or that the payment of the private owner be protracted as far as practicable. In fact, the expedited procedure of payment, as highlighted under Rep. Act No. 8974, is inherently more fair, especially to the layperson who would be hard-pressed to fully comprehend the social value of expropriation in the first place. Immediate payment placates to some degree whatever ill-will that arises from expropriation, as well as satisfies the demand of basic fairness.<br><br>The Court has the duty to implement Rep. Act No. 8974 and to direct compliance with the requirement of immediate payment in this case. Accordingly, the Writ of Possession dated 21 December 2004 should be held in abeyance, pending proof of actual payment by the Government to PIATCO of the proffered value of the NAIA 3 facilities, which totals P3,002,125,000.00.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rights of the Government</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">upon Issuance of the Writ</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">of Possession</span><br><br>Once the Government pays PIATCO the amount of the proffered value of P3 Billion, it will be entitled to the Writ of Possession. However, the Government questions the qualification imposed by the RTC in its 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> consisting of the prohibition on the Government from performing acts of ownership such as awarding concessions or leasing any part of NAIA 3 to other parties. To be certain, the RTC, in its 10 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Omnibus Order,</span> expressly stated that it was not affirming "the superfluous part of the Order [of 4 January 2005] prohibiting the plaintiffs from awarding concessions or leasing any part of NAIA <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[3]</span> to other parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Still, such statement was predicated on the notion that since the Government was not yet the owner of NAIA 3 until final payment of just compensation, it was obviously incapacitated to perform such acts of ownership.<br><br>In deciding this question, the 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan </span>cannot be ignored, particularly the declaration that "[f]or the government to take over the said facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as builder of the said structures." The obvious import of this holding is that unless PIATCO is paid just compensation, the Government is barred from "taking over," a phrase which in the strictest sense could encompass even a bar of physical possession of NAIA 3, much less operation of the facilities.<br><br>There are critical reasons for the Court to view the 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> less stringently, and thus allow the operation by the Government of NAIA 3 upon the effectivity of the Writ of Possession. For one, the national prestige is diminished every day that passes with the NAIA 3 remaining mothballed. For another, the continued non-use of the facilities contributes to its physical deterioration, if it has not already. And still for another, the economic benefits to the Government and the country at large are beyond dispute once the NAIA 3 is put in operation.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974 provides the appropriate answer for the standard that governs the extent of the acts the Government may be authorized to perform upon the issuance of the writ of possession. Section 4 states that "the court shall immediately issue to the implementing agency an order to take possession of the property and <span style="font-weight: bold;">start the implementation of the project</span>." We hold that accordingly, once the Writ of Possession is effective, the Government itself is authorized to perform the acts that are essential to the operation of the NAIA 3 as an international airport terminal upon the effectivity of the Writ of Possession. These would include the repair, reconditioning and improvement of the complex, maintenance of the existing facilities and equipment, installation of new facilities and equipment, provision of services and facilities pertaining to the facilitation of air traffic and transport, and other services that are integral to a modern-day international airport.<br><br>The Government's position is more expansive than that adopted by the Court. It argues that with the writ of possession, it is enabled to perform acts<span style="font-style: italic;"> de jure</span> on the expropriated property. It cites <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. Tagle,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> as well as the statement therein that "the expropriation of real property does not include mere physical entry or occupation of land," and from them concludes that "its mere physical entry and occupation of the property fall short of the taking of title, which includes all the rights that may be exercised by an owner over the subject property."<br><br>This conclusion is indeed lifted directly from statements in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tagle</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> but not from the <span style="font-style: italic;">ratio decidendi</span> of that case. <span style="font-style: italic;">Tagle</span> concerned whether a writ of possession in favor of the Government was still necessary in light of the fact that it was already in actual possession of the property. In ruling that the Government was entitled to the writ of possession, the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tagle</span> explains that such writ vested not only physical possession, but also the legal right to possess the property. Continues the Court, such legal right to possess was particularly important in the case, as there was a pending suit against the Republic for unlawful detainer, and the writ of possession would serve to safeguard the Government from eviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>At the same time, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tagle</span> conforms to the obvious, that there is no transfer of ownership as of yet by virtue of the writ of possession. <span style="font-style: italic;">Tagle</span> may concede that the Government is entitled to exercise more than just the right of possession by virtue of the writ of possession, yet it cannot be construed to grant the Government the entire panoply of rights that are available to the owner. Certainly, neither <span style="font-style: italic;">Tagle</span> nor any other case or law, lends support to the Government's proposition that it acquires beneficial or equitable ownership of the expropriated property merely through the writ of possession.<br><br>Indeed, this Court has been vigilant in defense of the rights of the property owner who has been validly deprived of possession, yet retains legal title over the expropriated property pending payment of just compensation. We reiterated the various doctrines of such import in our recent holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. Lim:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><blockquote>The recognized rule is that title to the property expropriated shall pass from the owner to the expropriator only <span style="font-weight: bold;">upon full payment of the just compensation</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> Jurisprudence on this settled principle is consistent both here and in other democratic jurisdictions. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. et al., vs. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>, thus:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Title to property which is the subject of condemnation proceedings does not vest the condemnor until the judgment fixing just compensation is entered and paid,</span> but the condemnor's title relates back to the date on which the petition under the Eminent Domain Act, or the commissioner's report under the Local Improvement Act, is filed.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x <span style="font-weight: bold;">Although the right to appropriate and use land taken for a canal is complete at the time of entry, title to the property taken remains in the owner until payment is actually made.</span> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">In <span style="font-style: italic;">Kennedy v. Indianapolis,</span> the US Supreme Court cited several cases holding that title to property does not pass to the condemnor until just compensation had actually been made. In fact, the decisions appear to be uniform to this effect. As early as 1838, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Rubottom v. McLure,</span> it was held that <span style="font-weight: bold;">'actual payment to the owner of the condemned property was a condition precedent to the investment of the title to the property in the State' albeit 'not to the appropriation of it to public use.'</span> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Rexford v. Knight</span>, the Court of Appeals of New York said that the construction upon the statutes was that the fee did not vest in the State until the payment of the compensation although the authority to enter upon and appropriate the land was complete prior to the payment. Kennedy further said that '<span style="font-weight: bold;">both on principle and authority the rule is . . . that the right to enter on and use the property is complete, as soon as the property is actually appropriated under the authority of law for a public use, but that the title does not pass from the owner without his consent, until just compensation has been made to him.'</span><br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Our own Supreme Court has held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Visayan Refining Co. v. Camus and Paredes,</span> that:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">'If the laws which we have exhibited or cited in the preceding discussion are attentively examined it will be apparent that the method of expropriation adopted in this jurisdiction is such as to afford absolute reassurance that no piece of land can be finally and irrevocably taken from an unwilling owner until compensation is paid....'"</span>(Emphasis supplied.)<br></div><br>Clearly, without full payment of just compensation, there can be no transfer of title from the landowner to the expropriator. Otherwise stated, the Republic's acquisition of ownership is conditioned upon the full payment of just compensation within a reasonable time.<br><br>Significantly, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Municipality of BiÃ±an v. Garcia</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this Court ruled that the expropriation of lands consists of two stages, to wit:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"x x x The<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> first </span>is concerned with the determination of the authority of the plaintiff to exercise the power of eminent domain and the propriety of its exercise in the context of the facts involved in the suit. It ends with an order, if not of dismissal of the action, "of condemnation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be condemned, for the public use or purpose described in the complaint, upon the payment of just compensation to be determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint" x x x.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">second</span> phase of the eminent domain action is concerned with the determination by the court of "the just compensation for the property sought to be taken." This is done by the court with the assistance of not more than three (3) commissioners. x x x.<br></div><br>It is only upon the completion of these two stages that expropriation is said to have been completed. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. Salem Investment Corporation</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> , we ruled that, "the process is not completed until payment of just compensation." Thus, here, the failure of the Republic to pay respondent and his predecessors-in-interest for a period of 57 years rendered the expropriation process incomplete.</blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Lim</span> serves fair warning to the Government and its agencies who consistently refuse to pay just compensation due to the private property owner whose property had been expropriated. At the same time, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim</span> emphasizes the fragility of the rights of the Government as possessor pending the final payment of just compensation, without diminishing the potency of such rights. Indeed, the public policy, enshrined foremost in the Constitution, mandates that the Government must pay for the private property it expropriates. Consequently, the proper judicial attitude is to guarantee compliance with this primordial right to just compensation.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Final Determination of Just</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Compensation Within 60 Days</span><br><br>The issuance of the writ of possession does not write<span style="font-style: italic;"> finis</span> to the expropriation proceedings. As earlier pointed out, expropriation is not completed until payment to the property owner of just compensation. The proffered value stands as merely a provisional determination of the amount of just compensation, the payment of which is sufficient to transfer possession of the property to the Government. However, to effectuate the transfer of ownership, it is necessary for the Government to pay the property owner the final just compensation.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim</span>, the Court went as far as to countenance, given the exceptional circumstances of that case, the reversion of the validly expropriated property to private ownership due to the failure of the Government to pay just compensation in that case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It was noted in that case that the Government deliberately refused to pay just compensation. The Court went on to rule that "in cases where the government failed to pay just compensation within five (5) years from the finality of the judgment in the expropriation proceedings, the owners concerned shall have the right to recover possession of their property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974 mandates a speedy method by which the final determination of just compensation may be had. Section 4 provides:<br><blockquote>In the event that the owner of the property contests the implementing agency's proffered value, the court shall determine the just compensation to be paid the owner within sixty (60) days from the date of filing of the expropriation case. When the decision of the court becomes final and executory, the implementing agency shall pay the owner the difference between the amount already paid and the just compensation as determined by the court.</blockquote>We hold that this provision should apply in this case. The sixty (60)-day period prescribed in Rep. Act No. 8974 gives teeth to the law's avowed policy "to ensure that owners of real property acquired for national government infrastructure projects are <span style="font-weight: bold;">promptly paid</span> just compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In this case, there already has been irreversible delay in the prompt payment of PIATCO of just compensation, and it is no longer possible for the RTC to determine the just compensation due PIATCO within sixty (60) days from the filing of the complaint last 21 December 2004, as contemplated by the law. Still, it is feasible to effectuate the spirit of the law by requiring the trial court to make such determination within sixty (60) days from <span style="font-weight: bold;">finality of this decision</span>, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Rep. Act No. 8974 and its Implementing Rules.<br><br>Of course, once the amount of just compensation has been finally determined, the Government is obliged to pay PIATCO the said amount. As shown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim </span>and other like-minded cases, the Government's refusal to make such payment is indubitably actionable in court.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Appointment of Commissioners</span><br><br>The next argument for consideration is the claim of the Government that the RTC erred in appointing the three commissioners in its 7 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> without prior consultation with either the Government or PIATCO, or without affording the Government the opportunity to object to the appointment of these commissioners. We can dispose of this argument without complication.<br><br>It must be noted that Rep. Act No. 8974 is silent on the appointment of commissioners tasked with the ascertainment of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> This protocol though is sanctioned under Rule 67. We rule that the appointment of commissioners under Rule 67 may be resorted to, even in expropriation proceedings under Rep. Act No. 8974, since the application of the provisions of Rule 67 in that regard do not conflict with the statute. As earlier stated, Section 14 of the Implementing Rules does allow such other incidents affecting the complaint to be resolved under the provisions on expropriation of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. Even without Rule 67, reference during trial to a commissioner of the examination of an issue of fact is sanctioned under Rule 32 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>But while the appointment of commissioners under the aegis of Rule 67 may be sanctioned in expropriation proceedings under Rep. Act No. 8974, the standards to be observed for the determination of just compensation are provided not in Rule 67 but in the statute. In particular, the governing standards for the determination of just compensation for the NAIA 3 facilities are found in Section 10 of the Implementing Rules for Rep. Act No. 8974, which provides for the replacement cost method in the valuation of improvements and structures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Nothing in Rule 67 or Rep. Act No. 8974 requires that the RTC consult with the parties in the expropriation case on who should be appointed as commissioners. Neither does the Court feel that such a requirement should be imposed in this case. We did rule in <span style="font-style: italic;">Municipality of Talisay v. Ramirez</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> that "there is nothing to prevent [the trial court] from seeking the recommendations of the parties on [the] matter [of appointment of commissioners], the better to ensure their fair representation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> At the same time, such solicitation of recommendations is not obligatory on the part of the court, hence we cannot impute error on the part of the RTC in its exercise of solitary discretion in the appointment of the commissioners.<br><br>What Rule 67 does allow though is for the parties to protest the appointment of any of these commissioners, as provided under Section 5 of the Rule. These objections though must be made filed within ten (10) days from service of the order of appointment of the commissioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In this case, the proper recourse of the Government to challenge the choice of the commissioners is to file an objection with the trial court, conformably with Section 5, Rule 67, and not as it has done, assail the same through a special civil action for certiorari. Considering that the expropriation proceedings in this case were effectively halted seven (7) days after the <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> appointing the commissioners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> it is permissible to allow the parties to file their objections with the RTC within five (5) days from finality of this decision.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Insufficient Ground for Inhibition</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">of Respondent Judge</span><br><br>The final argument for disposition is the claim of the Government is that Hon. Gingoyon has prejudged the expropriation case against the Government's cause and, thus, should be required to inhibit himself. This grave charge is predicated on facts which the Government characterizes as "undeniable." In particular, the Government notes that the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> was issued <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span>, without any preceding motion, notice or hearing. Further, such order, which directed the payment of US$62 Million to PIATCO, was attended with error in the computation of just compensation. The Government also notes that the said Order was issued even before summons had been served on PIATCO.<br><br>The disqualification of a judge is a deprivation of his/her judicial power<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and should not be allowed on the basis of mere speculations and surmises. It certainly cannot be predicated on the adverse nature of the judge's rulings towards the movant for inhibition, especially if these rulings are in accord with law. Neither could inhibition be justified merely on the erroneous nature of the rulings of the judge. We emphasized in <span style="font-style: italic;">Webb v. People:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><blockquote>To prove bias and prejudice on the part of respondent judge, <span style="font-weight: bold;">petitioners harp on the alleged adverse and erroneous rulings of respondent judge on their various motions. By themselves, however, they do not sufficiently prove bias and prejudice to disqualify respondent judge. To be disqualifying, the bias and prejudice must be shown to have stemmed from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case. </span>Opinions formed in the course of judicial proceedings, although erroneous, as long as they are based on the evidence presented and conduct observed by the judge, do not prove personal bias or prejudice on the part of the judge. <span style="font-weight: bold;">As a general rule, repeated rulings against a litigant, no matter how erroneous and vigorously and consistently expressed, are not a basis for disqualification of a judge on grounds of bias and prejudice. Extrinsic evidence is required to establish bias, bad faith, malice or corrupt purpose, in addition to the palpable error which may be inferred from the decision or order itself. Although the decision may seem so erroneous as to raise doubts concerning a judge's integrity, absent extrinsic evidence, the decision itself would be insufficient to establish a case against the judge. The only exception to the rule is when the error is so gross and patent as to produce an ineluctable inference of bad faith or malice.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></blockquote>The Government's contentions against Hon. Gingoyon are severely undercut by the fact that the 21 December 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order,</span> which the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> sought to rectify, was indeed severely flawed as it erroneously applied the provisions of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, instead of Rep. Act No. 8974, in ascertaining compliance with the requisites for the issuance of the writ of possession. The 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order,</span> which according to the Government establishes Hon. Gingoyon's bias, was promulgated precisely to correct the previous error by applying the correct provisions of law. It would not speak well of the Court if it sanctions a judge for wanting or even attempting to correct a previous erroneous order which precisely is the right move to take.<br><br>Neither are we convinced that the <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> issuance of the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order,</span> without the benefit of notice or hearing, sufficiently evinces bias on the part of Hon. Gingoyon. The <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> amendment by a court of an erroneous order previously issued may be sanctioned depending on the circumstances, in line with the long-recognized principle that every court has inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Section 5(g), Rule 135 of the Rules of Court further recognizes the inherent power of courts "to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> a power which Hon. Gingoyon noted in his 10 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Omnibus Order.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> This inherent power includes the right of the court to reverse itself, especially when in its honest opinion it has committed an error or mistake in judgment, and that to adhere to its decision will cause injustice to a party litigant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Certainly, the 4 January 2005 Order was designed to make the RTC's previous order conformable to law and justice, particularly to apply the correct law of the case. Of course, as earlier established, this effort proved incomplete, as the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> did not correctly apply Rep. Act No. 8974 in several respects. Still, at least, the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> correctly reformed the most basic premise of the case that Rep. Act No. 8974 governs the expropriation proceedings.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Government belittles Hon. Gingoyon's invocation of Section 5(g), Rule 135 as "patently without merit". Certainly merit can be seen by the fact that the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> reoriented the expropriation proceedings towards the correct governing law. Still, the Government claims that the unilateral act of the RTC did not conform to law or justice, as it was not afforded the right to be heard.<br><br>The Court would be more charitably disposed towards this argument if not for the fact that the earlier order with the 4 January 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> sought to correct was itself issued without the benefit of any hearing. In fact, nothing either in Rule 67 or Rep. Act No. 8975 requires the conduct of a hearing prior to the issuance of the writ of possession, which by design is available immediately upon the filing of the complaint provided that the requisites attaching thereto are present. Indeed, this expedited process for the obtention of a writ of possession in expropriation cases comes at the expense of the rights of the property owner to be heard or to be deprived of possession. Considering these predicates, it would be highly awry to demand that an order modifying the earlier issuance of a writ of possession in an expropriation case be barred until the staging of a hearing, when the issuance of the writ of possession itself is not subject to hearing. Perhaps the conduct of a hearing under these circumstances would be prudent. However, hearing is not mandatory, and the failure to conduct one does not establish the manifest bias required for the inhibition of the judge.<br><br>The Government likewise faults Hon. Gingoyon for using the amount of US$350 Million as the basis for the 100% deposit under Rep. Act No. 8974. The Court has noted that this statement was predicated on the erroneous belief that the BIR zonal valuation applies as a standard for determination of just compensation in this case. Yet this is manifest not of bias, but merely of error on the part of the judge. Indeed, the Government was not the only victim of the errors of the RTC in the assailed orders. PIATCO itself was injured by the issuance by the RTC of the writ of possession, even though the former had yet to be paid any amount of just compensation. At the same time, the Government was also prejudiced by the erroneous ruling of the RTC that the amount of US$62.3 Million, and not P3 Billion, should be released to PIATCO.<br><br>The Court has not been remiss in pointing out the multiple errors committed by the RTC in its assailed orders, to the prejudice of both parties. This attitude of error towards all does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> negate the charge of bias. Still, great care should be had in requiring the inhibition of judges simply because the magistrate did err. Incompetence may be a ground for administrative sanction, but not for inhibition, which requires lack of objectivity or impartiality to sit on a case.<br><br>The Court should necessarily guard against adopting a standard that a judge should be inhibited from hearing the case if one litigant loses trust in the judge. Such loss of trust on the part of the Government may be palpable, yet inhibition cannot be grounded merely on the feelings of the party-litigants. Indeed, every losing litigant in any case can resort to claiming that the judge was biased, and he/she will gain a sympathetic ear from friends, family, and people who do not understand the judicial process. The test in believing such a proposition should not be the vehemence of the litigant's claim of bias, but the CourtÃ¯Â¿Â½s judicious estimation, as people who know better than to believe any old cry of "wolf!", whether such bias has been irrefutably exhibited.<br><br>The Court acknowledges that it had been previously held that "at the very first sign of lack of faith and trust in his actions, whether well-grounded or not, the judge has no other alternative but to inhibit himself from the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> But this doctrine is qualified by the entrenched rule that "a judge may not be legally prohibited from sitting in a litigation, but when circumstances appear that will induce doubt to his honest actuations and probity in favor of either party, or incite such state of mind, he should conduct a careful self-examination. He should exercise his discretion in a way that the people's faith in the Courts of Justice is not impaired."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> And a self-assessment by the judge that he/she is not impaired to hear the case will be respected by the Court absent any evidence to the contrary. As held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chin v. Court of Appeals</span>:<br><blockquote>An allegation of prejudgment, without more, constitutes mere conjecture and is not one of the "just and valid reasons" contemplated in the second paragraph of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court for which a judge may inhibit himself from hearing the case. We have repeatedly held that mere suspicion that a judge is partial to a party is not enough. Bare allegations of partiality and prejudgment will not suffice in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption that the judge will undertake his noble role to dispense justice according to law and evidence and without fear or favor. There should be adequate evidence to prove the allegations, and there must be showing that the judge had an interest, personal or otherwise, in the prosecution of the case. To be a disqualifying circumstance, the bias and prejudice must be shown to have stemmed from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote>The mere vehemence of the Government's claim of bias does not translate to clear and convincing evidence of impairing bias. There is no sufficient ground to direct the inhibition of Hon. Gingoyon from hearing the expropriation case.<br><br>In conclusion, the Court summarizes its rulings as follows:<br><br>(1) The 2004 <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> sets the base requirement that has to be observed before the Government may take over the NAIA 3, that there must be payment to PIATCO of just compensation in accordance with law and equity. Any ruling in the present expropriation case must be conformable to the dictates of the Court as pronounced in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan </span>cases.<br><br>(2) Rep. Act No. 8974 applies in this case, particularly insofar as it requires the immediate payment by the Government of at least the proffered value of the NAIA 3 facilities to PIATCO and provides certain valuation standards or methods for the determination of just compensation.<br><br>(3) Applying Rep. Act No. 8974, the implementation of Writ of Possession in favor of the Government over NAIA 3 is held in abeyance until PIATCO is directly paid the amount of P3 Billion, representing the proffered value of NAIA 3 under Section 4(c) of the law.<br><br>(4) Applying Rep. Act No. 8974, the Government is authorized to start the implementation of the NAIA 3 Airport terminal project by performing the acts that are essential to the operation of the NAIA 3 as an international airport terminal upon the effectivity of the Writ of Possession, subject to the conditions above-stated. As prescribed by the Court, such authority encompasses "the repair, reconditioning and improvement of the complex, maintenance of the existing facilities and equipment, installation of new facilities and equipment, provision of services and facilities pertaining to the facilitation of air traffic and transport, and other services that are integral to a modern-day international airport."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>(5) The RTC is mandated to complete its determination of the just compensation within sixty (60) days from finality of this <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>. In doing so, the RTC is obliged to comply with "law and equity" as ordained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Again</span> and the standard set under Implementing Rules of Rep. Act No. 8974 which is the "replacement cost method" as the standard of valuation of structures and improvements.<br><br>(6) There was no grave abuse of discretion attending the RTC <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> appointing the commissioners for the purpose of determining just compensation. The provisions on commissioners under Rule 67 shall apply insofar as they are not inconsistent with Rep. Act No. 8974, its Implementing Rules, or the rulings of the Court in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Agan.</span><br><br>(7) The Government shall pay the just compensation fixed in the decision of the trial court to PIATCO immediately upon the finality of the said decision.<br><br>(8) There is no basis for the Court to direct the inhibition of Hon. Gingoyon.<br><br>All told, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC to warrant the nullification of the questioned orders.

Yet the engagement of these appraisers at the election of the Government is clearly different from the appointment by the trial court of commissioners. The differences extend beyond merely the selecting authority. The engagement of appraisers under Section 11 primarily occurs before the filing of the expropriation complaint, when the Government is obliged to determine the current relevant zonal valuation of the land to be expropriated, the valuation of the structures and improvements using the replacement cost method, or the proffered value of the property for expropriation, all for the purpose of making the initial payment necessary for the writ of possession under Section 4 of Rep. Act No. 8974. This initial determination of the amount is generally made by the Government, and not by the courts, and the engagement of appraisers is attuned for such purpose. However, if the Government engages these appraisers after the initial payment has been made to the property owner, for the express purpose of making the final determination of just compensation, there is no rule that binds the trial court to the findings of these appraisers. Neither are these appraisers obliged to receive evidence submitted by the parties, unlike the commissioners, who are expressly authorized to do so under Section 6, Rule 67.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span> note 42.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> G.R.

In addition, I proffer the following thoughts:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan case did not preclude</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">right of State to expropriate</span><br></div><br>The majority opinion took excruciating pains to reconcile our Decision in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan </span>and
the inherent right of the State to expropriate private property. With
due respect, the effort is strained and unnecessary for there nothing
in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan</span> where it can be deduced that the right of the State to expropriate the subject property has been impaired or diminished. In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan,</span> we simply held:<br><blockquote>x x x<br><br>This
Court, however, is not unmindful of the reality that the structures
comprising the NAIA IPT III facility are almost complete and that funds
have been spent by PIATCO in their construction. For the government to
take over the said facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as
builder of the said structures. The compensation must be just and in
accordance with law and equity for the government cannot unjustly
enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors.</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan</span> involved <span style="font-weight: bold;">solely</span>
the issue of the validity of THE PIATCO contracts. After striking down
the contracts as void, we ruled that the State must pay just
compensation to PIATCO before it could exercise the right to take over
considering the undeniable fact that the latter spent a considerable
sum of money to build the structures comprising the NAIA IPT III. The
Court, however, did not spell out a rigid formula for just compensation
to be paid to PIATCO except to say that it must be according to law and
equity. The Court's language was carefully crafted to give the trial
court sufficient flexibility in determining just compensation
considering the exchange of charges and countercharges that the cost in
building the said structures was unreasonably bloated. It ought to be
stressed again that in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan,</span>
we did not rule that the State cannot expropriate the said structures.
Necessarily, we did not also set the procedure on how the expropriation
proceedings should be conducted if the State would opt to expropriate
said structures. We need not, therefore, strain in attempting to square
our ruling in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan </span>with our ruling in the case at bar. If at all, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan</span> will <span style="font-weight: bold;">later</span> be relevant in fixing just compensation but not in determining which procedure to follow in the expropriation of NAIA IPT III.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">R.A. No. 8974 cannot</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">amend Rule 67</span><br></div><br>Article VIII, sec. 5 of the 1987 Constitution gave the Supreme Court the following powers:<br><blockquote>x x x<br><br>(5)
Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of
constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts,
the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal
assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a
simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of
cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not
diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of
special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless
disapproved by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> we emphasized that the 1987 Constitution strengthened the rule making power of this Court, thus:<br><blockquote>The
1987 Constitution molded an even stronger and more independent
judiciary. Among others, it enhanced the rule making power of this
Court. x x x<br><br>The rule making power of this Court was expanded.
This Court for the first time was given the power to promulgate rules
concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. x x
x <span style="font-weight: bold;">But most importantly, the 1987
Constitution took away the power of Congress to repeal, alter, or
supplement rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure. In fine,
the power to promulgate rules of pleading, practice and procedure is no
longer shared by this Court with Congress</span> x x x.</blockquote>Undoubtedly,
Rule 67 is the rule this Court promulgated to govern the proceedings in
expropriation cases filed in court. It has been the undeviating rule
for quite a length of time. Following Article VIII, section 5(5) of the
1987 Constitution and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Echegaray</span>
jurisprudence, Rule 67 cannot be repealed or amended by Congress. This
prohibition against non- repeal or non-amendment refers to any part of
Rule 67 for Rule 67 is pure procedural law. Consequently, the Court
should not chop Rule 67 into pieces and hold that some can be changed
by Congress but others can be changed. The stance will dilute the rule
making power of this Court which can not be allowed for it will weaken
its institutional independence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span><br></div><br>On
December 12, 2005, the Solicitor General filed a Supplemental
Manifestation and Motion. The Solicitor General informed the Court
about an Order dated December 2, 2005 of the High Court of Justice,
Queen's Bench Division, London which reads: <br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 360px;"><blockquote>Claim No.: HT-05-269<br></blockquote></div>IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE<br>QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION<br>TECHNOLOGY AND CONSTRUCTION COURT<br>MR.

be sure, the said Order is not yet final. Be that as it may, the Court
cannot turn a blind eye to this new wrinkle of the case at bar. It is
of judicial notice that despite <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agan,</span>
the subject case has reached the international arbitral tribunals where
the government and the private respondent have filed charges and
countercharges. There is evident need to avoid the issues pestering the
parties from further multiplying and for new proceedings to be started
in other courts, lest public interest suffer further irretrievable
prejudice. Towards this end, it is respectfully submitted that the
Court should exercise its power to compel the parties to interplead
pursuant to Rule 62 and invoke the need for orderly administration of
justice. The parties may be given reasonable time to amend their
pleadings in the trial court.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW WHEREOF</span>,
I join the Opinion of Mr. Justice Corona except the part calling for
the inhibition of the respondent judge. The issues resolved by the
respondent judge are not the run of the mill variety. Indeed, their
novelty and complexity have divided even the members of this Court.
There may have been lapses by the respondent judge but they do not

The rules of procedure, like Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, must adjust automatically to such new laws on substantive matters.<br><br>Section 4 of Republic Act No. 8974, mandating immediate payment to the property owner of the full zonal or proffered value prior to takeover by the government, is a substantive requirement in expropriation cases. Thus, Section 4 must apply to all expropriation cases under RA No. 8974 involving the acquisition of real property, like the NAIA Terminal III, for "national government projects."<br><br>Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that Section 4 of RA 8974 is not applicable to the expropriation of NAIA Terminal III, the Court must still apply the substantive concept in Section 4 of RA 8974 to expropriation proceedings under Rule 67 to insure equal protection of the law to property owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> There is no substantial reason to discriminate against property owners in expropriation cases under Rule 67. Under RA 8974, when private property is expropriated for a national government project, the government must first pay the zonal or proffered value to the property owner before the government can take over the property. In the present case, private property is expropriated for an admittedly national government project. Thus, the Court must extend the substantive benefits in Section 4 of RA 8974 to expropriation cases under Rule 67 to prevent denial of the equal protection of the law.<br><br>Accordingly, I join in the result of the majority opinion.<br><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Section 5(5), Article VIII, 1987 Constitution; Echegaray v.

Indeed, not only time but also resources are at stake in the expropriation of NAIA IPT3, an infrastructure project that needs only to be completed to become fully operational, instead of building an entirely new facility from scratch.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second,</span> NAIA IPT3 sits on 65 hectares (161 acres) of prime government land located in one of the most expensive commercial areas in the country. But that valuable land will be completely laid to waste if NAIA IPT3 does not become operational, either because government does not allow it to operate or petitioners decide to build, operate or develop an entirely new international airport. In either case, both sides will only succeed in stalemating each other and NAIA IPT3 will be absolutely of no use to both petitioners and private respondent PIATCO. The land will just lie idle and unproductive while a white elephant abjectly sits on it. A repeat of the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant? Certainly. On the other hand, will not expropriating NAIA IPT3, putting it to good use and paying off its owner(s) redound to the benefit of the entire country and all parties concerned?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third,</span> there is no denying that a project like NAIA IPT3 is long overdue, such that the prestige of the entire country before the international community is at stake. Politics and narrow vested interests have a peculiar way of extirpating the most salutary and beneficial ventures in this country.

Neither is it a "site or location" because "location" is the specific place or position of a person or thing and "site" pertains to a place or location or a piece of property set aside for a specific use. They further aver that even the bicameral deliberations on the law reveal that the legislature never contemplated the use of this special law for the acquisition of land for a purpose other than a right of way, site or location for government infrastructure projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the provisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of RA 8974 cited by respondent judge speak of "relevant current zonal valuation of the [Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)]" as the amount of deposit necessary for the issuance of a writ of possession.

Hence, the pronouncements in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> cannot constitute the law of the case here.<br><br>The majority opinion claims that "the staging of expropriation proceedings in this case with the exclusive use of Rule 67 would allow for the government to take over the NAIA 3 facilities in a fashion that directly rebukes our 2004 resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> (which) mandated that there must be first payment of just compensation before the Government could take over the NAIA IPT3 facilities." This is very misleading.<br><br>The full text of the relevant statement of the Court in its 2004 resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> is as follows:<br><blockquote>This Court, however, is not unmindful of the reality that the structures comprising the NAIA [IPT3] facility are almost complete and that funds have been spent by PIATCO in their construction. <span style="font-style: italic;">For the government to take over the facility, it has to compensate respondent PIATCO as builder of the said structures.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">The compensation must be just and in accordance with law and equity</span> for the government can not unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Clearly, the resolution only requires that PIATCO be given just compensation as a condition for any government take-over of NAIA IPT3. The just compensation should be in accordance with law and equity. There is something seriously wrong with the argument that RA 8974 is the only legal and equitable way to compensate PIATCO in accordance with our 2004 resolution.<br><br>The application of Rule 67 in the expropriation proceedings of NAIA IPT3 is in consonance with <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span>. The determination and payment of just compensation pursuant to Rule 67 are in accordance with law. Under Rule 67, PIATCO will be given FULL JUST COMPENSATION by the government for the taking of NAIA IPT3. That is mandatory. The Constitution itself ordains it.<br><br>Under Rule 67, there is no way the government can unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO. Section 9 of Rule 67 ensures this by requiring the payment of interest from the time government takes possession of the property.<br><br>Moreover, I dare say the majority opinion actually got caught up in a self-contradiction. At first, it claimed that the 2004 resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span> laid down the following directives: (1) PIATCO must receive payment of just compensation determined in accordance with law and equity, and (2) the government is barred from taking over NAIA IPT3 <span style="font-style: italic;">until such just compensation</span> is paid. It continued to argue that the 2004 resolution requires the payment of just compensation before the takeover of NAIA IPT3 facilities. Subsequently, however, it backtracked and stated that "the 2004 resolution does not particularize the extent such payment must be effected before the takeover, but it actually requires at least <span style="font-style: italic;">some degree of payment</span> to the private owner before a writ of possession may issue." However, neither the proffered value nor the zonal valuation under RA 8974 is equivalent to just compensation. If the majority opinion were to pursue its argument to its logical conclusion, no takeover can be had without payment of the just compensation itself, not merely of a value corresponding to what it vaguely referred to as "some degree of payment".<br><br>The requirement to pay the proffered value was a strained and belabored way of establishing that the application of RA 8974 is in consonance with the 2004 resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span>. If the majority opinion were to be true to its pronouncement that the 2004 resolution demands payment of just compensation prior to the take over of NAIA IPT3, then payment of the proffered value is not enough. The proffered value is definitely not equivalent to just compensation.<br><br>The majority failed to realize that respondent judge gravely abuse his discretion when he issued his January 10, 2005 order. Respondent judge precipitately ruled that Rule 67 of the Rules of Court and all the laws on expropriation involving infrastructure projects had been expressly repealed by RA 8974 and its implementing rules and regulations. Worse, respondent judge justified his conclusion by erroneously invoking a footnote in <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Iloilo v.

It is very plain to see, and this court hereby holds, that the NAIA IPT3 is itself the very right-of-way, the site or location of the national government's infrastructure project; it is the very right-of-way, site or location of an airport that will make them attain their <span style="font-style: italic;">"goal of encouraging and promoting international and domestic air traffic as well as developing an internationally acceptable airport accommodation and service."</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Respondent judge's theory about Rule 67's supposed repeal by RA 8974 was totally devoid of factual and legal basis. RA 8974 did <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> repeal Rule 67 at all. The Constitution will not allow it. In fact, neither its repealing clause nor any of its provisions even mentioned or referred to the Rules of Court, whether on expropriation or anything else. But even assuming (but not conceding) that respondent judge's theory had been based on an <span style="font-style: italic;">implied</span> repeal, still there would have been no legal justification for it.<br><br>Settled is the rule in statutory construction that implied repeals are not favored. Thus:<br><blockquote>The two laws must be absolutely incompatible, and a clear finding thereof must surface, before the inference of implied repeal may be drawn. The rule is expressed in the maxim, <span style="font-style: italic;">interpretare et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi, i.e.,</span> every statute must be so interpreted and brought into accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. The fundament is that the legislature should be presumed to have known the existing laws on the subject and not have enacted conflicting statutes. Hence, all doubts must be resolved against any implied repeal, and all efforts should be exerted in order to harmonize and give effect to all laws on the subject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></blockquote>The foregoing becomes all the more significant when, as in this case, the provisions of RA 8974 reveal no manifest intent to revoke Rule 67. <span style="font-style: italic;">In fact, Section 14 of the IRR of RA 8974 makes an explicit reference to Rule 67 and mandates its applicability to all matters regarding defenses and objections to the complaint, issues on uncertain ownership and conflicting claims, effects of appeal on the rights of the parties and such other incidents affecting the complaint.</span> If only for this reason, respondent judge's "repeal theory" is totally erroneous.<br><br>The footnote in <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Iloilo</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> was not in any way necessary to resolve any of the issues in that case.

The Court invoked Section 1 of Rule 67 in resolving the issue of the sufficiency in form and substance of the amended complaint for expropriation and Section 2 of the same Rule in holding that the City of Iloilo was not in estoppel since it simply followed the procedure that a prior hearing was not required before a writ of possession could be issued. Indeed, the Court could not even have applied RA 8974 in <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Iloilo</span> because it did not involve a project of the national government but that of a local government unit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> thus requiring the application of RA 7160 (the Local Government Code).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>More importantly, any talk of repeal (whether express or implied) by legislative enactment of the rules of procedure duly promulgated by this Court goes against the Constitution itself.

The majority however failed to realize that such change brought about by a legislative enactment subverts the fundamental law and defeats the constitutional intent to strengthen the independence of this Court.<br><br>There is no question that the appropriate standard of just compensation is a substantive matter, not procedural.

That was wrong and the reasoning was even more difficult to understand.<br><br>True, under Section 2(d) of the IRR of RA 8974 defining "national government projects", an airport (which NAIA IPT3 essentially is) is specifically listed among the national government projects for which expropriation proceedings may be initiated under the law. However, the law and its IRR also provide that the expropriation should be for the purpose of providing for a right of way, site or location for the intended national government project. A national government project is separate and distinct from the purpose of expropriation. Otherwise, there would have been no need to define them separately. Thus, respondent judge erred when he equated one with the other and obliterated the clear distinction made by the law.<br><br>Moreover, under Section 2(e) of the IRR, the specific objects or purposes of expropriation were lumped as 'ROW' which is defined as the "right-of-way, site or location, with defined physical boundaries, used for a national government project." Obviously, the NAIA IPT3 is not a right of way, site or location for any national government infrastructure project but the infrastructure itself albeit still under construction. The construction (and now the completion) of NAIA IPT3 never required the acquisition of private property for a right of way, site or location since the terminal, including all its access roads, stands completely on government land.<br><br>Conformably, RA 8974 does not apply to the expropriation of NAIA IPT3. And there being no special law on the matter, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court governs the procedure for its expropriation.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">AMOUNT ORDERED TO BE RELEASED</span><br><br>Having determined Rule 67 to be the applicable procedure to follow in this expropriation case, I now turn to the other issues.<br><br>In its complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> for the expropriation of NAIA IPT3, petitioners prayed for the immediate issuance of a writ of possession of the airport terminal and deposited the amount of P3,002,125,00 (about $53 million) at LBP-Baclaran for this purpose. This amount was based on the assessed value of NAIA IPT3 for taxation purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> As requested by petitioners and in support of their complaint for expropriation, LBP-Baclaran issued a certification of deposit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> which was in effect the functional equivalent of a certificate of availability of said funds.<br><br>In his January 4, 2005 order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> respondent judge â€” without any motion by PIATCO â€”  ordered petitioners to immediately pay PIATCO US$62,343,175.77, the <span style="font-style: italic;">total </span>balance of MIAA's deposits in LBP-Baclaran. Respondent judge reiterated the above directive in his January 10, 2005 omnibus order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The amount directed to be released was about US$ 9 million (or P500 million) more than the provisional value required by Rule 67 for issuance of the writ of possession.<br><br>I refuse to join the majority who turned a blind eye on respondent judge's orders which were issued with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Respondent judge should not have issued his disputed orders without any motion by PIATCO. There were very compelling reasons why. Considering that respondent judge knew or should have known how extremely controversial NAIA IPT3 had become, he should have granted the parties unimpeded opportunity to confront each other on the propriety of releasing such a huge amount to the owner of the property under expropriation. There were in fact still so many pending contentious issues on which the parties had taken radically opposite positions, such as whether it was respondent PIATCO alone that was entitled to payment or whether there were other parties like Takenaka Corporation (to be discussed later in this decision) that had valid claims thereon and, if so, how much each was entitled to. Furthermore, inasmuch as petitioners had been vigorously complaining that they were never really able to inspect and evaluate the structural integrity and real worth of NAIA IPT3, respondent judge should have at least tried to determine the reasonableness of petitioners' provisional deposit and therefore, he ought not to have been in such a hurry to order the release of petitioners' funds to PIATCO which was not even asking for it. In other words, all the foregoing warning signs considered, he should have been more circumspect, deliberate and careful in handling the case.<br><br>On a more academic note, however, and as already quoted previously, one significant difference between RA 8974 and Rule 67 is that, under RA 8974, immediate payment of the <span style="font-style: italic;">full zonal value</span> of the land and improvements/structures is required before the writ of possession is issued. On the other hand, under Rule 67, the deposit of an amount equivalent to the <span style="font-style: italic;">assessed</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span> of the property for taxation purposes is enough.<br><br>Under Section 2 of Rule 67, the only requisites for authorizing immediate entry (that is, for the issuance of the writ of possession) in expropriation proceedings are: (1) the filing of a complaint for expropriation sufficient in form and substance, and (2) a deposit equivalent to the assessed value for taxation purposes of the property subject to expropriation. Upon compliance with these two requirements, the issuance of a writ of possession becomes ministerial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Petitioners complied fully with the requirements of Rule 67 pertaining to the issuance of the writ allowing entry into the expropriated facility. First, they duly filed the verified complaint with the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo.</span> Second, PIATCO was served with and notified of the complaint. Third, petitioners set aside and earmarked P3,022,125,000 as provisional deposit, equivalent to the assessed value of the property for taxation purposes with the depositary bank. From then on, it became the ministerial duty of the trial court presided over by respondent judge to issue the writ of possession.<br><br>Section 2 of Rule 67 categorically prescribes the amount to be deposited with the authorized government depositary as the pre-condition for the issuance of a writ of possession. This is the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation. The figure is exact and permits the court no discretion in determining what the provisional value should be.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion when he ordered the release not only of the provisional deposit (as computed under Rule 67) but also of the entire bank balance of petitioner MIAA. He exercised discretion in a matter where no discretion was allowed.<br><br>Respondent judge thus disregarded established rules by unilaterally increasing the amount of the provisional deposit required for the issuance of the writ of possession. This Court has had occasions in the past where we denounced the acts of trial courts in unilaterally increasing such provisional deposits. After issuing the writ of possession, the provisional deposit is fixed and the court can no longer change it. As the Court ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">National Power Corporation v. Jocson</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>:<br><blockquote>After having fixed these provisional values, x x x and upon deposit by petitioner of the said amounts, respondent Judge lost, as was held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila Railroad Company vs. Paredes,</span> "plenary control over the order fixing the amount of the deposit, and has no power to annul, amend or modify it in matters of substance pending the course of the condemnation proceedings." The reason for this rule is that a contrary ruling would defeat the very purpose of the law which is to provide a speedy and summary procedure whereby the peaceable possession of the property subject of the expropriation proceedings "may be secured without the delays incident to prolonged and vexatious litigation touching the ownership and value of such lands, which should not be permitted to delay the progress of work."</blockquote>Even assuming for the sake of argument that it was RA 8974 that was applicable, still the trial court could not order petitioners to increase their deposit and to immediately pay the zonal value of NAIA IPT3. Section 4(c) of the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> states that, in cases where there is <span style="font-style: italic;">no existing valuation</span> of the property concerned, <span style="font-style: italic;">only the proferred value</span> of the property by the agency requesting expropriation is required to be paid for issuance of the writ.<br><br>So even if it had been RA 8974 that was applicable â€” which was not so â€” the amount deposited by petitioners would have constituted <span style="font-style: italic;">the proffered</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span> estimated by them, based on comparative values made by the City Assessor. In any case, the final determination of the total just compensation due the owner will have to be made in accordance with Rule 67. The provisional deposit shall then be deducted and petitioners shall pay the balance plus legal interest from the time petitioners took possession of the property until PIATCO is fully paid.<br><br>The majority opinion asserted that the determination of the amount of just compensation to be made pursuant to RA 8974 is limited to the value of the improvements/structures that constitute the NAIA IPT3 complex and cannot include the BIR zonal valuation which serves as one of the bases for just compensation under the law. This is, however, based on the assumption that the law is valid and Congress can substantially amend the rules of practice and procedure duly promulgated by this Court. It cannot.<br><br>Even assuming that RA 8974 is valid, it still does not support the conclusions of the majority opinion.<br><br>The law makes clear the distinction between the valuation of the land itself, and the improvements and structures constructed therein. While PIATCO is not entitled to the valuation that is inclusive of the value of the land, it is entitled to just compensation limited to the value of the improvements and/or structures.<br><br>True, Section 4 distinguishes between the valuations of the land itself and of the improvements and structures constructed therein. However, it is erroneous to infer that such difference in the manner of valuation justifies the application of RA 8974 to the expropriation of improvements and structures alone, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> separate from the land. The language of the law itself does not warrant the conclusion made in the majority opinion.<br><br>Section 4 of RA 8974 on the valuation of improvements and structures expressly refers to Section 7 of the law. Section 4 is therefore to be construed in the light of Section 7. The latter provision (Section 7) speaks of "improvements and/or structures <span style="font-style: italic;">on the land to be expropriated.</span>" Hence, the expropriation of the improvements and structures under RA 8974 should be properly viewed not in isolation from but in connection with (or as an incident of) the expropriation of land.<br><br>Moreover, any discussion of the expropriation under RA 8974 cannot be divorced from (1) the purpose of the expropriation and (2) the nature or character of the project. Here, the expropriation does not meet the first requisite. Hence, assuming the validity of RA 8974, its provisions still cannot be applied.<br><br>Even the reference to the proffered value by the majority opinion is inappropriate. The law is clear that such proffered value applies only "[i]n case the completion of a national government project is of utmost urgency and importance, and <span style="font-style: italic;">there is no existing valuation of the area concerned.</span>" The majority opinion recognizes the correctness of the position of the Solicitor General that zonal valuations are only for parcels of land and, hence, there can be no zonal valuation for improvements or structures such as an airport terminal like NAIA IPT3. Since it is impossible for improvements or structures to have an existing valuation, then there can be no proffered value for NAIA IPT 3 to speak of.<br><br>The fact that the proffered value does not apply to improvements is buttressed by the provisions of RA 8974. The law provides that in the determination of the proffered value, the standards prescribed in Section 5 of RA 8974 shall be taken into consideration. Section 5 expressly refers to<span style="font-style: italic;"> "Standards for the Assessment of the Value of the Land Subject of Expropriation Proceedings or Negotiated Sale."</span> On the other hand, the valuation of improvements and/or structures is separately governed by Section 7 of the law.<br><br>To reiterate, the determination of the proffered value categorically refers to Section 5 on the valuation of the land, not to valuation of improvements or structures under Section 7. Thus, the majority opinion unduly enlarged the concept of proffered value when it extended the same to improvements or structures.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">PERFORMANCE OF ACTS OF OWNERSHIP</span><br><br>Petitioners contend that respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion when he prohibited petitioners in his January 4, 2005 order from performing "acts of ownership". Although six days later, in his January 10, 2005 omnibus order, respondent judge removed this prohibition, it was only because he thought it to be a "superfluity" inasmuch as petitioners were not yet the owners of the terminal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Petitioners allege that the order of respondent judge unduly limited them to mere physical entry to the property without, however, affording them the means to accomplish the public purpose of the expropriation.

In deciding to exercise the power of eminent domain, petitioners intended to acquire not only physical possession but also ownership of the property ultimately.

Yes. Full payment of just compensation, though a condition precedent for the transfer of title or ownership, is not a condition precedent for the <span style="font-style: italic;">taking</span> of the property.

But when suggestion is made of record that he might be induced to act in favor of one party or with bias or prejudice against a litigant arising out of circumstances reasonably capable of inciting such a state of mind, he should conduct a careful self-examination. He should exercise his discretion in a way that the people's faith in the courts of justice is not impaired. A salutary norm is that he reflect on the probability that a losing party might nurture at the back of his mind the thought that the judge had unmeritoriously tilted the scales of justice against him. That passion on the part of a judge may be generated because of serious charges of misconduct against him by a suitor or his counsel, is not altogether remote. He is a man, subject to the frailties of other men. He should, therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to act or withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel is involved. He could in good grace inhibit himself where that case could be heard by another judge and where no appreciable prejudice would be occasioned to others involved therein. On the result of his decisions to sit or not to sit may depend to a great extent the all-important confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary. If after reflection he should resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where his motives or fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be interpreted as giving meaning and substance to the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137. He serves the cause of the law who forestalls miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>Here, petitioners' skepticism of respondent judge's ability to display the cold neutrality of an impartial judge was evident:<br><blockquote>Respondent judge ought to have inhibited himself from the expropriation case. xxx [H]e lacks the competence and more importantly, the impartiality necessary for justice to prevail.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx                                        xxx                                        xxx<br></div><br>[I]f respondent judge did not ambush petitioners with his Orders dated January 4 and 10, 2005, petitioners would have had the restraint and patience to contest in the ordinary course of law the Order dated January 7, 2005 hastily appointing three commissioners for the determination of just compensation.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> But the pattern of fraud and deception has become too obvious and too dangerous to be ignored.</span> Petitioners have had enough of respondent judge's onslaught.

It could have avoided this imbroglio had it pursued the options available to it under the 2004 resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agan</span>. Among these options was the filing in this Court of a motion for the determination of just compensation. Immediately after the 2004 resolution was promulgated, the right, purpose and propriety of expropriation could not have been seriously contested. The sole issue that remained was the amount of just compensation to be paid. Thus, a motion could have easily been filed to determine the just compensation for the facility. The Court could have then appointed a panel of commissioners in accordance with Section 5 of Rule 67 and the problem could have been completely resolved.<br><br>Another option the government could have taken at that time was to take over NAIA IPT3 in the exercise of its police power. Thereafter, it could have bidded out the facility's operations. PIATCO could have then been paid from the revenues from the winning bidder.<br><br>Nonetheless, the present expropriation proceedings are proper. Even the majority opinion recognizes this. The government has all the right to institute the proceedings where Rule 67 should be applied.<br><br>Rule 67 is designed to expedite expropriation proceedings as well as to strike the needed balance between the interests of the State and that of the private owner. Applying its provisions here is grounded not only in law but also in reality.<br><br>The provisional deposit having been paid, petitioners can take possession of NAIA IPT3. They can also perform acts of ownership over the property. NAIA IPT3 can then be made operational and the public purpose for its expropriation will be satisfied. PIATCO, on the other hand, will receive full and just compensation after the court finally determines the fair market value of the property.<br><br>RA 8974 provides that there should be immediate payment direct to the property owner prior to the take over of the property. Pursuant thereto, the majority opinion ordered the payment of the proffered value to PIATCO as a condition for the implementation of the writ of possession earlier issued by respondent judge. On the other hand, Rule 67 requires only the making of a down payment in the form of a provisional deposit. It cannot be withdrawn without further orders from the court, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, until just compensation is finally determined.<br><br>It is disturbing that the majority opinion allows PIATCO to take hold of the money without giving the government the opportunity to first inspect the facility thoroughly to ascertain its structural integrity and to make a preliminary valuation. With the money already in its possession, PIATCO may make use of the same in whatever way it may see fit. I dread to think what will happen if the government later on decides to back out after finding either irremediable structural defects or an excessively bloated valuation, such that it will cost more to put NAIA IPT3 in operational readiness than to build (or develop) and operate another airport. What happens then? Will not the government be left holding an empty bag â€” losing no less than US$ 53 million for an inoperable facility?<br><br>Furthermore, the exchange of opinion between Senator Renato Cayetano and Congressman Salacnib Baterina quoted by the majority opinion reveals that there should be a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> legislative appropriation of funds</span> to finance the acquisition of right of way, site or location for a national government project. Based on PIATCO's estimate, the value of the NAIA IPT3 may well be $400 million. This amount may be fair or it may be bloated. Nonetheless, in the event the trial court determines the just compensation after 60 days from finality of the decision in this case, the government cannot just release the amount, assuming that it has the necessary funds. The release of that huge amount in one shot should have congressional fiat for it is Congress after all which holds the purse under our system of government.<br><br>Given the foregoing, while the procedure under RA 8974 is (as the majority opinion describes it) "eminently more favorable to the property owner than Rule 67," it is clearly onerous to the government. In contrast, Rule 67 will be advantageous to the government without being cumbersome to the private owner. It provides a procedure that is sensitive to the government's financial condition and, at the same time, fair and just to the owner of the property.<br><br>In ordering the application of RA 8974, the majority opinion favors the interests of PIATCO over that of the government. Rather than striking the desired balance between legitimate State interests and private rights, it sacrifices public interest in favor of individual benefit.<br><br>The majority opinion constantly and unabashedly proclaims the objectives of RA 8974 â€” to benefit the property owner and to expedite expropriation proceedings for national government projects. The majority opinion tilted the balance in favor of private interest to the prejudice of the common good. Moreover, besides being erroneous, resort to RA 8974 will be counter-productive and self-defeating.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The national government operates on a "collection-for-payment" system.</span> It has to collect money first before it can make payments to its creditors. If the government is allowed to undertake acts of ownership over NAIA IPT3, the facility can be utilized not only to serve the public but also to contribute to the collections needed by the government. Payment of just compensation to PIATCO will then come "easier and sooner."<br><br>Applying RA 8974, on the other hand, will bring about the exact opposite result. Considering the limited funds and scarce resources of the national government, it will not be able to come up with the amount equivalent to the full just compensation within the short period envisioned in the majority opinion. It is absurd to expect or require the government to pay the full just compensation for NAIA IPT3 allegedly worth several hundred million dollars in one shot. The expropriation proceedings will grind to a halt. The hands of the government will be tied. The public interest sought to be met by the expropriation will be adversely affected. NAIA IPT3 will remain idle and the prime government property on which it stands will be a complete waste. In such a case, nobody wins. Everybody loses â€” PIATCO, the government, the Filipino people and our national prestige.
