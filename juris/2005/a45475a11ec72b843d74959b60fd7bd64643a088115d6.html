				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 6 April 2005, the Court required Atty. Ricardo T. Calimag, counsel for Roberto P.

Sulaiman, to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt of court for his participation in the submission of a fake judicial decision to this Court.&nbsp; This concerns his compliance therewith entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Show Cause</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Re: Compliance to Resolution Dated 6 April 2005</span>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Counsel explains that he filed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Intervention with Leave of Court and Petition-In-Intervention</span> (to which was appended a copy of the fake decision) on behalf of his clients to seek the truth in order that justice will prevail.&nbsp; He reasons that he was misled in the appreciation of the evidence (referring to the forged judicial decision) made available to him at the time of submission of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Petition-In-Intervention.</span>&nbsp; At the same time, he asserts that there was an honest mistake in the appreciation of the documents and that there was never any malice intended in the submission of the questioned documents.&nbsp; In fact, he even welcomes the referral of the incident to the National Bureau of Investigation so as to identify the mastermind of the production of the fake decision.<br><br>Counsel's explanation is insufficient and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The Court cites counsel in direct contempt of court.<br><br>Direct contempt, or contempt in <span style="font-style: italic;">facie curiae,</span> is misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge so as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before the same, including disrespect toward the court, and can be punished summarily without hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; It is conduct directed against or assailing the authority and dignity of the court or a judge, or in the doing of a forbidden act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>As had been earlier observed, it is insulting to assert a claim before this Supreme Court based on an obvious and incompetent forgery and conceived by one with so primitive a sense of what normative standards would pass judicial muster.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; We cannot accept counsel's declarations of good faith and honest mistake since, as a member of the Bar and an officer of the court, he is presumed to know better.&nbsp; He is required to thoroughly prepare himself on the law and facts of his case and the evidence he will adduce.&nbsp; The minimum he could have done was to verify with the appropriate authorities the documents upon which his clients based their claims, and not have relied on his clients' assertions.<br><br>Counsel's actuations may even constitute a violation of the lawyer's oath.&nbsp; As an officer of the court, he is reminded of his basic duties to observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in court, nor mislead or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Counsel's act of filing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Petition-In-Intervention</span> based on a spurious judicial decision constitutes direct contempt of court.&nbsp; A person found guilty of direct contempt may be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand pesos or imprisonment not exceeding ten (10) days, or both, if it be a Regional Trial Court or a court of equivalent or higher rank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Under the circumstances, a fine of Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00) would be appropriate.<br><br>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, Atty.
