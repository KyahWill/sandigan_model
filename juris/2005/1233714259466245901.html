Bautista, as lessee, executed a contract of lease over one-half portion of the said property, shown in the sketch appended thereto as Annex "A."&nbsp; The lease was for the period of October 1, 1966 to midnight of October 1, 1990.&nbsp; The property was to be used for shipyard slipways and the lessee's other allied businesses.&nbsp; The NIC obliged itself to construct two slipways, with all its accessories, within the first 10 years of the lease with a total value of not less than P450,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On March 14, 1973, the property was mortgaged to the China Banking Corporation (CBC) as security for a loan by two of Carmen Cruz's children, Mariano and Gabriel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The owner's duplicate of the title was delivered to and kept by the CBC as mortgagee.<br><br>On December 31, 1974, Carmen Cruz executed a Deed of Absolute Sale of Realty with Assumption of Mortgage in which she, as vendor, sold and conveyed the property to her children, namely, Serafin D. Cruz (married <br> to Adelaida Cruz), Mariano Cruz, Rogelio Cruz, Sr. Carmencita Cruz and Sr. Mary Carmela Cruz, for the purchase price of P350,000.00 which the vendor acknowledged to have received from the vendees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated November 22, 1976, Mariano Cruz, in his behalf and in behalf of the other vendees, requested CBC to conform to the sale of the property, a copy of which was attached to the said letter.&nbsp;

However, on June 28, 1977, the CBC, through counsel, wrote Mariano Cruz, informing him that Carmen Cruz had instructed it not to conform to the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage, and not to surrender the owner's duplicate of the said title.<br><br>In the meantime, the balance of the loan account secured by the mortgage was paid to the CBC.&nbsp; Thus, on June 29, 1977, the CBC executed a Cancellation of Real Estate Mortgage over the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> However, the deed was not presented to the Register of Deeds for registration.<br><br>On the same day, Mariano Cruz executed an Affidavit of Adverse Claim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> stating, <i>inter alia</i>, that he and the others named therein were the vendees of the property as evidenced by a Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage appended thereto, and that, to protect their rights and interests, the said affidavit of adverse claim was being executed as a cautionary notice to third persons and the world that the property had been sold to them.&nbsp; It was, likewise, stated that Carmen Cruz had ordered the CBC not to surrender the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 81574.&nbsp; The aforesaid affidavit of adverse claim was inscripted at the dorsal portion of the title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> on June 30, 1977 as Entry No. 22178.<br><br>In a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated July 1, 1977, the Register of Deeds requested CBC to surrender the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 81574, pursuant to Section 72 of Act 496, in order that proper memorandum be made thereon.&nbsp; The Register of Deeds was obviously unaware that the CBC had already executed the cancellation of real estate mortgage on June 29, 1977.<br><br>On July 30, 1977, Carmen Cruz, as lessor, and the NIC, as lessee, executed a Supplementary Lease Agreement;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the October 5, 1966 Contract of Lease earlier executed by the parties was modified, in that the terms of the lease was extended for another 15 years to expire on October 1, 2005.&nbsp;

On the same day, the parties executed a Contract of Lease<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> over an additional portion of the property, with an area of 590.58 square meters, as shown in the sketch appended thereto.&nbsp; However, the said contracts were not presented for registration to the Register of Deeds.<br><br>On September 14, 1977, the aforesaid Cancellation of Real Estate Mortgage the CBC had earlier executed (on June 29, 1977) was presented to the Register of Deeds and annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 81574 as Entry No. 27796.&nbsp; The following were, likewise, presented to the Register of Deeds for registration, and, thereafter, annotated at the dorsal portion of the said title: the Contract of Lease dated October 5, 1966 (Entry No. 27797), the July 30, 1977 Contract of Lease (Entry No. 27798), and the Supplementary Lease Agreement (Entry No. 27799).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Mariano Cruz and the other vendees presented the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage to the Register of Deeds for registration.&nbsp; On December 19, 1977, the Register of Deeds cancelled the said title and issued TCT No. 11272 in the names of the new owners.&nbsp; TCT No. 11272 was later cancelled by TCT No. R-11830.<br><br>In a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated October 20, 1978, Mariano Cruz, <i>et al.</i> informed the NIC that the property had been sold to them, and gave it 30 days from receipt of the letter to vacate the property and return possession to them.&nbsp; The vendees, likewise, informed the NIC that since the October 5, 1966 Contracts of Lease and the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement were annotated at the back of TCT No. 81574 only on September 14, 1977, after the affidavit of adverse claim of Mariano Cruz, <i>et al.</i> was annotated on June 29, 1977, such contracts were null and void.&nbsp; However, the NIC refused to vacate the property.<br><br>In the meantime, the property was subdivided into three lots: Lots 1-A, 1-B and 1-C.&nbsp; Lot 1-A had an area of 6,307 square meters, covered by TCT No. 85099<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> issued on July 5, 1982.<br><br>Carmen Cruz filed a complaint with the RTC of Navotas against Cipriano Bautista, in his capacity as president of the NIC, for the declaration of nullity of the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease, and for the cancellation of the annotation at the back of TCT No. 81574 referring to the said contracts.&nbsp; The complaint was amended to implead the NIC as party-defendant.&nbsp; Carmen Cruz alleged therein that she was the owner-lessor of the property subject of the said contract; the NIC failed to construct the two slipways within the period stated in the lease contract; it took advantage of the animosity between her and her children, and caused the preparation of the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease; the NIC was able to insert therein blatantly erroneous, one-sided and highly unfair provisions; and that the said contracts were even extended for a period long beyond her life expectancy (the plaintiff was then almost 80 years old).&nbsp; She further alleged that the provisions in the Contract of Lease and Supplementary Lease Agreement which granted NIC the exclusive option to buy the property, was a sham.&nbsp; She prayed that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in her favor:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered declaring the Supplementary Contract of Lease dated July 30, 1977 as null and void <i>ab initio</i>; ordering the defendant and all persons claiming possession of the premises under it to vacate and turn over the premises to the plaintiffs; ordering the defendant to pay the reasonable monthly rental of P10,000.00 for the occupancy of the premises, beginning October 1, 1990, until it vacates the premises; ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P30,000.00 as moral damages; the sum of P50,000.00 as attorney's fees, and the sum of P1,000.00 as appearance fee of the undersigned counsel; to pay the sum of P5,000.00 as litigation expenses; plus costs of suit.<br><br>Plaintiffs further pray for such other relief and remedies they are entitled to in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Mariano Cruz and his siblings filed a complaint-in-intervention in the said case, alleging that they were the co-owners of the property, and praying that judgment be rendered in their favor, as follows:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered rescinding the Contract of Lease dated October 5, 1966, (Annex "B"), declaring as null and void the Supplementary Lease Agreement (Annex "C"), and the Contract of Lease (Annex "D"), both dated July 30, 1977, for having been entered into by the plaintiff who had long ceased to be the owner of the property in question, awarding the sum of P450,000.00, actual damages, representing the value of the improvements which the defendants bound themselves to introduce in the premises; awarding the plaintiffs-intervenors the sum of P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; the sum of P150,000.00 as moral damages; P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and P10,000.00 as litigation expenses.<br><br>Plaintiffs-intervenors further pray for such other relief and remedies they are entitled to in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>However, Carmen Cruz filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.&nbsp; On February 6, 1984, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> granting the motion and dismissing the amended complaint and the complaint-in-intervention.&nbsp; The order became final and executory.<br><br>On June 23, 1990, Mariano Cruz, <i>et al</i>. wrote the NIC that they would no longer renew the October 5, 1966 contract of lease which was to expire on October 1, 1990; as far as they were concerned, the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease were null and void, the same having been executed and annotated on September 14, 1977 at the back of TCT No. 81574 long after the annotation of the affidavit of the adverse claim of Mariano Cruz, <i>et al</i>. on June 30, 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated January 11, 1991, Mariano Cruz, <i>et al</i>. wrote the NIC, demanding that it vacate the property within 30 days from notice thereof, otherwise, a complaint for unlawful detainer would be filed against it.&nbsp; However, the NIC refused to vacate the property.<br><br>On April 18, 1991, Mariano Cruz and his siblings filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> against the NIC with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Navotas for ejectment. However, on June 11, 1992, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dismissing the complaint, on the ground that it had no jurisdiction over the case, it appearing that the validity of the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and the Contract of Lease, in relation to the deed of absolute sale with assumption of mortgage executed by Carmen Cruz, were intertwined with the issue of NIC's right of possession.&nbsp; The plaintiffs sought a motion for reconsideration of the decision, which the MTC denied on September 15, 1992. The plaintiffs appealed to the RTC, which rendered a decision granting the appealed decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The plaintiffs-appellants filed a petition for review with the CA.&nbsp; On July 13, 1993, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC and dismissed the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The decision became final and executory.<br><br>In the meantime, Mariano Cruz died intestate and was survived by his son Mariano Cruz, Jr.;&nbsp; Rogelio Cruz, likewise, died and was survived by his children Sylvia, Rosyl, Rogelio, Jr., Sergio and Estrella, all surnamed Cruz; Serafin Cruz also died and was survived by his wife Adelaida, and his children Merceditas and Gabriel.&nbsp; TCT No. 81574 was reconstituted and TCT No. R-85099 was issued.<br><br>On January 24, 1995, German and Marcelo Cruz, Rosalina Cruz-Laiz, Mariano Cruz, Jr. and the said heirs filed a Complaint against Carmen Cruz, as unwilling plaintiff, and the NIC with the RTC of Malabon for the nullification of the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease.&nbsp; The complaint was amended to allege that they were the co-owners of the property covered by TCT No. 85099 based on the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage executed by Carmen Cruz on December 31, 1974;&nbsp; an affidavit of adverse claim was annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 81574 on June 30, 1977, despite which NIC caused Carmen Cruz to execute, on July 30, 1977, a Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease by taking advantage of her age, mental weakness and lack of will; and that NIC failed to pay rentals for the property.&nbsp; The plaintiffs prayed that:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that, after trial on the merits, judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiffs as follows: <ol> <li><u>Under the First Alternative Cause of Action</u>, declaring the Contract of Lease dated 30 July 1977 and the Supplementary Lease Contract dated 30 July 1977, Annex "D" hereof, as null and void <i><u>ab initio</u></i>;

she admitted that the plaintiffs were the co-owners of the property; Bautista was granted an "exclusive option to buy" the leased property at the ridiculously low fixed price of P1,600,000.00, which, according to Carmen Cruz, was an option unsupported by any consideration; hence, null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Carmen Cruz prayed that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in her favor:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that the complaint as against answering defendant be dismissed, and that:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>AS TO THE CROSS-CLAIM</u><br></div><br>a) The Contract of Lease and the Supplemental Lease Contract be declared null and void due to vitiated consent;<br><br>b) In the event that monetary judgment be rendered by this Honorable Court against answering defendant in favor of the plaintiffs, her co-defendants, Navotas Industrial Corporation and Bautista, be made to reimburse her for all or part of the said judgment;<br><br>c) Co-defendants be ordered to pay her moral as well as exemplary damages in the amount which this Honorable Court may deem just and proper;<br><br>d) Co-defendants, instead of answering defendants, be, likewise, ordered to pay the plaintiffs, the rentals in arrears over the premises which now amounts to P147,000.00.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>BOTH AS TO COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM</u><br></div><br>a) Plaintiffs and co-defendants be ordered, jointly and severally, to reimburse answering defendant the sum of P30,000.00 which the latter paid her counsel as and for attorney's fees for unnecessarily dragging her into this suit including the amount of P1,000.00 which she will pay her lawyer for every appearance;<br><br>b) Likewise, the costs of suit and other litigation expenses.<br><br>Other reliefs and remedies reasonable under the premises are similarly prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>In its amended answer, NIC alleged that its July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease were valid, whereas the deed of absolute sale with assumption of mortgage executed by Carmen Cruz in favor of the plaintiffs was null and void for being simulated and fraudulent.&nbsp; NIC and Bautista further alleged that it was exercising its option to buy the subject property now covered by TCT No. 85099;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> it, likewise, offered P1,600,000.00 as consideration for the sale to be paid upon the execution of a deed of transfer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>NIC and Bautista prayed that, after due proceeding, judgment be rendered in their favor, thus:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, herein answering defendants respectfully prayed that the complaint be dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>On the Counterclaim: (a) that the "Contract of Lease" and the "Supplementary Lease Agreement" be declared valid, legal and binding between Carmen Vda. de Cruz and defendants Navotas and Bautista, as well as their respective heirs, successors or assigns, while the "Deed of Absolute Sale with Assumption of Mortgage" be declared null and void so far as it prejudiced and adversely affected the rights of defendants Navotas and Bautista on the portion of the property leased to it;

Said contracts of lease were belatedly annotated two months after its execution or on September 14, 1977 only, after appellees were allegedly warned by CARMEN that her children are desirous of the property leased in their favor.&nbsp; To say the least, this warning from CARMEN should have aroused appellees' suspicion regarding the status of the prime property they intend to lease for another fifteen (15) years. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 110 of Act No. 496 was the law in force when Carmen Cruz executed the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage, and when the respondents executed the affidavit of adverse claim and presented it to the Register of Deeds on June 30, 1977.&nbsp; The petitioner's reliance on the said provision is misplaced.&nbsp; Indeed, the Register of Deeds acted in accord with Section 110 of Act No. 496 when he inscribed the affidavit of adverse claim at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 81574, despite the non-production of the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 81574 simultaneously with the presentation of the affidavit of adverse claim.&nbsp; The law reads:<br><blockquote> SEC. 110.&nbsp; Whoever claims any part or interest in registered land adverse to the registered owner, arising subsequent to the date of the original registration, may, if no other provision is made in this Act for registering the same, make a statement in writing setting forth fully his alleged right or interest, and how or under whom acquired, and a reference to the volume and page of the certificate of title of the registered owner, and a description of the land in which the right or interest is claimed.<br><br>The statement shall be signed and sworn to, and shall state the adverse claimant's residence, and designate a place at which all notices may be served upon him. This statement shall be entitled to registration as an adverse claim, and the court, upon a petition of any party-in-interest, shall grant a speedy hearing upon the question of the validity of such adverse claim and shall enter such decree therein as justice and equity may require.&nbsp; If the claim is adjudged to be invalid, the registration shall be cancelled.&nbsp; If in any case the court, after notice and hearing, shall find that a claim thus registered was frivolous or vexatious, it may tax the adverse claimant double or treble costs in its discretion.<br></blockquote>Irrefragably, the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage which Carmen Cruz executed on December 31, 1974 was a voluntary act; and under Section 50 of the law, the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the land.&nbsp; Indeed, Section 55 of Act No. 496 provides that the presentation of the owner's duplicate certificate of title for the registration of any voluntary instrument is required:<br><blockquote> SEC. 55.&nbsp; No new certificate of title shall be entered, no memorandum shall be made upon any certificate of title by the register of deeds, in pursuance of any deed or other voluntary instrument, unless the owner's duplicate certificate is presented for such indorsement, except in cases expressly provided for in this Act, or upon the order of the court for cause shown; and whenever such order is made, a memorandum thereof shall be entered upon the new certificate of title and upon the owner's duplicate: <i>Provided, however,</i> That in case the mortgagee refuses or fails to deliver within a reasonable time to the register of deeds the duplicate or copy of the certificate of title surrendered by the owner, after advice by said officer, in order to enable him to register or annotate thereon another real right acquired by said owner, the record or annotation made on the certificate in the register book shall be valid for all legal purposes.<br><br>The production of the owner's duplicate certificate whenever any voluntary instrument is presented for registration shall be conclusive authority from the registered owner to the register of deeds to enter a new certificate or to make a memorandum of registration in accordance with such instrument, and the new certificate or memorandum shall be binding upon the registered owner and upon all persons claiming under him, in favor of every purchaser for value and in good faith: <i>Provided, however,</i> That in all cases of registration procured by fraud the owner may pursue all his legal and equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud, without prejudice, however, to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of title: <i>And provided, further,</i> That after the transcription of the decree of registration under this Act procured by the presentation of a forged duplicate certificate, or of a forged deed or other instrument, shall be null and void.&nbsp; In case of the loss or theft of an owner's duplicate certificate, notice shall be sent by the owner or by someone in his behalf to the register of deeds of the province in which the land lies as soon as the loss or theft is discovered.<br></blockquote>This Court explained the rationale of the requirement in <i>L.P. Leviste &amp; Company, Inc. v. Noblejas</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><blockquote> The basis of respondent Villanueva's adverse claim was an agreement to sell executed in her favor by Garcia Realty.&nbsp; An agreement to sell is a voluntary instrument as it is a willful act of the registered owner.&nbsp; As such voluntary instrument, Section 50 of Act No. 496 expressly provides that the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the land.&nbsp; And Section 55 of the same Act requires the presentation of the owner's duplicate certificate of title for the registration of any deed or voluntary instrument. As the agreement to sell involves an interest less than an estate in fee simple, the same should have been registered by filing it with the Register of Deeds who, in turn, makes a brief memorandum thereof upon the original and owner's duplicate certificate of title.&nbsp; The reason for requiring the production of the owner's duplicate certificate in the registration of a voluntary instrument is that, being a willful act of the registered owner, it is to be presumed that he is interested in registering the instrument and would willingly surrender, present or produce his duplicate certificate of title to the Register of Deeds in order to accomplish such registration. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>However, in this case, Carmen Cruz had ordered the CBC, the mortgagee and custodian of the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 81574, not to surrender the owner's duplicate of the said title to the Register of Deeds.&nbsp; The latter thus acted in accord with law when the affidavit of adverse claim was inscribed at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 81574 on June 30, 1977.&nbsp; Indeed, this Court ruled in <i>L.P. Leviste &amp; Company, Inc. v. Noblejas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> that:<br><blockquote> ... However, where the owner refuses to surrender the duplicate certificate for the annotation of the voluntary instrument, the grantee may file with the Register of Deeds a statement setting forth his adverse claim, as provided for in Section 110 of Act No. 496.&nbsp; In such a case, the annotation of the instrument upon the entry book is sufficient to affect the real estate to which it relates, although Section 72 of Act No. 496 imposes upon the Register of Deeds the duty to require the production by the Registered owner of his duplicate certificate for the inscription of the adverse claim.&nbsp; The annotation of an adverse claim is a measure designed to protect the interest of a person over a piece of real property where the registration of such interest or right is not, otherwise, provided for by the Land Registration Act, and serves as a notice and warning to third parties dealing with said property that someone is claiming an interest on the same or a better right than the registered owner thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, on June 29, 1977, the balance of Mariano Cruz and Gabriel Cruz's account with the CBC had already been paid, presumably by Mariano Cruz; and the CBC had executed a cancellation of real estate mortgage.&nbsp; However, the said deed was inexplicably not presented to the Register of Deeds for registration.<br><br>The general rule is that a person dealing with registered land is not required to go behind the register to determine the condition of the property.&nbsp; However, such person is charged with notice of the burden on the property which is noted on the face of the register or certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> A person who deals with registered land is bound by the liens and encumbrances including adverse claim annotated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the present action, the petitioner caused the annotation of the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Sale only on September 14, 1977, long after the annotation of the respondents' adverse claim at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 81574 <i>on June 30, 1977</i>.&nbsp; Thus, as of that date, the petitioner had constructive knowledge of the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage Carmen Cruz executed on December 31, 1974 in favor of her children.&nbsp; Even before July 30, 1977, the petitioner had knowledge that Carmen Cruz was no longer the owner of the property, and had no more right to execute the July 30, 1977 Supplementary Lease Agreement and Contract of Lease.&nbsp; The registration of the said lease contracts was of no moment, since it is understood to be without prejudice to the better rights of third parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>While it is true that in the complaint and amended complaint in Civil Case No. C-7040, Carmen Cruz alleged that she was the owner-lessor of the property, such allegation cannot detract from the fact that the property had already been registered under the names of the respondents under TCT No. 11272, later cancelled by TCT No. R-11830.&nbsp; The petitioner was informed by the respondents that they were the registered owners of the property.&nbsp; Moreover, the already aging Carmen Cruz and her children had a domestic quarrel, and animosity that caused her to go into seclusion; she thought then that her children had abandoned her.&nbsp; The attendant circumstances must have influenced Carmen Cruz to erroneously allege in her complaint that she was the owner of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Even then, on February 23, 1988, Carmen Cruz executed an Affidavit in which she swore that she had sold the property to her children:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>That among the parcels of land which I have sold was that parcel located in Barrio Almacen, Navotas, Rizal, then covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 81574 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal in favor of my children Serafin D.

After she sold the subject lot to the plaintiffs herein, the latter tried to effect the registration and annotation of the said transfer with the Registry of Deeds of Rizal sometime in 28 June 1977 but China Banking Corporation, the mortgagee, through its legal counsel, Atty.
