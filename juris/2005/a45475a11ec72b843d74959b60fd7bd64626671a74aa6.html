(ITM), Grand Textile Manufacturing Corporation (Grandtex) and IFC as parties thereto.&nbsp; ITM and Grandtex agreed to guarantee PPIC's obligations under the loan agreement.<br><br>"PPIC paid the installments due on June 1, 1977, December 1, 1977 and June 1, 1978.&nbsp; The payments due on December 1, 1978, June 1, 1979 and December 1, 1979 were rescheduled as requested by PPIC.&nbsp; Despite the rescheduling of the installment payments, however, PPIC defaulted.&nbsp; Hence, on April 1, 1985, IFC served a written notice of default to PPIC demanding the latter to pay the outstanding principal loan and all its accrued interests.&nbsp; Despite such notice, PPIC failed to pay the loan and its interests.<br><br>"By virtue of PPIC's failure to pay, IFC, together with DBP, applied for the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages on the real estate, buildings, machinery, equipment plant and all improvements owned by PPIC, located at Calamba, Laguna, with the regional sheriff of Calamba, Laguna.&nbsp; On July 30, 1985, the deputy sheriff of Calamba, Laguna issued a notice of extrajudicial sale.&nbsp; IFC and DBP were the only bidders during the auction sale.&nbsp; IFC's bid was for P99,269,100.00 which was equivalent to US$5,250,000.00 (at the prevailing exchange rate of P18.9084 = US$1.00).&nbsp; The outstanding loan, however, amounted to US$8,083,967.00 thus leaving a balance of US$2,833,967.00.&nbsp; PPIC failed to pay the remaining balance.<br><br>"Consequently, IFC demanded ITM and Grandtex, as guarantors of PPIC, to pay the outstanding balance.&nbsp; However, despite the demand made by IFC, the outstanding balance remained unpaid.<br><br>"Thereafter, on May 20, 1988, IFC filed a complaint with the RTC of Manila against PPIC and ITM for the payment of the outstanding balance plus interests and attorney's fees.<br><br>"The trial court held PPIC liable for the payment of the outstanding loan plus interests.&nbsp; It also ordered PPIC to pay IFC its claimed attorney's fees.&nbsp; However, the trial court relieved ITM of its obligation as guarantor.&nbsp; Hence, the trial court dismissed IFC's complaint against ITM.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x&nbsp;

font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the Guarantee Agreement</span><br></div><br>The present controversy arose from the following Contracts:&nbsp; (1) the Loan Agreement dated December 17, 1974, between IFC and PPIC;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and (2) the Guarantee Agreement dated December 17, 1974, between ITM and Grandtex, on the one hand, and IFC on the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>IFC claims that, under the Guarantee Agreement, ITM bound itself as a surety to PPIC's obligations proceeding from the Loan Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; For its part, ITM asserts that, by the terms of the Guarantee Agreement, it was merely a guarantor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and not a surety.&nbsp; Moreover, any ambiguity in the Agreement should be construed against IFC -- the party that drafted it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;

The Guarantors <span style="font-style: italic;">jointly </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">severally</span>, irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantee, as <span style="font-style: italic;">primary obligors</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">and not as sureties merely</span>, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and interest and commitment charge on, the Loan, and the principal of, and interest on, the Notes, whether at stated maturity or upon prematuring, all as set forth in the Loan Agreement and in the Notes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The Agreement uses "guarantee" and "guarantors," prompting ITM to base its argument on those words.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; This Court is not convinced that the use of the two words limits the Contract to a mere guaranty.&nbsp; The specific stipulations in the Contract show otherwise.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Solidary Liability</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Agreed to by ITM</span><br><br>While referring to ITM as a guarantor, the Agreement specifically stated that the corporation was "jointly and severally" liable.&nbsp; To put emphasis on the nature of that liability, the Contract further stated that ITM was a primary obligor, not a <span style="font-style: italic;">mere </span>surety.&nbsp; Those stipulations meant only one thing: that <span style="font-style: italic;">at bottom</span>, and to all legal intents and purposes, it was a surety.<br><br>Indubitably therefore, ITM bound itself to be solidarily<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> liable with PPIC for the latter's obligations under the Loan Agreement with IFC.&nbsp; ITM thereby brought itself to the level of PPIC and could not be deemed merely secondarily liable.<br><br>Initially, ITM was a stranger to the Loan Agreement between PPIC and IFC.&nbsp; ITM's liability commenced only when it guaranteed PPIC's obligation.&nbsp; It became a surety when it bound itself solidarily with the principal obligor.&nbsp; Thus, the applicable law is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Article 2047.&nbsp; By guaranty, a person, called the guarantor binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the principal in case the latter should fail to do so.<br><br>"If a person binds himself solidarily with the principal debtor, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this Book shall be observed.&nbsp; In such case the contract shall be called suretyship."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The aforementioned provisions refer to Articles 1207 to 1222 of the Civil Code on "Joint and Solidary Obligations."&nbsp; Relevant to this case is Article 1216, which states:<br><blockquote>"The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously.&nbsp; The demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to those which may subsequently be directed against the others, so long as the debt has not been fully collected."<br></blockquote>Pursuant to this provision, petitioner (as creditor) was justified in taking action directly against respondent.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">No Ambiguity in the</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Undertaking</span><br><br>The Court does not find any ambiguity in the provisions of the Guarantee Agreement.&nbsp; When qualified by the term "jointly and severally," the use of the word "guarantor" to refer to a "surety" does not violate the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; As Article 2047 provides, a suretyship is created when a guarantor binds itself solidarily with the principal obligor.&nbsp; Likewise, the phrase in the Agreement -- "as primary obligor and not merely as surety" -- stresses that ITM is being placed on the same level as PPIC.&nbsp; Those words emphasize the nature of their liability, which the law characterizes as a suretyship.<br><br>The use of the word "guarantee" does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> make the contract one of guaranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; This Court has recognized that the word is frequently employed in business transactions to describe the intention to be bound by a primary or an independent obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; The very terms of a contract govern the obligations of the parties or the extent of the obligor's liability.&nbsp; Thus, this Court has ruled in favor of suretyship, even though contracts were denominated as a "Guarantor's Undertaking" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> or a "Continuing Guaranty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Contracts have the force of law between the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> who are free to stipulate any matter not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; None of these circumstances are present, much less alleged by respondent.&nbsp; Hence, this Court cannot give a different meaning to the plain language of the Guarantee Agreement.<br><br>Indeed, the finding of solidary liability is in line with the premise provided in the "Whereas" clause of the Guarantee Agreement.&nbsp; The execution of the Agreement was a condition precedent for the approval of PPIC's loan from IFC.&nbsp; Consistent with the position of IFC as creditor was its requirement of a higher degree of liability from ITM in case PPIC committed a breach.&nbsp; ITM agreed with the stipulation in Section 2.01 and is now estopped from feigning ignorance of its solidary liability.&nbsp; The literal meaning of the stipulations control when the terms of the contract are clear and there is no doubt as to the intention of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>We note that the CA denied solidary liability, on the theory that the parties would not have executed a Guarantee Agreement if they had intended to name ITM as a primary obligor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court opined that ITM's undertaking was collateral to and distinct from the Loan Agreement.&nbsp; On this point, the Court stresses that a suretyship is merely an accessory or a collateral to a principal obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Although a surety contract is secondary to the principal obligation, the liability of the surety is direct, primary and absolute; or equivalent to that of a regular party to the undertaking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; A surety becomes liable to the debt and duty of the principal obligor even without possessing a direct or personal interest in the obligations constituted by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ITM's Liability as Surety</span><br><br>With the present finding that ITM is a surety, it is clear that the CA erred in declaring the former secondarily liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; A surety is considered in law to be on the same footing as the principal debtor in relation to whatever is adjudged against the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Evidently, the dispositive portion of the assailed Decision should be modified to require ITM to pay the amount adjudged in favor of IFC.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Peripheral Issues</span><br></div><br>In addition to the main issue, ITM raised procedural infirmities allegedly justifying the denial of the present Petition.&nbsp; Before the trial court and the CA, IFC had allegedly instituted different arguments that effectively changed the corporation's theory on appeal, in violation of this Court's previous pronouncements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; ITM further claims that the main issue in the present case is a question of fact that is not cognizable by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>These contentions deserve little consideration.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Alleged Change of</span><br style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Theory on Appeal</span><br><br>Petitioner's arguments before the trial court (that ITM was a "primary obligor") and before the CA (that ITM was a "surety") were related and intertwined in the action to enforce the solidary liability of ITM under the Guarantee Agreement.&nbsp; We emphasize that the terms "primary obligor" and "surety" were premised on the same stipulations in Section 2.01 of the Agreement.&nbsp; Besides, both terms had the same legal consequences.&nbsp; There was therefore effectively no change of theory on appeal.&nbsp; At any rate, ITM failed to show to this Court a disparity between IFC's allegations in the trial court and those in the CA.&nbsp; Bare allegations without proof deserve no credence.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;

The assailed Decision was based on a misapprehension of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> which particularly related to certain stipulations in the Guarantee Agreement -- stipulations that had not been disputed by the parties.&nbsp; This circumstance compelled the Court to review the Contract firsthand and to make its own findings and conclusions accordingly.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;
