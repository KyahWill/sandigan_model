Chavez to respondent dated August 8, 2001 confirming the receipt of two folders relative to the cases she filed against Lourdes Fresnoza Boon and Mona Lisa San Juan, requesting Atty.

No. 00-22089-90 was dismissed by the Makati Prosecutor’s Office by Resolution dated August 18, 2000 due to lack of probable cause and, in any event, the issues raised therein were in the nature of intra-corporate disputes which are properly cognizable by another forum, viz:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">careful</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">examination</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">evaluation</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">evidence</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">adduced</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complainant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undersigned</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investigating</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prosecutor</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finds</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">probable</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cause</span> to hold respondent for the offense charged of Estafa.&nbsp; Apparently, there was no deceit and/or unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence employed by respondent when complainant agreed to invest her money in the restaurant business under the name and style of La Gondola, Inc. which is owned by respondent. xxx In the present case, though, complainant alleged that respondent immediately upon receipt of the P4,800,000.00 representing her investment in the restaurant business, executed earlier in favor of Philippine Commercial and International Bank whereby La Gondola assumed the loans and credit accommodations obtained by Lucre Export/Import Inc., using the funds of La Gondola, Inc.; respondent being the President and majority owner of the latter corporation.&nbsp; However, outside of the mere allegation of complainant that respondent allegedly assumed the loans and credit accommodations extended to the other company using the funds&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of La Gondola, Inc., no concrete and real evidence were presented and/or proven&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to this effect by complainant. xxx<br><br>Moreover, it is apparent <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">issues</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">raised</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complainant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appears</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intra-corporate</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disputes</span> which could be very well settled in another forum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Notably, a similar complaint for the same offense, docketed as I.S. No. 99-H-2780, had been previously filed by complainant against Ms. Boon which case was dismissed for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As thus observed by the Office of the Bar Confidant, the filing of an appeal from the prosecutor’s resolution would have been inutile since the facts and issues raised in the estafa case had already been twice passed upon by the Office of the City Prosecutor, hence, it would likely be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>No fault or negligence can also be attributed to respondent in the dismissal of I.S. No. 2000-G-22087-88 against Julie Teh.&nbsp; By Resolution of August 14, 2000 of the Makati Prosecutor’s Office, it is clear that it was dismissed, in the main, on the ground that the offense charged did not actually exist and complainant failed to appear and present the original checks, viz:<br><blockquote>After a careful evaluation of the evidence on record, the undersigned recommends for the dismissal of the present complaints on the following grounds:<br><ol><li>Despite reasonable opportunity given to her, complainant failed to appear and present the original copies of the subject checks and other documents attached to the complaint.<br><br></li><li>The subject checks were presented after the 90-day period hence there is no more presumption of knowledge of the insufficiency of funds.&nbsp; Accordingly, the burden is shifted upon the complainant to prove that at the time the checks were issued, the drawer knew that he had insufficient funds.&nbsp; There is no allegation much less proof to that effect.&nbsp; The result is that the element of knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit is not present, therefore the crime does not exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On the alleged failure of respondent to appear during the hearing of I.S. No. 2000-G-22087-88 and his failure to present the original of the checks subject thereof, they being then in the possession of complainant who was abroad at that time:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Such failure to present the original of the checks cannot solely be attributed to respondent, for she herself was guilty of neglect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>As for the alleged compulsion in the settlement of her two complaints for violation of B.P. Blg. 22 in accordance with the terms dictated by the therein respondents Mona Lisa San Juan and Elizabeth Chan Ong, upon the promise of respondent that he would waive the 10% success fee in the complaint to be filed against Swire Development:&nbsp; Assuming the truthfulness of her allegation that respondent compelled her to settle, what the terms were as alleged to have been dictated by Ms. San Juan and Ms. Chan Ong, and the manner and/or extent of prejudice she suffered, complainant did not establish.&nbsp; Moreover, she failed to show that the promise by respondent that he would waive the 10% success fee was for the purpose of defrauding her or of such nature as to constitute undue influence, thereby depriving her of reasonable freedom of choice.<br><br>Subsequent to the amicable settlement, it appears that complainant never raised any objection to the terms of the compromise.&nbsp; As an accepted rule, when a client, upon becoming aware of the compromise and the judgment thereon, fails to promptly repudiate the action of his attorney, he will not afterwards be heard to complain about it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As for complainant’s claim that the amount of P51,716.54, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">amount</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">record</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complainant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">paid</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent’s</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">legal</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">services</span>, was intended for the filing fees in the complaint against Swire Development Corporation, the same was not substantiated as in fact the retainer agreement does not so confirm.<br><blockquote>We would like to thank you for retaining our law firm in the handling and representation of your case.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regard</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">five</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cases</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">referred</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">us,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aggregate</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acceptance</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fee</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P200,000</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pesos</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Appearance</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fee</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P1,500.00</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pesos</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">per</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hearing</span>.&nbsp; As regards the damages to be recovered, we will get 10% thereof by way of Success Fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>If, admittedly, the only payment given to complainant by respondent is the amount of P51,716.54, then complainant still owes respondent more, as respondent rendered his legal services in 4 out of the 5 cases. An acceptance fee is not a contingent fee, but is an absolute fee arrangement which entitles a lawyer to get paid for his efforts regardless of the outcome of the litigation.&nbsp; That complainant was dissatisfied with the outcome of the four cases does not render void the above retainer agreement for respondent appears to have represented the interest of complainant.&nbsp; Litigants need to be reminded that lawyers are not demi-gods or “magicians” who can always win their cases for their clients no matter the utter lack of merit of the same or how passionate the litigants may feel about their cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In sum, this Court finds well taken the finding of the Office of the Bar Confidant that complainant failed to establish the guilt of respondent by clear, convincing and satisfactory proof.&nbsp; The charges against him must thus be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>However, since respondent had been advised by complainant through counsel Chavez Laureta and Associates, by letter of July 18, 2001, that she intended to terminate his services, as of said date, he was obliged, under Rule 22.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, viz:<br><blockquote>Rule 22.02 – A lawyer who withdraws or is discharged shall, subject to a retainer lien, immediately turn over all papers and property to which the client is entitled, and shall cooperate with his successor in the orderly transfer of the matter, including all information necessary for the proper handling of the matter,<br></blockquote>to immediately turn over all papers and property which complainant entrusted to his successor.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the complaint is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.&nbsp; Respondent is, however, hereby directed to RETURN all the records in his possession relative to the cases he handled for complainant.<br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,</i> and<i> Garcia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 1-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Canon 16. – A lawyer shall hold in trust all moneys and properties of his client that may come into his possession.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Rule 16.03 – A lawyer shall deliver the funds and property of his client when due or upon demand.&nbsp;
