				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Atty. Artemio P. Cabatos (respondent) was administratively charged<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by Judge Gervacio A. Lopena (complainant) of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Tagbilaran-Clarin, Bohol of SERIOUS BREACH OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS and GRAVE MISCONDUCT allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>1) Respondent knowingly falsified a Deed of Donation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> purportedly executed by one Crispina Panis by notarizing the same on June 24, 1981 when the donor had died on January 15, 1981, and<br><br>2) Respondent "showed a grave disrespect to the courts and the administration of justice" by holding, together with his followers, a parade/rally on September 21, 1984 around the principal streets of Tagbilaran City, directed against complainant who had convicted respondent's close relatives in three criminal cases and denied the applications for probation of two of the convicts.<br></blockquote>Acting on this Court's Resolution of February 14, 1990,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> respondent submitted his COMMENT, by letter of April 19, 1990,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> claiming that he had been away from his place of birth, Panaytayon, Tubigon, Bohol since 1958, hence, when he notarized the questioned deed of donation, he "really did not recognize the person of Cristina Panis," but he was led by one Gregorio Ricafort to believe that "the old woman before him at the time was the said Crispina Panis."<br><br>Respondent informed that his notarization of the questioned document in fact resulted to his indictment in court for reckless imprudence resulting in falsification of public document, which case was pending trial.<br><br>As for the charge of having conducted a rally/parade, respondent claimed that the same was staged by PDP Laban and BAYAN of Bohol as a protest against complainant who showed bias in presiding over the trial of the criminal cases against members of the Cabatos family and "disregarding the evidence in convicting them."<br><br>By Comment/Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to respondent's COMMENT, complainant countered that <u>one of the witnesses to the questioned document was respondent's father, Geronimo Cabatos</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <u>a permanent resident of Panaytayon</u> who knew as he was related by blood to Crispina Panis,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> hence, it is incredible for respondent not to know of Panis' death on January 15, 1981 or that "he did not know the person of . . . Panis [even if] he ha[d] been away from his place of birth since 1958."<br><br>This Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) by Resolution of June 4, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The <i>rollo</i> shows that complainant had been manifesting his zeal in pursuing the case, but until March 19, 2002 when a Commissioner of the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline issued a Notice of Hearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> directing the parties to appear at the IBP Building on April 19, 2002, the case appears to have in the interim remained dormant.<br><br>Due to the unavailability of complainant and the IBP Investigating Commissioner on the scheduled hearings on April 19, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and June 7, 2002, respectively, they were reset to June 28, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Before the June 28, 2002 scheduled hearing, complainant filed before the IBP a MANIFESTATION COUPLED WITH MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADING<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> wherein he expressed "wonder . . . why it took the Committee on Bar Discipline of the IBP over ten (10) long years to set th[e] case for hearing."<br><br>In the same Manifestation <i>cum</i> Motion, complainant informed that his two witnesses, Aniceta P.

There is no question that the complainant waived his right to present his evidence despite the opportunity given him by this Commission and in effect deprived the respondent the right to confront him and his witnesses.<br><br>However, this Commission would like to point out that there is no issue that respondent Atty. Cabatos did not exercise that degree of diligence required of him as a Notary Public.<br><br>It has been held in the case entitled <b><i>Flores v. Chua</i></b>, 306 SCRA 465, that where the notary public is a lawyer, a graver responsibility is placed upon his shoulder by reason of his solemn oath to obey the laws and to do no falsehood or consent to the doing of any.  And in the case <b><i>Nunga v. Viray</i></b>, 306 SCRA 487, the Honorable Court ruled that notaries public must observe with utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties.<br><br>In the case before us, the respondent himself admitted that he did not exert any effort to find out if the person who acknowledged to have executed the Deed of Donation was really Crispina Panis.  He merely relied on the assurance of Mr. Gregorio Ricafort that the person who appeared before him as Notary Public was the real Crispina Panis.  Considering that Tubigon, Bohol is a small town, it would have been easy to determine the real identity of the person claiming to have executed the document.<br><br>Moreover, it was easy for the respondent to require the person who claimed to have executed the questioned Deed of Donation to produce his Community Tax Certificate (formerly Residence Certificate) and any other documents to identify him or her.  This he did not do.<br><br>It can therefore be validly concluded that respondent Atty. Cabatos failed to exercise with utmost care and diligence his duties as Notary Public.<br><br>For these reasons, it is recommended that respondent Atty. Artemio P. Cabatos be reprimanded, with a warning that a graver penalty will be recommended to be imposed on him in the event he again fails to exercise that high degree of diligence required of a Notary Public in the performance of his duties as such.

By such information, he in fact impliedly admits that the document had already been signed when it was brought to him for notarization.<br><br>That a notary public should not notarize a document unless the persons who signed it are the same persons who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the contents of the truth of what are stated therein bears reiterating.  On pain of sounding like a broken record, this Court has repeatedly held that the purpose of the injunction is to enable the notary public to verify the genuineness of the signature of the acknowledging party - in this case Crispina Panis - and to ascertain that the document is the party's free act of deed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Respondent having thus failed to faithfully discharge his sacred duties as a notary public, under the facts and circumstances of the case, the revocation of his notarial commission and disqualification from being commissioned as notary public for a period of One (1) Year is in order.<br><br>As for the charge against respondent of showing "grave disrespect to the courts and the administration of justice" by holding a parade/rally, along with his followers, during which he imputed bias to complainant whom he branded as "worse than President Marcos," it has not been sufficiently substantiated.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the notarial commission of respondent, Atty.
