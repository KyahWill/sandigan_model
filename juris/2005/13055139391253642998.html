 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 56534.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals 
denied the petition of Security Bank and Trust Company (“Security Bank”)
 for failure to comply with Section 3, Rule 46 of the 1997 Rules of 
Civil Procedure as amended by Supreme Court Circular No. 39-98.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Antecedent Facts</span><br></div><br>On
 20 September 1996, Security Bank as mortgagee and Innovatech 
Development and Management Corporation (“Innovatech”) as mortgagor 
entered into a real estate mortgage.&nbsp; Innovatech secured its P25,000,000
 loan from Security Bank with a mortgage on fourteen condominium units 
located at Tito Jovy Tower, Buencamino St., Alabang, Muntinlupa City 
with Condominium Certificates of Title No. 41863, 41864, 41865, 41866, 
41867, 41868, 41869, 41870, 41871, 41872, 41873, 41875, 41876 and 41877 
of the Register of Deeds of Makati City.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 dated 1 July 1997, Inigo A. Nebrida and Librada C. Nebrida, 
Innovatech’s Vice-President and Treasurer, respectively, informed 
Security Bank that Innovatech sold the fourteen condominium units to 
Indiana Aerospace University (“Indiana”) of Mactan, Cebu.&nbsp; Innovatech 
provided Security Bank with copies of the Deed of Sale with Assumption 
of Mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> it made with 
Indiana as well as Indiana’s loan application with Bank of Southeast 
Asia for P69,000,000.&nbsp; According to Innovatech, part of the proceeds of 
Indiana’s loan with the Bank of Southeast Asia would be used to pay the 
loan with Security Bank.<br><br>The loan with Security Bank matured on 
19 September 1997 without payment from either Innovatech or Indiana.&nbsp; 
Consequently, Security Bank filed a petition for notarial foreclosure of
 the fourteen condominium units under Act No. 3135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 as amended by Act No. 4118.&nbsp; The public auction was held on 29 January 
1998, at 10:00 a.m., at the City Hall of Muntinlupa City.&nbsp; During the 
public auction, the condominium units were sold for P32,839,290 to 
Security Bank as the only and highest bidder.<br><br>On 25 February 
1998, Innovatech filed an action against Security Bank for Annulment of 
Extrajudicial Foreclosure Sale and Certificate of Sale, Reconveyance of 
Properties and Damages with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order and 
Writ of Preliminary Injunction.&nbsp; On 26 March 1998, the Regional Trial 
Court of Muntinlupa City, Branch 256 (“trial court”) granted the Writ of
 Preliminary Injunction in favor of Innovatech.<br><br>The 26 March 1998
 Order became the subject of a petition for certiorari docketed as 
CA-G.R. SP No. 49326 filed by Security Bank before the Court of 
Appeals.&nbsp; In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> promulgated on 24 August 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 the Court of Appeals dismissed Security Bank’s petition for lack of 
merit.&nbsp; However, in an Amended Decision promulgated on 8 June 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 the Court of Appeals set aside its 24 August 1999 Decision and 
nullified the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the trial court. 
Innovatech filed a motion for reconsideration of the Amended Decision 
but the Court of Appeals denied the motion in its Resolution of 19 
February 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Innovatech 
filed a petition, docketed as G.R. No. 152157, before this Court.&nbsp; This 
Court denied the petition in its 10 April 2002 Minute Resolution and 
denied with finality Innovatech’s motion for reconsideration on 6 
September 2002.<br><br>Meanwhile, on 22 June 1998, Indiana filed a 
Complaint-in-Intervention with prayer for the issuance of Temporary 
Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Prohibitory and Mandatory 
Injunction.<br><br>On 1 February 1999, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,
 the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction is GRANTED.&nbsp; Subject to 
the filing of a bond in the amount of P1,000,000.00 by 
Plaintiff-Intervenor to pay the damages which Defendant may sustain by 
reason of the issuance of the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, 
if this Court should finally decide that Plaintiff-Intervenor is not 
entitled thereto, the Office of the Registry of Deeds of Makati City and
 any person acting in its behalf, are hereby directed to cancel the 
registration and annotation of the Certificate of Sale dated January 29,
 1998 at the back of Condominium Certificates of Title [N]os. 41863, 
41864, 41865, 41866, 41867, 41868, 41869, 41870, 41871, 41872, 41873, 
41875, 41876 and 41877 which was inscribed thereon on February 3, 1998 
and known as Entry [N]o. 1454/CCT 41863.&nbsp; And since the regularity of 
the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings conducted by the Notary Public
 in connection with the condominium units covered by the aforementioned 
condominium certificates of title is one of the issues in this case, the
 Office of the Registry of Deeds and any person acting in its behalf are
 likewise enjoined and prohibited from subsequently undertaking the 
registration and annotation of the Certificate of Sale dated January 29,
 1998 at the back of Condominium Certificates of Title [N]os. 41863, 
41864, 41865, 41866, 41867, 41868, 41869, 41870, 41871, 41872, 41873, 
41875, 41876 and 41877 until further order from this Court and trial on 
the merits of the instant case.<br><br>Set this case for hearing on the merits on February 12 and 24, 1999 both at 9:30 a.m.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Security Bank moved for reconsideration of the Order.&nbsp; In its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of 3 November 1999, the trial court denied Security Bank’s motion for lack of merit.<br><br>Security Bank went to the Court of Appeals for relief.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Resolutions of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>In its assailed Resolution of 22 February 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied due course to Security Bank’s petition.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ruled:<br><blockquote>x
 x x However, the petition does not indicate the dates when petitioner 
received a copy of the Order dated 01 February 1999 and when the Motion 
for Reconsideration was filed in violation of Section 3, Rule 46 of the 
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure <span style="font-weight: bold;">as amended by Circular 39-98</span> (Emphasis supplied) which provides:<br><br>“<span style="font-style: italic;">Sec. 3.&nbsp; Contents and filing of petition; effect of non-compliance with requirements.</span>
 – x x x In actions filed under Rule 65, the petition shall further

denial thereof was received. x x x<br><br>The failure of the petitioner

 sole issue for resolution is whether the Court of Appeals erred in 
dismissing Security Bank’s petition on mere technicality despite the 
bank’s substantial compliance with Section 3, Rule 46 of the 1997 Rules 
of Civil Procedure as amended by Circular No. 39-98.<br><br>Security 
Bank asserts that the date of filing of the motion for reconsideration 
appears in the body of the petition.&nbsp; Security Bank likewise contends 
that the certified true copy of the 1 February 1999 Order attached to 
the petition clearly shows the stamped date of receipt of the Order.&nbsp; 
Hence, Security Bank insists that the petition substantially complies 
with Section 3, Rule 46 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure as amended 
by Circular No. 39-98.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of This Court</span><br></div><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>Section 3, Rule 46 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended by Circular No. 39-98, provides:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">RULE 46<br></div><blockquote>SEC. 3.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Contents and filing of petition; effect of non-compliance with requirements</span>.
 -&nbsp; The petition shall contain the full names and actual addresses of 
all the petitioners and respondents, a concise statement of the matters 
involved, the factual background of the case, and the grounds relied 
upon for the relief prayed for.<br><br>In actions filed under Rule 65, 
the petition shall further indicate the material dates showing when 
notice of the judgment or final order or resolution subject thereof was 
received, when a motion for new trial or reconsideration, if any, was 
filed and when notice of the denial thereof was received.<br><br>It 
shall be filed in seven (7) clearly legible copies together with proof 
of service thereof on the respondent with the original copy intended for
 the court indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall be accompanied
 by a clearly legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the 
judgment, order, resolution, or ruling subject thereof, such material 
portions of the record as are referred to therein, and other documents 
relevant or pertinent thereto.&nbsp; The certification shall be accomplished 
by the proper clerk of court or by his duly authorized representative, 
or by the proper officer of the court, tribunal, agency or office 
involved or by his duly authorized representative.&nbsp; The other requisite 
number of copies of the petition shall be accompanied by clearly legible
 plain copies of all documents attached to the original.<br><br>The 
petitioner shall also submit together with the petition a sworn 
certification that he has not theretofore commenced any other action 
involving the same issues in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals or 
different divisions thereof, or any other tribunal or agency; if there 
is such other action or proceeding, he must state the status of the 
same; and if he should thereafter learn that a similar action or 
proceeding has been filed or is pending before the Supreme Court, the 
Court of Appeals, or different divisions thereof, or any other tribunal 
or agency, he undertakes to promptly inform the aforesaid courts and 
other tribunal or agency thereof within five (5) days therefrom.<br><br>The
 petitioner shall pay the corresponding docket and other lawful fees to 
the clerk of court and deposit the amount of P500.00 for costs at the 
time of the filing of the petition.<br><br>The failure of the petitioner
 to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient 
ground for the dismissal of the petition.<br></blockquote>The Rules clearly provide that <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-compliance with any of the requirements</span>
 shall be a sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition.&nbsp; If we 
apply the Rules strictly, we cannot fault the Court of Appeals for 
dismissing Security Bank’s petition.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals merely 
followed the Rules.&nbsp; However, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction
 this Court may disregard procedural lapses so that a case may be 
resolved on its merits based on the evidence presented by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Rules of procedure should promote, not defeat, substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, the Court may opt to apply the Rules liberally to resolve the substantial issues raised by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The material dates required to be stated in the petition for certiorari under Rule 65 are:<br><blockquote>(1) the date of receipt of the notice of the judgment or final order or resolution;<br><br>(2) the date of filing of the motion for new trial or for reconsideration; and<br><br>(3) the date of receipt of the notice of denial of the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Contrary
 to the Court of Appeals’ findings, Security Bank correctly asserted 
that page 13 of its petition states the date of filing of the motion for
 reconsideration on 23 February 1999, or thirteen days after the receipt
 of the Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The 
petition also states the date of receipt of notice of denial of the 
motion for reconsideration filed before the trial court. Hence, the 
petition only lacked the date of receipt of the trial court’s Order of 1
 February 1999 that was the subject of the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The
 stamped date on the Order of 1 February 1999 annexed to the petition is
 not clear enough for the Court of Appeals to determine when Security 
Bank’s counsel received a copy of the Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 However, upon filing its motion for reconsideration before the Court of
 Appeals, Security Bank attached another copy of the Order of 1 February
 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> This time, the 
stamped date of receipt of the Order shows that the Security Bank’s 
counsel received the Order on 10 February 1999.<br><br>When Security 
Bank furnished the Court of Appeals with the copy of the trial court’s 
Order bearing the stamped date of its receipt, it showed its willingness
 to rectify its omission.&nbsp; Security Bank, in effect, substantially 
complied with the Rules.&nbsp; In addition, the trial court would have 
dismissed the motion for reconsideration outright if Security Bank had 
filed it late. The trial court’s Order of 3 November 1999 does not show 
that Security Bank filed the motion for reconsideration out of time.<br><br>The
 rationale for requiring the statement of material dates is to determine
 the timeliness of filing of the petition.&nbsp; Clearly, Security Bank filed
 the motion for reconsideration with the trial court on time.&nbsp; Security 
Bank also filed the petition before the Court of Appeals within the 
reglementary period.&nbsp; The Court reiterates that there is ample 
jurisprudence holding that the subsequent and substantial compliance of a
 party may call for the relaxation of the rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the recent case of <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Great Southern Maritime Services Corporation v. Acuña</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 we held that “the failure to comply with the rule on a statement of 
material dates in the petition may be excused since the dates are 
evident from the records.”&nbsp; The more material date for purposes of 
appeal to the Court of Appeals is the date of receipt of the trial 
court’s order denying the motion for reconsideration, which date is 
admittedly stated in the petition in the present case.&nbsp; The other 
material dates may be gleaned from the records of the case if reasonably
 evident.&nbsp; Thus, in this case the Court deems it proper to relax the 
Rules to give all the parties the chance to argue their causes and 
defenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>,
 we SET ASIDE the Resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated 22 February 
2000 and 29 November 2000.&nbsp; This case is REMANDED to the Court of 
Appeals which is DIRECTED to reinstate and give due course to the 
petition in CA-G.R.
