It stated that the only copies of the Consumption Entries submitted to the Hearing Officer were mere machine copies furnished by an informer of the EIIB.&nbsp; It asserted that the letters of Tomas and Danganan were unreliable because of the following:<br><blockquote>In the said letters, the two collection officers merely submitted a listing of alleged import entry numbers and dates released of alleged importations by Hantex Trading Co., Inc. of merchandise in 1987, for which they certified that the corresponding duties and taxes were paid after being processed in their offices.&nbsp; In said letters, no amounts of the landed costs and advance sales tax and duties were stated, and no particulars of the duties and taxes paid per import entry document was presented.<br><br>The contents of the two letters failed to indicate the particulars of the importations per entry number, and the said letters do not constitute as evidence of the amounts of importations of Hantex Trading Co., Inc. in 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The respondent cited the following findings of the Hearing Officer:<br><br>… [T]hat the import entry documents do not constitute evidence only indicate that the tax assessments in question have no factual basis, and must, at this point in time, be withdrawn and cancelled.&nbsp;

The alleged 1987 deficiency income tax assessment (including increments) and the alleged 1987 deficiency sales tax assessment (including increments) are<i> void ab initio</i>, since under Sections 16(a) and 49(b) of the Tax Code, the Commissioner shall examine a return after it is filed and, thereafter, assess the correct amount of tax.&nbsp; The following facts obtaining in this case, however, are indicative of the incorrectness of the tax assessments in question: the deficiency interests imposed in the income and percentage tax deficiency assessment notices were computed in violation of the provisions of Section 249(b) of the NIRC of 1977, as amended; the percentage tax deficiency was computed on an annual basis for the year 1987 in accordance with the provision of Section 193, which should have been computed in accordance with Section 162 of the 1977 NIRC, as amended by Pres. Decree No. 1994 on a quarterly basis; and the BIR official who signed the deficiency tax assessments was the Assistant Commissioner for Collection, who had no authority to sign the same under the NIRC.<br><br>Second.&nbsp; Even granting <i>arguendo</i> that the deficiency taxes and increments for 1987 against the respondent were correctly computed in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Code, the facts indicate that the above-stated assessments were based on alleged documents which are inadmissible in either administrative or judicial proceedings.&nbsp; Moreover, the alleged bases of the tax computations were anchored on mere presumptions and not on actual facts.&nbsp; The alleged undeclared purchases for 1987 were based on mere photocopies of alleged import entry documents, not the original ones, and which had never been duly certified by the public officer charged with the custody of such records in the Bureau of Customs.&nbsp; According to the respondent, the alleged undeclared sales were computed based on mere presumptions as to the alleged gross profit contained in its 1987 financial statement.&nbsp; Moreover, even the alleged financial statement of the respondent was a mere machine copy and not an official copy of the 1987 income and business tax returns.&nbsp; Finally, the respondent was following the accrual method of accounting in 1987, yet, the BIR investigator who computed the 1987 income tax deficiency failed to allow as a deductible item the alleged sales tax deficiency for 1987 as provided for under Section 30(c) of the NIRC of 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Commissioner did not adduce in evidence the original or certified true copies of the 1987 Consumption Entries on file with the Commission on Audit.&nbsp;

The CTA ruled that the respondent failed to overcome the <i>prima facie </i>correctness of the tax deficiency assessment issued by the petitioner, to wit:<br><blockquote>The issue should be ruled in the affirmative as petitioner has failed to rebut the validity or correctness of the aforementioned tax assessments.&nbsp; It is incongruous for petitioner to prove its cause by simply drawing an inference unfavorable to the respondent by attacking the source documents (Consumption Entries) which were the bases of the assessment and which were certified by the Chiefs of the Collection Division, Manila International Container Port and the Port of Manila, as having been processed and released in the name of the petitioner after payment of duties and taxes and the duly certified copies of Financial Statements secured from the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp; Any such inference cannot operate to relieve petitioner from bearing its burden of proof and this Court has no warrant of absolution.&nbsp; The Court should have been persuaded to grant the reliefs sought by the petitioner should it have presented any evidence of relevance and competence required, like that of a certification from the Bureau of Customs or from any other agencies, attesting to the fact that those consumption entries did not really belong to them.<br><br>The burden of proof is on the taxpayer contesting the validity or correctness of an assessment to prove not only that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is wrong but the taxpayer is right (<i>Tan Guan v.

Commissioner (1977), the assessment was given due course in the presence of admissible evidence as to how the Commissioner arrived at his determination, although there was no admissible evidence with respect to the substantial issue of whether the taxpayer had unreported or undeclared income from narcotics sale. …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>Based on a Memorandum dated October 23, 1990 of the IIPO, the source documents for the actual cost of importation of the respondent are the machine copies of the Consumption Entries from the informer which the IIPO claimed to have been certified by Tomas and Danganan:<br><blockquote>The source documents for the total actual cost of importations, abovementioned, were the different copies of Consumption Entries, Series of 1987, filed by subject with the Bureau of Customs, marked Annexes “F-1” to “F-68.”&nbsp; The total cost of importations is the sum of the Landed Costs and the Advance Sales Tax as shown in the annexed entries.&nbsp; These entries were duly authenticated as having been processed and released, after payment of the duties and taxes due thereon, by the Chief, Collection Division, Manila International Container Port, dated August 7, 1990, “Annex-G,” and the Port of Manila, dated August 22, 1990, “Annex-H.”&nbsp; So, it was established that subject-importations, mostly resins, really belong to HANTEX TRADING CO., INC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br></blockquote>It also appears on the worksheet of the IIPO, as culled from the photocopies of the Consumption Entries from its informer, that the total cost of the respondent’s importation for 1987 was P105,761,527.00.&nbsp; Per the report of Torres and Filamor, they also relied on the photocopies of the said Consumption Entries:<br><blockquote>The importations made by taxpayer verified by us from the records of the Bureau of Customs and xerox copies of which are hereto attached shows the big volume of importations made and not declared in the income tax return filed by taxpayer.<br><br>Based on the above findings, it clearly shows that a <u><i>prima facie</i></u> case of fraud exists in the herein transaction of the taxpayer, as a consequence of which, said transaction has not been possibly entered into the books of accounts of the subject taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, the petitioner based her finding that the 1987 importation of the respondent was underdeclared in the amount of P105,761,527.00 on the worthless machine copies of the Consumption Entries.&nbsp; Aside from such copies, the petitioner has no other evidence to prove that the respondent imported goods costing P105,761,527.00.&nbsp; The petitioner cannot find solace on the certifications of Tomas and Danganan because they did not authenticate the machine copies of the Consumption Entries, and merely indicated therein the entry numbers of Consumption Entries and the dates when the Bureau of Customs released the same.&nbsp; The certifications of Tomas and Danganan do not even contain the landed costs and the advance sales taxes paid by the importer, if any.&nbsp; Comparing the certifications of Tomas and Danganan and the machine copies of the Consumption Entries, only 36 of the entry numbers of such copies are included in the said certifications; the entry numbers of the rest of the machine copies of the Consumption Entries are not found therein.<br><br>Even if the Court would concede to the petitioner’s contention that the certification of Tomas and Danganan authenticated the machine copies of the Consumption Entries referred to in the certification, it appears that the total cost of importations inclusive of advance sales tax is only P64,324,953.00 – far from the amount of P105,716,527.00 arrived at by the EIIB and the BIR,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> or even the amount of P110,079,491.61 arrived at by Deputy Commissioner Deoferio, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>&nbsp; As gleaned from the certifications of Tomas and Danganan, the goods covered by the Consumption Entries were released by the Bureau of Customs, from which it can be presumed that the respondent must have paid the taxes due on the said importation.&nbsp; The petitioner did not adduce any documentary evidence to prove otherwise.<br><br>Thus, the computations of the EIIB and the BIR on the quantity and costs of the importations of the respondent in the amount of P105,761,527.00 for 1987 have no factual basis, hence, arbitrary and capricious.&nbsp; The petitioner cannot rely on the presumption that she and the other employees of the BIR had regularly performed their duties.&nbsp; As the Court held in <i>Collector of Internal Revenue v. Benipayo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> in order to stand judicial scrutiny, the assessment must be based on facts.&nbsp; The presumption of the correctness of an assessment, being a mere presumption, cannot be made to rest on another presumption.<br><br>Moreover, the uncontroverted fact is that the BIR District Revenue Office had repeatedly examined the 1987 books of accounts of the respondent showing its importations, and found that the latter had minimal business tax liability.&nbsp; In this case, the presumption that the District Revenue officers performed their duties in accordance with law shall apply.&nbsp; There is no evidence on record that the said officers neglected to perform their duties as mandated by law; neither is there evidence <i>aliunde</i> that the contents of the 1987 and 1988 Profit and Loss Statements submitted by the respondent with the SEC are incorrect.<br><br>Admittedly, the respondent did not adduce evidence to prove its correct tax liability.&nbsp; However, considering that it has been established that the petitioner’s assessment is barren of factual basis, arbitrary and illegal, such failure on the part of the respondent cannot serve as a basis for a finding by the Court that it is liable for the amount contained in the said assessment; otherwise, the Court would thereby be committing a travesty.<br><br>On the disposition of the case, the Court has two options, namely, to deny the petition for lack of merit and affirm the decision of the CA, without prejudice to the petitioner’s issuance of a new assessment against the respondent based on credible evidence; or, to remand the case to the CTA for further proceedings, to enable the petitioner to adduce in evidence certified true copies or duplicate original copies of the Consumption Entries for the respondent’s 1987 importations, if there be any, and the correct tax deficiency assessment thereon, without prejudice to the right of the respondent to adduce controverting evidence, so that the matter may be resolved once and for all by the CTA.&nbsp; In the higher interest of justice to both the parties, the Court has chosen the latter option.&nbsp; After all, as the Tax Court of the United States emphasized in <i>Harbin v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> taxation is not only practical; it is vital.&nbsp; The obligation of good faith and fair dealing in carrying out its provision is reciprocal and, as the government should never be over-reaching or tyrannical, neither should a taxpayer be permitted to escape payment by the concealment of material facts.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; The records are REMANDED to the Court of Tax Appeals for further proceedings, conformably with the decision of this Court.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Tinga, </i>and <i>Chico-Nazario, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Omar U.
