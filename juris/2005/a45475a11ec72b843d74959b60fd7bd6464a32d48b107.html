				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The 20 percent discount required by the law to be given to senior citizens is a <i>tax credit</i>, not merely a <i>tax deduction</i> from the gross income or gross sale of the establishment concerned.&nbsp; A <i>tax credit</i> is used by a private establishment only after the tax has been computed; a <i>tax deduction</i>, before the tax is computed.&nbsp; RA 7432 unconditionally grants a <i>tax credit</i> to all covered entities.&nbsp; Thus, the provisions of the revenue regulation that withdraw or modify such grant are void.&nbsp; Basic is the rule that administrative regulations cannot amend or revoke the law.<br><center><b><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span></b><br></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the August 29, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the August 11, 2003 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 67439.&nbsp; The assailed Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“<b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Resolution appealed from is <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>. &nbsp;No costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The assailed Resolution denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The CA narrated the antecedent facts as follows:<br><blockquote>“Respondent is a domestic corporation primarily engaged in retailing of medicines and other pharmaceutical products.&nbsp; In 1996, it operated six (6) drugstores under the business name and style ‘Mercury Drug.’<br><br>“From January to December 1996, respondent granted twenty (20%) percent sales discount to qualified senior citizens on their purchases of medicines pursuant to Republic Act No. [R.A.] 7432 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.&nbsp; For the said period, the amount allegedly representing the 20% sales discount granted by respondent to qualified senior citizens totaled P904,769.00.<br><br>“On April 15, 1997, respondent filed its Annual Income Tax Return for taxable year 1996 declaring therein that it incurred net losses from its operations.<br><br>“On January 16, 1998, respondent filed with petitioner a claim for tax refund/credit in the amount of P904,769.00 allegedly arising from the 20% sales discount granted by respondent to qualified senior citizens in compliance with [R.A.] 7432.&nbsp; Unable to obtain affirmative response from petitioner, respondent elevated its claim to the Court of Tax Appeals [(CTA or Tax Court)] via a Petition for Review.<br><br>“On February 12, 2001, the Tax Court rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dismissing respondent’s Petition for lack of merit.&nbsp; In said decision, the [CTA] justified its ruling with the following ratiocination:<br><blockquote>‘x x x, if no tax has been paid to the government, erroneously or illegally, or if no amount is due and collectible from the taxpayer, tax refund or tax credit is unavailing.&nbsp; Moreover, whether the recovery of the tax is made by means of a claim for refund or tax credit, before recovery is allowed[,] it must be first established that there was an actual collection and receipt by the government of the tax sought to be recovered. x x x.<br><center><br>‘x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>‘Prescinding from the above, it could logically be deduced that tax credit is premised on the existence of tax liability on the part of taxpayer.&nbsp; In other words, if there is no tax liability, tax credit is not available.’<br></blockquote>“Respondent lodged a Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; The [CTA], in its assailed resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> granted respondent’s motion for reconsideration and ordered herein petitioner to issue a Tax Credit Certificate in favor of respondent citing the decision of the then Special Fourth Division of [the CA] in CA G.R. SP No. 60057 entitled ‘<i>Central [Luzon] Drug Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>’ promulgated on May 31, 2001, to wit:<br><blockquote>‘However, Sec. 229 clearly does not apply in the instant case because the tax sought to be refunded or credited by petitioner was not erroneously paid or illegally collected.&nbsp; We take exception to the CTA’s sweeping but unfounded statement that ‘both tax refund and tax credit are modes of recovering taxes which are either erroneously or illegally paid to the government.’&nbsp; Tax refunds or credits do not exclusively pertain to illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes as they may be other circumstances where a refund is warranted.&nbsp; The tax refund provided under Section 229 deals exclusively with illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes but there are other possible situations, such as the refund of excess estimated corporate quarterly income tax paid, or that of excess input tax paid by a VAT-registered person, or that of excise tax paid on goods locally produced or manufactured but actually exported.&nbsp; The standards and mechanics for the grant of a refund or credit under these situations are different from that under Sec. 229.&nbsp; Sec. 4[.a)] of R.A. 7432, is yet another instance of a tax credit and it does not in any way refer to illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes,&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>The CA affirmed <i>in toto</i> the Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ordering petitioner to issue a tax credit certificate in favor of respondent in the reduced amount of P903,038.39.&nbsp; It reasoned that Republic Act No. (RA) 7432 required neither a tax liability nor a payment of taxes by private establishments prior to the availment of a tax credit.&nbsp; Moreover, such credit is not tantamount to an unintended benefit from the law, but rather a just compensation for the taking of private property for public use.<br><br>Hence this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]<br><br></sup><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote>“Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent may claim the 20% sales discount as a tax credit instead of as a deduction from gross income or gross sales.<br><br>“Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent is entitled to a refund.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>These two issues may be summed up in only one: whether respondent, despite incurring a net loss, may still claim the 20 percent sales discount as a tax credit.<br><center><br><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The Petition is not meritorious.<br><center><br><b><u>Sole Issue:<br><i>Claim of 20 Percent Sales Discount<br>as Tax Credit Despite Net Loss</i></u></b><br></center><br>Section 4a) of RA 7432<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> grants to senior citizens the privilege of obtaining a 20 percent discount on their purchase of medicine from any private establishment in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The latter may then claim the cost of the discount as a <i>tax credit</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; But can such credit be claimed, even though an establishment operates at a loss?<br><br>We answer in the affirmative.<br><br><b><u>Tax Credit <i>versus</i><br>Tax Deduction</u></b><br><br>Although the term is not specifically defined in our Tax Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>tax credit</i> generally refers to an amount that is “subtracted directly from one’s total tax liability.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; It is an “allowance against the tax itself”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> or “a deduction from what is owed”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> by a taxpayer to the government.&nbsp; Examples of <i>tax credits</i> are withheld taxes, payments of estimated tax, and investment tax credits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>Tax credit</i> should be understood in relation to other tax concepts.&nbsp; One of these is <i>tax deduction</i> -- defined as a subtraction “from income for tax purposes,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> or an amount that is “allowed by law to reduce income prior to [the] application of the tax rate to compute the amount of tax which is due.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; An example of a <i>tax deduction</i> is any of the allowable deductions enumerated in Section 34<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Tax Code.<br><br>A <i>tax credit</i> differs from a <i>tax deduction</i>.&nbsp; On the one hand, a <i>tax credit</i> reduces the tax due, including -- whenever applicable -- the <i>income tax</i> that is determined after applying the corresponding tax rates to <i>taxable income</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; A <i>tax deduction</i>, on the other, reduces the income that is subject to tax<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in order to arrive at <i>taxable income</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; To think of the former as the latter is to avoid, if not entirely confuse, the issue.&nbsp; A <i>tax credit</i> is used only after the tax has been computed; a <i>tax deduction</i>, <b>before</b>.<br><br><i><b><u>Tax Liability Required<br>for Tax Credit</u></b></i><br><br>Since a <i>tax credit</i> is used to reduce directly the tax that is due, there ought to be a tax liability <b>before</b> the <i>tax credit</i> can be applied.&nbsp; Without that liability, any <i>tax credit</i> application will be useless.&nbsp; There will be no reason for deducting the latter when there is, to begin with, no existing obligation to the government.&nbsp; However, as will be presented shortly, the <i>existence</i> of a tax credit or its <i>grant</i> by law is not the same as the <i>availment</i> or <i>use</i> of such credit.&nbsp; While the grant is mandatory, the availment or use is not.<br><br>If a <i>net loss</i> is reported by, and no other taxes are currently due from, a business establishment, there will obviously be no tax liability against which any <i>tax credit</i> can be applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; For the establishment to choose the immediate availment of a <i>tax credit</i> will be premature and impracticable.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the irrefutable fact remains that, under RA 7432, Congress has granted without conditions a tax credit benefit to all covered establishments.<br><br>Although this <i>tax credit</i> benefit is available, it need not be used by losing ventures, since there is no tax liability that calls for its application.&nbsp; Neither can it be reduced to nil by the quick yet callow stroke of an administrative pen, simply because no reduction of taxes can instantly be effected.&nbsp; By its nature, the <i>tax credit</i> may still be deducted from a <i>future</i>, not a <i>present</i>, tax liability, without which it does not have any use.&nbsp; In the meantime, it need not move.&nbsp; But it breathes.<br><br><b><i><u>Prior Tax Payments Not<br>Required for Tax Credit<br></u></i></b><br>While a tax liability is essential to the <i>availment or use</i> of any <i>tax credit</i>, prior tax payments are not.&nbsp; On the contrary, for the <i>existence or grant</i> solely of such credit, neither a tax liability nor a prior tax payment is needed.&nbsp; The Tax Code is in fact replete with provisions granting or allowing <i>tax credits</i>, even though no taxes have been previously paid.<br><br>For example, in computing the <i>estate tax due</i>, Section 86(E) allows a <i>tax credit</i> -- subject to certain limitations -- for estate taxes paid to a foreign country.&nbsp; Also found in Section 101(C) is a similar provision for donor’s taxes -- again when paid to a foreign country -- in computing for the <i>donor’s tax due</i>.&nbsp; The <i>tax credits</i> in both instances allude to the prior payment of taxes, even if not made to our government.<br><br>Under Section 110, a VAT (Value-Added Tax)- registered person engaging in transactions -- whether or not subject to the VAT -- is also allowed a <i>tax credit</i> that includes a ratable portion of any input tax not directly attributable to either activity.&nbsp; This input tax may <i>either</i> be the VAT on the purchase or importation of goods or services that is merely due from -- not necessarily paid by -- such VAT-registered person in the course of trade or business; <i>or</i> the transitional input tax determined in accordance with Section 111(A).&nbsp; The latter type may in fact be an amount equivalent to only eight percent of the value of a VAT-registered person’s beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies, when such amount -- as computed -- is higher than the actual VAT paid on the said items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly from this provision, the <i>tax credit</i> refers to an input tax that is either due only or given a value by mere comparison with the VAT actually paid -- then later prorated.&nbsp; No tax is actually paid prior to the availment of such credit.<br><br>In Section 111(B), a one and a half percent input <i>tax credit</i> that is merely presumptive is allowed.&nbsp; For the purchase of primary agricultural products used as inputs --either in the processing of sardines, mackerel and milk, or in the manufacture of refined sugar and cooking oil -- and for the contract price of public work contracts entered into with the government, again, no prior tax payments are needed for the use of the <i>tax credit</i>.<br><br>More important, a VAT-registered person whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, under Section 112(A), apply for the issuance of a <i>tax credit</i> certificate for the amount of creditable input taxes merely due -- again not necessarily paid to -- the government and attributable to such sales, to the extent that the input taxes have not been applied against output taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Where a taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales and also in taxable or exempt sales, the amount of creditable input taxes due that are not directly and entirely attributable to any one of these transactions shall be proportionately allocated on the basis of the volume of sales.&nbsp; Indeed, in availing of such <i>tax credit</i> for VAT purposes, this provision -- as well as the one earlier mentioned -- shows that the prior payment of taxes is not a requisite.<br><br>It may be argued that Section 28(B)(5)(b) of the Tax Code is another illustration of a <i>tax credit</i> allowed, even though no prior tax payments are not required.&nbsp; Specifically, in this provision, the imposition of a final withholding tax rate on cash and/or property dividends received by a nonresident foreign corporation from a domestic corporation is subjected to the condition that a foreign <i>tax credit</i> will be given by the domiciliary country in an amount equivalent to taxes that are merely deemed paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Although true, this provision actually refers to the <i>tax credit</i> as a <i>condition</i> only for the imposition of a lower tax rate, not as a <i>deduction</i> from the corresponding tax liability.&nbsp; Besides, it is not our government but the domiciliary country that credits against the income tax payable to the latter by the foreign corporation, the tax to be foregone or spared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In contrast, Section 34(C)(3), in relation to Section 34(C)(7)(b), categorically allows as credits, against the income tax imposable under Title II, the amount of income taxes merely incurred -- not necessarily paid -- by a domestic corporation during a taxable year in any foreign country.&nbsp; Moreover, Section 34(C)(5) provides that for such taxes incurred but not paid, a <i>tax credit</i> may be allowed, subject to the condition precedent that the taxpayer shall simply give a bond with sureties satisfactory to and approved by petitioner, in such sum as may be required; and further conditioned upon payment by the taxpayer of any tax found due, upon petitioner’s redetermination of it.<br><br>In addition to the above-cited provisions in the Tax Code, there are also tax treaties and special laws that grant or allow <i>tax credits</i>, even though no prior tax payments have been made.<br><br>Under the treaties in which the <i>tax credit</i> method is used as a relief to avoid double taxation, income that is taxed in the <i>state of source</i> is also taxable in the <i>state of residence</i>, but the tax paid in the former is merely allowed as a credit against the tax levied in the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Apparently, payment is made to the <i>state of source</i>, not the <i>state of residence</i>.&nbsp; No tax, therefore, has been <i>previously</i> paid to the latter.<br><br>Under special laws that particularly affect businesses, there can also be <i>tax credit</i> incentives.&nbsp; To illustrate, the incentives provided for in Article 48 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1789, as amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 391, include <i>tax credits</i> equivalent to either five percent of the net value earned, or five or ten percent of the net local content of exports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; In order to avail of such credits under the said law and still achieve its objectives, no prior tax payments are necessary.<br><br>From all the foregoing instances, it is evident that prior tax payments are not indispensable to the availment of a <i>tax credit</i>.&nbsp; Thus, the CA correctly held that the availment under RA 7432 did not require prior tax payments by private establishments concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; However, we do not agree with its finding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that the carry-over of <i>tax credits</i> under the said special law to succeeding taxable periods, and even their application against internal revenue taxes, did not necessitate the existence of a tax liability.<br><br>The examples above show that a tax liability is certainly important in the <i>availment or use</i>, not the <i>existence or grant</i>, of a <i>tax credit</i>.&nbsp; Regarding this matter, a private establishment reporting a <i>net loss</i> in its financial statements is no different from another that presents a <i>net income</i>.&nbsp; Both are entitled to the <i>tax credit</i> provided for under RA 7432, since the law itself accords that unconditional benefit.&nbsp; However, for the losing establishment to immediately apply such credit, where no tax is due, will be an improvident usance.<br><br><b><i><u>Sections 2.i and 4 of Revenue<br>Regulations No. 2-94 Erroneous<br></u></i></b><br>RA 7432 specifically allows private establishments to claim as <i>tax credit</i> the amount of discounts they grant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In turn, the Implementing Rules and Regulations, issued pursuant thereto, provide the procedures for its availment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; To deny such credit, despite the plain mandate of the law and the regulations carrying out that mandate, is indefensible.<br><br><i>First</i>, the definition given by petitioner is erroneous.&nbsp; It refers to <i>tax credit</i> as the amount representing the 20 percent discount that “shall be deducted by the said establishments from their <i>gross income</i> for income tax purposes and from their <i>gross sales</i> for value-added tax or other percentage tax purposes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; In ordinary business language, the <i>tax credit</i> represents the amount of such discount.&nbsp; However, the manner by which the discount shall be credited against taxes has not been clarified by the revenue regulations.<br><br>By ordinary acceptation, a discount is an “abatement or reduction made from the gross amount or value of anything.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; To be more precise, it is in business parlance “a deduction or lowering of an amount of money;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> or “a reduction from the full amount or value of something, especially a price.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; In business there are many kinds of discount, the most common of which is that affecting the <i>income statement</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> or financial report upon which the <i>income tax</i> is based.<br><br><b><i><u>Business Discounts<br>Deducted from Gross Sales</u></i></b><br><br>A <i>cash discount</i>, for example, is one granted by business establishments to <i>credit customers</i> for their prompt payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; It is a “reduction in price offered to the purchaser if payment is made within a shorter period of time than the maximum time specified.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Also referred to as a <i>sales discount</i> on the part of the seller and a <i>purchase discount</i> on the part of the buyer, it may be expressed in such terms as “5/10, n/30.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>A <i>quantity discount</i>, however, is a “reduction in price allowed for purchases made in large quantities, justified by savings in packaging, shipping, and handling.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; It is also called a <i>volume</i> or <i>bulk discount</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>A “percentage reduction from the list price x x x allowed by manufacturers to wholesalers and by wholesalers to retailers”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> is known as a <i>trade discount</i>.&nbsp; No entry for it need be made in the manual or computerized <i>books of accounts</i>, since the purchase or sale is already valued at the net price actually charged the buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The purpose for the discount is to encourage trading or increase sales, and the prices at which the purchased goods may be resold are also suggested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Even a <i>chain discount</i> -- a series of discounts from one list price -- is recorded at net.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Finally, akin to a <i>trade discount</i> is a <i>functional discount</i>.&nbsp; It is “a supplier’s price discount given to a purchaser based on the [latter’s] role in the [former’s] distribution system.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; This role usually involves warehousing or advertising.<br><br>Based on this discussion, we find that the nature of a <i>sales discount</i> is peculiar.&nbsp; Applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the country, this type of discount is reflected in the <i>income statement</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> as a line item deducted -- along with returns, allowances, rebates and other similar expenses -- from <i>gross sales</i> to arrive at <i>net sales</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; This type of presentation is resorted to, because the <i>accounts receivable</i> and <i>sales</i> figures that arise from <i>sales discounts</i>, -- as well as from <i>quantity, volume</i> or <i>bulk discounts</i> -- are recorded in the manual and computerized <i>books of accounts</i> and reflected in the financial statements at the gross amounts of the invoices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; This manner of recording credit sales -- known as the <i>gross method</i> -- is most widely used, because it is simple, more convenient to apply than the <i>net method</i>, and produces no material errors over time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>However, under the <i>net method</i> used in recording <i>trade, chain</i> or <i>functional discounts</i>, only the net amounts of the invoices -- after the discounts have been deducted -- are recorded in the <i>books of accounts</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and reflected in the financial statements.&nbsp; A separate line item cannot be shown,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> because the transactions themselves involving both <i>accounts receivable</i> and <i>sales</i> have already been entered into, net of the said discounts.<br><br>The term <i>sales discounts</i> is not expressly defined in the Tax Code, but one provision adverts to amounts whose sum -- along with <i>sales returns, allowances</i> and <i>cost of goods sold</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> -- is deducted from <i>gross sales</i> to come up with the <i>gross income, profit</i> or <i>margin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> derived from business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; In another provision therein, <i>sales discounts</i> that are granted and indicated in the invoices at the time of sale -- and that do not depend upon the happening of any future event -- may be excluded from the <i>gross sales</i> within the same quarter they were given.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; While determinative only of the VAT, the latter provision also appears as a suitable reference point for income tax purposes already embraced in the former.&nbsp; After all, these two provisions affirm that <i>sales discounts</i> are amounts that are always deductible from <i>gross sales</i>.<br><br><b><i><u>Reason for the Senior Citizen Discount:<br>The Law, Not Prompt Payment</u></i></b><br><br>A distinguishing feature of the implementing rules of RA 7432 is the private establishment’s outright deduction of the discount from the invoice price of the medicine sold to the senior citizen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; It is, therefore, expected that for each retail sale made under this law, the discount period lasts no more than a day, because such discount is given -- and the net amount thereof collected -- immediately upon perfection of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Although prompt payment is made for an arm’s-length transaction by the senior citizen, the real and compelling reason for the private establishment giving the discount is that the law itself makes it mandatory.<br><br>What RA 7432 grants the senior citizen is a mere discount privilege, not a <i>sales discount</i> or any of the above discounts in particular.&nbsp; Prompt payment is not the reason for (although a necessary consequence of) such grant.&nbsp; To be sure, the privilege enjoyed by the senior citizen must be equivalent to the <i>tax credit</i> benefit enjoyed by the private establishment granting the discount.&nbsp; Yet, under the revenue regulations promulgated by our tax authorities, this benefit has been erroneously likened and confined to a <i>sales discount</i>.<br><br>To a senior citizen, the monetary effect of the privilege may be the same as that resulting from a <i>sales discount</i>.&nbsp; However, to a private establishment, the effect is different from a simple reduction in price that results from such discount.&nbsp; In other words, the <i>tax credit</i> benefit is not the same as a <i>sales discount</i>.&nbsp; To repeat from our earlier discourse, this benefit cannot and should not be treated as a <i>tax deduction</i>.<br><br>To stress, the effect of a <i>sales discount</i> on the <i>income statement</i> and <i>income tax return</i> of an establishment covered by RA 7432 is different from that resulting from the <i>availment</i> or <i>use</i> of its <i>tax credit</i> benefit.&nbsp; While the former is a deduction <i>before</i>, the latter is a deduction <i>after</i>, the <i>income tax</i> is computed.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, a discount is not necessarily a <i>sales discount</i>, and a <i>tax credit</i> for a simple discount privilege should not be automatically treated like a <i>sales discount</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus</i>.&nbsp; Where the law does not distinguish, we ought not to distinguish.<br><br>Sections 2.i and 4 of Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 2-94 define <i>tax credit</i> as the 20 percent discount deductible from <i>gross income</i> for <i>income tax</i> purposes, or from <i>gross sales</i> for VAT or other percentage tax purposes.&nbsp; In effect, the <i>tax credit</i> benefit under RA 7432 is related to a <i>sales discount</i>.&nbsp; This contrived definition is improper, considering that the latter has to be deducted from <i>gross sales</i> in order to compute the <i>gross income</i> in the <i>income statement</i> and cannot be deducted again, even for purposes of computing the <i>income tax</i>.<br><br>When the law says that the cost of the discount may be claimed as a <i>tax credit</i>, it means that the amount -- when claimed -- shall be treated as a reduction from any tax liability, plain and simple.&nbsp; The option to avail of the <i>tax credit</i> benefit depends upon the existence of a tax liability, but to limit the benefit to a <i>sales discount</i> -- which is not even identical to the discount privilege that is granted by law -- does not define it at all and serves no useful purpose.&nbsp; The definition must, therefore, be stricken down.<br><br><b><i><u>Laws Not Amended<br>by Regulations</u></i></b><br><br><i>Second</i>, the law cannot be amended by a mere regulation.&nbsp; In fact, a regulation that “operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute is a mere nullity”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> it cannot prevail.<br><br>It is a cardinal rule that courts “will and should respect the contemporaneous construction placed upon a statute by the executive officers whose duty it is to enforce it x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp;

Their interpretation has muddled up the intent of Congress in granting a mere discount privilege, not a sales discount.&nbsp; The administrative agency issuing these regulations may not enlarge, alter or restrict the provisions of the law it administers;

Respondent is given two options -- either to claim or not to claim the cost of the discounts as a <i>tax credit</i>.&nbsp; In fact, it may even ignore the credit and simply consider the gesture as an act of beneficence, an expression of its social conscience.<br><br>Granting that there is a tax liability and respondent claims such cost as a <i>tax credit</i>, then the <i>tax credit</i> can easily be applied.&nbsp;

RA 7432 does not give respondent the unfettered right to avail itself of the credit whenever it pleases.&nbsp; Neither does it allow our tax administrators to expand or contract the legislative mandate.&nbsp; “The ‘plain meaning rule’ or <i>verba legis</i> in statutory construction is thus applicable x x x.&nbsp; Where the words of a statute are clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><b><u>Tax Credit <i>Benefit<br>Deemed</i> Just Compensation<br></u></b><br><i>Fourth</i>, Sections 2.i and 4 of RR 2-94 deny the exercise by the State of its power of eminent domain.&nbsp;
