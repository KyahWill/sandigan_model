They likewise requested for payment of their 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, which they alleged has not been paid to them since the start of their employment.&nbsp; Respondents resented the demand and allegedly told petitioners, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Amo man ko, ako'y magbuot"</span> (which means "I am the owner, and I will be the one to decide").<br><br>On November 15, 1997, petitioner Nene Janiola was dismissed from employment.&nbsp; On November 25, 1997, petitioners Ginaly Arnuza and Joann Gamil met the same fate.&nbsp; On November 28, 1997, it was the turn of petitioners Emma Cordova, Lerma Plazon and Teresita Torion to be terminated from employment.<br><br>Hence, petitioners filed complaints of illegal dismissal, and nonpayment/underpayment of wages, overtime pay, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and service incentive leave pay against respondents, before the Regional Arbitration Branch of the Department of Labor and Employment in Butuan City.&nbsp; Petitioners alleged that they are regular employees of respondents, entitled to security of tenure, and may only be terminated from employment due to just or authorized causes.<br><br>On April 14, 1998, Labor Arbiter Rogelio Legaspi, on the basis of the position paper of petitioners, decided in favor of the latter, awarding them the total amount of P384,352.15.&nbsp; Respondents failed to file their position paper.&nbsp; They appealed to the NLRC, and included in their prayer the reduction of the appeal bond due to financial constraints.&nbsp; Respondents' "Plea to reduce and admit bond" states:<br><blockquote>The respondents are presently in financial distress.&nbsp; They still have past due accounts with the RCBC due to financial losses triggered by the recent economic woes.&nbsp; Lately, the mother of the respondent was airlifted to Manila and she is in serious conditions.&nbsp; That again entails expenses.<br><br>Moreover, the appeal of the respondents are <span style="font-style: italic;">(sic)</span> grounded on solid and firm foundation, only that the evidences for the respondents were not presented and considered.&nbsp; If the bond be not reduced, the substantial rights of the respondents would be greatly prejudiced all because they do not have the amount to put up as appeal bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>In lieu of the bond, respondents submitted a bank certification from the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), which stated that respondents maintain a savings account with the latter bank, having a total deposit of P23,008.19, as of April 23, 1998.&nbsp; The bank certification states:<br><blockquote>This is to certify that <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPS.

It granted respondents' plea to reduce the amount of the cash bond to P50,000.00, pursuant to the authority vested in him by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; It also ruled that the labor arbiter's April 14, 1998 decision did not become final and executory with the failure of respondents to post the appeal bond.&nbsp; According to the NLRC, when respondents appealed the April 14, 1998 decision, they prayed for the reduction of the appeal bond; and in substantial compliance with the bond requirement, respondents submitted a bank certification.&nbsp; The NLRC gave due course to respondents' appeal, set aside and vacated the April 14, 1998 decision of the labor arbiter, and remanded the case to the Arbitration Branch of origin for reception of evidence of respondents; thus, rendering moot and academic respondents' motion to reduce the appeal bond.&nbsp; Hence, there is no finality of the April 14, 1998 decision to speak of.<br><br>On petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> with the Court of Appeals, the latter upheld the ruling of the NLRC.<br><br>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the decision of the Court of Appeals was denied.<br><br>Hence, this petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners assail the decision of the Court of Appeals on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN RULING THAT THE SUBMISSION OF A BANK CERTIFICATION IN LIEU OF CASH OR SURETY SUPERSEDEAS BOND WAS A MERE INCONSEQUENTIAL INADEQUACY.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN NOT FINDING THAT THE LABOR ARBITER'S DECISION DATED 14 APRIL 1998 HAD BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners argue that the original decision of the labor arbiter dated April 14, 1998, declaring their dismissal illegal with a total monetary award of P384,352.15 had already become final for failure of respondents to post an appeal bond.&nbsp; They stress that the posting of a cash or surety bond is a requirement <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span> for the perfection of an appeal by an employer from a decision involving a monetary award.&nbsp; They insist that the certification from the RCBC â€“ Butuan Branch, stating that respondents maintain a depository account under SA#1-537-90450-6, with a balance of TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EIGHT PESOS AND NINETEEN CENTAVOS (P23,008.19), as of April 23, 1998, cannot take the place of the required cash or surety bond for the perfection of the appeal.&nbsp; They assert that this kind of bank certification does not, in any way, ensure that the labor arbiter's award will be paid should the appeal fail.<br><br>We find for the petitioners.<br><br>Art. 223 of the Labor Code provides that in case of a judgment involving a monetary award, an appeal by the employer may be perfected <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> upon the posting of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the Commission in the amount equivalent to the monetary award.&nbsp; We have ruled that the word <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> makes it perfectly clear that the lawmakers intended that the posting of the bond is the exclusive means by which an employer's appeal may be perfected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; The filing of a supersedeas bond, which is actually a security required from an appellant to ensure payment of the adjudged monetary award in case the appeal fails, is indispensable to the perfection of the appeal.&nbsp; We further held that the posting of a cash or surety bond for the perfection of an appeal is jurisdictional, without which the NLRC, as in this case, does not have the authority to review and revise the judgment of the labor arbiter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, non-compliance with this legal requirement is fatal and has the effect of rendering the appealed judgment final and executory.&nbsp; In some cases, however, this Court relaxed the requirement of posting a supersedeas bond for the perfection of an appeal.&nbsp; The decisions in these exceptional cases were justified by the fact that there was substantial compliance with the rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your Bus Lines vs. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this Court excused the appellant for its failure to post the bond because it relied on the notice of the decision which, while stating the requirements for perfecting an appeal, did not mention that a bond must be filed.&nbsp; In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Blancaflor vs. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> it was noted that the failure of appellant to post a bond was in part due to the failure of the Labor Arbiter to state the exact amount of back wages and separation pay due; thus, no basis exists for the computation of the amount of the bond to be filed.&nbsp; In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cabalan Pastulan Negrito Labor Association vs. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> this Court granted petitioner-appellant's plea to give due course to its appeal despite non-posting of a supersedeas bond on account of its insolvency and poverty.&nbsp; Petitioner-appellant is an association of Negritos performing trash sorting services in the American naval base in Subic Bay.&nbsp; Further, the existence of an employer-employee relationship between petitioner-appellant and private respondent was not established.&nbsp; In <span style="font-weight: bold;">UERM-Memorial Medical Center vs. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the appellant-employer was allowed to post a property bond in lieu of a cash or surety bond.&nbsp; In this case, the judgment involved more than P17M and its precipitate execution could adversely affect the existence of the employer medical center. It also appeared that the real property bond was worth more than P102M, hence, the posting of a real property bond was sufficient compliance with the requirements of Art. 223.<br><br>However, in the case at bar, we find no substantial compliance with the bond requirement.&nbsp; The NLRC Rules state that in cases where the decision of the labor arbiter involves a monetary award, an appeal by the employer shall be perfected only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the NLRC or this Court in an amount equivalent to the monetary award, exclusive of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; We agree with the petitioners that the bank certification submitted by respondents does not come close to the cash or surety bond required by law.&nbsp; The obvious purpose of an appeal bond is to ensure, during the period of appeal, against any occurrence that would defeat or diminish recovery by the aggrieved employees under the judgment if subsequently affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; As petitioners pointed out, the bank certification does not, in any way, ensure that the labor arbiter's award will be paid should the appeal fail.&nbsp; Respondents are not prevented from making withdrawals from their savings account.&nbsp; And, the total amount deposited in respondents' savings account, twenty-three thousand eight pesos and nineteen centavos (P23,008.19), is measly compared to the monetary award by the labor arbiter which amounts to three hundred eighty four thousand three hundred fifty two pesos and fifteen centavos (P384,352.15).&nbsp; In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Biogenerics Marketing and Research Corp. vs. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the NLRC, upon motion of the appellant to reduce the appeal bond, ordered appellant to post an additional cash or surety bond in the amount of P1,950,000.00.&nbsp; It found no justification for a substantial reduction of the bond.&nbsp; Appellant initially posted a cash bond of P50,000.00 for a monetary award totaling P2,200,000.00.&nbsp; The NLRC, as well as this Court, rejected the additional "bond" filed by appellant which was denominated as an "Irrevocable Bank Guarantee" in the amount of P1,950,000.00 and entered into by and between appellant and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.&nbsp; It was held that the bank guarantee cannot be a substitute for the cash or surety bond contemplated under&nbsp; Art. 223 of the Labor Code.<br><br>In the case at bar, the respondents cannot be excused from making a substantial compliance with the bond requirement.&nbsp; The law does not require outright payment of the appealed monetary award, but only the posting of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the NLRC or this Court, and not a mere bank certification which only states the total amount of deposit existing in such bank as of a certain date.&nbsp; The cash or surety bond will ensure that the award will be eventually paid in case the appeal fails.&nbsp; A mere bank certification of the type submitted by respondents will not.&nbsp; What respondents have to pay is a moderate and reasonable sum for premiums for such bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also ruled that it is not inclined to frustrate respondents' right to appeal merely because of such "inconsequential inadequacy." We cannot denominate the bond requirement as a mere "inconsequential inadequacy."&nbsp; This requirement is intended to discourage employers from using the appeal to delay, or even evade, their obligation to satisfy their employee's possibly just and lawful claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; The right to appeal is a statutory right.&nbsp; A party who wants to avail of it must comply with the requirements set by the law.&nbsp; We have ruled that while it is true that the NLRC Rules must be liberally construed and that the NLRC is not bound by the technicalities of law and procedure, the NLRC itself (and the Court of Appeals in the instant case) must not be the first to arbitrarily disregard specific provisions of the Rules which are precisely intended to assist the parties in obtaining a just and expeditious settlement of labor disputes.&nbsp; In short, the rule on liberal construction is not a license to disregard the rules of procedure.&nbsp; Rules of Procedure exists for a purpose, and to disregard such rules in the guise of liberal construction would be to defeat such purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The consequence then of respondents' failure to substantially comply with the mandatory requirement of posting a bond for the perfection of the appeal is to render the April 14, 1998 decision of the labor arbiter final and executory, and to place it beyond the power of the NLRC to review or revise.&nbsp; The NLRC, thus, acted without jurisdiction in reviewing and modifying the decision of the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; Similarly, the Court of Appeals acted without jurisdiction in affirming the decision of the NLRC.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW THEREOF</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals' November 16, 2001 Decision in CA-G.R.
