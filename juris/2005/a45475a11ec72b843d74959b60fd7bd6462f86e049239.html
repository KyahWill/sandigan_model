Del Rosario</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In relying on <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs of Guido</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Isabel Yaptinchay</span>, the trial court held:<br><blockquote>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heirs of Yaptinchay</span> case arose from facts not dissimilar to the case at bar.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>In the instant case, plaintiffs presented a Marriage Contract, a Certificate of Live Birth, pictures (sic) and testimonial evidence to establish their right as heirs of the decedent.  Thus, the preliminary act of having a status and right to the estate of the decedent, was sought to be determined herein.  However, <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the establishment of a status, a right, or a particular fact is remedied through a special proceeding</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(Sec. 3(c), Rule 1, 1997 Rules of Court)</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not an ordinary civil action</span> whereby a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the protection or redress of a wrong (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ibid</span>, a).  The operative term in the former is "to establish", while in the latter, it is "to enforce", a right.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their status and right as putative heirs of the decedent not having been established, as yet, the Complaint failed to state a cause of action</span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The court, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not being a probate</span></span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">court</span>, is without jurisdiction to rule on plaintiffs' cause to establish their status and right herein</span>.  Plaintiffs do not have the personality to sue (<span style="font-style: italic;">Secs. 1 and 2, Rule 3, in relation to Secs. 1 and 2, Rule 2, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supra</span></span>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Petitioners thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeals, questioning the trial court's <span style="font-style: italic;">ratio decedendi</span> in dismissing the case as diametrically opposed to this Court's following ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño v. Cariño</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>Under Article 40 of the Family Code, the absolute nullity of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage void.  Meaning, where the absolute nullity of a previous marriage is sought to be invoked for purposes of contracting a second marriage, the sole basis acceptable in law, for said projected marriage to be free from legal infirmity, is a final judgment declaring the previous void.  (Domingo v. Court of Appeals, 226 SCRA 572, 579 [1993])  However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for purposes other than remarriage, no judicial action is necessary to declare a marriage an absolute nullity</span>.  For other purposes, such as but not limited to the determination of heirship, legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child, settlement of estate, dissolution of property regime, or a criminal case for that matter, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the court may pass upon the validity of marriage even after the death of the parties thereto, and even in a suit not directly instituted to question the validity of said marriage, so long as it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">essential to the determination of the case</span></span>.  (Niñal, et al. v. Bayadog, GR No. 13378, March 14, 2000).  In such cases, evidence must be adduced, testimonial or documentary, to prove the existence of grounds rendering such a previous marriage an absolute nullity.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">These need not be limited solely to an earlier final judgment of a court declaring such previous marriage void</span>.  (Domingo v. Court of Appeals, supra) (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Conceding that the ruling in Cariño was promulgated (in 2001) subsequent to that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs of Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay</span> (in 1999), the appellate court found <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño</span> to be inapplicable, however, to the case in this wise:<br><blockquote>To be borne in mind is the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the main issue in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño</span> case was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">validity</span> of the two marriages</span> contracted by the deceased SPO4 Santiago Cariño, whose death benefits was the bone of contention between the two women both named Susan (<span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>., Susan Nicdao Cariño and Susan Yee Cariño) both of whom he married.  It is not disputed in said case that SPO4 S. Cariño contracted two marriages with said two women during his lifetime, and the only question was:  which of these two marriages was validly celebrated?  The award of the death benefits of the deceased Cariño was thus, merely an <span style="font-weight: bold;">incident</span> to the question of which of the two marriages was valid.  Upon the other hand, the case at bench is of a different milieu. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main issue here is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">annulment of title to property</span></span>.  The only undisputed fact in this case is that the deceased Jose Portugal, during his lifetime, owned a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-34292.  However, here come two contending parties, - herein plaintiffs-appellants and defendant-appellee, - both now insisting to be the legal heir(s) of the decedent. x x x. The status and rights of the parties herein have not, therefore, been definitively established, as yet. x x x. Necessarily and naturally,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> such questions as to such status or right must be properly ventilated in an appropriate special proceeding</span>, not in an ordinary civil action, whereunder a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the protection or redress of a wrong. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The institution of an ordinary civil suit for that purpose in the present case is thus impermissible.  For it is axiomatic that what the law prohibits or forbids directly, it cannot permit or allow indirectly</span>.  To permit, or allow, a declaration of heirship, or the establishment of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child to be determined in an ordinary civil action, not in an appropriate special proceeding brought for that purpose, is thus to impinge upon this axiom. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>The appellate court, by Decision of September 24, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> thus affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the case.<br><br>Hence, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> faulting the appellate court to have erred when<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>. . . it affirmed the RTC decision dismissing the initiatory complaint as it failed to state a cause of action.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>. . .  (i) it applied the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs of Guido [and Isabel] Yaptingchay</span> despite the existence of a later and contrary ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño</span>, and (ii) when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Honorable CA and the lower court <span style="font-weight: bold;">failed to render judgment</span> based on the evidence presented relative to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">issues raised during pre-trial</span></span>, . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Petitioners thus prayed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Supreme Court that the questioned CA decision be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reversed</span>, and a new one entered in accordance with the prayers set forth in the instant complaint based on the above disquisition and evidence adduced by petitioners in the court a quo.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN THE ALTERNATIVE</span>, should the Honorable Supreme Court find that the pronouncements in <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño</span> apply, a decision be entered <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remanding</span> to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> the determination of the issues of which of the two marriages is valid, and the determination of "heirship" and legitimacy of Jose Jr. and Leonila preparatory to the determination of the annulment of title issued in the name of Leonila.<br><br>Other relief and remedy just and equitable in the premises are likewise prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Petitioners, in the main, argue that the appellate court misapplied <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs of Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay</span> and in effect encouraged multiplicity of suits which is discouraged by this Court as a reading of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño</span> shows; that <span style="font-style: italic;">Cariño</span> allows courts to pass on the determination of heirship and the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child so long as it is necessary to the determination of the case; and that contrary to the appellate court's ruling, they had established their status as compulsory heirs.<br><br>In the main, the issue in the present petition is whether petitioners have to institute a special proceeding to determine their status as heirs before they can pursue the case for annulment of respondent's Affidavit of Adjudication and of the TCT issued in her name.<br><br>In the above-cited case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs of Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the therein petitioners executed on March 17, 1994 an extrajudicial settlement of the estate of the deceased Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay, "owners-claimants" of the two lots mentioned therein.  They later discovered on August 26, 1994 that a portion, if not all, of the two lots had been titled in the name of the therein respondent Golden Bay Realty and Development Corporation which in turn sold portions thereof to the therein individual respondents.  The therein petitioners <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs</span> thus filed a complaint for annulment of titles.  The therein respondents moved to dismiss the case for failure of the therein petitioners to, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, state a cause of action and prove their status as heirs. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss in this wise:<br><blockquote>But the plaintiffs who claimed to be the legal heirs of the said Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have not shown any proof or even a semblance of it</span>-except the allegations that they are the legal heirs of the aforementioned Yaptinchays-<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">that they have been declared the legal heirs of the deceased</span> couple</span>.  Now, the determination of who are the legal heirs of the deceased couple must be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">made in the proper special proceedings in court</span>, and not in an ordinary suit for reconveyance of property.  This must take precedence over the action for reconveyance . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>On petition for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">certiorari</span> by the Heirs, this Court, albeit holding that the petition was an improper recourse, found that the trial court did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the case. Citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Litam et al. v. Rivera</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Solivio v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court held that "the declaration of heirship can be made only in a special proceeding inasmuch as the petitioners here are seeking the establishment of a status or right."<br><br>In the above-cited case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Litam</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Gregorio Dy Tam <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instituted a special proceeding</span> for issuance of letters of administration before the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, alleging in his petition that he is the son of Rafael Litam who died in Manila on January 10, 1951 and is survived by him and his therein named seven (7) siblings who are children of the decedent by his marriage to Sia Khin celebrated in China in 1911; that the decedent contracted in 1922 in the Philippines another marriage with Marcosa Rivera; and that the decedent left neither a will nor debt.  Dy Tam thus prayed for the issuance of letters of administration to Marcosa Rivera, "the surviving spouse of the decedent." The CFI granted the petition and issued letters of administration to, on Marcosa's request, her nephew Arminio Rivera.<br><br>While the special proceeding was pending, Dy Tam and his purported siblings <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed a civil case</span> before the same court, against the estate of Rafael Litam administrator Arminio Rivera and Remedios R. Espiritu, duly appointed guardian of Marcosa.  In their complaint, Dy Tam and his purported siblings substantially reproduced the allegations made in his petition in the special proceeding, with the addition of a list of properties allegedly acquired during the marriage of the decedent and Marcosa.<br><br>Finding the issue raised in the civil case to be identical to some unresolved incidents in the special proceeding, both were jointly heard by the trial court, following which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it rendered a decision in the civil case</span> dismissing it, declaring, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that the plaintiffs Dy Tam et al. are not the children of the decedent whose only surviving heir is Marcosa.<br><br>On appeal to this Court by Dy Tam et al., one of the two issues raised for determination was whether they are the legitimate children of Rafael Litam.<br><br>This Court, holding that the issue hinged on whether Rafael Litam and Sia Khin were married in 1911, and whether Rafael Litam is the father of appellants Dy Tam et al., found "substantially correct" the trial court's findings of fact and its conclusion that, among other things, the birth certificates of Dy Tam et al. "do not establish the identity of the deceased Rafael Litam and the persons named therein as father [and] it does not appear in the said certificates of birth that Rafael Litam had in any manner intervened in the preparation and filing thereof"; and that "[t]he other documentary evidence presented by [them] [is] entirely immaterial and highly insufficient to prove the alleged marriage between the deceased Rafael Litam and Sia Khin and [their] alleged status . . . as children of said decedent."<br><br>This Court went on to opine in <span style="font-style: italic;">Litam</span>, however, that "the lower court should not have declared, in the decision appealed from, that Marcosa is the only heir of the decedent, for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">such declaration is improper in the [civil case], it being within the exclusive competence of the court in [the] [s]pecial [p]roceeding</span>."<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Solivio</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> also cited in <span style="font-style: italic;">Heirs of Guido and Isabel Yaptinchay</span>, there was a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">special proceeding</span> for the settlement of the estate of the deceased, who was a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">soltero</span>, filed before the RTC of Iloilo.  In the special proceeding, Branch 23 of said court declared as sole heir Celedonia Solivio, the decedent's maternal aunt-half sister of his mother.  Concordia Javellana-Villanueva, the decedent's paternal aunt-sister of his father, moved to reconsider the court's order declaring Celedonia Solivio as sole heir of the decedent, she claiming that she too was an heir. The court denied the motion on the ground of tardiness.  Instead of appealing the denial of her motion, Concordia filed a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">civil case</span> against Celedonia before the same RTC, for partition, recovery of possession, ownership and damages.  The civil case was raffled to Branch 26 of the RTC, which rendered judgment in favor of Concordia.  On appeal by Celedonia, the appellate court affirmed the said judgment.<br><br>On petition for review filed before this Court by Celedonia who posed, among other issues, "whether Branch 26 of the RTC of Iloilo had jurisdiction to entertain [the civil action] for partition and recovery of Concordia Villanueva's share of the estate of [the deceased] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while the [estate] proceedings . . . were still pending</span> . . . in Branch 23 of the same court," this Court held that <span style="font-weight: bold;">"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[i]n the interest of orderly procedure</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to avoid confusing and conflicting dispositions</span> of a decedent's estate, a court should not interfere with [estate] proceedings <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pending</span> in a co-equal court,"</span> citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Guilas v. CFI Judge of Pampanga</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>This Court, however, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Solivio</span>, upon "[c]onsidering that the estate proceedings are still pending, but nonetheless [therein private respondent-Concordia Villanueva] h<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ad lost her right to have herself declared as co-heir</span> in said proceedings, opted to proceed to discuss the merits of her claim <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the interest of justice</span>," and declared her an heir of the decedent.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Guilas</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> cited in <span style="font-style: italic;">Solivio</span>, a project of partition between an adopted daughter, the therein petitioner Juanita Lopez Guilas (Juanita), and her adoptive father was approved in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proceedings for the settlement of the testate estate</span> of the decedent-adoptive mother, following which the probate court directed that the records of the case be archived.<br><br>Juanita subsequently <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed a civil action</span> against her adoptive father to annul the project of partition on the ground of lesion, preterition and fraud, and <span style="font-style: italic;">prayed that her adoptive father immediately deliver to her the two lots allocated to her in the project of partition</span>.  She subsequently <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed a motion in the testate estate proceedings</span> for her adoptive father to <span style="font-style: italic;">deliver to her, among other things, the same two lots allotted to her</span>.<br><br>After conducting pre-trial in the civil case, the trial court, noting the parties' agreement to suspend action or resolution on Juanita's motion in the testate estate proceedings for the delivery to her of the two lots alloted to her until after her complaint in the civil case had been decided, set said case for trial.<br><br>Juanita later filed in the civil case a motion to set aside the order setting it for trial on the ground that in the amended complaint she, in the meantime, filed, she acknowledged the partial legality and validity of the project of partition insofar as she was allotted the two lots, the delivery of which she was seeking.  She thus posited in her motion to set aside the April 27, 1966 order setting the civil case for hearing that there was no longer a prejudicial question to her motion in the testate estate proceedings for the delivery to her of the actual possession of the two lots.  The trial court, by order of April 27, 1966, denied the motion.<br><br>Juanita thereupon assailed the April 27, 1966 order before this Court.<br><br>The probate court's approval of the project of partition and directive that the records of the case be sent to the archives notwithstanding, this Court held that the testate estate proceedings had not been "legally terminated" as Juanita's share under the project of partition had not been delivered to her.  Explained this Court:<br><blockquote>As long as the order of the distribution of the estate has not been complied with, the probate proceedings cannot be deemed closed and terminated (Siguiong vs. Tecson, supra.); because a judicial partition is not final and conclusive and does not prevent the heir from bringing an action to obtain his share, provided the prescriptive period therefor has not elapse (Mari vs. Bonilla, 83 Phil., 137).  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The better practice</span>, however, for the heir who has not received his share, is <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">to demand his share through a proper motion in the same probate or administration proceedings</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> or for <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">re-opening</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the probate or administrative proceedings</span> if it had already been closed, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">not through an independent action, which would be tried by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">another court or Judge which may thus reverse a decision or order of the probate o[r] intestate court</span> already final and executed</span> and re-shuffle properties long ago distributed and disposed of (Ramos vs. Ortuzar, 89 Phil. 730, 741-742; Timbol vs. Cano, supra,; Jingco vs. Daluz, L-5107, April 24, 1953, 92 Phil. 1082; Roman Catholic vs. Agustines, L-14710, March 29, 1960, 107 Phil., 455, 460-461).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>This Court thus set aside the assailed April 27, 1966 order of the trial court setting the civil case for hearing, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allowed the civil case to continue</span> because it "involves no longer" the two lots <span style="text-decoration: underline;">adjudicated to Juanita</span>.<br><br>The common doctrine in <span style="font-style: italic;">Litam, Solivio</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Guilas</span> in which the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">adverse parties are putative heirs to the estate of a decedent or parties to the special proceedings for its settlement</span> is that if the special proceedings are pending, or if there are no special proceedings filed but there is, under the circumstances of the case, a need to file one, then the determination of, among other issues, heirship should be raised and settled in said special proceedings.  Where special proceedings had been instituted but had been finally closed and terminated, however, or if a putative heir has lost the right to have himself declared in the special proceedings as co-heir and he can no longer ask for its re-opening, then an ordinary civil action can be filed for his declaration as heir in order to bring about the annulment of the partition or distribution or adjudication of a property or properties belonging to the estate of the deceased.<br><br>In the case at bar, respondent, believing rightly or wrongly that she was the sole heir to Portugal's estate, executed on February 15, 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the questioned Affidavit of Adjudication under the second sentence of Rule 74, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Said rule is an exception to the general rule that when a person dies leaving a property, it should be judicially administered and the competent court should appoint a qualified administrator, in the order established in Sec. 6, Rule 78 in case the deceased left no will, or in case he did, he failed to name an executor therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Petitioners claim, however, to be the exclusive heirs of Portugal.
