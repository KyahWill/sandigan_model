				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals of 30 March 1999 affirming Resolutions No. 94-4483 and No. 95-2754 of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) dated 11 August 1994 and 11 April 1995, respectively, which in turn affirmed Resolution No. 2309 of the Board of Directors of the Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines (AIIBP) dated 13 December 1993, finding petitioner guilty of Dishonesty in the Performance of Official Duties and/or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and dismissing him from the service, and its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of 15 December 1999 dismissing petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>The records show that petitioner Sappari K. Sawadjaan was among the first employees of the Philippine Amanah Bank (PAB) when it was created by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 264 on 02 August 1973.&nbsp; He rose through the ranks, working his way up from his initial designation as security guard, to settling clerk, bookkeeper, credit investigator, project analyst, appraiser/ inspector, and eventually, loans analyst.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In February 1988, while still designated as appraiser/investigator, Sawadjaan was assigned to inspect the properties offered as collaterals by Compressed Air Machineries and Equipment Corporation (CAMEC) for a credit line of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00).&nbsp; The properties consisted of two parcels of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) No. N-130671 and No. C-52576.&nbsp; On the basis of his Inspection and Appraisal Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the PAB granted the loan application.&nbsp; When the loan matured on 17 May 1989, CAMEC requested an extension of 180 days, but was granted only 120 days to repay the loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Sawadjaan was promoted to Loans Analyst I on 01 July 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In January 1990, Congress passed Republic Act 6848 creating the AIIBP and repealing P.D. No. 264 (which created the PAB).&nbsp; All assets, liabilities and capital accounts of the PAB were transferred to the AIIBP,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and the existing personnel of the PAB were to continue to discharge their functions unless discharged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the ensuing reorganization, Sawadjaan was among the personnel retained by the AIIBP.<br><br>When CAMEC failed to pay despite the given extension, the bank, now referred to as the AIIBP, discovered that TCT No. N-130671 was spurious, the property described therein non-existent, and that the property covered by TCT No. C-52576 had a prior existing mortgage in favor of one Divina Pablico.<br><br>On 08 June 1993, the Board of Directors of the AIIBP created an Investigating Committee to look into the CAMEC transaction, which had cost the bank Six Million Pesos (P6,000,000.00) in losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The subsequent events, as found and decided upon by the Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> are as follows:<br><blockquote>On 18 June 1993, petitioner received a memorandum from Islamic Bank [AIIBP] Chairman Roberto F. De Ocampo charging him with Dishonesty in the Performance of Official Duties and/or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and preventively suspending him.<br><br>In his memorandum dated 8 September 1993, petitioner informed the Investigating Committee that he could not submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Committee because of its alleged partiality.&nbsp; For his failure to appear before the hearing set on 17 September 1993, after the hearing of 13 September 1993 was postponed due to the Manifestation of even date filed by petitioner, the Investigating Committee declared petitioner in default and the prosecution was allowed to present its evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>.<br><br>On 08 December 1993, the Investigating Committee rendered a decision, the pertinent portions of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>In view of respondent SAWADJAAN'S abject failure to perform his duties and assigned tasks as appraiser/inspector, which resulted to the prejudice and substantial damage to the Bank, respondent should be held liable therefore.&nbsp; At this juncture, however, the Investigating Committee is of the considered opinion that he could not be held liable for the administrative offense of dishonesty considering the fact that no evidence was adduced to show that he profited or benefited from being remiss in the performance of his duties.&nbsp; The record is bereft of any evidence which would show that he received any amount in consideration for his non-performance of his official duties.<br><br>This notwithstanding, respondent cannot escape liability.&nbsp; As adverted to earlier, his failure to perform his official duties resulted to the prejudice and substantial damage to the Islamic Bank for which he should be held liable for the administrative offense of CONDUCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE SERVICE.<br><br>Premises considered, the Investigating Committee recommends that respondent SAPPARI SAWADJAAN be meted the penalty of SIX (6) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY SUSPENSION from office in accordance with the Civil Service Commission's Memorandum Circular No. 30, Series of 1989.<br></blockquote>On 13 December 1993, the Board of Directors of the Islamic Bank [AIIBP] adopted Resolution No. 2309 finding petitioner guilty of Dishonesty in the Performance of Official Duties and/or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and imposing the penalty of Dismissal from the Service.<br><br>On reconsideration, the Board of Directors of the Islamic Bank [AIIBP] adopted the Resolution No. 2332 on 20 February 1994 reducing the penalty imposed on petitioner from dismissal to suspension for a period of six (6) months and one (1) day.<br><br>On 29 March 1994, petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB).<br><br>On 11 August 1994, the CSC adopted Resolution No. 94-4483 dismissing the appeal for lack of merit and affirming Resolution No. 2309 dated 13 December 1993 of the Board of Directors of Islamic Bank.<br><br>On 11 April 1995, the CSC adopted Resolution No. 95-2574 denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>On 16 June 1995, the instant petition was filed with the Honorable Supreme Court on the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>Public respondent Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines has committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction when it initiated and conducted administrative investigation without a validly promulgated rules of procedure in the adjudication of administrative cases at the Islamic Bank.<br><br></li><li>Public respondent Civil Service Commission has committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it prematurely and falsely assumed jurisdiction of the case not appealed to it, but to the Merit System Protection Board.<br><br></li><li>Both the Islamic Bank and the Civil Service Commission erred in finding petitioner Sawadjaan of having deliberately reporting false information and therefore guilty of Dishonesty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and penalized with dismissal from the service.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On 04 July 1995, the Honorable Supreme Court<i> En Banc</i> referred this petition to this Honorable Court pursuant to Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, which took effect on 01 June 1995.<br><br>We do not find merit [in] the petition.<br><br>Anent the first assignment of error, a reading of the records would reveal that petitioner raises for the first time the alleged failure of the Islamic Bank [AIIBP] to promulgate rules of procedure governing the adjudication and disposition of administrative cases involving its personnel.&nbsp; It is a rule that issues not properly brought and ventilated below may not be raised for the first time on appeal, save in exceptional circumstances (<i>Casolita, Sr. v. Court of Appeals</i>, 275 SCRA 257) none of which, however, obtain in this case.&nbsp; Granting <i>arguendo</i> that the issue is of such exceptional character that the Court may take cognizance of the same, still, it must fail.&nbsp; Section 26 of Republic Act No. 6848 (1990) provides:<br><blockquote>Section 26.&nbsp; Powers of the Board.&nbsp; The Board of Directors shall have the <i>broadest powers to manage the Islamic Bank,</i> x x x The Board shall adopt policy guidelines necessary to carry out effectively the provisions of this Charter as well as <i>internal rules and regulations necessary for the conduct of its Islamic banking business and all matters related to personnel organization, office functions and salary administration.&nbsp;</i> (Italics ours)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, Item No. 2 of Executive Order No. 26 (1992) entitled "Prescribing Procedure and Sanctions to Ensure Speedy Disposition of Administrative Cases" directs, "all administrative agencies" to "adopt and include in their respective Rules of Procedure" provisions designed to abbreviate administrative proceedings.<br><br>The above two (2) provisions relied upon by petitioner does not require the Islamic Bank [AIIBP] to promulgate rules of procedure before administrative discipline may be imposed upon its employees.&nbsp; The internal rules of procedures ordained to be adopted by the Board refers to that necessary for the conduct of its Islamic banking business and all matters related to "personnel organization, office functions and salary administration."&nbsp; On the contrary, Section 26 of RA 6848 gives the Board of Directors of the Islamic Bank the "broadest powers to manage the Islamic Bank."&nbsp; This grant of broad powers would be an idle ceremony if it would be powerless to discipline its employees.<br><br>The second assignment of error must likewise fail.&nbsp; The issue is raised for the first time <i>via</i> this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Petitioner submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the CSC.&nbsp; Although he could have raised the alleged lack of jurisdiction in his Motion for Reconsideration of Resolution No. 94-4483 of the CSC, he did not do so.&nbsp; By filing the Motion for Reconsideration, he is estopped from denying the CSC's jurisdiction over him, as it is settled rule that a party who asks for an affirmative relief cannot later on impugn the action of the tribunal as without jurisdiction after an adverse result was meted to him.&nbsp; Although jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case may be objected to at any stage of the proceedings even on appeal, this particular rule, however, means that jurisdictional issues in a case can be raised only during the proceedings in said case and during the appeal of said case (<i>Aragon v. Court of Appeals</i>, 270 SCRA 603).&nbsp; The case at bar is a petition [for] <i>certiorari</i> and not an appeal. <br><br>But even on the merits the argument must falter.&nbsp; Item No. 1 of CSC Resolution No. 93-2387 dated 29 June 1993, provides:<br><blockquote>Decisions in administrative cases involving officials and employees of the civil service appealable to the Commission pursuant to Section 47 of Book V of the Code (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, Administrative Code of 1987) including personnel actions such as contested appointments shall now be appealed directly to the Commission and not to the MSPB.<br></blockquote>In <i>Rubenecia v. Civil Service Commission</i>, 244 SCRA 640, 651, it was categorically held:.<blockquote> . . The functions of the MSPB relating to the determination of administrative disciplinary cases were, in other words, re-allocated to the Commission itself.<br></blockquote>Be that as it may, "(i)t is hornbook doctrine that in order `(t)o ascertain whether a court (in this case, administrative agency) has jurisdiction or not, the provisions of the law should be inquired into."&nbsp; Furthermore, `the jurisdiction of the court must appear clearly from the statute law or it will not be held to exist.'"(<i>Azarcon v. Sandiganbayan</i>, 268 SCRA 747, 757)&nbsp; From the provision of law abovecited, the Civil Service Commission clearly has jurisdiction over the Administrative Case against petitioner.<br><br>Anent the third assignment of error, we likewise do not find merit in petitioner's proposition that he should not be liable, as in the first place, he was not qualified to perform the functions of appraiser/investigator because he lacked the necessary training and expertise, and therefore, should not have been found dishonest by the Board of Directors of Islamic Bank [AIIBP] and the CSC.&nbsp; Petitioner himself admits that the position of appraiser/inspector is "one of the most serious [and] sensitive job in the banking operations."&nbsp; He should have been aware that accepting such a designation, he is obliged to perform the task at hand by the exercise of more than ordinary prudence.&nbsp; As appraiser/investigator, he is expected, among others, to check the authenticity of the documents presented by the borrower by comparing them with the originals on file with the proper government office.&nbsp; He should have made it sure that the technical descriptions in the location plan on file with the Bureau of Lands of Marikina, jibe with that indicated in the TCT of the collateral offered by CAMEC, and that the mortgage in favor of the Islamic Bank was duly annotated at the back of the copy of the TCT kept by the Register of Deeds of Marikina.&nbsp; This, petitioner failed to do, for which he must be held liable.&nbsp; That he did not profit from his false report is of no moment.&nbsp; Neither the fact that it was not deliberate or willful, detracts from the nature of the act as dishonest.&nbsp; What is apparent is he stated something to be a fact, when he really was not sure that it was so.<br><br>Wherefore, above premises considered, the instant Petition is DISMISSED, and the assailed Resolutions of the Civil Service Commission are hereby AFFIRMED.<br></blockquote>On 24 March 1999, Sawadjaan's counsel notified the court<span style="font-style: italic;"> a quo</span> of his change of address,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> but apparently neglected to notify his client of this fact.&nbsp; Thus, on 23 July 1999, Sawadjaan, by himself, filed a Motion for New Trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in the Court of Appeals based on the following grounds: fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence and newly discovered evidence.&nbsp; He claimed that he had recently discovered that at the time his employment was terminated, the AIIBP had not yet adopted its corporate by-laws.&nbsp; He attached a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it was only on 27 May 1992 that the AIIBP submitted its draft by-laws to the SEC, and that its registration was being held in abeyance pending certain corrections being made thereon.&nbsp; Sawadjaan argued that since the AIIBP failed to file its by-laws within 60 days from the passage of Rep. Act No. 6848, as required by Sec. 51 of the said law, the bank and its stockholders had "already forfeited its franchise or charter, including its license to exist and operate as a corporation,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and thus no longer have "the legal standing and personality to initiate an administrative case."<br><br>Sawadjaan's counsel subsequently adopted his motion, but requested that it be treated as a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This motion was denied by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> in its Resolution of 15 December 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Still disheartened, Sawadjaan filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court challenging the above Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals on the ground that the court <i>a quo</i> erred: i) in ignoring the facts and evidences that the alleged Islamic Bank has no valid by-laws; ii) in ignoring the facts and evidences that the Islamic Bank lost its juridical personality as a corporation on 16 April 1990; iii) in ignoring the facts and evidences that the alleged Islamic Bank and its alleged Board of Directors have no jurisdiction to act in the manner they did in the absence of a valid by-laws; iv) in not correcting the acts of the Civil Service Commission who erroneously rendered the assailed Resolutions No. 94-4483 and No. 95-2754 as a result of fraud, falsification and/or misrepresentations committed by Farouk A. Carpizo and his group, including Roberto F. de Ocampo; v) in affirming an unconscionably harsh and/or excessive penalty; and vi) in failing to consider newly discovered evidence and reverse its decision accordingly.<br><br>Subsequently, petitioner Sawadjaan filed an <span style="font-style: italic;">"</span><i>Ex-parte </i>Urgent Motion for Additional Extension of Time to File a Reply (to the Comments of Respondent Al-Amanah Investment Bank of the Philippines),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Reply (to Respondent's Consolidated Comment,)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and Reply (to the Alleged Comments of Respondent Al-Amanah Islamic Bank of the Philippines)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; On 13 October 2000, he informed this Court that he had terminated his lawyer's services, and, by himself, prepared and filed the following: 1) Motion for New Trial;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 2) Motion to Declare Respondents in Default and/or Having Waived their Rights to Interpose Objection to Petitioner's Motion for New Trial;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> 3) <span style="font-style: italic;">Ex-Parte </span>Urgent Motions to Punish Attorneys Amado D.

Act No. 6848, all proceedings initiated by AIIBP and all actions resulting therefrom are a patent nullity.&nbsp; Or, in his words, the AIIBP and its officers and Board of Directors,<br><blockquote>. . . [H]ave no legal authority nor jurisdiction to manage much less operate the Islamic Bank, file administrative charges and investigate petitioner in the manner they did and allegedly passed Board Resolution No. 2309 on December 13, 1993 which is <u>null and void for lack of an (<i>sic</i>) authorized and valid by-laws.</u>&nbsp; The CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION was therefore affirming, erroneously, a null and void "Resolution No. 2309 dated December 13, 1993 of the Board of Directors of Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines" in CSC Resolution No. 94-4483 dated August 11, 1994.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration thereof was denied by the CSC in its Resolution No. 95-2754 dated April 11, 1995.&nbsp; Both acts/resolutions of the CSC are erroneous, resulting from fraud, falsifications and misrepresentations of the alleged Chairman and CEO Roberto F. de Ocampo and the alleged Director Farouk A. Carpizo and his group at the alleged Islamic Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Nowhere in petitioner's voluminous pleadings is there a showing that the court <i>a quo</i> committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction reversible by a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Petitioner already raised the question of AIIBP's corporate existence and lack of jurisdiction in his Motion for New Trial/Motion for Reconsideration of 27 May 1997 and was denied by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Despite the volume of pleadings he has submitted thus far, he has added nothing substantial to his arguments.<br><br>The AIIBP was created by Rep. Act No. 6848.&nbsp; It has a main office where it conducts business, has shareholders, corporate officers, a board of directors, assets, and personnel.&nbsp; It is, in fact, here represented by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, "the principal law office of government-owned corporations, one of which is respondent bank."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> At the very least, by its failure to submit its by-laws on time, the AIIBP may be considered a <i>de facto</i> corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> whose right to exercise corporate powers may not be inquired into collaterally in any private suit to which such corporations may be a party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Moreover, a corporation which has failed to file its by-laws within the prescribed period does not <i>ipso facto</i> lose its powers as such.&nbsp; The SEC Rules on Suspension/Revocation of the Certificate of Registration of Corporations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> details the procedures and remedies that may be availed of before an order of revocation can be issued.&nbsp; There is no showing that such a procedure has been initiated in this case.<br><br>In any case, petitioner's argument is irrelevant because this case is not a corporate controversy, but a labor dispute; and it is an employer's basic right to freely select or discharge its employees, if only as a measure of self-protection against acts inimical to its interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Regardless of whether AIIBP is a corporation, a partnership, a sole proprietorship, or a <i>sari-sari</i> store, it is an undisputed fact that AIIBP is the petitioner's employer.&nbsp; AIIBP chose to retain his services during its reorganization, controlled the means and methods by which his work was to be performed, paid his wages, and, eventually, terminated his services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>And though he has had ample opportunity to do so, the petitioner has not alleged that he is anything other than an employee of AIIBP.&nbsp; He has neither claimed, nor shown, that he is a stockholder or an officer of the corporation.&nbsp; Having accepted employment from AIIBP, and rendered his services to the said bank, received his salary, and accepted the promotion given him, it is now too late in the day for petitioner to question its existence and its power to terminate his services.&nbsp; One who assumes an obligation to an ostensible corporation as such, cannot resist performance thereof on the ground that there was in fact no corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Even if we were to consider the facts behind petitioner Sawadjaan's dismissal from service, we would be hard pressed to find error in the decision of the AIIBP.<br><br>As appraiser/investigator, the petitioner was expected to conduct an ocular inspection of the properties offered by CAMEC as collaterals and check the copies of the certificates of title against those on file with the Registry of Deeds.&nbsp; Not only did he fail to conduct these routine checks, but he also deliberately misrepresented in his appraisal report that after reviewing the documents and conducting a site inspection, he found the CAMEC loan application to be in order.&nbsp; Despite the number of pleadings he has filed, he has failed to offer an alternative explanation for his actions.<br><br>When he was informed of the charges against him and directed to appear and present his side on the matter, the petitioner sent instead a memorandum questioning the fairness and impartiality of the members of the investigating committee and refusing to recognize their jurisdiction over him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the investigating committee rescheduled the hearing to give the petitioner another chance, but he still refused to appear before it.<br><br>Thereafter, witnesses were presented, and a decision was rendered finding him guilty of dishonesty and dismissing him from service.&nbsp; He sought a reconsideration of this decision and the same committee whose impartiality he questioned reduced their recommended penalty to suspension for six months and one day.&nbsp; The board of directors, however, opted to dismiss him from service.<br><br>On appeal to the CSC, the Commission found that Sawadjaan's failure to perform his official duties greatly prejudiced the AIIBP, for which he should be held accountable.&nbsp; It held that:<br><blockquote>. . . (I)t is crystal clear that respondent SAPPARI SAWADJAAN was remiss in the performance of his duties as appraiser/inspector.&nbsp; Had respondent performed his duties as appraiser/inspector, he could have easily noticed that the property located at Balintawak, Caloocan City covered by TCT No. C-52576 and which is one of the properties offered as collateral by CAMEC is encumbered to Divina Pablico.&nbsp; Had respondent reflected such fact in his appraisal/inspection report on said property the ISLAMIC BANK would not have approved CAMEC's loan of P500,000.00 in 1987 and CAMEC's P5 Million loan in 1988, respondent knowing fully well the Bank's policy of not accepting encumbered properties as collateral.<br><br>Respondent SAWADJAAN's reprehensible act is further aggravated when he failed to check and verify from the Registry of Deeds of Marikina the authenticity of the property located at Mayamot, Antipolo, Rizal covered by TCT No. N-130671 and which is one of the properties offered as collateral by CAMEC for its P5 Million loan in 1988.&nbsp; If he only visited and verified with the Register of Deeds of Marikina the authenticity of TCT No. N-130671 he could have easily discovered that TCT No. N-130671 is fake and the property described therein non-existent.<br><br>. . .<br><br>This notwithstanding, respondent cannot escape liability.&nbsp; As adverted to earlier, his failure to perform his official duties resulted to the prejudice and substantial damage to the ISLAMIC BANK for which he should be held liable for the administrative offense of CONDUCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE SERVICE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>From the foregoing, we find that the CSC and the court <i>a quo</i> committed no grave abuse of discretion when they sustained Sawadjaan's dismissal from service.&nbsp; Grave abuse of discretion implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, or, in other words, where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The records show that the respondents did none of these; they acted in accordance with the law.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is DISMISSED.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals of 30 March 1999 affirming Resolutions No. 94-4483 and No. 95-2754 of the Civil Service Commission, and its Resolution of 15 December 1999 are hereby affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against the petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Panganiban, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, </i>and<i> Garcia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Puno, J.,</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Docketed as CA-G.R.
