No objection to the admission of Hermosura's testimony was, however, raised by the defense.<br><br>Hermosura, a tricycle driver, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the first time since the incident occurred more than a year earlier</span>, gave an account of what he claimed to have witnessed, as follows:<br><br>About 10:00 o'clock in the evening of April 9, 1992, while he was resting by the roadside fronting the NODA terminal at Malvar Street,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> he, at a distance of ten meters, saw appellant, also known in the place as "Anggay Padrones," arrive on a tricycle with a companion.&nbsp;

Without any provocation, the strangers uttered invectives at him and they "quarreled," drawing him to retreat.&nbsp; As he was retreating, he noticed that something was thrown at him by one of the three.&nbsp;

When he confronted the three, however, they told him that they just heard his name mentioned by the police and that they were even drunk when they made their statements.&nbsp; That explains why the three repaired to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to withdraw their statements implicating him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The defense also presented Romeo Pareja<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Pareja), the father of the two girls, Annalyn and Genelyn, who were slightly injured by the explosion. <br><br>At the witness stand, Pareja declared as follows: <br><br>On the date and time of the incident, he, together with his wife and his two daughters were walking on their way home from Mendoza Park.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; As they were passing through Malvar Street, he noticed that appellant was engaged in a conversation with three persons.&nbsp; He soon heard an explosion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> but he did not see who was responsible therefor.&nbsp; While he later came to know that appellant was accused for the incident, he did not lodge any complaint against him as the injuries of his children were only slight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>By the assailed consolidated judgment, the trial court convicted appellant of the three charges.

When asked, however, who the children were, he could not furnish their names.<br><br>Hermosura's testimony that he brought the children to the hospital is belied by their father's claim that he brought them to the hospital.&nbsp; That he does not even know the names of the children, assuming that he assisted the father in bringing them to the hospital, betrays his prevarication, for it is incredible that he would not have come to know their names, given the usual procedure in hospitals to note down the names of patients.<br><br>As for Hermosura's claim that the children were more or less two (2) meters away from the explosion, it is likewise belied by their father's testimony that "he and his family were more or less <b>12 meters from the place where the blast occurred.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Not only that.&nbsp; It is incredible.&nbsp; For by the natural course of things, if the children were merely two meters away from the place where the blast occurred, they would have been killed or maimed or seriously wounded.&nbsp; But they merely suffered slight injuries.<br><br>Romeo Pareja's testifying for the defense, instead of for the prosecution, only indicates that he was not convinced of appellant's involvement.<br><br>More incredibilities.&nbsp; When asked where the fatal victim Elias was when the grenade exploded, Hermosura declared that the latter was "at the second floor of their house inside the room."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; When pressed how he could have known of Elias whereabouts, he replied that he "used to pass by the house of the victim and he knew that by that time he was asleep at his room upstair[s]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>And why Hermosura remained at the scene where the alleged warring parties were, despite his claim that appellant was dangling the grenade for 2 minutes before he threw it,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> defies credulity.&nbsp; For the normal reaction of a person who is faced with a threat to his life with the possible throwing of a hand grenade in the vicinity would be, in an instinct of self-preservation, to hie to a safe place to avoid being hit in case it is thrown as it was, in the case at bar, eventually.<br><br>On Hermosura's claim that appellant threw the hand grenade to his adversaries who were about 2 to 3 meters away:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Why a person in the offensive who tries to harm his enemies by throwing a grenade at such close distance, which undoubtedly could also cause him harm unless of course he wants to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>, further defies credulity.<br><br>Hermosura's lack of credibility becomes more pronounced on considering his belated posturing as a witness for the prosecution. <span style="font-style: italic;">Notatu digdum</span> is his failure to immediately give any statement in connection with the case, like the three alleged eyewitnesses who were to recant their statements later.&nbsp; It was only more that a year from the occurrence of the incident on April 9, 1992 or on June 8, 1993 that he, <u>for the first time</u>, gave his account, when he took the witness stand, of what he allegedly witnessed.&nbsp; His explanation behind his failure to timely give a statement — that he took care of the deceased, who certainly did not lie in state for more than a year — betrays his absolute lack of knowledge of the incident.<br><br>To be credible, testimonial evidence should come not only from the mouth of a credible witness.&nbsp; The testimony must also be credible, reasonable and in accord with human experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> No better test has yet been found to determine the weight of the testimony of a witness than its conformity to the knowledge and common experience of mankind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; This Court finds that Hermosura's testimony failed to pass this test.<br><br>Since the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence but it has failed to discharge its burden of <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> proving the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of appellant, the burden of the evidence did not pass to the defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;
