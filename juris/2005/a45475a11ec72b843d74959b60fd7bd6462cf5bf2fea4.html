No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 3</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Period of ordinary appeal</span>. – The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order appealed from. Where a record on appeal is required, the appellants shall file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order. However, on appeal in <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> cases shall be taken within forty-eight (48) hours from notice of the judgment or final order appealed from.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The period of appeal shall be interrupted by a timely motion for new trial or reconsideration.</span> No motion for extension of time to file a motion for new trial or reconsideration shall be allowed. (Underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>On the other hand, Rule 22 provides for the manner of computing time and the effect of interruption:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 1</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">How to compute time.</span> – In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included. If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 2.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Effect of interruption.</span> – Should an act be done which <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">effectively interrupts</span> the running of the period, the allowable period after such interruption shall start to run on the day after notice of the cessation of the cause thereof.<br><br>The day of the act that caused the interruption shall be excluded in the computation of the period. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>The requirement of notice under Sections 4 and 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of Rule 15 in connection with Section 2, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court is mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Absence of the mandatory requirement renders the motion a worthless piece of paper which the clerk of court has no right to receive and which the court has no authority to act upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Being a fatal defect, in cases of motions to reconsider a decision, the running of the period to appeal is not tolled by their filing or pendency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>When the bank then filed its Motion for Reconsideration on the last of the 15-day period for taking an appeal and it was subsequently denied, the bank had only one (1) day from December 9, 2002 when it received a copy of the order denying the motion or until December 10, 2002 within which to perfect its appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>It filed the Notice of Appeal, however, on December 11, 2002, hence, out of time, and the decision of the trial court had become final and executory.<br><br>While Rules may be relaxed when the party invoking liberality adequately explains his failure to abide therewith, the bank failed to do so.<br><br>The explanations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> proffered by the bank behind its failure to incorporate a notice of hearing of the Motion for Reconsideration&nbsp; — inadvertent deletion from its computer file of the standard clauses for pleadings during the printing of the finalized draft of the motion and the handling counsel's heavy workload — are unsatisfactory.<br><br>To credit the foregoing explanations would render the mandatory rule on notice of hearing meaningless and nugatory as lawyers would simply invoke these grounds should they fail to comply with the rules.<br><br>As to the claim that the government would suffer loss of substantial amount if not allowed to recover the proceeds of the loans, this Court finds that any loss was caused by respondent's own doing or undoing.<br><br>In fine, the failure to timely perfect an appeal cannot simply be dismissed as a mere technicality, for it is jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><blockquote>Nor can petitioner invoke the doctrine that rules of technicality must yield to the broader interest of substantial justice. While every litigant must be given the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities, the failure to perfect an appeal within the reglementary period is not a mere technicality. It raises a <span style="font-weight: bold;">jurisdictional </span>problem as it deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction over the appeal. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The failure to file the notice of appeal within the reglementary period is akin to the failure to pay the appeal fee within the prescribed period. In both cases, the appeal is not perfected in due time.</span> As we held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pedrosa v. Hill,</span> the requirement of an appeal fee is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by no means a mere technicality of law or procedure, but an essential requirement without which the decision appealed from would become final and executory</span>. The same can be said about the late filing of a notice of appeal.
