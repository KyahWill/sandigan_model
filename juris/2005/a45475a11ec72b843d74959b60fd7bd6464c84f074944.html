				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court are two consolidated petitions for review on certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals Decision of October 12, 2001 and Resolution of February 19, 2002 in CA-G.R. SP No. 65406, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Acesite (Philippines) Hotel Corporation, Holiday Inn Manila, Johann Angerbauer and Phil Kennedy v. National Labor Relations Commission and Leo A. Gonzales.</span>”<br><br>The antecedents of the case are as follows:<br><br>Leo A. Gonzales (Gonzales) was hired on October 18, 1993 as Chief of Security of Manila Pavillion Hotel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;January 1, 1995, Acesite Corporation (Acesite) took over the operations of Manila Pavillion and renamed it Holiday Inn Manila (the hotel).&nbsp; Acesite retained Gonzales as Chief of Security of the hotel.<br><br>On March 25, 1998, Gonzales took a 4-day sick leave and took emergency leave on March 30, 1998.&nbsp; On April 16-29, 1998, he again took a 12-day vacation leave, thereby using up all leaves that he was entitled for the year.<br><br>Before the expiration of his 12-day vacation leave or on April 23, 1998, Gonzales filed an application<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> for emergency leave for 10 days commencing on April 30 up to May 13, 1998.&nbsp; The application was not, however, approved.&nbsp; By Acesite’s claim, he received a telegram<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> informing him of the disapproval and asking him to report back for work on April 30, 1998.<br><br>Gonzales did not report for work on April 30, 1998.&nbsp; On even date, he received a telegram<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> from Acesite advising him that he was on unauthorized leave and asking him to provide a written explanation within the next 24 hours why he was not reporting for work.&nbsp; At the same time, he was required to report for work the following day or on May 1, 1998.<br><br>On May 2, 1998, Gonzales’ father Anacleto sent a telegram<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to Acesite stating that he was still recovering from severe stomach disorder and would report back for work on May 4, 1998.&nbsp; A medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated May 3, 1998 issued by a Dr. Laureano C. Gonzales, Jr. stating that Gonzales was under his care from April 30 – May 3, 1998 was presented to prove that he indeed was treated from such sickness.<br><br>On May 4, 1998, around lunchtime, Gonzales reported for work and presented himself to Johann Angerbauer, then Resident Manager of the hotel.&nbsp; Angerbauer claims that when Gonzales went to him, he asked him to explain why he had been absent despite orders for him to report back for work to which he (Gonzales) replied that it was necessary for him to go home to his province in&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Abra.<br><br>Gonzales, on the other hand, claims that when he conferred with Angerbauer, he requested for leave without pay from May 5-9, 1998 which was provisionally approved on condition that he (Gonzales) would be sending his explanation through e-mail behind his absences on April 30, 1998 and May 2, 1998 so that Angerbauer could send it to the hotel General Manager Phil Kennedy who was then out of the country.<br><br>Around 5:33 pm of May 4, 1998, Gonzales sent his explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to Angerbauer through e-mail, to wit, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>:<br><blockquote>This has reference with your verbal instruction that I will submit my written explanation regarding my absences on April 30,1998 and May 2, 1998.<br><br>At the outset, my profound apologies for the above-stated absences.&nbsp; As you are fully aware of, on April 27, 1998, I formally requested your office that my official leave [which] will expire on April 29, 1998 shall be extended up to May 15, 1998.&nbsp; Inasmuch that I was in the province (ABRA) at that time, I was not aware that my request was disapproved until such time that I received your telegram two days later.&nbsp; Likewise, when I received your telegram, I was sick at that time and this was duly communicated to your office thru telegram.&nbsp; This was the reason I failed to report for work also on May 2, 1998.<br><br>As exhaustively discussed to you today, there is a great necessity for me to go home tonight in the province.&nbsp; Once again, I am asking your kind understanding that I shall be allowed to go on leave effective tomorrow and rest assured that I will report for work after the election.&nbsp; At any rate, the training of our new guards will start on May 18, 1998.<br><br>Thank you for this and for the past favors.<br></blockquote>In the evening Gonzales left for Abra.<br><br>Also on May 4, 1998 Angerbauer sent the following inter-office memo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to Gonzales, allegedly received at around 7:55 pm by the security staff:<br><blockquote>As discussed during our meeting, you are advised to submit an explanation within 24 hours why you did not report to work 1st May 1998? And why you came in late today 4th of May 1998, as we had a 10:30 AM scheduled communication meeting with the incoming Security Agency.<br><br>We will be having another meeting tomorrow regarding the turnover of the outgoing Security Agency.&nbsp; I will be expecting your presence during the said meeting.<br><br>For your compliance.<br></blockquote>Gonzales claims that he got hold of a copy of the above-quoted memo only on May 8, 1998.<br><br>Gonzales not having reported for work on May 5, 1998, Angerbauer sent him on even date the following telegram<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> at his provincial address in Abra:<br><blockquote>THIS IS TO REITERATE OUR ADVICE FOR YOU TO REPORT BACK TO WORK IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE DUE TO VERY URGENT MATTERS INVOLVING SECURITY DEPARTMENT’S CONCERNS WHICH IMPERATIVELY REQUIRE YOUR PERSONAL ATTENTION. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS AS OUR FINAL ADVICE.<br></blockquote>Gonzales, who claims to have received the May 5, 1998 telegram only in the afternoon of May 7, 1998, immediately repaired back to Manila on May 8, 1998 only to be “humiliatingly and ignominiously barred by the guard (a subordinate of [Gonzales]) from entering the premises.”<br><br>It appears that on May 7, 1998, Angerbauer issued the following Notice of Termination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> through an inter-office memo:<br><blockquote>As you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continuously</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disregard</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">several</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">advices</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">report</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">back</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">work</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attend</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">urgent</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">matters</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">involving</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Department’s</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">concerns</span> which, as categorically made clear to you, imperatively required your personal presence and attention considering that you are its Department Head, thus adversely affecting the operations of said&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;department, we are left with no recourse but to terminate your services from the Hotel effective immediately for violations of rule no. 27, Type C, of the House Code of Discipline – “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acts</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gross</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disobedience</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insubordination</span>” and provisions of the Labor Code, specifically Art. 282.

Gonzales, however, failed to appear in 2 consecutive hearings despite notice, meriting the dismissal by the Labor Arbiter of his complaint by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of September 17, 1998.<br><br>Gonzales refiled on July 13, 1999 his complaint for illegal dismissal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> against Angerbauer and Kennedy, which he amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on September 20, 1999, by impleading Acesite as respondent.<br><br>After the filing of their respective position papers, pleadings and documentary evidence, the Labor Arbiter, by Decision of February 7, 2000, dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, it holding that Gonzales was dismissed for just cause and was not denied of due process.<br><br>Gonzales appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), he faulting the Labor Arbiter as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>The Labor Arbiter committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>The Labor Arbiter seriously erred in the finding of facts, which caused grave or irreparable damage or injury to the complainant/appellant.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>The Labor Arbiter seriously erred in the finding that there was absence of due process in the dismissal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of December 29, 2000, the NLRC reversed that of the Labor Arbiter, the dispositive portion of which is quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision of Labor Arbiter Geobel A.

(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Acesite thereupon filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals anchored on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE NLRC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT REVERSED THE FINDING OF THE LABOR ARBITER THAT THE RESPONDENT WAS LEGALLY DISMISSED FOR JUST CAUSE[.]<br><br></li><li>THE NLRC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT REVERSED THE FINDING OF THE LABOR ARBITER THAT THE RESPONDENT WAS AFFORDED PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS[.]<br><br></li><li>THE NLRC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT REVERSED THE FINDING OF THE LABOR ARBITER THAT THE RESPONDENT IS NOT ENTITLED TO HIS MONEY CLAIMS[.]<br><br></li><li>THE NLRC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT INCLUDED PETITIONERS PHIL KENNEDY AND JOHANN ANGERBAUER LIABLE TO THE RESPONDENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THEY ARE MERE EMPLOYEES OF THE HOTEL[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of October 12, 2001, the Court of Appeals, finding that Gonzales was illegally dismissed, affirmed with modification the NLRC decision:<br><blockquote>After a careful study of the evidence on record and of the allegations of both parties, this Court is convinced that private respondent <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gonzales</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">illegally</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dismissed</span>.<br><br>The parties hereto contest the receipt by private respondent Gonzales of the first telegram sent by petitioner Angerbauer.&nbsp;

Gonzales, Jr., We do not think Dr. Gonzales who likewise ran for the same elective position as herein private respondent Gonzales would help him cover up his absences if he really did not treat the latter and had him under his care.&nbsp; Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">report</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">work</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ma</span>y <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1998</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">justified</span>.<br><br>As to the third telegram, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">final</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">notice</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioners</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">private</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gonzales,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directed</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">him</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">report</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">work</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">upon</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">receipt</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thereof,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complied</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> by the latter when he reported to the hotel on May 8, 1998 but was refused entry. &nbsp;Petitioners insist that he did not report to work.

What petitioners did was to send him a notice of termination on the premise that his immediate dismissal is authorized under their House Code of Discipline.&nbsp; While it is recognized that company policies and regulations, unless they are oppressive or contrary to law, are generally valid and binding on the parties and must be complied with, the same cannot be exercised for the purpose of defeating the rights of the employees under the law.<br><br>Unfortunately for petitioners, their employees are still entitled to the procedural requirements of notice and hearing despite provisions in their code of discipline purportedly giving them the right to immediately terminate their services.&nbsp; Employees cannot bargain away this right notwithstanding their acquiescence to the employer’s rules.<br><br>As to petitioners’ claim that private respondent willfully disobeyed their orders, the Supreme Court in the case of Lagatic vs. NLRC held:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">In order that an employer may dismiss an employee on the ground of willful disobedience, there must be concurrence of at least two (2) requisites: the employee’s assailed conduct must have been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">willful</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentional</span>, the willingness being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">characterized</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrongful</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perverse</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attitude</span>;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">discharge</span>.</span><br></blockquote>The present case does not show the presence of the first requisite.&nbsp; As private respondent Gonzales’ failure to comply with petitioners’ orders were not characterized by a perverse attitude. At most he can only be suspended from service for assuming that his leaves of absence would be approved by management.&nbsp; The penalty of dismissal is too harsh considering that private respondent Gonzales has been with the company for almost five (5) years and has rendered unblemished service until the period in controversy.&nbsp; For his unauthorized absences, We hereby rule that a suspension of one (1) week is commensurate to his violation of Type C, House Code of Discipline rule on unauthorized absences.<br><br>Anent the alleged willful non-disclosure by private respondent Gonzales of his candidacy for public office, We find the same to be unsupported by evidence.&nbsp; The tenor of private respondent Gonzales’ internal email to petitioner Angerbauer reveals that the latter was aware that the reason for the former’s prolonged absences was his ongoing campaign as Board Member of the Province of Abra.

and that Gonzales was afforded procedural due process as the twin requirements of notice and hearing were complied with through the numerous telegrams sent to both Gonzales’ city and provincial addresses asking him to report for work and explain his unauthorized absences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>This Court finds no reason to depart from the findings of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Indeed, there appears to have been no just cause to dismiss Gonzales from employment.&nbsp; As correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, Gonzales cannot be considered to have <span style="font-weight: bold;">willfully</span> disobeyed his employer.&nbsp; Willful disobedience entails the concurrence of at least two (2) requisites: the employee’s assailed conduct has been willful or intentional, the willfulness being characterized by a “wrongful and perverse attitude;” and the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In Gonzales’ case, his assailed conduct has not been shown to have been characterized by a perverse attitude, hence, the first requisite is wanting.&nbsp; His receipt of the telegram disapproving his application for emergency leave starting April 30, 1998 has not been shown.&nbsp; And it cannot be said that he disobeyed the May 5, 1998 telegram since he received it only on May 7, 1998.&nbsp; On the contrary, that he immediately hied back to Manila upon receipt thereof negates a perverse attitude.<br><br>As to Gonzales’ alleged concealment of his candidacy (for provincial board member) as a ground for Acesite’s loss of trust and confidence in him, the same is not impressed with merit.&nbsp; It should be noted that Acesite’s ground for terminating the services of Gonzales as stated in the Notice of Termination is his alleged acts of insubordination/disobedience.&nbsp; The concealment of candidacy angle harped upon by Acesite can only thus be considered as mere afterthought to further justify his illegal dismissal.<br><br>With regards to Gonzales’ perceived feigning of illness, the same is purely speculatory.<br><br>If there is anything that Gonzales can be faulted for, it is his being too presumptuous that his application for leave would be approved. For his unauthorized absences, this Court finds that Gonzales violated paragraph 26, Rule 11 of Type B offenses of the Company’s House Code of Discipline – unauthorized absence from work for three consecutive days<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> – which is punishable by a suspension of 3 days on the first offense – when he did not report for work from May 5-7, 1998.<br><br>As for Gonzales’ petition before this Court, he argues that the Court of Appeals, absent any reason, modified the decision of the NLRC by deleting or eliminating the “other fringe benefits or their monetary equivalent;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that the said court should not have given Acesite the option to reinstate him or not since the case at bar does not fall under circumstances for which reinstatement is no longer possible;&nbsp; that even assuming that his reinstatement is not in the interest of labor, the severance pay of ½ month pay ordered by the appellate court is not in accordance with law and jurisprudence;&nbsp; and that the reduction of the moral and exemplary damages awarded him by the NLRC was erroneous.<br><br>In illegal dismissal cases, reinstatement to an illegally dismissed employee’s former position may be excused on the ground of “strained relations.”&nbsp; This may be invoked against employees whose positions demand trust and confidence, or whose differences with their employer are of such nature or degree as to preclude reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In the case at bar, Gonzales was Chief of Security, whose duty was&nbsp; to “manage the operation of the security areas of the hotel to provide and ensure the safety and security of the hotel guests, visitors, management, staff and their properties according to company policies and local laws.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It cannot be gainsaid that Gonzales’ position is one of trust and confidence, he being in charge of the over-all security of said hotel.&nbsp; Thus, reinstatement is no longer possible.&nbsp; In lieu thereof, Acesite is liable to pay separation pay of 1 month for every year of service.<br><br>As to the award of moral and exemplary damages, this Court finds it unwarranted.&nbsp; Moral damages are recoverable only where the dismissal of the employees was attended by bad faith or fraud or constituted an act oppressive to labor or was done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy.&nbsp; Exemplary damages on the other hand may be awarded only if the dismissal was effected in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Though these grounds have been alleged by Gonzales, they were not sufficiently proven.<br><br>The appellate court affirmed the NLRC ruling that Angerbauer and Kennedy are solidarily liable with Acesite.

Angerbauer, acting on behalf of Acesite, was, like Gonzales, perhaps also too presumptuous in thinking that the telegrams ordering the latter to report for work were all received on time, drawing him to hastily conclude that Gonzales intentionally disobeyed the orders contained therein.<br><br>As to the deletion of the “fringe benefits or their monetary equivalent,” this Court agrees with Gonzales that it is not in accord with law and jurisprudence.
