				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Administrative Circular 12-2000, as clarified by Administrative Circular 13-2001, merely establishes a rule of preference in imposing penalties for violations of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (BP 22), the “Bouncing Checks Law.”&nbsp; When the circumstances of both the offense and the offender indicate good faith or a clear mistake of fact without taint of negligence, the imposition of a fine alone -- instead of imprisonment -- is the preferred penalty.&nbsp; As the Circular requires a review of the factual circumstances of a given case, it applies only to pending or future litigations.&nbsp; It is not a penal law; hence, it does not have retroactive effect.&nbsp; Neither may it be used to modify final judgments of conviction.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the October 10, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the October 11, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) (Branch 5), Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The October 10, 2001 Order released Respondent Fernando L.

Dimagiba issued to Petitioner Susan Go thirteen (13) checks which, when presented to the drawee bank for encashment or payment on the due dates, were dishonored for the reason “account closed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Dimagiba was subsequently prosecuted for 13 counts of violation of BP 22<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> under separate Complaints filed with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) in Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After a joint trial, the MTCC (Branch 4) rendered a Decision on July 16, 1999, convicting the accused in the 13 cases. The dispositive portion reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing disquisition, this Court finds the evidence of the prosecution to have established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt of the offenses charged and imposes upon the accused the penalty of 3 months imprisonment for each count (13 counts) and to indemnify the offended party the amount of One Million Two Hundred Ninety Five Thousand Pesos (P1,295,000.00) with legal interest per annum commencing from 1996 after the checks were dishonored by reason ‘ACCOUNT CLOSED’ on December 13, 1995, to pay attorney’s fees of P15,000.00 and to pay the costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>The appeal of Dimagiba was raffled to Branch 4 of the RTC in Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On May 23, 2000, the RTC denied the appeal and sustained his conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> There being no further appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), the RTC issued on February 1, 2001, a Certificate of Finality of the Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Thus, on February 14, 2001, the MTCC issued an Order directing the arrest of Dimagiba for the service of his sentence as a result of his conviction.&nbsp; The trial court also issued a Writ of Execution to enforce his civil liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On February 27, 2001, Dimagiba filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the MTCC Order.&nbsp; He prayed for the recall of the Order of Arrest and the modification of the final Decision, arguing that the penalty of fine only, instead of imprisonment also, should have been imposed on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The arguments raised in that Motion were reiterated in a Motion for the Partial Quashal of the Writ of Execution filed on February 28, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated August 22, 2001, the MTCC denied the Motion for Reconsideration and directed the issuance of a Warrant of Arrest against Dimagiba.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> On September 28, 2001, he was arrested and imprisoned for the service of his sentence.<br><br>On October 9, 2001, he filed with the RTC of Baguio City a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> for a writ of habeas corpus.&nbsp; The case was raffled to Branch 5, which scheduled the hearing for October 10, 2001.&nbsp; Copies of the Order were served on respondent’s counsels and the city warden.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</span><br></div><br>Right after hearing the case on October 10, 2001, the RTC issued an Order directing the immediate release of Dimagiba from confinement and requiring him to pay a fine of P100,000 in lieu of imprisonment.&nbsp; However, the civil aspect of the July 16, 1999 MTCC Decision was not touched upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A subsequent Order, explaining in greater detail the basis of the grant of the writ of habeas corpus, was issued on October 11, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In justifying its modification of the MTCC Decision, the RTC invoked<span style="font-style: italic;"> Vaca v.

[The RTC] Judge was utterly devoid of jurisdiction in amending a final and conclusive decision of the Municipal Trial Court, Branch 4, dated July 16, 1999, in nullifying the Sentence Mittimus, dated September 28, 2001, issued by x x x [the] Municipal Trial Court, Branch 4, Baguio City, and in ordering the release of [Dimagiba] from confinement in jail for the service of his sentence under the said final and conclusive judgment;<br><br>“2. Assuming only for the sake of argument that habeas corpus is the proper remedy, the Petition for Habeas Corpus is utterly devoid of merit as [Dimagiba was] not entitled to the beneficent policy enunciated in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Eduardo Vaca</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rosa Lim</span> cases and reiterated in the Supreme Court Circular No. 12-2000; x x x<br><br>“3. Granting for the sake of argument that [Dimagiba was] entitled to the beneficent policy enunciated in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Eduardo Vaca</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rosa Lim</span> cases and reiterated in the Supreme Court Circular No. 12-2000, the minimum fine that should be imposed on [Dimagiba] is one million and two hundred ninety five thousand pesos (P1,295,000.00) up to double the said amount or (P2,590,000), not just the measly amount of P100,000; and<br><br>“4. [The RTC] judge committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in hearing and deciding [Dimagiba’s] Petition for Habeas Corpus without notice and without affording procedural due process to the People of the Philippines through the Office of [the] City Prosecutor of Baguio City or the Office of the Solicitor General.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>In the main, the case revolves around the question of whether the Petition for habeas corpus was validly granted.&nbsp; Hence, the Court will discuss the four issues as they intertwine with this main question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]<br><br></sup><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition is meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Main Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Propriety of the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Writ of Habeas Corpus</span><br></div><br>The writ of habeas corpus applies to all cases of illegal confinement or detention in which individuals are deprived of liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It was devised as a speedy and effectual remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint; or, more specifically, to obtain immediate relief for those who may have been illegally confined or imprisoned without sufficient cause and thus deliver them from unlawful custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It is therefore a writ of inquiry intended to test the circumstances under which a person is detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The writ may not be availed of when the person in custody is under a judicial process or by virtue of a valid judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, as a post-conviction remedy, it may be allowed when, as a consequence of a judicial proceeding, any of the following exceptional circumstances is attendant:&nbsp; (1) there has been a deprivation of a constitutional right resulting in the restraint of a person; (2) the court had no jurisdiction to impose the sentence; or (3) <span style="font-style: italic;">the imposed penalty has been excessive</span>, thus voiding the sentence as to such excess.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Petition for a writ of habeas corpus was anchored on the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Vaca</span> and on SC-AC No. 12-2000, which allegedly prescribed the imposition of a fine, not imprisonment, for convictions under BP 22.&nbsp; Respondent sought the retroactive effect of those rulings, thereby effectively challenging the penalty imposed on him for being excessive.&nbsp; From his allegations, the Petition appeared sufficient in form to support the issuance of the writ.<br><br>However, it appears that respondent has previously sought the modification of his sentence in a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the MTCC’s Execution Order and in a Motion for the Partial Quashal of the Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Both were denied by the MTCC on the ground that it had no power or authority to amend a judgment issued by the RTC.<br><br>In his Petition for habeas corpus, respondent raised the same arguments that he had invoked in the said Motions.&nbsp; We believe that his resort to this extraordinary remedy was a procedural infirmity.&nbsp; The remedy should have been an appeal of the MTCC Order denying his Motions, in which he should have prayed that the execution of the judgment be stayed.&nbsp; But he effectively misused the action he had chosen, obviously with the intent of finding a favorable court.&nbsp; His Petition for a writ of habeas corpus was clearly an attempt to reopen a case that had already become final and executory.&nbsp; Such an action deplorably amounted to forum shopping.&nbsp; Respondent should have resorted to the proper, available remedy instead of instituting a different action in another forum.<br><br>The Court also finds his arguments for his release insubstantial to support the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;

The competence to amend the law belongs to the legislature, not to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Inapplicability of</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">SC-AC No. 12-2000</span><br><br>Petitioners argue that respondent is not entitled to the benevolent policy enunciated in SC-AC No. 12-2000, because he is not a “first time offender.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This circumstance is, however, not the sole factor in determining whether he deserves the preferred penalty of fine alone.&nbsp; The penalty to be imposed depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It is the trial court’s discretion to impose any penalty within the confines of the law.&nbsp; SC-AC No. 13-2001 explains thus:<br><blockquote>“x x x.&nbsp; Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 establishes a rule of preference in the application of the penal provisions of BP 22 such that where the circumstances of both the offense and the offender clearly indicate good faith or a clear mistake of fact without taint of negligence, the imposition of a fine alone should be considered as the more appropriate penalty.&nbsp; Needless to say, the determination of whether the circumstances warrant the imposition of a fine alone rests solely upon the Judge.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>It is, therefore, understood that:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Judges concerned, may in the exercise of sound discretion, and taking into consideration the peculiar circumstances of each case, determine whether the imposition of a fine alone would best serve the interests of justice, or whether forbearing to impose imprisonment would depreciate the seriousness of the offense, work violence on the social order, or otherwise be contrary to the imperatives of justice;”<br></blockquote>The Court notes that the Petition for a writ of habeas corpus relied mainly on the alleged retroactivity of SC-AC No. 12-2000, which supposedly favored BP 22 offenders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> On this point, Dimagiba contended that his imprisonment was violative of his right to equal protection of the laws, since only a fine would be imposed on others similarly situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The rule on retroactivity states that criminal laws may be applied retroactively if favorable to the accused.&nbsp; This principle, embodied in the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> has been expanded in certain instances to cover special laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The issue of retroactivity of SC-AC No. 12-2000 was settled in <span style="font-style: italic;">De Joya v. Jail Warden of Batangas City</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which we quote:<br><blockquote>“Petitioner's reliance of our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ordoñez v. Vinarao</span> that a convicted person is entitled to benefit from the reduction of penalty introduced by the new law, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Simon</span>, is misplaced.&nbsp; Thus, her plea that as provided for in Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code, SC Admin. Circular No. 12-2000 as modified by SC Admin. Circular No. 13-2001 should benefit her has no basis.<br><br>“First. SC Admin. Circular No. 12-2000 is not a penal law; hence, Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code is not applicable. The circular applies only to those cases pending as of the date of its effectivity and not to cases already terminated by final judgment.<br><br>“Second. As explained by the Court in SC Admin. Circular No. 13-2001, SC Admin. Circular No. 12-2000 merely lays down a rule of preference in the application of the penalties for violation of B.P. Blg. 22. It does not amend B.P. Blg. 22, nor defeat the legislative intent behind the law. SC Admin. Circular No. 12-2000 merely urges the courts to take into account not only the purpose of the law but also the circumstances of the accused -- whether he acted in good faith or on a clear mistake of fact without taint of negligence -- and such other circumstance which the trial court or the appellate court believes relevant to the penalty to be imposed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Because the Circular merely lays down a rule of preference, it serves only as a guideline for the trial courts.&nbsp; Thus, it is addressed to the judges, who are directed to consider the factual circumstances of each case prior to imposing the appropriate penalty.&nbsp; In other words, the Administrative Circular does not confer any new right in favor of the accused, much less those convicted by final judgment. <br><br>The competence to determine the proper penalty belongs to the court rendering the decision against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> That decision is subject only to appeal on grounds of errors of fact or law, or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Another trial court may not encroach upon this authority.&nbsp; Indeed, SC-AC No. 12-2000 necessarily requires a review of all factual circumstances of each case.&nbsp; Such a review can no longer be done if the judgment has become final and executory.<br><br>In the present case, the MTCC of Baguio City had full knowledge of all relevant circumstances from which respondent’s conviction and sentence were based.&nbsp; The penalty imposed was well within the confines of the law.&nbsp; Upon appeal, the conviction was sustained by RTC-Branch 4 of Baguio City.&nbsp; Eventually, the Decision attained finality.&nbsp; Hence, RTC-Branch 5 did not have the jurisdiction to modify the lawful judgment in the guise of granting a writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>The doctrine of equal protection of laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> does not apply for the same reasons as those on retroactivity.&nbsp; Foremost of these reasons is that the Circular is not a law that deletes the penalty of imprisonment.&nbsp; As explained earlier, it is merely a rule of preference as to which penalty should be imposed under the peculiar circumstances of a case.&nbsp; At any rate, this matter deserves scant consideration, because respondent failed to raise any substantial argument to support his contention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Modification of Final</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Judgment Not Warranted</span><br><br>The Court is not unmindful of <span style="font-style: italic;">So v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> in which the final judgment of conviction for violation of BP 22 was modified by the deletion of the sentence of imprisonment and the imposition of a fine.&nbsp; That case proceeded from an “Urgent Manifestation of an Extraordinary Supervening Event,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> not from an unmeritorious petition for a writ of habeas corpus, as in the present case.&nbsp; The Court exercised in that case its authority to suspend or to modify the execution of a final judgment when warranted or made imperative by the higher interest of justice or by supervening events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The supervening event in that case was the petitioner’s urgent need for coronary rehabilitation for at least one year under the direct supervision of a coronary care therapist; imprisonment would have been equivalent to a death sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The peculiar circumstances of So do not obtain in the present case.&nbsp; Respondent’s supposed “unhealthy physical condition due to a triple by-pass operation, and aggravated by hypertension,” cited by the RTC in its October 10, 2001 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> is totally bereft of substantial proof.&nbsp; The Court notes that respondent did not make any such allegation in his Petition for habeas corpus.&nbsp; Neither did he mention his physical state in his Memorandum and Comment submitted to this Court.<br><br>Respondent seeks the retroactive application of SC-AC No. 12-2000 in his favor on the basis alone of the alleged settlement of his civil liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Griffith v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> he theorizes that answering for a criminal offense is no longer justified after the settlement of the debt. <br><br>Respondent, however, misreads <span style="font-style: italic;">Griffith</span>.&nbsp; The Court held in that case that convicting the accused who, two years prior to the filing of the BP 22 cases, had already paid his debt (from which the checks originated) was contrary to the basic principles of fairness and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Obviously, that situation is not attendant here. <br><br>The civil liability in the present case was satisfied through the levy and sale of the properties of respondent only after the criminal case had been terminated with his conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Apparently, he had sufficient properties that could have been used to settle his liabilities prior to his conviction.&nbsp; Indeed, such an early settlement would have been an indication that he was in good faith, a circumstance that could have been favorably considered in determining his appropriate penalty.<br><br>At any rate, civil liability differs from criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> What is punished in the latter is not the failure to pay the obligation, but the issuance of checks that subsequently bounced or were dishonored for insufficiency or lack of funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The Court reiterates the reasons why the issuance of worthless checks is criminalized:<br><blockquote>“The practice is prohibited by law because of its deleterious effects on public interest. The effects of the increase of worthless checks transcend the private interest of the parties directly involved in the transaction and touches the interest of the community at large. The mischief it creates is not only a wrong to the payee or holder, but also an injury to the public. The harmful practice of putting valueless commercial papers in circulation multiplied a thousand-fold can very well pollute the channels of trade and commerce, injure the banking system and eventually hurt the welfare of society and the public interest.
