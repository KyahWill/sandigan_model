CV No. 52769 which declared that the Heirs of Jose P. Mariano and Erlinda Mariano-Villanueva have the right to redeem Lot 15-C from petitioner Ruben S.

Mariano filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration/Clarification alleging that since Lot 15-C covered by TCT No. 17745 was one of those sold by Irene Mariano to Raul in the Deed of Sale dated April 15, 1975 which has been found to be simulated and declared null and void, TCT No. 17745 should likewise be cancelled and the property reverted back to them.<br><br>On May 19, 2000, the CA rendered the assailed Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Motion for Reconsideration filed separately by defendant-appellee Raul Santos and Intervenor-appellant the law firm of San Buenaventura, Moraleda Obias and Yambao as well as the Motion for Reconsideration/Clarification filed by plaintiffs-appellants Heirs of Jose P. Mariano and Erlinda Mariano Villanueva are hereby DENIED, while the Supplemental Motion to Restore Possession and Administration to Plaintiffs-Appellants is GRANTED.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Heirs of Jose P. Mariano and Erlinda Mariano Villanueva are restored in the possession and administration of Lots 15-A, 15-B, 545 and 2348, together with the improvements thereon.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, plaintiffs-appellants are declared to have the right to redeem Lot 15-C from Ruben Sia.</span><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Petitioner Sia then filed the present petition for review anchored on a sole error, to wit:<br><blockquote>THE MATTER OF REDEMPTION NOT HAVING BEEN RAISED AS AN ISSUE, NOR MADE THE SUBJECT OF AN ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR, NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO ONE, NOR OTHERWISE TREATED IN THE PARTIES’ BRIEFS, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HAVING DECLARED IN ITS RESOLUTION OF MAY 19, 2000 THAT PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO REDEEM LOT 15-C FROM HEREIN PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner claims that the CA violated the provisions of Section 8, Rule 51 of the Revised Rules of Court in declaring that respondents have the right to redeem Lot 15-C since the redemption of Lot 15-C was never raised before the trial court and even on appeal but only for the first time in respondents’ “Motion for Partial Reconsideration/Clarification” when respondents stated that Ruben Sia “has refused to grant the right of redemption to the Heirs of Irene P. Mariano on the ground that it should be Raul Santos, the titled owner at the time of the auction, who has the right to redeem.” Besides, petitioner argues that Lot 15-C was not subject of the appeal as the CA itself found that only four parcels of land were involved in the appeal, namely: Lot 15-A, Lot 15-B, Lot 545 and Lot 2348.&nbsp; Lastly, petitioner submits that the CA cannot make any declaration that may adversely affect his property rights since he was not impleaded as a party in the case and may not therefore be bound or be adversely affected by any judgment that may be rendered in the case.<br><br>Respondents contend that the CA correctly declared that they have the right to redeem Lot 15-C from petitioner because this Court has so held in G.R. Nos. 94617<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and 95281,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> promulgated on April 12, 2000, thereby rendering the issue in the present petition moot and academic.&nbsp; Moreover, they submit that the matter of redemption, or any issue relative thereto, was raised in the appellee’s brief filed by Raul and replied to by them in their reply brief.&nbsp; As to petitioner’s claim that he was never impleaded as party in the case, they submit that petitioner has been properly apprised of the pendency of Civil Case No. 88-1506 with the annotation of a notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> in TCT No. 17745 of Raul prior to the issuance of TCT No. 20201 in petitioner’s name.<br><br>Three undisputed facts are prominent in the present petition which have great bearing in the disposition thereof:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; petitioner is neither a party before the trial court nor in the CA;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Lot 15-C is not a subject matter of the case;&nbsp; and (3)&nbsp; our decision in G.R. Nos. 94617 and 95281,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> wherein herein respondent Erlinda Villanueva and petitioner Sia are parties, had expressly declared that respondents have the right to redeem the lot covered by TCT No. 17745 which refers to Lot 15-C.<br><br>There is no question that Lot 15-C is not one of the parcels of land involved in the appeal before the CA.&nbsp; In its decision, it specifically mentioned only Lot 15-A, Lot 15-B, Lot 545 and Lot 2348 as the lots subject of the case.&nbsp; Thus, this fact and the fact that petitioner is not a party to the case, militate against the propriety of declaring in the assailed Resolution that respondents have the right to redeem Lot 15-C.<br><br>Finally, there is no longer any actual case or controversy between the parties insofar as the issue of redemption of Lot 15-C is concerned.&nbsp; This is settled by the decision of this Court in G.R. Nos. 94617 and 95281, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 19533 is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE, and a new one entered ORDERING the Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Sur to accept payment of redemption money for the property levied in Civil Case No. R-570 from petitioner Erlinda Mariano, computed as of November 22, 1989, and upon receipt thereof, to execute and deliver to Erlinda Mariano a duly accomplished certificate of redemption of said property.&nbsp; The Definite Deed of Sale issued in favor of private respondent Ruben Sia and the alias writ of execution issued pursuant to the Order of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 22 of Camarines Sur dated August 28, 1990 are NULLIFIED.&nbsp; Costs against private respondent.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It is noted that the said decision was promulgated on April 12, 2000 or a little over a month before herein assailed Resolution was promulgated by the CA on May 19, 2000.&nbsp; It becomes final on October 16, 2000.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is GRANTED.&nbsp; The portion, to wit:&nbsp; “Finally, plaintiffs-appellants are declared to have the right to redeem Lot 15-C from Ruben Sia” of the Court of Appeals’ Resolution dated May 19, 2000 in CA-G.R.
