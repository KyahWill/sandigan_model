				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Judge Alberto L. Lerma, Presiding Judge of Branch 256 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Muntinlupa, stands charged in a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated September 21, 2001 filed by the Bagong West Kabulusan Neighborhood Association, Inc. (the Association) for falsification of court records, gross violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, gross neglect of duty, and gross ignorance of the law with manifest bias and partiality.<br><br>The facts which spawned the filing of the complaint are as follows:<br><br>CST Enterprises, Inc. filed before the Muntinlupa Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) thirty eight (38) complaints for ejectment against 39 individuals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (the defendants) who were occupying lots located at West Kabulusan, Barangay Cupang, Muntinlupa City and covered by TCT Nos. 124275 and 157581 (the lots). The cases, which were raffled to Branch 80 of the MeTC, were docketed as <b>Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</b>.<br><br>Branch 80 of the Muntinlupa MeTC, by decision of March 17, 2000, rendered judgment in favor of CST Enterprises, Inc., ordering the defendants to    vacate the lots and surrender possession thereof to CST Enterprises, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <u>The judgment became final and executory following which writs of execution were issued and served on the defendants on June 14, 2000</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>It appears that the defendants refused to vacate the lots. Thus, by Order of November 8, 2000, the MeTC directed the defendants to demolish their “respective structures” within 5 days from notice thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> A writ of demolition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated November 9, 2000 was accordingly issued directing the sheriff to remove and demolish the houses and improvements introduced by the defendants on the lots.<br><br>On December 11, 2000, the Association, claiming to represent the underprivileged and homeless residents of the lots, <u>but without naming the defendants in Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u>, filed a Complaint <u>against MeTC Sheriff Armando M. Camacho</u>, for “<u>Injunction</u> with Very Urgent Petition for the Issuance of Restraining Order to Preserve and Maintain the Status Quo,” docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 00-233.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Complaint for injunction alleged that under R.A. No. 7279 (URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING ACT OF 1992), it is mandatory that before demolition or eviction can be effected, adequate relocation, whether temporary or permanent, be undertaken by the City of Muntinlupa and the National Housing Authority with the assistance of other concerned government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It thus prayed that service of the notice to vacate and demolish be held in abeyance until the provisions of R.A. 7279 have been complied with and that, in the meantime, a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) be issued to preserve and maintain the status quo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On motion of the Association, a special raffle of Civil Case No. 00-233 was set on December 15, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, in a petition filed by the defendants before the Court of Appeals, docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 61991</b>, <u>assailing among other things, the MeTC judgment in the ejectment cases</u> which was sought to be annulled, the appellate court, by Resolution of December 12, 2000, issued a TRO enjoining the enforcement of the writ of demolition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Association’s complaint for injunction in <b>Civil Case No. 00-233</b> was raffled to Branch 256 of the Muntinlupa RTC presided by respondent, Judge Alberto Lerma. Summons dated January 2, 2001 was thereafter issued to Sheriff Camacho requiring him to enter his appearance and answer the    Association’s petition within 15 days from service thereof, which summons was served on him on January 15, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Notice dated January 8, 2001 setting for hearing on January 17, 2001 the Association’s prayer for a TRO was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The notice addressed to Sheriff Camacho was, however, served on him the day after the hearing or on January 18, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As he was not present during the hearing, respondent, on motion of the Association, considered the matter of the issuance of TRO submitted for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>By Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of February 5, 2001, respondent denied the Association’s prayer for a TRO, he finding that no great or irreparable injury would result if a TRO is not issued immediately.

SP No. 61991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On motion of the Association, the hearing of “the main case for injunction” in Civil Case No. 00-233 was set for hearing on April 19, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> during which the defendant sheriff again failed to show up. The hearing was thus reset<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to June 22, 2001 during which respondent, on motion of the Association, declared its “Motion to Declare Defendant in Default” submitted for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On September 14, 2001, the Association filed a “Very Urgent Motion to Resolve Complaint for Injunction,” setting the motion for hearing on September 17, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Association was later to allege in its present complaint that the staff of respondent refused to set the said motion for hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Alleging that respondent, “with manifest bias and partiality and with gross ignorance of R.A. 7279 and gross neglect of duty, deliberately delayed the resolution of [Civil Case No. 00-233] in order for . . . [Sheriff] Camacho [to] EFFECT THE DEMOLITION before the resolution of [said] case so that [it] will be rendered moot and academic,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Association, through its Acting President, Wenefredo S. Quedor, filed on September 24, 2001 the present complaint against respondent before the Office of the Court Administrator.<br><br>In the affidavit of the Acting President of the Association (hereinafter referred to as complainant), it is averred that respondent violated Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 20-95 requiring him to act on the application for a TRO after all parties are heard in a summary hearing conducted within 24 hours after the records are transmitted to the branch selected by raffle, he having set for hearing the prayer for TRO only on January 17, 2001 or 33 days <u>after the complaint was raffled to his sala</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>It is further averred in the said affidavit that respondent maliciously and unlawfully falsified court records by making it appear that he already resolved the pending incident re the application for the issuance of a TRO by issuing the Order of February 5, 2001 when in fact the Motion to Resolve the application was not yet resolved when it was heard on February 28, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Respondent, in his Comments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated November 29, 2001, claimed that several actions were instituted by complainant and/or the defendants to stop at all cost the enforcement and implementation of the decision rendered by the MeTC in Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that on August 23, 2000, before the filing of Civil Case No. 00-233, he dismissed a petition of the defendants against the MeTC Branch 80 judge, <u>for “Certiorari and Prohibition or Annulment of Judgment in Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u> with prayer for Writ of Preliminary Injunction,” docketed as <b>SP Civil Case No. 00-085</b>, and denied their motion for reconsideration of the dismissal;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that the defendants elevated the case on December 4, 2000 to the Court of Appeals via petition for annulment of judgment with injunction and very urgent motion for the issuance of a restraining order (CA-G.R. SP No. 61991)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> challenging (1) the MeTC <b>Decision</b> dated March 17, 2000 in <u>Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u>; (2) the RTC <b>Order</b> dated August 23, 2000 dismissing on motion of CST Enterprises, Inc. the petition for certiorari in <u>S.P. Civil Case No. 00-085</u>; (3) the RTC <b>Order</b> dated October 18, 2000 in S.P. <u>Civil Case No. 00-085</u> denying the motion for reconsideration filed by the defendants; (4) the MeTC <b>Order</b> dated November 8, 2000 in <u>Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u> granting the motion for the issuance of a writ of demolition; (5) the MeTC <b>Writ of Demolition</b> dated November 9, 2000 in <u>Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u>; and (6) the <b>Notice to Vacate and Demolish</b> dated November 20, 2000 issued by MeTC Sheriff Camacho in <u>Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u>.<br><br>Respondent further claimed that <u>a week after the defendants filed their petition before the appellate court or on December 11, 2000, complainant again filed the Complaint for “Injunction</u> with Very Urgent Petition for the Issuance of Restraining Order to Preserve and Maintain the Status Quo” (Civil Case No. 00-233); that on December 12, 2000, the Court of Appeals issued in CA-G.R. SP No. 61991 a Resolution enjoining the enforcement of the writ of demolition for a period of 60 days from the date of its issuance, or until February 10, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> on account of which the Notice to Vacate and Demolish dated November 20, 2000, all addressed to the defendants, was temporarily suspended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Respondent furthermore alleged that on August 27, 2001, <u>five months after the Court of Appeals dismissed CA-G.R. SP No. 61991, complainant filed a motion to suspend proceedings in Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715</u> before Branch 80 of the MeTC for the same purpose, that is, to hold in abeyance the enforcement of the notice to vacate and demolish dated November 20, 2000;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that again, <u>on September 24, 2001, the same day complainant filed the present administrative case against him and while the motion to suspend proceedings in Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715 remained pending, the defendants filed before the RTC a complaint, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 01-268</b>, for illegal eviction/demolition, loss of property and damages, injunction and temporary restraining order, relocation/restitution/benefits with prayer for lis pendens</u>, which was raffled and assigned to Branch 276, presided by Judge N.C. Parello, again praying, among other things, to restrain Sheriff Camacho from enforcing the notice to vacate and demolish;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and that the motion to suspend proceedings in Civil Case Nos. 4678-4715 was denied on November 9, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the main, <u>respondent stressed that all these cases filed after a writ of demolition was issued by the MeTC were filed for the purpose of restraining the sheriff from enforcing the notices to vacate and demolish, in violation of the rule against forum-shopping</u> under Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, they involving the same parties, causes of action, and reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Respondent went on to stress that all his actions and findings in Civil Case No. 00-233 were in accordance with the Rules and the Canons on Judicial Ethics, with cold judicial impartiality, and with no other objective but to uphold the rule and majesty of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In its memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of August 18, 2003, the OCA opines that respondent should not have deferred the resolution of the pending incidents lest he be accused of delay. And it finds that respondent offered no explanation why the order denying complainant’s application for a TRO is dated February 5, 2001 when the hearing thereon occurred on February 28, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>To recall, the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 61991, issued a Resolution on December 12, 2000 <u>a day after Civil Case No. 00-233 (which also prayed for a TRO) was filed</u> on December 11, 2000, enjoining the enforcement of the writ of demolition against the defendants for a period of 60 days or until February 10, 2001. As respondent was one of the respondents in said CA-G.R. SP No. 61991, his Order dismissing SP Civil Case No. 00-085 being among those challenged in said case, it is assumed that he was served a copy of said Resolution.<br><br>Consequently, when Civil Case No. 00-233 was raffled to respondent’s sala on December 15, 2000, complainant’s prayer for a TRO had been rendered moot, such relief having been already afforded the defendants by the appellate court in its Resolution of December 12, 2000. To further act on the therein petitioners’ prayer for a TRO would thus serve no useful purpose, that is, if respondent was actually notified of the TRO issued by the appellate court.<br><br>Assuming arguendo that, as respondent alleged, complainant was guilty of forum shopping, respondent should have dismissed Civil Case No. 00-233 in accordance with Rule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>It would appear though that, to avert the possibility of complainant’s Complaint in Civil Case No. 00-233 being dismissed on the ground of forum shopping, it made it appear that the parties therein and in CA-G.R. SP No. 61991 are not one and the same.<br><br>A perusal of the allegations embodied in the complaint in Civil Case No. 00-233 shows, however, that the Association-herein complainant actually represented the defendants- petitioners in CA-G.R. SP No. 61991:<br><blockquote>Under date of November 17, 1999, CST Enterprises Inc. filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court of Muntinlupa City presided by Hon. Noli C. Diaz <u>39 (sic) ejectment cases against <b>herein plaintiffs</b></u> and docketed as Civil Case Nos. 4678 to 4715 xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>If indeed the Association-herein complainant represented the underprivileged and homeless citizens of West Kabulusan, Brgy. Cupang in Civil Case No. 00-233, it failed to comply with the requirements set forth under Rule 3, Section 3 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that when an action is prosecuted by a representative, the beneficiaries shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed as the real parties in interest. On that score alone, the complaint could have been dismissed – for lack of cause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> under Sec. 1(d) of Rule 16.<br><br>More. In the complaint in Civil Case No. 00-233, complainant did not implead the Presiding Judge of Branch 80 of the MeTC who issued the writ of demolition dated November 9, 2000 and CST Enterprises Inc. which stood to be adversely affected in case a TRO was issued by respondent. On the other hand, the duty of Sheriff Camacho, who was the sole defendant in the said case, to execute the writ of demolition was purely ministerial. In the absence of a directive to the contrary, he was expected to proceed with reasonable promptness to implement the writ according to its mandate.<br><br>Complainant faults respondent for violating Supreme Court Administrative Circular 20-95 for failure to call for a hearing on its application for a TRO <u>within 24 hours after the case had been raffled to his sala on December 15, 2001</u>, he having set the same for hearing only on January 17, 2000. Upon the assumption that the appellate court’s Resolution granting a TRO had not yet come to the notice of respondent at the time Civil Case No. 00-233 was raffled to him, what is <u>mandatory in the circular is the giving of notice and opportunity for the adverse party to be heard and interpose objections in a summary hearing, before a prayer for a TRO is acted upon</u>. The period within which to conduct a summary hearing is not 24 hours after the case has been raffled but <u>24 hours after the records are transmitted to the branch to which it is raffled</u>.<br><br>Pertinent paragraphs of Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 20-95 are quoted hereunder:<br>    <ol type="1"><li> Where an application for temporary restraining order (TRO) or writ of preliminary injunction is included in a complaint or any initiatory pleading filed with the trial court, such complaint or initiatory pleading shall be <u>raffled only after notice to the adverse party and in the presence of such party or counsel</u>.<br></li><br><li> The application for a TRO shall be <b>acted upon</b> only <u>after all parties are heard in a summary hearing conducted within twenty-four (24) hours after the records are transmitted to the branch selected by raffle</u>. The records shall be transmitted immediately after raffle.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">    xxx (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></li></ol>This circular is now incorporated in the present Rules of Court as Rule 58, Section 4 as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Verified application and bond for preliminary injunction or restraining order</i>. - A preliminary injunction or <u>temporary restraining order may be granted only when</u>:<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>(c) When an application for a writ of preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order is included in a complaint or any initiatory pleading, the case, if filed in a multi-sala court, shall be raffled only <u>after notice to and in the presence of the adverse party</u> or the person sought to be enjoined.
