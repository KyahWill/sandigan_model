				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By virtue of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> En Banc</span> Resolution issued on January 13, 2004, the Court authorized the Special First Division to suspend the Rules so as to allow it to consider and resolve the second Motion for Reconsideration of respondents,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> after the motion was heard on oral arguments on August 13, 2003.&nbsp; On July 9, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the Court resolved to submit for resolution the second Motion for Reconsideration in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 112526</span> together with <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 118338</span> in view of the Resolution of the Court dated January 15, 2001 issued in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 118838</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> consolidating the latter case with <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 112526</span>, the issues therein being interrelated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Hence, the herein Amended Decision.<br><br>The factual background of the two cases is as follows:<br><br>The Canlubang Estate in Laguna is a vast landholding previously titled in the name of the late Speaker and Chief Justice Jose Yulo, Sr.&nbsp; Within this estate are two parcels of land (hereinafter referred to as the “subject&nbsp; property”)&nbsp; covered&nbsp;&nbsp; by TCT Nos. 81949 and 84891 measuring 254.766 hectares and part of Barangay Casile, subsequently titled in the name of Sta. Rosa Realty Development Corporation (SRRDC), the majority stockholder of which is C.J. Yulo and Sons, Inc.<br><br>The subject property was involved in civil suits and administrative proceedings that led to the filing of <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 112526</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">118838,</span> thus:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Injunction Case Filed by Amante, et al.</span><br><br>On December 6, 1985, Amante, et al., who are the private respondents in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 112526</span> and petitioners in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 118838</span>, instituted an action for injunction with damages in the Regional Trial Court of Laguna (Branch 24) against Luis Yulo, SRRDC, and several SRRDC security personnel, docketed as <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil Case No. B-2333</span>.&nbsp; Amante, et al. alleged that: they are residents of Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna, which covers an area of around 300 hectares; in 1910, their ancestors started occupying the area, built their houses and planted fruit-bearing trees thereon, and since then, have been peacefully occupying the land; some time in June 3, 1985, SRRDC’s security people illegally entered Bgy. Casile and fenced the area; SRRDC’s men also entered the barangay on November 4, 1985, cut down the trees, burned their huts, and barred the lone jeepney from entering the Canlubang Sugar Estate; as a result of these acts, Amante, et al. were deprived of possession and cultivation of their lands.&nbsp; Thus, they claimed damages, sought the issuance of permanent injunction and proposed that a right of way be declared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In their Answer, the defendants denied the allegations and disclaimed any control and supervision over its security personnel.&nbsp; Defendant SRRDC also alleged that as the real owner of the property, it was the one that suffered damages due to the encroachment on the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>A writ of preliminary injunction was issued by the trial court on August 17, 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> but&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;this was subsequently dissolved by the Court of Appeals (CA) on April 22, 1988 in its decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 13908.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, the trial court, on January 20, 1992, rendered a decision ordering Amante, et al. to vacate the property, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs hereby dismissing the complaint and amended complaint.<br><br>The plaintiffs are hereby ordered to vacate the parcels of land belonging to the defendants Luis Yulo and Sta. Rosa Realty.&nbsp; They are likewise enjoined from entering the subject parcels of land.<br><br>Although attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation are recoverable in case of a clearly unfounded civil action against the plaintiff (Enervida vs. De la Torre, 55 SCRA 339), this Court resolves not to award attorney’s fees etc. in favor of the defendants because the plaintiffs appear to have acted in good faith in filing the present civil action (Salao vs. Salao, 70 SCRA 65) and that it would not be just and equitable to award the same in the case at bar. (Liwanag vs. Court of Appeals, 121 SCRA 354)&nbsp; Accordingly, the other reliefs prayed for by the defendants are hereby dismissed.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Amante, et al. appealed the aforesaid decision to the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 38182.<br><br>On June 28, 1994, the CA affirmed with modification the decision of the trial court in the injunction case.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;appellate court’s decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the judgment herein appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, with the modification that the defendants-appellees are hereby ordered, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs-appellants nominal damages in the amount of P5,000.00 per plaintiff.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Nominal damages were awarded by the CA because it found that SRRDC violated Amante, et al.’s rights as possessors of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Amante, et al. filed a motion for reconsideration thereof, pointing out the DARAB’s decision placing the property under compulsory acquisition, and the CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 27234, affirming the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; The CA, however, denied the motion, with the modification that only SRRDC and the defendants-security guards should be held jointly and severally liable for the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;nominal damages awarded.&nbsp; It also made the clarification that the decision should not preempt any judgment or prejudice the right of any party in the agrarian reform case pending before the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 112526).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Thus, Amante, et al. filed on March 2, 1995, herein petition, docketed as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 118838</span> on the following grounds:<br><blockquote>4.1. THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED THE CASE CONTRARY TO LAW OR APPLICABLE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS BECAUSE:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">4.1.1 FIRST, PETITIONERS MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EVICTED FROM THEIR LANDHOLDINGS CONSIDERING THAT:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">-- (A) PETITIONERS ARE ALREADY THE REGISTERED OWNERS UNDER THE TORRENS SYSTEM OF THE PROPERTIES IN QUESTION SINCE FEBRUARY 26, 1992 BY VIRTUE OF RA 6657 OR THE COMPREHENSIVE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW;<br><br>-- (B) THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS AFFIRMED THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF LAGUNA’S DISMISSAL OF THE EJECTMENT CASES FILED BY RESPONDENT SRRDC AGAINST PETITIONERS; AND<br><br>-- (C) ASSUMING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT ONLY THAT PETITIONERS ARE NOT YET THE REGISTERED OWNERS OF THE PROPERTIES IN QUESTION, RESPONDENTS MAY NOT RAISE THE ISSUE OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OWNERSHIP IN THIS CASE FOR INJUNCTION WITH DAMAGES, THE SAME TO BE VENTILATED IN A SEPARATE ACTION, NOT IN THIS CASE BROUGHT TO PREVENT RESPONDENTS FROM COMMITTING FURTHER ACTS OF DISPOSSESSION [BACAR V. DEL ROSARIO ET AL., 171 SCRA 451 (1989)].<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">4.1.2 SECOND, PETITIONERS ARE ENTITLED TO MORAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY’S FEES, INSTEAD OF MERE NOMINAL DAMAGES, CONSIDERING THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND RESPONDENTS TO HAVE UNLAWFULLY AND ILLEGALLY DISTURBED PETITIONERS’ PEACEFUL AND CONTINUOUS POSSESSION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></div></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ejectment Cases Filed by SRRDC</span><br><br>Between October 1986 and August 1987, after the injunction case was filed by Amante, et al., SRRDC filed with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Cabuyao, Laguna, several complaints for forcible entry with preliminary injunction and damages against Amante, et al., docketed as <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil Cases Nos. 250, 258, 260, 262 and 266.</span>&nbsp; SRRDC alleged that some time in July 1987, they learned that Amante, et al., without their authority and through stealth and strategy, were clearing, cultivating and planting on the subject property; and that despite requests from SRRDC’s counsel, Amante, et al. refused to vacate the property, prompting them to file the ejectment cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Amante, et al. denied that SRRDC are the absolute owners of the property, stating that they have been in peaceful possession thereof, through their predecessors-in-interest, since 1910.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On May 24, 1991, the MTC-Cabuyao rendered its decision in favor of SRRDC.&nbsp; Amante, et al. were ordered to surrender possession and vacate the subject property.&nbsp; The decision was appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna (Assisting Court).<br><br>On February 18, 1992, the RTC dismissed the ejectment cases on the ground that the subject property is an agricultural land being tilled by Amante, et al., hence it is the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), which has jurisdiction over the dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The RTC’s dismissal of the complaints was brought to the CA via a petition for review, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 33382.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In turn, the CA dismissed the petition per its Decision dated January 17, 1995 on the ground that SRRDC failed to show any prior physical possession of the subject property that would have justified the filing of the ejectment cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Also, the CA did not sustain the RTC’s finding that the subject properties are agricultural lands and Amante, et al. are tenant/farmers thereof, as the evidence on record does not support such finding.&nbsp; The parties did not file any motion for reconsideration from the Court of Appeals’ dismissal, hence, it became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Administrative Proceedings</span><br><br>While the injunction and ejectment cases were still in process, it appears that in August, 1989, the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO) issued a Notice of Coverage to SRRDC, informing petitioners that the property covered by TCT Nos. T-81949, T-84891 and T-92014 is scheduled for compulsory acquisition under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> SRRDC filed its “Protest and Objection” with the MARO on the grounds that the area was not appropriate for agricultural purposes, as it was rugged in terrain with slopes of 18% and above, and that the occupants of the land were squatters, who were not entitled to any land as beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thereafter, as narrated in the Decision of the Court dated October 12, 2001 in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 112526</span>, the following proceedings ensued:<br><blockquote>On August 29, 1989, the farmer beneficiaries together with the BARC chairman answered the protest and objection stating that the slope of the land is not 18% but only 5-10% and that the land is suitable and economically viable for agricultural purposes, as evidenced by the Certification of the Department of Agriculture, municipality of Cabuyao, Laguna.<br><br>On September 8, 1989, MARO Belen dela Torre made a summary investigation report and forwarded the Compulsory Acquisition Folder Indorsement (CAFI) to the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer (hereafter, PARO).<br><br>On September 21, 1989, PARO Durante Ubeda forwarded his endorsement of the compulsory acquisition to the Secretary of Agrarian Reform.<br><br>On November 23, 1989, Acting Director Eduardo C. Visperas of the Bureau of Land Acquisition and Development, DAR forwarded two (2) Compulsory Acquisition Claim Folders covering the landholding of SRRDC, covered by TCT Nos. T-81949 and T-84891 to the President, Land Bank of the Philippines for further review and evaluation.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">On December 12, 1989, Secretary of Agrarian Reform Miriam Defensor Santiago sent two (2) notices of acquisition to petitioner, stating that petitioner’s landholdings covered by TCT Nos. T-81949 and T-84891, containing an area of 188.2858 and 58.5800 hectares, valued at P4,417,735.65 and P1,220,229.93, respectively, had been placed under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.</span><br><br>On February 6, 1990, petitioner SRRDC in two letters separately addressed to Secretary Florencio B. Abad and the Director, Bureau of Land Acquisition and Distribution, sent its formal protest, protesting not only the amount of compensation offered by DAR for the property but also the two (2) notices of acquisition.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">On March 17, 1990, Secretary Abad referred the case to the DARAB for summary proceedings to determine just compensation under R.A. No. 6657, Section 16.</span><br><br>On March 23, 1990, the LBP returned the two (2) claim folders previously referred for review and evaluation to the Director of BLAD mentioning its inability to value the SRRDC landholding due to some deficiencies.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">On March 28, 1990, Executive Director Emmanuel S. Galvez wrote the Land Bank President Deogracias Vistan to forward the two (2) claim folders involving the property of SRRDC to the DARAB for it to conduct summary proceedings to determine the just compensation for the land.</span><br><br>On April 6, 1990, petitioner sent a letter to the Land Bank of the Philippines stating that its property under the aforesaid land titles were exempt from CARP coverage because they had been classified as watershed area and were the subject of a pending petition for land conversion.<br><br>On May 10, 1990, Director Narciso Villapando of BLAD turned over the two (2) claim folders (CACF’s) to the Executive Director of the DAR Adjudication Board for proper administrative valuation.&nbsp; Acting on the CACF’s, on September 10, 1990, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Board promulgated a resolution asking the office of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to first resolve two (2) issues before it proceeds with the summary land valuation proceedings.</span><br><br>The issues that need to be threshed out were as follows: (1) whether the subject parcels of land fall within the coverage of the Compulsory Acquisition Program of the CARP; and (2) whether the petition for land conversion of the parcels of land may be granted.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>On December 7, 1990, the Office of the Secretary, DAR, through the Undersecretary for Operations (Assistant Secretary for Luzon Operations) and the Regional Director of Region IV, submitted a report answering the two issues raised.&nbsp; According to them, firstly, by virtue of the issuance of the notice of coverage on August 11, 1989, and notice of acquisition on December 12, 1989, the property is covered under compulsory acquisition.&nbsp; Secondly, Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1990, Section IV D also supports the DAR position on the coverage of the said property.&nbsp; During the consideration of the case by the Board, there was no pending petition for land conversion specifically concerning the parcels of land in question.</span><br><br>On February 19, 1991, the Board sent a notice of hearing to all the parties interested, setting the hearing for the administrative valuation of the subject parcels of land on March 6, 1991.&nbsp; However, on February 22, 1991, Atty. Ma. Elena P. Hernandez-Cueva, counsel for SRRDC, wrote the Board requesting for its assistance in the reconstruction of the records of the case because the records could not be found as her co-counsel, Atty. Ricardo Blancaflor, who originally handled the case for SRRDC and had possession of all the records of the case was on indefinite leave and could not be contacted.&nbsp; The Board granted counsel’s request and moved the hearing on April 4, 1991.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">On March 18, 1991, SRRDC submitted a petition to the Board for the latter to resolve SRRDC’s petition for exemption from CARP coverage before any administrative valuation of their landholding could be had by the Board.</span><br><br>On April 4, 1991, the initial DARAB hearing of the case was held and subsequently, different dates of hearing were set without objection from counsel of SRRDC.&nbsp; During the April 15, 1991 hearing, the subdivision plan of subject property at Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna was submitted and marked as Exhibit “5” for SRRDC.&nbsp; At the hearing on April 23, 1991, the Land Bank asked for a period of one month to value the land in dispute.<br><br>At the hearing on April 23, 1991, certification from Deputy Zoning Administrator Generoso B. Opina was presented.&nbsp; The certification issued on September 8, 1989, stated that the parcels of land subject of the case were classified as “Industrial Park” per Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 45-89 dated March 29, 1989.<br><br>To avert any opportunity that the DARAB might distribute the lands to the farmer beneficiaries, on April 30, 1991, petitioner filed a petition with DARAB to disqualify private respondents as beneficiaries.&nbsp; However, DARAB refused to address the issue of beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>. . .</blockquote>On December 19, 1991, the DARAB promulgated a decision, affirming the dismissal of the protest of SRRDC against the compulsory coverage of the property covered by TCT Nos. 81949 and 84891.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises, the Board hereby orders:<br><ol type="1"><li> The dismissal for lack of merit of the protest against the compulsory coverage of the landholdings of Sta.

The ISSUE ON CARP COVERAGE was initiated and incorporated in said proceeding, <span style="font-weight: bold;">at the instance of petitioner itself,</span> by filing a petition dated March 18, 1991, … Prayed therein were that DARAB:<br><br><ol type="1"><li> Take cognizance and assume jurisdiction over the question of CARP coverage of the subject parcels of land;<br><br></li><li> Defer or hold in abeyance the proceedings for administrative valuation of the subject properties pending determination of the question of CARP coverage;<br><br></li><li> Allow respondent SRRDC to adduce evidence in support of its position that the subject parcels of land are not covered by the CARP beginning on the scheduled hearing date of April 4, 1991” (p.3; emphasis and underscoring supplied).</li></ol>Upon persistent request of petitioner SRRDC, it was accommodated by DARAB and a counsel of SRRDC even took the witness stand.&nbsp; Its lawyers were always in attendance during the scheduled hearings until it was time for SRRDC to present its own evidence.<br><br>4.5.2.3.&nbsp; But, as earlier stated, despite the open session proddings by DARAB for SRRDC to submit evidence and the rescheduling for, allegedly, they are still collating the evidence, nay, the request that it be allowed to adduce evidence, none was adduced and this constrained public respondent to declare SRRDC as having waived its right to present evidence.&nbsp; And, after the remaining parties were heard, the hearing was formally terminated.<br><br>. . .<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.5.3. Needless to state, the jurisdictional objection (CARP coverage), now being raised herein was not one of the original matters in issue.&nbsp; Principally, DARAB was called upon under Section 16 of Republic Act No. 6657 to resolve a land valuation case.&nbsp; But SRRDC itself insisted that DARAB should take cognizance thereof in the same land valuation proceeding.&nbsp; And, SRRDC, through its lawyers, actively participated in the hearings conducted.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.5.4. It was only when an adverse decision was rendered by DARAB that the jurisdictional issue was raised in the petition for review it filed with the Honorable Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It was also only then that petitioner presented proof/evidence.</span><br><br>. . .<br><br>4.5.6.&nbsp; Public respondents (DAR/DARAB) are not unmindful of the rule that matter of jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceeding.&nbsp; But for two serious considerations, the applicability thereof in the case at bar should not be allowed.<br><br>4.5.6.1.&nbsp; The fact [part (municipal/industrial) and/or watershed] upon which the jurisdictional issue interchangeably hinges were not established during the hearing of the case.&nbsp; No proof was adduced.&nbsp; That the matter of CARP coverage is strictly administrative implementation of CARP and, therefore, beyond the competence of DARAB, belonging, as it does, to the DAR Secretary, was not even alleged, either before DARAB or the Honorable Court of Appeals, the numerous petitions/incidents filed notwithstanding.&nbsp; Be it that as it may, the records of the case show that initially DARAB refused to take cognizance thereof and, in fact, forwarded the issue of CARP coverage to the office of the DAR Secretary.&nbsp; It was only when it was returned to DARAB by said office that proceedings thereon commenced pursuant to Section 1(g) of Rule II of the DARAB Revised Rules of Procedure.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.5.6.2. Petitioner is now estopped from assailing the jurisdiction of DARAB.&nbsp; First, it expressly acknowledged the same, in fact invoked it, when it filed its petition (Annex “4”); and, second, during the scheduled hearings, SRRDC, through its counsel, actively participated, one of its counsel (sic) even testifying.&nbsp; It may not now be allowed to impugn the jurisdiction of public respondent </span>…<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In CA-G.R. SP No. 27234, the CA likewise found that it was SRRDC that called upon the DARAB to determine the issue and it, in fact, actively participated in the proceedings before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>&nbsp; It was SRRDC’s own act of summoning the DARAB’s authority that cured whatever jurisdictional defect it now raises.&nbsp; It is elementary that the active participation of a party in a case pending against him before a court or a quasi-judicial body, is tantamount to a recognition of that court’s or body’s jurisdiction and a willingness to abide by the resolution of the case and will bar said party from later on impugning the court’s or body’s jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the issue of jurisdiction was raised by SRRDC only before the CA.&nbsp; It was never presented or discussed before the DARAB for obvious reasons, i.e., it was SRRDC itself that invoked the latter’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; As a rule, when a party adopts a certain theory, and the case is tried and decided upon that theory in the court below, he will not be permitted to change his theory on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; Points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time at such late stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; To permit SRRDC to change its theory on appeal would not only be unfair to Amante, et al. but would also be offensive to the basic scales of fair play, justice and due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court notes that then DAR Secretary Benjamin T. Leong issued a Memorandum on July 11, 1991, ordering the opening of a trust account in favor of SRRDC.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">In Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals,</span> this Court struck down as void DAR Administrative Circular No. 9, Series of 1990, providing for the opening of trust accounts in lieu of the deposit in cash or in bonds contemplated in Section 16 (e) of R.A. No. 6657.&nbsp; As a result, the DAR issued Administrative Order No. 2, Series of 1996, converting trust accounts in the name of landowners into deposit accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Thus, the trust account opened by the LBP per instructions of DAR Secretary Benjamin T. Leong should be converted to a deposit account, to be retroactive in application in order to rectify the error committed by the DAR in opening a trust account and to grant the landowners the benefits concomitant to payment in cash or LBP bonds prior to the ruling of the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals.&nbsp;</span> The account shall earn a 12% interest per annum from the time the LBP opened a trust account up to the time said account was actually converted into cash and LBP bonds deposit accounts.<br><br>Given the foregoing conclusions, the petition filed in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 118838,</span> which primarily rests on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 112526</span>, should be granted.<br><br>The judgments of the trial court in the injunction case (Civil Case No. B-2333) and the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 38182 were premised on SRRDC’s transfer certificates of title over the subject property.&nbsp; The trial court and the CA cannot be faulted for denying the writ of injunction prayed for by Amante, et al. since at the time the trial court rendered its decision in the injunction case on January 20, 1992, SRRDC was still the holder of the titles covering the subject property.&nbsp; The titles in its name were cancelled and corresponding TCTs were issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines on February 11, 1992, and CLOAs were issued to the farmer-beneficiaries on February 26, 1992.&nbsp; When Amante, et al., in their motion for reconsideration filed in CA-G.R. SP No. 38182, brought to the CA’s attention the issuance of the CLOAs, the CA, per Resolution dated January 19, 1995, reiterated its ruling that “whether or not the subject property is covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (R.A. No. 6657) is the subject matter of a separate case, and we cannot interfere with the same at the present time.”&nbsp; The CA further stated that “(O)ur present decision is, therefore, not intended to preempt any judgment or prejudice the right of any party in the said case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> It must be noted that at that juncture, the DARAB Decision and the CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 27234, finding the subject property covered by the CARP Law, is yet to be finally resolved by this Court in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 112526</span> and in fact, a temporary restraining order was issued by the Court on December 15, 1993, enjoining the DARAB from enforcing the effects of the CLOAs.&nbsp; Amante, et al. was likewise restrained from further clearing the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Hence, the decision of the trial court and the CA denying the writ of injunction was warranted.<br><br>Nevertheless, considering that the subject property is agricultural and may be acquired for distribution to farmer-beneficiaries identified by the DAR under the CARP, the transfer certificates of title issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines and the CLOAs issued by the DAR in the names of Amante, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> are valid titles and therefore must be upheld.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">By virtue thereof, Amante, et al. who have been issued CLOAs are now the owners of the subject property.</span>&nbsp; Consequently, the decisions of the trial court in the injunction case and the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 38182 must now be set aside, insofar as it orders Amante, et al. to vacate and/or enjoins them from entering the subject property.<br><br>The Court, however, agrees with the CA that Amante, et al. is not entitled to actual, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees.&nbsp; SRRDC’s right of possession over the subject property was predicated on its claim of ownership, and it cannot be sanctioned in exercising its rights or protecting its interests thereon.&nbsp; As was ruled by the CA, Amante, et al. is merely entitled to nominal damages as a result of SRRDC’s acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>All is not lost in this case.&nbsp; In its Memorandum dated September 29, 1993, to the DAR Secretary, the DENR manifested that:<br><blockquote>. . . the farmers themselves could be tapped to undertake watershed management and protection.&nbsp; This community-based approach in natural resource management, is in fact, being used in numerous watershed management projects nationwide.&nbsp; Adopting the same approach in the area is deemed the best possible solution to the case since it will not prejudice the CLOAs issued to the farmer-beneficiaries.&nbsp; They should, however, be required to undertake the necessary reforestation and other watershed management/rehabilitation measures in the area.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we recommend that a watershed management plan for the area espousing the community-based approach be drawn-up jointly by the DAR and DENR. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup></blockquote>If SRRDC sincerely wants to preserve the property for ecological considerations, it can be done regardless of who owns it.&nbsp; After all, we are all stewards of this earth, and it rests on all of us to tend to it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the Second Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Court’s Decision dated October 12, 2001 in G.R.
