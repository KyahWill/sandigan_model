				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeks to annul and set aside the August 31, 2004 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 76995, and its December 13, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration.<br><div align="justify"><br>The antecedent facts show that on November 28, 1997, the Discipline Committee of Duty Free Philippines (DFP) rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 in DISCOM Case No. 97-027 finding Stock Clerk Rossano A. Mojica guilty 
of Neglect of Duty by causing considerable damage to or loss of 
materials, assets and property of DFP.&nbsp; Thus, Mojica was considered 
forcibly resigned from the service with forfeiture of all benefits 
except his salary and the monetary value of the accrued leave credits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Mojica
 was formally informed of his forced resignation on January 14, 1998.&nbsp; 
Thereupon, he filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for 
reinstatement, payment of full back wages, damages, and attorney's fees,
 against DFP before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<br><br>On
 February 2, 2000, Labor Arbiter Facundo L. Leda rendered a Decision 
finding that Mojica was illegally dismissed.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of
 the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, decision is hereby 
rendered declaring the dismissal of complainant Rossano J. Mojica to be 
illegal such that respondent Duty Free Philippines is directed to 
reinstate him to his former or substantially equivalent position without
 loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to pay him the amount
 of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PESOS &amp; 08/100 
(P259,017.08) representing his backwages and attorney's fees, both 
awards being subject to further computation until actual reinstatement.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The NLRC reversed the ruling of the arbiter.&nbsp; It found that the dismissal was valid and with just cause.<br><br>Mojica's motion for reconsideration was denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 hence he filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of 
Court before the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 76995.<br><br>The
 appellate court agreed with the arbiter that Mojica was not guilty of 
gross or habitual negligence that would warrant his dismissal.&nbsp; It found
 that there was no convincing evidence to prove that Mojica connived 
with other personnel in pilfering the stocks of DFP.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Respondent
 Mojica is a civil service employee; therefore, jurisdiction is lodged 
not with the NLRC, but with the Civil Service Commission.<br><br>DFP was created under Executive Order (EO) No. 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 on September 4, 1986 primarily to augment the service facilities for 
tourists and to generate foreign exchange and revenue for the 
government.&nbsp; In order for the government to exercise direct and 
effective control and regulation over the tax and duty free shops, their
 establishment and operation was vested in the Ministry, now Department 
of Tourism (DOT), through its implementing arm, the Philippine Tourism 
Authority (PTA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> &nbsp;All the net profits from the merchandising operations of the shops accrued to the DOT.<br><br>As provided under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 564,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 PTA is a corporate body attached to the DOT.&nbsp; As an attached agency, 
the recruitment, transfer, promotion and dismissal of all its personnel 
was governed by a merit system established in accordance with the civil 
service rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, all PTA officials and employees are subject to the Civil Service rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accordingly,
 since DFP is under the exclusive authority of the PTA, it follows that 
its officials and employees are likewise subject to the Civil Service 
rules and regulations.&nbsp; Clearly then, Mojica's recourse to the Labor 
Arbiter was not proper.&nbsp; He should have followed the procedure laid down
 in DFP's merit system and the Civil Service rules and regulations.<br><br>PD No. 807 or <i>The Civil Service Decree of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 declared that the Civil Service Commission shall be the central 
personnel agency to set standards and to enforce the laws governing the 
discipline of civil servants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp;
 It categorically described the scope of Civil Service as embracing 
every branch, agency, subdivision, and instrumentality of the 
government, including every government-owned or controlled corporation 
whether performing governmental or proprietary function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp;
 It construed an agency to mean any bureau, office, commission, 
administration, board, committee, institute, corporation, whether 
performing governmental or proprietary function, or any other unit of 
the National Government, as well as provincial, city or municipal 
government, except as otherwise provided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, EO No. 180<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 defined "government employees" as all employees of all branches, 
subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies, of the Government, 
including government-owned or controlled corporations with original 
charters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; It provided 
that the Civil Service and labor laws shall be followed in the 
resolution of complaints, grievances and cases involving government 
employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>EO No. 292 or <i>The Administrative Code of 1987</i>
 empowered the Civil Service Commission to hear and decide 
administrative cases instituted by or brought before it directly or on 
appeal, including contested appointments, and review decisions and 
actions of its offices and of the agencies attached to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Thus, we held in <i>Zamboanga City Water District v. Buat</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>There
 is no dispute that petitioner, a water district with an original 
charter, is a government-owned and controlled corporation.&nbsp; The 
established rule is that the hiring and firing of employees of 
government-owned and controlled corporations are governed by provisions 
of the Civil Service Law and Civil Service Rules and Regulations.&nbsp; 
Jurisdiction over the strike and the dismissal of private respondents is
 therefore lodged not with the NLRC but with the Civil Service 
Commission. (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we also held that:<br><blockquote>It
 is now settled that, conformably to Article IX-B, Section 2(1), [of the
 1987 Constitution] government-owned or controlled corporations shall be
 considered part of the Civil Service only if they have original 
charters, as distinguished from those created under general law.<br><br>PAGCOR
 belongs to the Civil Service because it was created directly by PD 1869
 on July 11, 1983.&nbsp; Consequently, controversies concerning the relations
 of the employee with the management of PAGCOR should come under the 
jurisdiction of the Merit System Protection Board and the Civil Service 
Commission, conformably to the Administrative Code of 1987.<br><br>Section 16(2) of the said Code vest in the Merit System Protection Board the power <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span> to:<br><br>a)
 Hear and decide on appeal administrative cases involving officials and 
employees of the Civil Service.&nbsp; Its decision shall be final except 
those involving dismissal or separation from the service which may be 
appealed to the Commission.<br><br>Applying this rule, we have upheld 
the jurisdiction of Civil Service Authorities, as against that of the 
labor authorities, in controversies involving the terms of employment, 
and other related issues, of the Civil Service official and employees...<br></blockquote>EO
 No. 292 provided that civil service employees have the right to present
 their complaints or grievances to management and have them adjudicated 
as expeditiously as possible in the best interest of the agency, the 
government as a whole, and the employee concerned.&nbsp; Such complaint or 
grievances shall be resolved at the lowest possible level in the 
department or agency, as the case may be, and the employee shall have 
the right to appeal such decision to higher authorities.&nbsp; In case any 
dispute remains unresolved after exhausting all the available remedies 
under existing laws and procedure, the parties may jointly refer the 
dispute in the Public Sector Labor Management Council for appropriate 
action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In sum, the
 labor arbiter and the NLRC erred in taking cognizance of the complaint 
as jurisdiction over the complaint for illegal dismissal is lodged with 
the Civil Service Commission.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals likewise erred in 
sustaining the labor arbiter.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the August 31, 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
