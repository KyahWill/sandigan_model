The Republic goes on to argue as follows:<br><blockquote>The evidence on record clearly shows that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondents</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suzara</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garcia</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">diverted</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">funds</span> provided by petitioner to respondent ISC intended for the construction of the buildings.&nbsp; There is a need to apply the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate entity in the instant case.&nbsp; Respondents Suzara and Garcia used respondent ISC, a corporation, as a shield to justify their wrong deeds and in order to protect the fraud they committed.&nbsp;

Suzara and Garcia.”<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>As quoted earlier, the Republic in its complaint charged ISC et al. to be guilty of fraud for “they had no intention whatsoever to perform them and had falsely represented . . . that they were financially capable and had all the technical expertise and experience.” But as stated earlier, Suzara in the Answer he jointly filed with ISC denied the allegation of misrepresentation, he claiming that his participation in the execution of the MOA was limited to his official capacity as Chairman of ISC.<br><br>Issues having been joined after ISC and Suzara jointly filed their Answer, it was incumbent for the Republic to prove the issue,<span style="font-style: italic;"> inter alia,</span> of whether Suzara’s participation in the MOA was limited to his official capacity as Chairman of ISC.<br><br>Albeit ISC and Suzara were declared as in default on December 12, 1994 under Rule 20 of the Revised Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Republic had the burden of proving that first, Suzara, contrary to his claim, participated in the MOA not only in his official capacity as Chairman but also in his personal capacity, and second, that he, along with ISC, committed fraud.&nbsp; For fraud cannot be presumed and it must be established by clear and sufficient evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Courts never sustain findings of fraud upon circumstances which, at most, create only suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It does not mean, however, that fraud can only be proved by direct evidence.&nbsp;

It bears noting, in this connection, that the Republic paid ISC P5,942,160.00 on October 6,&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1989</span>.&nbsp; And it paid P2,546,640.00 on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">July</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1990</span>.&nbsp; There is no showing, however, that the same or part of the funds received from the Republic were those invested by ISC in financial institutions.<br><br>To infer from the above-specified documents, as what the Republic did in its brief before the appellate and this Court, that Suzara being then Chairman of ISC “clearly assented to a patently unlawful act” by agreeing “to divert the funds intended for the construction of 45 school buildings” is a <span style="font-style: italic;">non sequitor</span>.&nbsp; Parenthetically, the allegation of fraud involving Suzara in the complaint was one arising from misrepresentation of financial capability and technical expertise and experience to construct the school buildings, not from “diversion.”<br><br>In fine, the participation, if any, by Suzara in the alleged diversion is not unexplainable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Unfortunately, he was declared as in default.&nbsp; At all events, it is speculatory.&nbsp; As such, fraud as the Republic’s basis in urging the piercing the veil of corporate fiction does not lie.<br><br>This Court would not also hold Suzara personally liable for, as correctly found by the appellate court which cited<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tramat Mercantile, Inc. v.
