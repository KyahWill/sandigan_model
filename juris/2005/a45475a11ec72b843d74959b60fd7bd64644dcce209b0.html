Plaintiff consistently <u>denied claims from the defendants that he received the demand letter and notice of auction sale</u>.<br><br>After plaintiffs presented their evidence, the parties entered into a gentlemen’s agreement that status shall remain until such time that the issue of a temporary restraining order shall have been resolved and/or until further notice from the court.<br><br>On the other hand, defendants’ loan witness is Anna Marie Quintos, employed in PNB International Finance Limitd, based in Hongkong, Ms. Quintos testified that there <u>are three (3) real estate mortgages securing plaintiff’s loan.

Witness also testified that the <u>loan documents were properly filled up when Mr. Timbol signed the same and that he was furnished copies thereof, that after Mr. Timbol was declared in default he did not pay interest at all</u>. She, however, admitted that she was not the account officer handling Mr. Timbol’s account but it was one Cathy de Guzman. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>In justifying the grant of the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, the trial court stated:<br><blockquote>After weighing the arguments advanced by the parties, the court holds that <u><b>it would better serve the cause of justice</b> if the consolidation of title shall in the meantime not proceed, for to do so would probably work injustice to the plaintiffs</u>, <b>considering</b> their <b>claim</b> that the foreclosure of the mortgaged properties conducted by Atty. Ricardo M. Espina on November 15, 1999, was highly <b><u>irregular and illegal</u></b> as well as defendant <u><b>PNB’s act of bloating</b></u> the amount of their obligation. Moreover, for defendant PNB to proceed with the intended consolidation of title with the principal case still to be resolved would <b><u>tend to render the issue therein moot and academic</u></b>; thus, the court deems it fit to maintain the status quo by issuing the writ of preliminary injunction applied for. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>PNB filed a motion for reconsideration and a supplemental motion for reconsideration of the trial court’s order of December 2, 2000, but they were denied, by Order of December 22, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> in this wise:<br><blockquote>. . . .[Defendant PNB] claims that contrary to the finding of the court, plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction; that PNB-IFL did not bloat plaintiffs’ loan obligation therewith; that the bank’s witness was able to rebut plaintiffs’ said allegations when she testified that plaintiffs’ total principal loan obligation of P22,796,200.00 is secured by their nine (9) titles; that this fact is also clearly shown on the real estate mortgage contracts executed by the plaintiffs in defendant bank’s favor; that the interest rates in the promissory notes were based on the facility letters signed by the plaintiffs and fixed at USD prime rate plus 2.5% in accordance with the agreement of the parties; that the requisite posting and publication of notice were properly obtained by the defendant bank prior to the public auction sale, furnishing a copy thereof to plaintiffs’ representative and, therefore, PNB did not violate the provisions of PD 1079; and finally, defendant was of the impression that the hearing conducted on August 14 to 23, 2000 were for plaintiffs’ Application for a TRO and not for a preliminary injunction.<br><br>In its supplemental motion for reconsideration, defendant <u>PNB averred that its allegation that it never bloated plaintiffs’ obligation was duly established by its witness and supported by documentary exhibits; that the required notice and publication of the notice of extra judicial sale were also complied with as evidenced by the court</u>; that error is in losing sight of the well-established doctrine that the right to an injunctive relief must be clear, positive, existing and unmistakable and there is an urgent and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages; and that plaintiffs failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that they will suffer irreparable injury or injustice if defendant will consolidate title to the properties foreclosed.<br><br><u>Plaintiffs opposed the motion and advanced the argument that defendant PNB never presented sufficient evidence that would show that indeed it did not bloat their obligation</u>. Also, they added that the <u>findings of the court as contained in the assailed order are for purposes of preliminary injunctive writ only</u> and that there is nothing new in the matters brought forth in the motion for reconsideration as the court had considered the matters in the present motion.<br><br>It is clear from the pronouncement of the court in the order sought to be reconsidered that <u>the court deems it fit that status quo be maintained until the principal case is resolved, considering the <b>nature</b> of the instant case</u> which is for annulment of Real Estate Mortgage, of Foreclosure of Mortgage, of Auction Sale, Accounting and Damages. This is precisely its main concern in granting the issuance of the preliminary writ of injunction upon plaintiffs’ posting of a bond. In addition, whether it is a TRO or a preliminary injunction, the grounds for granting either relief will be the same. Moreover, <u>in a preliminary injunction, the defendant stands protected by the injunction bond to be posted</u> by the plaintiff in case it turned out that the latter is not entitled thereto.<br><br>Likewise, the court believes it would be better for all the parties concerned if pre-trial conference in this case be already set in order that full blown trial be immediately had, thus the grant of a preliminary injunction instead of a mere TRO.

As adverted to earlier, the appellate court, by decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of February 28 2003, dismissed petitioner’s petition in this wise:<br><blockquote>. . . <u>[T]he issue concerning the defect in the notice and publication of the notice of sale in an extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings cannot be simply ignored</u> for the rule is settled that non-compliance with the requirements of notice and publication in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale could constitute a jurisdictional defect that would invalidate the sale. Thus, <u>we fully agree with the respondent court when it said</u>:<br><blockquote>After weighing the arguments advanced by the parties, the court holds that it would better serve the cause of justice if the consolidation of title shall in the meantime not proceed, for to do so would probably work injustice to the plaintiffs, considering their claim that the foreclosure of the mortgaged properties conducted by Atty. Ricardo M. Espina on November 15, 1999, was highly irregular and illegal as well as defendant PNB’s act of bloating the amount of their obligation. Moreover, for defendant PNB to proceed with the intended consolidation of title with the principal case still to be resolved would tend to render the issue therein moot and academic; thus, the court deems it fit to maintain status quo by issuing the writ of preliminary injunction applied for.<br></blockquote>Be that as it may, in a special action for certiorari, the burden is on the petitioner to prove not merely reversible error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the public respondent. Again, by grave abuse of discretion is meant capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<br><br>Certainly, <u>the <b>issue of any irregularity</b> in the foreclosure proceedings is a <b>factual issue</b> and therefore, not within this court’s function to evaluate</u>, given the limited scope of its review power, which is confined only to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion. <u>Granting arguendo that there was a mistake in the questioned findings and conclusions of the respondent judge, certiorari will not prosper</u>. Needless to state, certiorari is not available to correct errors of procedure or mistakes in the judge’s findings and conclusions. As long as a court acts within its jurisdiction, <u>any alleged <b>errors</b> committed <b>in the exercise of its jurisdiction</b> will amount to nothing more than <b>errors of judgment</b> which are reviewable by timely appeal and not by a special civil action of certiorari</u>.<br><br>In conclusion, <u>we are not convinced that the respondent court abused its discretion in a manner that is whimsical and arbitrary</u> as to warrant our interference by the extraordinary writ of certiorari. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Its motion for reconsideration of the appellate court’s decision having been denied, petitioner lodged the present petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>Proffering that while a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 shall raise only questions of law, the findings of fact by the court <i>a quo</i> being deemed conclusive, petitioner invokes the following exceptions to the general rule which were enunciated in <i>Fuentes v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> enumerating instances where the factual findings of the appellate court may be reviewed by this Court:<br><blockquote><i>(1) when the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contradictory;<br><br>(2) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;<br><br>(3) when the inference made by the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;<br><br>(4) when there is grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts;<br><br>(5) when the appellate court, in making its findings, goes beyond the issues of the case, and such findings are contrary to the admissions of both appellate and appellee;<br><br>(6) when the judgment of the Court of appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts;<br><br>(7) when the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;</i> (Italics in the original)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner goes on to submit that a number of the above enumerated exceptions are present in this case. Thus it contends that the appellate court failed to notice relevant facts which, if considered properly, justifies a different conclusion, and that it premised its decision on a misapprehension of fact which, if likewise considered, will justify a different conclusion. It is in this light that petitioner concludes that the challenged decision is not in accord with the facts and the law of the case.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>Respondents never denied that they defaulted in the payment of the obligation. They, however, prayed, in their complaint, for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain petitioner from proceeding to “annotate and/or consolidate its title to the mortgaged properties,” otherwise their titles to the properties would be cancelled and new ones issued in lieu thereof, causing them “injustice and irreparable damages and injury.”<br><br>Rule 58, Sec. 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction</i>. — A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established:<br><blockquote>(a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually;<br><br>(b) That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or<br><br>(c) That a party, court, agency or a person in doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.<br></blockquote></blockquote>To be entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction, an applicant must show that (1) he has a right <i>in esse</i> or a right to be protected, and (2) the act against which injunction is to be directed is a violation of such right. That is settled.<br><br>From a considered scrutiny of the records of the case, the main thesis of respondents in praying for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is that “[t]he foreclosure by [the] Notary Public is highly irregular, not valid and thus illegal” because “it was not in accordance with Administrative Order No. 3 of the Supreme Court dated 24 October 1984”, and the amount of their obligation was “deliberately bloated” to a “staggering” amount of P101,117,800.00, way above the granted credit facilities amounting to US$848,300.00.<br><br>Respondents’ claim of irregularity in the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings was belied, however, by the testimonial and documentary evidence of petitioner which correctly argued that Supreme Court Administrative Order No. 3 does not apply, the extrajudicial foreclosure having been conducted by a notary public to which mode of foreclosure respondents agreed in the REMs, hence, proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>As for respondents’ claim of deliberate bloating by petitioner of their obligation, the same was likewise belied by petitioner which demonstrated that, contrary to respondents’ representation that each of the first 7 above-listed titles secured the amount of 7 obligations of P13,053,600.00 each, the 7 titles <b><u>collectively secured</u></b> the amount of P13,053,600.00. Such claim, <u>despite respondent Timbol’s admission in his October 27, 1999 letter to petitioner’s counsel</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that he and his company’s outstanding obligation was P33,000,000.00 is <b>grossly misleading and is a gross misrepresentation</b>. The same letter of respondent Timbol belies respondent Timbol’s testimony, <u>as noted by the trial court</u>, that he denied the claims [of petitioner] that he received the demand letter.” Parenthetically, respondents did not allege in their complaint that they did not receive any demand letter from petitioner.<br><br>The issuance by the trial court, therefore, of the Order granting a writ of preliminary injunction in order, so it declared, to “better serve the cause of justice” considering respondents’ claim that the foreclosure was irregular and petitioner bloated their obligation, was attended with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>It was, therefore, error for the appellate court to find no grave abuse of discretion in the issuance of the trial court’s order and accordingly dismiss petitioner’s petition for certiorari.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed February 28, 2003 decision of the Court of Appeals and its Order denying a reconsideration thereof are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> and another rendered <b>NULLIFYING</b> and <b>SETTING ASIDE</b> the September 8, 2000 Order of Branch 150 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati in Civil Case No. 00-946.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona</i> and <i>Garcia, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Court of Appeals (CA) <i>Rollo</i> at 22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Annex “A” to petitioner’s Petition before the CA, CA <i>Rollo</i> at 36.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 58.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 275.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 278.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 108.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 110-113.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 109.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 114-128.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 122.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 124-125.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 129-157.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 85-92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 134.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 139-140.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> 265 SCRA 327 (1997).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 146-157.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 115-116.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 116.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 123-126.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 123-125.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 44-45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> 268 SCRA 703 (1997).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <i>Casano v.
