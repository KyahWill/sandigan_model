According to the CA, considering that the appellant had been sentenced to life imprisonment in Criminal Case No. 98-77300, it had no jurisdiction over the appeal under Article VIII, Section 5(2)(d) of the Constitution, and Section 3, Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; However, instead of dismissing the appeal as mandated by Supreme Court Circular No. 2-90, the CA ordered the transfer of the case to this Court, citing its&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Limpangog v. Court of Appeals.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The Court resolves to return the case to the CA for a decision of the appeal on its merits.<br><br>After the instant case was transferred by the CA, this Court promulgated <span style="font-style: italic;">People of the Philippines v.
