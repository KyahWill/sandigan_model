				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This Court's review powers over resolutions and orders of the Office of the Ombudsman is restricted only to determining whether grave abuse of discretion, that is, capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment, has been committed.&nbsp; The Court is not authorized to correct every error or mistake allegedly committed by that constitutionally independent government agency.&nbsp; Thus, absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion, we have consistently sustained its determination of the existence or the nonexistence of probable cause.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the April 21, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the August 27, 2004 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the deputy ombudsman for Luzon in OMB-L-C-03-1550-L.&nbsp; The challenged Resolution disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"<b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, it is respectfully recommended that the present case lodged against respondents Felix V.

They added that Vice-Mayor Contreras had failed to refer the budget to the chief legal counsel of the municipality; and that, together with the other incumbent members of the Sangguniang Bayan, she had instead sought the approval of the alleged "Illegal Annual Budget for 2003."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On the theory that no enabling resolution had been enacted authorizing expenditures of the municipality to be based on the annual budget for the preceding year, petitioners claimed that the disbursement of public funds during the period January 1, 2003 to July 11, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and/or August 27, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> had been illegal.&nbsp; They therefore prayed that respondents be held liable for the illegal disbursements done in the discharge of official functions, through evident bad faith and/or gross negligence that had caused undue injury to the Municipality of Hagonoy, Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Respondents filed their respective Counter-Affidavits, both dated February 27, 2004, and practically identical in form and substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; They stated that the proposed budget had actually been submitted on June 26, 2003, and not June 11, 2003.&nbsp; It was submitted only on that date, because Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2002-2003, otherwise known as the "New Government Accounting System," had mandated the revision of accounting procedures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; In compliance with that Circular, the municipality had to review and modify almost all of its financial transactions beginning January 1, 2002.&nbsp; In order to prepare a feasible budget, they allegedly had to know the locality's financial position for the prior year, data on which had to come from the accounting department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>According to respondents, the Sangguniang Bayan of Hagonoy and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Bulacan eventually passed and approved the proposed budget, whose effectivity date was January 1, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; They averred that the Local Government Code had not required the vice-mayor to submit the budget to the legal officer of the municipality for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Finally, respondents claimed that the disbursements of public funds during the absence of an approved budget were legal under Section 323<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of RA 7160 or the LGC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In their Reply and Supplemental Reply, petitioners reiterated their allegations in their Joint Affidavit-Complaint, in which they stressed that Section 323 of the LGC had required the mayor to submit the budget for the coming fiscal year not later than October 16 of the current FY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><b><u><center><br>Ruling of the Deputy Ombudsman<br></center><br></u></b>The Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon (OMB-Luzon) found no probable cause against respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; It noted that the charge was premised on allegedly illegal disbursements that had caused undue injury to the government.&nbsp; Yet, petitioners failed to specify which disbursements had been made illegally.&nbsp; Besides, there was no proof that the expenditures unduly benefited certain individuals or were made pursuant to the regular operations of the municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The OMB-Luzon also held that Section 323 of the LGC had authorized the reenactment of the budget for the preceding year to allow the municipal government to function and carry out its mandate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the disbursements made during the questioned period when the new budget had not yet been approved could not have been illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, the OMB-Luzon pointed out that the alleged undue injury should have been specified, quantified, and proven to the point of moral certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; It found no reason to set the case for clarificatory hearings or to issue subpoenas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><b><u><center><br>The Issues<br></center><br></u></b><br>Petitioners state the issues in this wise: <br><blockquote><table Â ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"(A)</td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="justify">Whether or not the admitted flagrant violation of Respondent Mayor Felix V.

Desierto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> held that appeals from the orders, directives, or decisions of the OMB in administrative disciplinary cases were cognizable by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; <i>Tirol v. Del Rosario</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> clarified that, in non-administrative cases in which the OMB had acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 may be filed directly with this Court.&nbsp; Accordingly, <i>Kuizon v. Desierto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> held that this Court had jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari questioning the resolutions or orders of the ombudsman in criminal cases.<br><br>Thus, petitioners committed a procedural error in resorting to a Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; To challenge the dismissal of their Complaint and to require the OMB to file an information, petitioners should have resorted to a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The only ground upon which this Court may entertain a review of the OMB's resolution is grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> not reversible errors.<br><b><u><center><br>Main Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">No Grave Abuse of Discretion</span><br></center><br></u></b>A special civil action for certiorari is the proper remedy when a government officer has acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; But even assuming that the present Petition may be treated as one for certiorari, the case must nevertheless be dismissed.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility.&nbsp; It must have been so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioners do not even allege that the OMB gravely abused its discretion in issuing its questioned Resolution.&nbsp; A perusal of the issues they submitted reveals that the crux of the controversy revolves around the finding of the deputy ombudsman that there was no probable cause against respondents. They allege that he committed <i>legal errors</i> in arriving at his findings and conclusions and had in fact no basis for dismissing their Complaint.&nbsp; The OMB's judgment may or may not have been erroneous, but it has not been shown to be tainted with arbitrariness, despotism or capriciousness amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><i><u><b>Sufficient Basis</b></u></i><br><br>In any event, the Court finds no grave abuse in the manner in which the deputy ombudsman exercised his discretion.&nbsp; Evidently, he had sufficient bases for his finding that there was no probable cause.<br><br><i>First,</i> the mere failure of the local government to enact a budget did not make all its disbursements illegal.&nbsp; Section 323 of the LGC provides for the automatic reenactment of the budget of the preceding year, in case the Sanggunian fails to enact one within the first 90 days of the fiscal year.&nbsp; Hence, the contention in the present case that money was paid out of the local treasury without any valid appropriation must necessarily fail.<br><br><i>Second,</i> Section 323 states that only the annual appropriations for salaries and wages, statutory and contractual obligations, and essential operating expenses are deemed reenacted.&nbsp; Petitioner failed to identify disbursements that had gone beyond this coverage.<br><br><i>Third,</i> petitioners failed to substantiate their allegations that the government had suffered undue injury.&nbsp; They concluded that there had been undue injury simply on the basis of their unsubstantiated claims of illegal disbursements.&nbsp; Having failed to prove any unlawful expenditure, the claim of undue injury must necessarily fail.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fourth,</span> petitioners relied solely on Section 318 of the LGC, which allegedly exposed the mayor to criminal liability for delay in submitting a budget proposal.&nbsp; The pertinent provision reads: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 318. <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of the Budget by the Local Chief Executive.</span> â Upon receipt of the statements of income and expenditures from the treasurer, the budget proposals of the heads of departments and offices, and the estimates of income and budgetary ceilings from the local finance committee, the local chief executive shall prepare the executive budget for the ensuing fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of this Title.<br><br>"The local chief executive shall submit the said executive budget to the sanggunian concerned not later than the sixteenth (16th) of October of the current fiscal year. Failure to submit such budget on the date prescribed herein shall subject the local chief executive to such criminal and administrative penalties as provided for under this Code and other applicable laws."<br></blockquote>Under the above LGC provision, criminal liability for delay in submitting the budget is qualified by various circumstances.&nbsp; For instance, the mayor must first receive the necessary financial documents from other city officials in order to be able to prepare the budget.&nbsp; In addition, criminal liability must conform to the provisions of the LGC and other applicable laws.&nbsp; Noteworthy is the fact that petitioners failed to present evidence that would fulfill these qualifications stated in the law.<br><br>We stress that the present case proceeds from an accusation that a crime was committed.&nbsp; A criminal case requires the filing of an information that will be the basis for the trial of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; A preliminary investigation should then be conducted to determine whether a probable cause exists to warrant the filing of the information against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Probable Cause</b></i><br><br><i>Probable cause</i> is defined as the existence of facts and circumstances that engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed, and that the respondent is probably guilty of that crime and should be held for trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; This term was explained in <i>Pilapil v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>"Probable cause is a reasonable ground of presumption that a matter is, or may be, well founded, such a state of facts in the mind of the prosecutor as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe, or entertain an honest or strong suspicion, that a thing is so.&nbsp; (Words and Phrases, Probable Cause, v. 34, p. 12)&nbsp; The term does not mean 'actual and positive cause' nor does it import absolute certainty.&nbsp; It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief.&nbsp; Thus a finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction.&nbsp; It is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged.&nbsp; Precisely, there is a trial for the reception of evidence of the prosecution in support of the charge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><u><i><b>Function of the<br>Government Prosecutor</b></i></u><br><br>The determination of probable cause during a preliminary investigation is a function of the government prosecutor, who in this case is the ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; As a rule, the Court does not interfere in the ombudsman's exercise of discretion in determining probable cause, unless there are compelling reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This policy is based on constitutional, statutory and practical considerations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; To insulate the OMB from outside pressure and improper influence, the Constitution and RA 6770<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (the Ombudsman Act of 1989) grant it a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutorial powers virtually free from executive, legislative or judicial intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Such initiative and independence must be inherent in the ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as champion of the people and preserver of the integrity of public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Otherwise, the courts would be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the OMB with regard to complaints filed before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; This effect would be the same as the further clogging of already clogged dockets of courts, should they be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of prosecuting attorneys each time an information is filed or a complaint dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court may exercise its certiorari power when the government prosecutor unreasonably refuses to file an information even if clearly warranted by the evidence.&nbsp; This certiorari power was recognized in <i>Socrates v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> which enumerated the remedies of the offended party or complainant, as follows:&nbsp; (1) to file an action for mandamus in case of grave abuse of discretion;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; (2) to lodge a new complaint against the offenders before the ombudsman and request the conduct of a new examination as required by law; (3) to institute administrative charges against the erring prosecutor, a criminal complaint under Article 208 of the Revised Penal Code, or a civil action for damages under Article 27 of the Civil Code; (4) to secure the appointment of another prosecutor; or (5) to institute another criminal action if no double jeopardy is involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><i><b><u>No Prima Facie Evidence</u></b></i><br><br>Under the present factual milieu, petitioners clearly failed to establish the following elements of a violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act:<br><blockquote>"1. The accused is a public officer or a private person charged in conspiracy with former;<br><br>"2. That he or she causes undue injury to any party, whether the government or a private party;<br><br>"3. That said public officer commits the prohibited acts during the performance of his or her official duties or in relation to his or her public positions;<br><br>"4. Such undue injury is caused by giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to such parties; and<br><br>"5. That the public officer has acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>A preliminary investigation constitutes a realistic judicial appraisal of the merits of a case.&nbsp; The complainant must adduce sufficient proof of guilt as basis for a criminal charge in court.&nbsp; As discussed earlier, the present petitioners did not submit any proof in support of their accusations against respondents.<br><br>Hence, the Court is bound to respect the deputy ombudsman's professional judgment in finding the case dismissible, absent a showing of grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Government resources and the time and effort of public officials would be needlessly wasted if the courts allow unmeritorious cases to be filed and given due course.&nbsp; It would be better to dismiss a case, like the present one in which the circumstances blatantly show that the act complained of does not constitute the offense charged.<br><u><b><center><br>Other Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Prayer for Subpoenas</span><br></center><br></b></u>This Petition includes a prayer for <i>subpoena ad testificandum</i> and s<i>ubpoena duces tecum.&nbsp; </i>This prayer, including a request for a clarificatory hearing, was initially made before the OMB in petitioners' Reply to respondents' Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners sought the testimonies of the municipal accountant and treasurer, who could purportedly identify the disbursements for FY 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The deputy ombudsman found this request tantamount to a "fishing expedition," which was not appropriate in a preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Without having to go through a preliminary investigation, the OMB has the power to dismiss a complaint outright for being completely without merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; It necessarily follows that conducting a preliminary investigation and determining if any of the modes of discovery should be used are within the ambit of its discretion.&nbsp; The Court cannot compel the testimonies of witnesses and the production of documents if, in the ombudsman's sound judgment, these pieces of evidence are not necessary to establish probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <i><b>DENIED</b></i>, and the assailed Resolution and Order are <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, Carpio-Morales, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.</span>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 29-61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id., pp. 66-73.&nbsp; Signed by Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer I Robert C.
