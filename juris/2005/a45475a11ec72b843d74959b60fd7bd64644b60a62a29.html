Guadinez Construction Supply (VMGCS) for P83,228.00.<br><br>Purchase Order No. 2019 was issued by the Provincial Government of Quezon in favor of VMGCS, who in turn, delivered the lumber materials on November 13, 1992 to Azaula, then Barangay Captain of Poblacion, Polillo, Quezon, as evidenced by Delivery Receipt No. 0063. The materials were placed about five meters from the construction site.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On November 20, 1992, Herminio Salvosa, officer-in-charge of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Polillo station, together with his fellow forest rangers, confiscated seventy-three (73) pieces of undocumented Makaasim lumber piled along the Polillo-Bordeos road, approximately five (5) meters from the Navotas Bridge.

Azaula, Rosendo N. Escara, Naime V. Ayuma, being the Barangay Captain, Municipal Mayor and Municipal Treasurer, respectively, of Polillo, Quezon, in the exercise of their administrative and/or official functions, with evident bad faith, conspiring and confederating with accused Virginia M. Guadinez, doing business under the V.M. Guadinez Construction Supply, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully cause undue injury and/or damage to the province of Quezon, by using in the construction of the Navotas Bridge in Sibulan, Polillo, Quezon, confiscated lumber consisting of 73 pieces with a volume of 4,172 board feet, valued at P11,172.00, more or less, and make it appear in a Disbursement Voucher, Delivery Receipt No. 0063, and Inspection Report dated January 28, 1993, that the lumber used in the construction of the Navotas Bridge were purchased from the V.M. Guadinez Construction Supply for P83,228.00, thus enabling accused Virginia Guadinez to receive the said purchase price, to the damage and prejudice of the Province of Quezon, in the aforementioned amount.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>Ayuma was eventually dropped from the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On April 30, 2004, the Sandiganbayan rendered the assailed decision finding petitioner, Azaula and Guadines guilty as charged, to wit:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, this Court finds accused BERNIE H.

People</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that in appeals to this Court from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sandiganbayan</span> only questions of law may be raised, not issues of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>It would seem quite obvious that such issues raised by Meneses and Bautista in G.R. No. 71651 as whether or not conviction was on the basis of alleged weakness of the defense evidence rather than on the strength of the prosecution's proofs or was founded on mere suspicions and conjectures; or the existence of conspiracy was inferred in the absence of positive and convincing evidence; or the evidence on record does not justify arrival at a verdict of guilt, are issues of fact, and not of law.&nbsp; So, too, such issues as are set up by Silva, Cruz and Almendral in G.R. No. 71728, to wit:&nbsp; whether or not there is sufficient evidence of conspiracy among the accused; or Silva and Cruz acted truthfully and in utmost good faith; or the Sandiganbayan relied on the weakness of the defense rather than on the strength of the evidence of the State; or the judgment of the Sandiganbayan was unduly influence(d) by the findings of the Civil Service Commission&nbsp; of grave misconduct and neglect of duties as regards accused Darum; or the evidence of the prosecution is insufficient to establish moral certainty of guilt are factual, not legal issues.&nbsp; But it is axiomatic that in appeals to this Court from the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Sandiganbayan</span> only questions of law may be raised, not issues of fact (Sec. 7, PD 1606; <span style="font-style: italic;">NuÃ±ez vs. Sandiganbayan,</span> 111 SCRA 433). ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>This well entrenched rule is, however, not without any exception. When the records clearly show a misapprehension of facts by the lower court, the Supreme Court â in the interest of speedy justice â may resolve the factual issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We have reviewed the records of this case and we find no reason to deviate from the decision of the Sandiganbayan which is supported by the testimonial and documentary evidence of the prosecution.&nbsp; The testimonies of Mendoza and Salvosa that the lumber used in the repair of the Navotas Bridge bore the markings "DENR CONFISCATED" show that it was the batch of lumber earlier confiscated.&nbsp; Hence, no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>It is an established doctrine of long standing that factual findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The trial court is in a unique position of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts.&nbsp; Only the trial judge can observe the furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh or the scant or full realization of an oath â all of which are useful for an accurate determination of a witness' honesty and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, the clear and straightforward testimonies of Mendoza and Salvosa, who are disinterested witnesses, deserve credence.<br><br>The petitioner failed to disprove that the lumber used to repair the bridge were not the ones confiscated by the DENR.&nbsp; The testimony of SPO2 Marasigan that the confiscated lumber was deposited in his custody<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> deserves no consideration.&nbsp; As the Sandiganbayan observed, Marasigan's testimony was vague.&nbsp; He could not even identify the lumber he received or the person who delivered them to his custody.&nbsp; The Scale Information listing the lumber turned over to the PNP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and the Inventory Sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> prepared by the DENR enumerated lumber of varying dimensions which proves that the lumber in the PNP custody were not the lumber confiscated by the DENR on November 20, 1992.<br><br>Petitioner's claim that he acted in good faith when he affixed his signatures in the Inspection Report and in Disbursement Voucher No. 001-9302-957 is belied by his January 25, 1993 letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to Engr. Bert Nierva of the Provincial Engineering Office, to wit:<br><blockquote>It is a known fact that the Provincial Engineering Office has already programmed its construction but due to interception of the Personnel of the local DENR the materials, especifically lumber purposely for its construction and having been delivered on the site, said lumber was marked 'confiscated', whereby hampering its construction.<br><br>Eversince said construction materials was 'confiscated' commuters and agricultural products was delayed and found it hard to traverse said bridge. ...<br></blockquote>Clearly, petitioner knew of the confiscation by the DENR of the lumber delivered by Guadines.&nbsp; His contention that placing quotation marks on the word confiscated shows that he was unsure that the lumber were indeed confiscated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> is flawed.&nbsp; If at all, this information should have made him more circumspect in signing the Inspection Report and Disbursement Voucher.&nbsp; As petitioner had admitted, he signed the Inspection Report in his capacity as internal control representative of the governor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> hence, extra-diligence is required of him in order to maintain and protect the integrity of the transactions that pass through his office.<br><br>During the December 14, 1992 session of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan</span> where the matter of the confiscated lumber was taken up, Guadines admitted that the lumber which she delivered for the repair of the Navotas Bridge was confiscated by the DENR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The facts obtaining in the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Arias v. Sandiganbayan</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Magsuci v. Sandiganbayan</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> are not analogous to this case.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Arias</span>, we ruled that:<br><blockquote>All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations. If a department secretary entertains important visitors, the auditor is not ordinarily expected to call the restaurant about the amount of the bill, question each guest whether he was present at the luncheon, inquire whether the correct amount of food was served, and otherwise <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span> look into the reimbursement voucher's accuracy, propriety, and sufficiency. There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail. Any executive head of even <span style="font-style: italic;">small</span> government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices or departments is even more appalling.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There should be other grounds than the mere signature or approval appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and conviction.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>While in Magsuci, we held that:<br><blockquote>Fairly evident, however, is the fact that the action taken by Magsuci involved the very functions he had to discharge in the performance of his official duties. There has been no intimation at all that he had foreknowledge of any irregularity committed by either or both Engr. Enriquez and Ancla.&nbsp; Petitioner might have indeed been lax and administratively remiss in placing too much reliance on the official reports submitted by his subordinate (Engineer Enriquez), but for conspiracy to exist, it is essential that there must be a conscious design to commit an offense.&nbsp; Conspiracy is not the product of negligence but of intentionality on the part of cohorts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>We agree with the Sandiganbayan that <span style="font-style: italic;">Arias</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Magsuci </span>find no application to the instant case, thus:<br><blockquote>The above defense of Escara cannot exonerate him from criminal liability. It is true that in the cases of Arias vs. Sandiganbayan (180 SCRA 309) and Magsuci vs. Sandiganbayan (240 SCRA 13), the Supreme Court rejected the theory of criminal&nbsp; liability where the head of office, in discharging his official duties, relied in good faith on the acts of his subordinate. The High Tribunal ruled that there should be other grounds than the mere signature or approval appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and conviction. In this case, however, accused Escara had foreknowledge of the irregularity attendant in the delivery of the lumber supplied by Guadines. In his letter (Exhibit "I") dated January 23, 1993 addressed to Engineer&nbsp; Bert Nierva, of the Provincial Engineering Office of Quezon, he acknowledged that the materials intended for the construction of the Navotas Bridge had been confiscated by the DENR officials. Such foreknowledge should have put him on alert and prompted him, at the very least, to make inquiries into the transaction and to verify whether Guadines had already rectified or submitted the proper legal documents to recover the ownership of the confiscated&nbsp; lumber from the DENR. This he did not do. Instead, he immediately signed the Inspection Report (Exhibits "F" and "38-B") and Disbursement Voucher (Exhibits "D" and "11") and looked the other way, thus, ignoring the fact that the lumber he was authorizing payment for had already been confiscated in favor of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>What distinguishes petitioner's case from <span style="font-style: italic;">Arias</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Magsuci</span> is his foreknowledge of the existence of an anomaly.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Arias</span>, the accused auditor was acquitted for lack of evidence that he participated in the scheme to defraud the government.&nbsp; As we ratiocinated in the said case:<br><blockquote>Arias joined the Pasig office on July 19, 1978. The negotiations for the purchase of the property started in 1977. The deed of sale was executed on April 20, 1978. Title was transferred to the Republic on June 8, 1978. In other words, the transaction had already been consummated before his arrival. The pre-audit, incident to payment of the purchase, was conducted in the first week of October, 1978.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arias points out that apart from his signature on the voucher, there is no evidence linking him to the transaction.</span> On the contrary, the other co-accused testified they did not know him personally and none approached him to follow up the payment. [Emphasis supplied]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Magsuci</span>, the acquittal of the accused was predicated in this wise:<br><blockquote>In concluding petitioner's involvement in the conspiracy, the Sandiganbayan could only point to Magsuci's having (1) <span style="font-style: italic;">noted</span> the Accomplishment Report and Certification submitted by Enriquez, (2) <span style="font-style: italic;">signed</span> the disbursement voucher with the usual certification on the lawful incurrence of the expenses to be paid, and (3) <span style="font-style: italic;">co-signed</span> four checks for the payment of P352,217.16 to Ancla. The Sandiganbayan concluded that petitioner would not have thusly acted had he not been a party to the conspiracy.<br><br>Fairly evident, however, is the fact that the action taken by Magsuci involved the very functions he had to discharge in the performance of his official duties. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There has been no intimation at all that he had foreknowledge of any irregularity committed by either or both Engr. Enriquez and Ancla.</span> ...[Emphasis supplied]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>By signing the Inspection Report and Disbursement Voucher No. 001-9302-957 despite prior knowledge that the logs to which they pertained have been confiscated by the DENR, and by his failure to observe the requisite caution required by the circumstances, the petitioner has clearly taken himself out of the ambit of the protective blanket given to public officers by our rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arias</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Magsuci</span>.<br><br>Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3.&nbsp; Corrupt practices by public officers. â In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practice[s] of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">...<br><br></div> <table Â ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(e)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.

There was evident bad faith and manifest partiality when he signed the inspection report and the disbursement voucher because he had foreknowledge that the materials delivered by Guadines have already been confiscated by the DENR, which caused undue injury to the Government and gave unwarranted benefit to Guadines in the amount of P70,924.00.<br><br>As held by the Sandiganbayan:<br><blockquote>Since the lumber delivered by accused Guadines was illegally cut/obtained, it was confiscated by DENR officials.&nbsp; Having been confiscated, ownership over the lumber belonged to the government, hence, accused Guadines had no right to sell the same and receive payment therefor in the amount of P70,924.00, the amount disallowed by the COA.&nbsp; In fact, it was the National Government, or more directly, one of its agencies, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in whose favor the lumber had been confiscated, which had the right to dispose of the same in accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>The penalty for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 is "imprisonment for not less than six years and one month nor more than fifteen years, perpetual disqualification from public office." Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, if the offense is punished by special law, the Court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate penalty, the maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum term shall not be less than the minimum prescribed by the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Hence, the Sandiganbayan was correct in imposing the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from public office.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide, Jr., C.J., Quisumbing, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, J., </span>on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Rollo, pp. 34-73.&nbsp; Penned by Associate Justice Ma.
