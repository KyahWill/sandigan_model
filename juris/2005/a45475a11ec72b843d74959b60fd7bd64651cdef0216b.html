Its motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> having been denied by the appellate court by Resolution dated June 5, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> petitioner once again comes to this Court via petition for review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this time assailing the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Decision on the petition hinges on two issues, to wit: (1) whether the trial court has jurisdiction over the case, it not having furnished the Office of the Solicitor General copy of the orders it issued therein, and (2) whether the City of Lucena properly exercised its police power when it enacted the subject ordinances.<br><br>Petitioner argues that since the trial court failed to serve a copy of its assailed orders upon the Office of the Solicitor General, it never acquired jurisdiction over the case, it citing <b>Section 22, Rule 3 of the Rules which provides:</b><br><blockquote>SEC. 22. <i>Notice to the Solicitor General</i>.—In any action involving the validity of any treaty, law, <u>ordinance</u>, executive order, presidential decree, rules or regulations, <u>the court <b>in its discretion</b>, may require the appearance of the Solicitor General</u> who may be heard in person or through representative duly designated by him. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, petitioner invokes Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 63 which respectively provide:<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Notice on Solicitor General</i>. – In any action which involves the validity of a statute, executive order or regulation, or any other governmental regulation, the <u>Solicitor General shall be notified by the party assailing the same</u> and shall be entitled to be heard upon such question.<br><br>SEC. 4. <i>Local government ordinances</i>. – In any action involving the <u>validity of a local government ordinance</u>, the corresponding prosecutor or attorney of the local government unit involved shall be similarly notified and entitled to be heard. <u>If such ordinance is alleged to be <b>unconstitutional</b>, the Solicitor General shall also be notified and entitled to be heard</u>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>Nowhere, however, is it stated in the above-quoted rules that failure to notify the Solicitor General about the action is a jurisdictional defect.<br><br>In fact, Rule 3, Section 22 gives the courts in any action involving the “<u>validity</u>” of any <u>ordinance</u>, <i>inter alia</i>, “<u>discretion</u>” to notify the Solicitor General.<br><br>Section 4 of Rule 63, which more specifically deals with cases assailing the <i>constitutionality</i>, not just the validity, of a <u>local government ordinance</u>, directs that the Solicitor General “shall <u>also</u> be notified and entitled to be heard.” Who will notify him, Sec. 3 of the same rule provides — it is the party which is assailing the local government’s ordinance.<br><br>More importantly, however, this Court finds that no procedural defect, fatal or otherwise, attended the disposition of the case. For respondent <u>actually served a copy of its petition upon the Office of the Solicitor General on October 1, 1998</u>, two days after it was filed. The Solicitor General has issued a Certification to that effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> There was thus compliance with above-quoted rules.<br><br>Respecting the issue of whether police power was properly exercised when the subject ordinances were enacted: As with the State, the local government may be considered as having properly exercised its police power only if the following requisites are met: (1) the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require the interference of the State, and (2) the means employed are reasonably necessary for the attainment of the object sought to be accomplished and not unduly oppressive upon individuals. Otherwise stated, there must be a concurrence of a <b>lawful subject</b> and <b>lawful method</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>That traffic congestion is a public, not merely a private, concern, cannot be gainsaid. In <i>Calalang v. Williams</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which involved a statute authorizing the Director of Public Works to promulgate rules and regulations to regulate and control traffic on national roads, this Court held:<br><blockquote>In enacting said law, therefore, the National Assembly was prompted by considerations of p<b>ublic convenience and welfare.</b> It was inspired by a desire to relieve congestion of traffic, which is, to say the least, a menace to public safety. Public welfare, then, lies at the bottom of the enactment of said law, and the state in order to promote the general welfare may interfere with personal liberty, with property, and with business and occupations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The questioned ordinances having been enacted with the objective of relieving traffic congestion in the City of Lucena, they involve public interest warranting the interference of the State. The first requisite for the proper exercise of police power is thus present.<br><br>Respondent’s suggestion to have this Court look behind the explicit objective of the ordinances which, to it, was actually to benefit the private interest of petitioner by coercing all bus operators to patronize its terminal does not lie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Lim v. Pacquing</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>. . . [T]his Court cannot look into allegations that PD No. 771 was enacted to benefit a select group which was later given authority to operate the jai-alai under PD No. 810. <u>The examination of legislative motivation is generally prohibited</u>. (Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 29 L. Ed. 2d 438 [1971] per Black, J.) There is, in the first place, absolute lack of evidence to support ADC’s allegation of improper motivation in the issuance of PD No. 771. In the second place, as already averred, this Court cannot go behind the expressed and proclaimed purposes of PD No. 771, which are reasonable and even laudable. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>This leaves for determination the issue of whether the means employed by the Lucena Sangguniang Panlungsod to attain its professed objective were reasonably necessary and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.<br><br>With the aim of localizing the source of traffic congestion in the city to a single location,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the subject ordinances prohibit the operation of all bus and jeepney terminals within Lucena, including those already existing, and allow the operation of only one common terminal located outside the city proper, the franchise for which was granted to petitioner. The common carriers plying routes to and from Lucena City are thus compelled to close down their existing terminals and use the facilities of petitioner.<br><br>In <i>De la Cruz v. Paras</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court declared unconstitutional an ordinance characterized by overbreadth. In that case, the Municipality of Bocaue, Bulacan prohibited the operation of all night clubs, cabarets and dance halls within its jurisdiction for the protection of public morals. Held the Court:<br><blockquote><u>It cannot be said that such a sweeping exercise of a lawmaking power by Bocaue could qualify under the term reasonable. The objective of fostering public morals, a worthy and desirable end can be attained by a measure that does not encompass too wide a field. Certainly the ordinance on its face is characterized by overbreadth. The purpose sought to be achieved could have been attained by reasonable restrictions rather than by an absolute prohibition</u>. The admonition in Salaveria should be heeded: “The Judiciary should not lightly set aside legislative action when there is not a clear invasion of personal or property rights under the guise of police regulation.” It is clear that in the guise of a police regulation, there was in this instance a clear invasion of personal or property rights, personal in the case of those individuals desirous of patronizing those night clubs and property in terms of the investments made and salaries to be earned by those therein employed. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Lupangco v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this Court, in declaring unconstitutional the resolution subject thereof, advanced a similar consideration. That case involved a resolution issued by the Professional Regulation Commission which prohibited examinees from attending review classes and receiving handout materials, tips, and the like three days before the date of examination in order to preserve the integrity and purity of the licensure examinations in accountancy. Besides being unreasonable on its face and violative of academic freedom, the measure was found to be more sweeping than what was necessary, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Needless to say, the enforcement of Resolution No. 105 is not a guarantee that the alleged leakages in the licensure examinations will be eradicated or at least minimized. <u>Making the examinees suffer by depriving them of legitimate means of review or preparation on those last three precious days when they should be refreshing themselves with all that they have learned in the review classes and preparing their mental and psychological make-up for the examination day itself — <b>would be like uprooting the tree to get rid of a rotten branch. What is needed to be done by the respondent is to find out the source of such leakages and stop it right there</b></u><b>.</b> If corrupt officials or personnel should be terminated from their loss, then so be it. Fixers or swindlers should be flushed out. Strict guidelines to be observed by examiners should be set up and if violations are committed, then licenses should be suspended or revoked. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>As in <i>De la Cruz</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and <i>Lupangco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the ordinances assailed herein are characterized by overbreadth. They go beyond what is reasonably necessary to solve the traffic problem. Additionally, since the compulsory use of the terminal operated by petitioner would subject the users thereof to fees, rentals and charges, such measure is unduly oppressive, as correctly found by the appellate court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> What should have been done was to determine exactly where the problem lies and then to stop it right there.<br><blockquote>The true role of Constitutional Law is to <u>effect an equilibrium between authority and liberty</u> so that rights are exercised within the framework of the law and the laws are enacted with due deference to rights. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>A due deference to the rights of the individual thus requires a more careful formulation of solutions to societal problems.<br><br>From the memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> filed before this Court by petitioner, it is gathered that the Sangguniang Panlungsod had identified the cause of traffic congestion to be the indiscriminate loading and unloading of passengers by buses on the streets of the city proper, hence, the conclusion that the terminals contributed to the proliferation of buses obstructing traffic on the city streets. <br><br>Bus terminals <i>per se</i> do not, however, impede or help impede the flow of traffic. How the outright proscription against the existence of all terminals, apart from that franchised to petitioner, can be considered as reasonably necessary to solve the traffic problem, this Court has not been enlightened. If terminals lack adequate space such that bus drivers are compelled to load and unload passengers on the streets instead of inside the terminals, then reasonable specifications for the size of terminals could be instituted, with permits to operate the same denied those which are unable to meet the specifications.<br><br>In the subject ordinances, however, the scope of the proscription against the maintenance of terminals is so broad that even entities which might be able to provide facilities better than the franchised terminal are barred from operating at all.<br><br>Petitioner argues, however, that other solutions for the traffic problem have already been tried but proven ineffective. But the grant of an exclusive franchise to petitioner has not been shown to be the only solution to the problem.<br><br>While the Sangguniang Panlungsod, via Ordinance No. 1557,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> previously directed bus owners and operators to put up their terminals “outside the poblacion of Lucena City,” petitioner informs that said ordinance only resulted in the relocation of terminals to other well-populated barangays, thereby giving rise to traffic congestion in those areas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Assuming that information to be true, the Sangguniang Panlungsod was not without remedy. It could have defined, among other considerations, in a more precise manner, the area of relocation to avoid such consequences.<br><br>As for petitioner’s argument that the challenged ordinances were enacted pursuant to the power of the Sangguniang Panlungsod to “[r]egulate traffic on all streets and bridges; <u>prohibit encroachments or obstacles thereon</u> and, when necessary in the interest of public welfare, authorize the removal of encroachments and illegal constructions in public places”:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Absent any showing, nay allegation, that the terminals are encroaching upon public roads, they are not obstacles. The buses which indiscriminately load and unload passengers on the city streets are. The power then of the Sangguniang Panlungsod to prohibit encroachments and obstacles does not extend to terminals.<br><br>Neither are terminals public nuisances as petitioner argues. For their operation is a legitimate business which, by itself, cannot be said to be injurious to the rights of property, health, or comfort of the community.<br><br>But even assuming that terminals are nuisances due to their alleged indirect effects upon the flow of traffic, at most they are nuisance <i>per accidens, not per se</i>.<br><br>Unless a thing is nuisance <i>per se</i>, however, it may not be abated via an ordinance, without judicial proceedings, as was done in the case at bar.<br><br>In <i>Estate of Gregoria Francisco v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>Respondents can not seek cover under the general welfare clause authorizing the abatement of nuisances without judicial proceedings. <u>That tenet applies to a nuisance per se, or one which affects the immediate safety of persons and property and may be summarily abated under the undefined law of necessity (Monteverde v. Generoso, 52 Phil. 123 [1982]). The storage of copra in the quonset building is a legitimate business. By its nature, it can not be said to be injurious to rights of property, of health or of comfort of the community. If it be a nuisance per accidens it may be so proven in a hearing conducted for that purpose</u>. It is not per se a nuisance warranting its summary abatement without judicial intervention. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Pampanga Bus Co., Inc. v. Municipality of Tarlac</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> where the appellant-municipality similarly argued that the terminal involved therein is a nuisance that may be abated by the Municipal Council via an ordinance, this Court held: “Suffice it to say that in the abatement of nuisances the provisions of the Civil Code (Articles 694-707) must be observed and followed. This appellant failed to do.”<br><br>As for petitioner’s claim that the challenged ordinances have actually been proven effective in easing traffic congestion: Whether an ordinance is effective is an issue different from whether it is reasonably necessary. It is its <u>reasonableness, not its effectiveness</u>, which bears upon its constitutionality. If the constitutionality of a law were measured by its effectiveness, then even tyrannical laws may be justified whenever they happen to be effective.<br><br>The Court is not unaware of the resolutions of various barangays in Lucena City supporting the establishment of a common terminal, and similar expressions of support from the private sector, copies of which were submitted to this Court by petitioner. The weight of popular opinion, however, must be balanced with that of an individual’s rights.<br><blockquote>There is no question that not even the strongest moral conviction or the most urgent public need, subject only to a few notable exceptions, will excuse the bypassing of an individual's rights. It is no exaggeration to say that a person invoking a right guaranteed under Article III of the Constitution is a majority of one even as against the rest of the nation who would deny him that right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby <b>DENIED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Puno, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario</i>, and <i>Garcia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records at 1-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 118-120.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 226-229.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 227.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Records at 55-59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 339.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 328-360.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 358-360.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 384-399.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 467-470.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 18-59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 327.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 548-557.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 560-572.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 622-623.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 9-407 inclusive of Annexes “A” - “Y”.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 498.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>DECS v.
