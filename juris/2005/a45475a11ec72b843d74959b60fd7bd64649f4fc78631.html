Judge Rogelio M. Pizarro:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-style: italic;">[</span>9]</sup><br><blockquote>In administrative proceedings, the complainant bears the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus </span>of establishing, by substantial evidence, the averments of his complaint.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Notatu dignum</span> is the presumption of regularity in the performance of a judge's functions, hence bias, prejudice and even undue interest cannot be presumed, specially weighed against a judge's sacred allegation under oath of office to administer justice without respect to any person and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.</span>&nbsp; In a long line of cases decided by this Court, it was held that bare allegations of bias are not enough in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption that the judge will undertake his noble role to dispense justice according to law and evidence and without fear or favor.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinnott v. Barte,</span> it was further held, mere suspicion that a judge is partial is not enough.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">There should be clear and convincing evidence to prove the charge of bias and partiality.</span> Extrinsic evidence is required to establish bias, bad faith, malice or corrupt purpose, in addition to the palpable error that may be inferred from the decision or order itself.&nbsp; Although the decision may seem so erroneous as to raise doubts concerning a judge's integrity, absent extrinsic evidence, the decision itself would be insufficient to establish a case against the judge. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To merit disciplinary action, the error or mistake must be gross or patent, malicious, deliberate or in bad faith.&nbsp; In the absence of a showing to the contrary, defective or erroneous decision or order is presumed to have been issued in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, aside from complainant's bare allegations, there was no proof presented of the misdemeanor to warrant administrative sanction against respondent judge.&nbsp; She satisfactorily explained that the motion for support filed by complainant remained unresolved because of the motion subsequently filed by defendant David.&nbsp; She explained that she directed the complainant to enroll their children at Philippine Jin Nan Institute, Inc. because it is non-sectarian considering that complainant is a Christian while David is Jew.<br><br>Anent the charges against respondent clerk of court, we adopt the recommendation of the OCA that it was not supported by evidence; hence, it must be dismissed.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Evelyn Ong v.
