The Court of Appeals denied the same in a Resolution dated August 3, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner now comes to this Court raising the following issues:<br><blockquote>PETITIONER SUBMITS THAT THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED ARBITRARILY, WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION IN ISSUING THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS:<br><br>A) RESOLUTION DATED JUNE 9, 2000, DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR CLARIFICATORY JUDGMENT.<br><br>B) RESOLUTION DATED AUGUST 3, 2000, DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>The sole issue is whether or not the Court of Appeals acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in refusing to grant petitioner’s motion for clarificatory judgment.<br><br>It must be noted, as narrated above, that the Decision of the Court of Appeals had already become final and executory at the time that the motion for clarificatory judgment was filed. With regards to final judgments, this Court has pronounced that:<br><blockquote>… nothing is more settled in the law than that when a final judgment becomes executory, it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable. The judgment may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the Court rendering it or by the highest Court of the land. The only recognized exceptions are the correction of clerical errors or the making of so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and, of course, where the judgment is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>As a general rule, therefore, final and executory judgments are immutable and unalterable except under the three exceptions named above: a) clerical errors; b) <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party; and c) void judgments.<br><br>In the present case, petitioner claims the second exception, i.e., that her motion for clarificatory judgment is for the purpose of obtaining a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> amendment of the final and executory Decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br><i>Nunc pro tunc</i> judgments have been defined and characterized by this Court in the following manner:<br><blockquote>The office of a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is to record some act of the court done at a former time which was not then carried into the record, and the power of a court to make such entries is restricted to placing upon the record evidence of judicial action which has been actually taken. <b>It may be used to make the record speak the truth, but not to make it speak what it did not speak but ought to have spoken. If the court has not rendered a judgment that it might or should have rendered, or if it has rendered an imperfect or improper judgment, it has no power to remedy these errors or omissions by ordering the entry <i>nunc pro tunc</i> of a proper judgment. Hence a court in entering a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> has no power to construe what the judgment means, but only to enter of record such judgment as had been formerly rendered, but which had not been entered of record as rendered.</b> In all cases the exercise of the power to enter judgments <i>nunc pro tunc</i> presupposes the actual rendition of a judgment, and a mere right to a judgment will not furnish the basis for such an entry. (15 R. C. L., pp. 622-623.)<br><br>…<br><br><b>The object of a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is not the rendering of a new judgment and the ascertainment and determination of new rights, but is one placing in proper form on the record, the judgment that had been previously rendered, to make it speak the truth, so as to make it show what the judicial action really was, not to correct judicial errors, such as to render a judgment which the court ought to have rendered, in place of the one it did erroneously render, nor to supply nonaction by the court, however erroneous the judgment may have been.</b> (Wilmerding vs. Corbin Banking Co., 28 South., 640, 641; 126 Ala., 268.)<br><br>A <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entry in practice is an entry made now of something which was actually previously done, to have effect as of the former date. <b>Its office is not to supply omitted action by the court, but to supply an omission in the record of action really had, but omitted through inadvertence or mistake.</b> (Perkins vs. Haywood, 31 N. E., 670, 672.)<br><br>…<br><br>It is competent for the court to make an entry <i>nunc pro tunc</i> after the term at which the transaction occurred, even though the rights of third persons may be affected. But entries <i>nunc pro tunc</i> will not be ordered except where this can be done without injustice to either party, <b>and as a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order is to supply on the record something which has actually occurred, it cannot supply omitted action by the court . . . </b>(15 C. J., pp. 972-973.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>From the above characterization of a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> judgment it is clear that the judgment petitioner sought through the motion for clarificatory judgment is outside its scope. Petitioners did not allege that the Court of Appeals actually took judicial action and that such action was not included in the Court of Appeals’ Decision by inadvertence. A <i>nunc pro tunc</i> judgment cannot correct judicial error nor supply nonaction by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Since the judgment sought through the motion for clarificatory judgment is not a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> one, the general rule regarding final and executory decisions applies. In this case, no motion for reconsideration having been filed after the Court of Appeals rendered its decision on June 29, 1995 and an entry of judgment having been made on July 17, 1996, the same became final and executory and, hence, is no longer susceptible to amendment. It, therefore, follows that the Court of Appeals did not act arbitrarily nor with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it issued the aforementioned Resolution denying petitioner’s motion for clarificatory judgment and the Resolution denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Nevertheless, for purposes of guiding the parties in the execution of the aforesaid Decision of the CA, without altering the same, the following should be noted:<br><br>The Court of Appeals pronounced in its Decision that the contract between the parties is an equitable mortgage. Since the contract is characterized as a mortgage, the provisions of the Civil Code governing mortgages apply. Article 2088 of the Civil Code states:<br><blockquote>The creditor cannot appropriate the things given by way of pledge or mortgage, or dispose of them. Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void.<br></blockquote>This Court has interpreted this provision in the following manner:<br><blockquote>The essence of <i>pacto commissorio</i>, which is prohibited by Article 2088 of the Civil Code, is that ownership of the security will pass to the creditor by the mere default of the debtor (Guerrero v. Yñigo, et al., 96 Phil. 37, 41-42; Puig v. Sellner, et al., 45 Phil. 286, 287 – 88) …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>… The only right of a mortgagee in case of non-payment of a debt secured by mortgage would be to foreclose the mortgage and have the encumbered property sold to satisfy the outstanding indebtedness. The mortgagor’s default does not operate to vest in the mortgagee the ownership of the encumbered property, for any such effect is against public policy, as enunciated by the Civil Code …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Applying the principle of <i>pactum commissorium</i> specifically to equitable mortgages, in <i>Montevergin v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court enunciated that the consolidation of ownership in the person of the mortgagee in equity, merely upon failure of the mortgagor in equity to pay the obligation, would amount to a <i>pactum commissorium</i>. The Court further articulated that an action for consolidation of ownership is an inappropriate remedy on the part of the mortgagee in equity. The only proper remedy is to cause the foreclosure of the mortgage in equity. And if the mortgagee in equity desires to obtain title to the mortgaged property, the mortgagee in equity may buy it at the foreclosure sale.<br><br>The private respondents do not appear to have caused the foreclosure of the mortgage much less have they purchased the property at a foreclosure sale. Petitioner, therefore, retains ownership of the subject property. The right of ownership necessarily includes the right to possess, particularly where, as in this case, there appears to have been no availment of the remedy of foreclosure of the mortgage on the ground of default or non-payment of the obligation in question.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is <b>DISMISSED.</b> The parties are directed to proceed upon the basis of the final Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated June 29, 1995, in CA-G.R. CV No. 39025, that the contract in question was an equitable mortgage and not a sale.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See, RTC Decision, CA Rollo, p. 47, and CA Decision, CA Rollo, pp. 77-78.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Penned by Judge Nilo A.
