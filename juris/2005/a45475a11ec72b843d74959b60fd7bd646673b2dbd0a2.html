He further complained that the grant of additional 10% increase was the decision of the PPA BoardCom, and not of the Board of Directors, hence, null and void, for under P.D. No. 857 (the Revised Charter of the PPA), the agency’s corporate powers are vested exclusively in its Board of Directors.<br><br>In fine, Garcia averred that a power vested by law in the PPA Board of Directors cannot be delegated to its BoardCom.<br><br>Cusi thus suspended on January 22, 2002 the implementation of the additional 10% increase for fifteen (15) days or until February 5, 2002 “in the spirit of transparency and to be able to give all concerned more time to air and discuss pertinent issues on the matter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>By letter dated January 30, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> addressed to the PPA, AISLI ventilated its objections to the additional 10% increase, to wit: there was no Board of Directors Resolution authorizing the additional 10% increase to take effect on January 12, 2002; there was no notice of the additional increase given to port users; and there was no public hearing prior to the imposition thereof.<br><br>The PPA thereupon held on February 1, 2002 a meeting which was attended by representatives from AISLI, PSAA and PUC to clarify the issues raised by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>By letter of February 4, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to AISLI General Manager Garcia, the PPA, addressing Garcia’s complaint that there was no Board of Directors Resolution authorizing the additional 10% increase to take effect on January 12, 2002, wrote:<br><blockquote>This increase is covered by Board Resolution No. 1897 passed by the PPA Board of Directors on December 20, 2001. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Said adjustment is part of the deliberations made as early as December 2000 and January 2001</span>. Although the nationwide increase which was effected last 1 February 2001 was formerly confirmed by a Board Resolution, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the second increase, which was limited to Manila (foreign cargoes only) was subject to certain conditions on productivity</span>. Thus, the formal Board resolution [Board of Directors Resolution No. 1897] was adopted on 20 December 2001 when it was discussed by the Board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Respecting Garcia’s complaint about lack of notice to port users of the additional cargo handling rate increase, the PPA, denying the same, advised Garcia in the same letter of February 4, 2002 that after due notice to concerned port users, a public hearing was conducted on November 8, 2000 on account of which the Board of Directors decided to implement the increase in two tranches, the second of which being limited to Manila only, “conditioned on the improved productivity by MICT and South Harbor and which was deliberated only last December 2001 (instead of July as originally intended).”<br><br>On February 6, 2002, the suspension of the implementation of the additional 10% increase was lifted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>AISLI was thus prompted to file a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA for the declaration of nullity of Memorandum Circular No. 47-2001 and illegality of the additional 10% increase on tariff rates for cargo handling based thereon.<br><br>Before the appellate court AISLI insisted that Memorandum Circular 47-2001 was not supported by a proper Board Resolution of the PPA Board of Directors and that there was no public hearing and notice to port users prior to the implementation of the increase.<br><br>PSAA filed a Petition for Intervention raising the same issue raised by AISLI and praying for identical reliefs.<br><br>By Decision of March 31, 2003, the appellate court dismissed the petition, ratiocinating as follows:<br><blockquote>It is quite clear from the minutes [of the BoardCom meeting on January 11, 2001] that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the approved tariff increase was of two tranches, one in February and the other one in July, but this last increase was made subject to the reports on productivity improvement</span>. This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">documentary report showing sufficient productivity to back up the increase slated for July 2001, was submitted on December 2001. Hence it was only on this month, that the PPA Board of Directors passed the said Board Resolution No. 1897 ratifying the implementation of the said additional 10% increase</span>. xxx<br><br>Thus, the Memorandum Circular No. 47-2001 implementing the additional 10% increase in cargo handling tariff rates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was duly ratified or approved by the Board of Directors</span> of PPA, and therefore, valid and effective. <span style="font-style: italic;">The well known rule is that courts cannot undertake to control the discretion of the board of directors about administrative matters as to which they have legitimate power of action</span> (Gamboa vs. Victoriano, 90 SCRA 40).<br><br>On the allegation that public hearing was never conducted, suffice is (sic) to say that <span style="font-style: italic;">res ipsa loquitor</span> (sic). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The minutes of the public hearing (p. 128, rollo) held on November 8, 2000</span> at PDO-Manila Conference Room, 3rd Floor, PDO-Manila Building called for the purpose of deliberating on the request of ATI and ICTSI for tariff increase adjustment, would show that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Julio Garcia and Cora Bautista, respectively the General Manager and Assistant General Manager of petitioner AISLI, and Bobby Lim, Director of intervenor PSAA, attended and actively participated in the discussion of the issues taken up in said hearing</span>. xxx<br><br>But the foregoing discussion is really only for the nonce, for the fact is that “due process” and “notice and hearing” does (sic) not even come into play. <span style="font-style: italic;">As a general rule, notice and hearing, as the fundamental requirements of procedural due process, are essential only when an administrative body exercises its quasi-judicial function.

They thus argue that there was no valid Board of Directors Resolution in support of the January 2002 round of increases as Board Resolution 1897 was merely a reiteration of BoardCom Resolution 2001-761.<br><br>The minutes of the PPA BoardCom meeting held on January 11, 2001 belie petitioners’ stance, however.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">VI. PROPOSED CARGO HANDLING RATE INCREASE</span> - Asian Terminals, Inc. and International Container Terminals Services, Inc. requested for a 32% and 30% rate increase, respectively, for all stevedoring and arrastre charges including special services for containerized and non-containerized cargoes. The Philippine Chamber of Arrastre and Stevedoring Operators (PCASO) also submitted a similar request for a 20.61% increase in their tariff. AISL, on the other hand, informed PPA that the association will only support the request if the productivity at South Harbor and MICT is improved. There were earlier complaints about port inefficiency both at South Harbor and MICT.<br><br>The BoardCom, during its last meeting on 19 December 2000, had agreed in principle to grant an increase in the cargo handling rates nationwide (tentatively 10% in February and another 10% in July). However, the BoardCom asked for more figures on some specific items as well as commitment on the part of ATI and ICTSI to improve their productivity. In this regard, ATI, in its letter to PPA dated 8 January 2001 reported that it has already achieved and will continue to improve its productivity of 20 moves per gross crane hour.<br><br>After due deliberation on the matter, the BoardCom APPROVED the request for an across-the-board increase in the cargo handling tariff, effective 01 February 2001, to wit:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Arrastre&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevedoring<br></div><br>Foreign&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 15%<br><br>Domestic&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 10%<br><br>Director Ordoñez, however, suggested that the approved increase be subject to the condition that the productivity requirement which the Manila contractors’ (sic) have committed (20 moves/gross crane hour) is already in place. Further, by July 1 they will commit a further improvement of productivity rate by no less than 10% or 22 moves/gross crane hour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>As shown above, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the PPA BoardCom approved an increase in cargo handling rates to be implemented in two tranches,</span> the first in February 2001, and the other in July 2001.

For, as above-mentioned, the PPA conducted a public hearing participated in by petitioners, respondents ATI and ICTSI and other port users on November 8, 2000. The highlights of said hearing as recorded in the Minutes thereof reflect so:<br><ol type="1"><li>Mr. Leopoldo F. Bungubung, Port District Manager of PPA PDO-Manila xxx acknowledged the presence of the participants and the company/associations they represent and informed them that the Public Hearing is being conducted due to the request of Asian Terminals, Inc. of South Harbor (ATI) as well as the International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI) of Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) for a tariff adjustment for stevedoring and arrastre charges for containerized and non-containerized cargo for the Port of Manila, because of the increase in LP fuel, wages and depreciation of the peso. As a matter of procedure, he called the proponents to present their proposal and corresponding justification for tariff adjustment.<br><br></li><li>Mr. Manny Guarin, ATI Assistant Vice-President for Corporate Finance, commenced his presentation by giving a brief background on the prevailing, unstable business condition in the country. He stressed that ATI, like other businesses, has been severely affected by rising costs which hampered their operational and financial performance for the past six (6) months. As such, in order to render optimum services as well as not to derail its aim of modernizing the facilities and equipment at the Manila South Harbor, Mr. Guarin stressed that ATI seeks an across the board adjustment in the existing tariff structure by 32%. To justify this, he discussed in detail the impact of the various factors which are the root causes of the cost increment, namely, the continuing peso depreciation, the increases in the prices of oil, increase in cost of power and electricity and the interest expense; which schedules were provided to the attendees. xxx<br><br></li><li>Mr. Leopoldo de la Cruz, ICTSI Controller, presented the ICTSI’s reason for its request for 30% across-the-board tariff increase for stevedoring and arrastre. He zeroed in on the impact of the peso depreciation, xxx the ICTSI’s dollar obligations of $161M which was used for Berth 5 and equipment acquisition, the interest expense of its long term loan of P1.7B, xxx the depreciation computation comparing the depreciation expense account in CY 1999 at $12,000,513 and $12,000,816 for CY 2000. xxx<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr. Julio Garcia, Association of International Shipping Lines (AISL) General Manager commented on the productivity of both service providers</span> which is deteriorating and has no improvement whatsoever. He said that they are willing to contribute in every way they can to address the problem on productivity which is affecting the whole Port of Manila. Regarding the increase, he requested that AISL be given up to the end of the month to submit its position paper. They will support it but maybe not the amount as requested because of the timing of the request. In order for them to evaluate the requested increase in rates, he asked for the copy of the 1999 financial statements.<br></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;">xxx<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>9. Mr. Bobby Lim, Ship Agents’ Association of the Philippines (PSAA) [Director] asked that they be also allowed to submit their position on the tariff adjustment by the end of the month to give them ample time to discuss this among their members and make their evaluation. Unlike the others who were asking for the 1999 audited financial statements, he requested instead for the “year to date (January-September 2000) financial statements confined to ATI’s operations for South Harbor and ICTSI for MICT operations only. Like Mr. Garcia, he also urged the proponents to hold their request for a few months because he foresees that the factors that affect the profitability of ATI and ICTSI are only temporary and this will be resolved soon.<br><br>10. Mr. Sean Perez, ATI Vice President &amp; General Manager of South Harbor General Stevedoring Division, thanked the body for recognizing that the issues earlier presented are part of the economic realities. He stressed that this public hearing was more of looking at the present tariff structure to make an adjustment based on what was presented and not just an issue of wait and see because these factors were the result of several months of economic disturbance ATI had been experiencing. With regards (sic) to the port’s productivity earlier commented by Mr. Garcia, Mr. Perez said this is something they recognize and are taking actions to improve it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br></div>Furthermore, the minutes of the December 19, 2000 meeting of the PPA BoardCom show that petitioners were given the opportunity to ventilate their concerns as regards the proposed increase in cargo handling rates:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AISL informed PPA that the association will support the request only if productivity at MICT and South Harbor is improved.</span> The Port Users Confederation, on the other hand, limited the increase to 25% and to be implemented on a staggered basis.
