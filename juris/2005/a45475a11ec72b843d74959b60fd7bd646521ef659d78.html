				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When love is lost between spouses and the marriage inevitably results in separation, the bitterest tussle is often over the custody of their children.&nbsp; The Court is now tasked to settle the opposing claims of the parents for custody <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> of their child who is less than seven years of age.&nbsp; There being no sufficient proof of any compelling reason to separate the minor from his mother, custody should remain with her.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us are two consolidated petitions.&nbsp; The<span style="font-style: italic;"> first</span> is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Joycelyn Pablo-Gualberto under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the August 30, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 70878.&nbsp; The assailed Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the Petition for Certiorari is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.&nbsp; The assailed Order of May 17, 2002 is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">ANNULLED</span>.&nbsp; The custody of the child is hereby ordered returned to [Crisanto Rafaelito G.

Daisy and x x x Ronnie Nolasco, [Joycelyn’s mother and stepfather, respectively,] read the contents of the documents presented after which they returned the same.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">‘The Court believes that on that day, summons was duly served and this Court acquired jurisdiction over [Joycelyn].<br><br>‘The filing of [Joycelyn’s annulment] case on March 26, 2002 was an after thought, perforce the Motion to [D]ismiss should be denied.<br><br>‘The child subject of this Petition, Crisanto Rafaello P.

Parties are admonished not to use any other agencies of the government like the CIDG to interfere in this case and to harass the parties.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></div></blockquote>In a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> before the CA, Crisanto charged the Regional Trial Court (Branch 260) of Parañaque City with grave abuse of discretion for issuing its aforequoted May 17, 2002 Order.&nbsp; He alleged that this Order superseded, without any factual or legal basis, the still valid and subsisting April 3, 2002 Order awarding him custody <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> of his minor son; and that it violated Section 14 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Partly in Crisanto’s favor, the CA ruled that grave abuse of discretion had been committed by the trial court in reversing the latter court’s previous Order dated April 3, 2002, by issuing the assailed May 17, 2002 Order.&nbsp; The appellate court explained that the only incident to resolve was Joycelyn’s Motion to Dismiss, not the issuance of the earlier Order.&nbsp; According to the CA, the prior Order awarding provisional custody to the father should prevail, not only because it was issued after a hearing, but also because the trial court did not resolve the correct incident in the later Order.<br><br>Nonetheless, the CA stressed that the trial court judge was not precluded from considering and resolving Joycelyn’s Motion to lift the award of custody <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> to Crisanto, as that Motion had yet to be properly considered and ruled upon.&nbsp; However, it directed that the child be turned over to him until the issue was resolved.<br><br>Hence, these Petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In GR No. 154994, Petitioner Joycelyn submits these issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp; Whether or not the Respondent Court of Appeals, when it awarded the custody of the child to the father, violated Art. 213 of the Family Code, which mandates that ‘no child under seven years of age shall be separated from the mother, unless the court finds compelling reasons to order otherwise.’<br><br>“2.&nbsp; Is it Article 213 or Article 211 which applies in this case involving four-year old Rafaello?”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, Crisanto raises the following issues:<br><blockquote>“A.&nbsp; Did Respondent Court commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to or in excess of jurisdiction when, in its August 30, 2002 Decision, it ordered respondent court/Judge ‘to consider, hear and resolve the motion to lift award of custody <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pendente lite</span> of the child to petitioner and x x x denied the motion for reconsideration thereof in its November 27, 2002 Resolution, considering that: (1) there is no such motion ever, then or now pending, with the court a quo; (2) the November 27, 2002 Resolution is unconstitutional; and (3) the April 3, 2002 Order of respondent Judge, the validity of which has been upheld in the August 30, 2002 Decision of the respondent Court, has become final and executory; and<br><br>“B.&nbsp; Ought not the ancillary remedies [o]f habeas corpus, because the whereabouts, physical and mental condition of the illegally detained Minor Rafaello is now unknown to petitioner and preliminary mandatory injunction with urgent prayer for immediate issuance of preliminary [injunction], petitioner having a clear and settled right to custody of Minor Rafaello which has been violated and still is being continuously violated by [petitioner Joycelyn], be granted by this Honorable Court?”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Being interrelated, the procedural challenges and the substantive issues in the two Petitions will be addressed jointly.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>There is merit in the Petition in GR No. 154994, but not in GR No. 156254.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Preliminary Issue:</span><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The Alleged Prematurity</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">of the Petition in GR No. 154994</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"></div><br>Before going into the merits of the present controversy, the Court shall first dispose of a threshold issue.&nbsp; In GR No. 154994, therein Respondent Crisanto contends that the Petition for Review was filed beyond the deadline (October 24, 2002) allowed by the Rules of Court and by this Court.&nbsp; He claims that Registry Bill No. 88 shows that the Petition was sent by speed mail, only on November 4, 2002.&nbsp; Furthermore, he assails the Petition for its prematurity, since his Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the August 30, 2002 CA Decision was still pending before the appellate court.&nbsp; Thus, he argues that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over Joycelyn’s Petition.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Timeliness of the Petition</span><br><br>The manner of filing and service Joycelyn’s Petition by mail is governed by Sections 3 and 7 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, which we quote:<br><blockquote>“SEC. 3.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Manner of filing</span>. – The filing of pleadings, appearances, motions, notices, orders, judgments and all other papers shall be made by presenting the original copies thereof, plainly indicated as such personally to the clerk of court or by sending them by registered mail. xxx In the second case, <span style="font-style: italic;">the date of mailing of motions, pleadings and other papers or payments or deposits, as shown by the post office stamp on the envelope or the registry receipt, shall be considered as the date of their filing, payment, or deposit in court</span>.&nbsp; The envelope shall be attached to the records of the case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>“SEC. 7.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Service by mail</span>. – Service by registered mail shall be made by depositing the copy in the office, in a sealed envelope, plainly addressed to the party or his counsel at his office, if known, otherwise at his residence, if known, with postage fully pre-paid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after ten (10) days if undelivered.&nbsp; If no registry service is available in the locality of either the sender of the addressee, service may be done by ordinary mail. (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The records disclose that Joycelyn received the CA’s August 30, 2002 Decision on September 9, 2002.&nbsp; On September 17, she filed before this Court a Motion for a 30-day extension of time to file a petition for review on certiorari.&nbsp; This Motion was granted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and the deadline was thus extended until October 24, 2002.<br><br>A further perusal of the records reveals that copies of the Petition were sent to this Court and to the parties by registered mail<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> at the Biñan, Laguna Post Office on October 24, 2002.&nbsp; This is the date clearly stamped on the face of the envelope<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and attested to in the Affidavit of Service<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> accompanying the Petition.&nbsp; Petitioner Joycelyn explained that the filing and the service had been made by registered mail due to the “volume of delivery assignments and the lack of a regular messenger.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Petition is, therefore, considered to have been filed on October 24, 2002, its mailing date as shown by the post office stamp on the envelope.&nbsp; The last sentence of Section 3 of Rule 13 of the Rules provides that the date of filing may be shown <span style="font-style: italic;">either</span> by the post office stamp on the envelope <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span> by the registry receipt.&nbsp; Proof of its filing, on the other hand, is shown by the existence of the petition in the record, pursuant to Section 12 of Rule 13.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The postmaster satisfactorily clarifies that Registry Bill No. 88, which shows the date November 2, 2002, merely discloses when the mail matters received by the Biñan Post Office on October 24, 2002, were dispatched or sent to the Central Mail Exchange for distribution to their final destinations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The Registry Bill does not reflect the actual mailing date.&nbsp; Instead, it is the postal Registration Book<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that shows the list of mail matters that have been registered for mailing on a particular day, along with the names of the senders and the addressees.&nbsp; That book shows that Registry Receipt Nos. 2832-A and 2832-B, pertaining to the mailed matters for the Supreme Court, were issued on October 24, 2002.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Prematurity of the Petition</span><br><br>As to the alleged prematurity of the Petition of Joycelyn, Crisanto points out that his Urgent Motion for Partial Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> was still awaiting resolution by the CA when she filed her Petition before this Court on October 24, 2002.&nbsp; The CA ruled on the Motion only on November 27, 2002.<br><br>The records show, however, that the Motion of Crisanto was <span style="font-style: italic;">mailed</span> only on September 12, 2002.&nbsp; Thus, on September 17, 2002, when Joycelyn filed her Motion for Extension of Time to file her Petition for Review, she might have still been unaware that he had moved for a partial reconsideration of the August 20, 2002 CA Decision.&nbsp; Nevertheless, upon being notified of the filing of his Motion, she should have manifested that fact to this Court.<br><br>With the CA’s final denial of Crisanto’s Motion for Reconsideration, Joycelyn’s lapse may be excused in the interest of resolving the substantive issues raised by the parties.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:</span><br style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Grave Abuse of Discretion</span><br></div><br>In GR No. 156254, Crisanto submits that the CA gravely abused its discretion when it ordered the trial court judge to “consider, hear and resolve the motion to lift the award of custody <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>” without any proper motion by Joycelyn and after the April 3, 2002 Order of the trial court had become final and executory.&nbsp; The CA is also charged with grave abuse of discretion for denying his Motion for Partial Reconsideration without stating the reasons for the denial, allegedly in contravention of Section 1 of Rule 36 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The Order to Hear the Motion</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">to Lift the Award of Custody</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Pendente Lite Proper</span><br><br>To begin with, grave abuse of discretion is committed when an act is 1) done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> or 2) executed “whimsically or arbitrarily” in a manner “so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty, or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; What constitutes grave abuse of discretion is such capricious and arbitrary exercise of judgment as that which is equivalent, in the eyes of the law, to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the basis of these criteria, we hold that the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, there can be no question that a court of competent jurisdiction is vested with the authority to resolve even unassigned issues.&nbsp; It can do so when such a step is indispensable or necessary to a just resolution of issues raised in a particular pleading or when the unassigned issues are inextricably linked or germane to those that have been pleaded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; This truism applies with more force when the relief granted has been specifically prayed for, as in this case.<br><br>Explicit in the Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> filed by Joycelyn before the RTC is her ancillary prayer for the court to lift and set aside its April 3, 2002 Order awarding to Crisanto custody <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> of their minor son.&nbsp;
