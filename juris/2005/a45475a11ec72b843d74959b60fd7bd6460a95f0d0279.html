CV No. 35108, dated 24 August 1995 and 31 January 1996, respectively.&nbsp; Said Decision and Resolution reversed and set aside the ruling of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 101, Quezon City which held that the petitioners have fully paid their loan with private respondent Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">THE FACTS</span><br></div><br>The facts, as summed up by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo,</span> are as follows:<br><blockquote>Plaintiffs, which are sister companies, contracted several loans from defendant DBP. As securities for said loans, plaintiffs mortgaged to defendant DBP several parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 136639, 136640, 136641, 134249 and 134252, with a total area of 44,321 square meters and their improvements, and the acrylic, spinning and finishing equipments [sic]. On June 30, 1986, the accounts of plaintiffs were transferred to defendant APT, but the Remedial Management Group of defendant DBP still handled the accounts for defendant APT. In defendant DBP's letter, dated July 17, 1987, to plaintiffs, the latter's indebtedness was pegged at P4,165,756.21, which was later on reduced to P3,984,881.91 per defendant DBP's letter, dated August 6, 1987 (Exhibits C and D). In a letter, dated August 20, 1987, defendant DBP informed plaintiffs that the Central Bank, per their debt-equity swap arrangement, credited to its account P4,165,756.29, which amount was used to pay the remaining balance of plaintiffs, including additional charges thereon, amounting to P4,018,940.67 as of August 12, 1987; that the excess amount of P146,815.62 shall be refunded to plaintiffs by way of credit to the savings account to be set up for plaintiff Pacific Mills, Inc. with defendant DBP; and that the Legal Department of defendant DBP was preparing the necessary deed of cancellation of mortgage, which document would be released after the clearance of plaintiff's accounts with the Transaction Processing department of defendant DBP (Exhibit E). In the letters, dated September 30, 1987 and October 16, 1987, of defendant DBP to plaintiffs, the former reiterated that there existed an excess payment by plaintiffs by virtue of the debt-equity swap arrangement in the amount of P146,815.62, which amount defendant DBP proposed to refund by setting up a savings account (Exhibits A and B, pre-trial order). Thereafter, in the letter, dated October 5, 1987, plaintiffs, among other things, demanded from the latter to return the excess amount of P146,815.62, with interest (Exhibit F). The claim for refund was referred by defendant DBP to the Central Bank for approval (Exhibit G). However, per post-audit of plaintiffs' accounts by the Commission on Audit, there existed an unpaid balance of P4,855,910.67. Defendant DBP informed plaintiffs about the existence of the said balance and demanded immediate payment thereof in the letter, dated January 6, 1988 (Exhibit 2). In the letter, dated March 21, 1988, defendant DBP explained that the balance was discovered after post-audit adjustment of the accounts of plaintiffs preparatory to their final settlement and eventual closure; and that there was a mistake in the previous computation (Exhibit 3). The statement of account of plaintiffs showed that as of August 12, 1987, the outstanding obligations of plaintiffs, after the debt-equity swap arrangement with the Central Bank, was P5,152,916.98, the amount determined after computation of the interests, advances and the payments made by the plaintiffs from 1985 to 1987 (Exhibits 4 and 5). Due to the refusal of defendants to cancel the mortgages on the properties of plaintiffs, the latter instituted the present suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>The case instituted by herein petitioners in the trial court was one for cancellation of mortgages and release of the originals of the owner's duplicate transfer certificates of title. &nbsp;The trial court ruled in favor of herein petitioners in its Decision dated 25 July 1991.&nbsp; Part of the trial court's decision declared:<br><blockquote>. . . [T]he Court finds nothing substantial to defeat its [DBP's] own admission unequivocally stated in Exh. "E"/"1" that indeed plaintiffs have paid in full its total balance obligation with an excess payment even of P146,815.62.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision is reproduced hereunder:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises above considered, finding that plaintiffs have paid in full their last remaining obligation in the amount of P4,018,940.67 as admitted by defendants in their communication as of August 20, 1987, Exhibits "E" and also "1", said defendants are hereby ordered to cancel the Deed of Mortgage constituted on their T.C.T. Nos. 136639, 136640, 136641, 134249 and 134252, and for the defendants to release the said titles to plaintiffs, together with the improvements thereon, namely: acrylic, spinning and finishing equipments.<br><br>Further, the defendants are likewise ordered to reimburse plaintiffs the amount of P146,815.62 which is plaintiff's excess payment with interest of 14% per annum from date plaintiffs made demand therefore.<br><br>Defendants are likewise ordered to pay the attorney's fees of plaintiffs in the amount of P30,000.00, plus the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>The trial court's decision was fundamentally based on the letter dated 20 August 1987 sent by DBP to the petitioners,<span style="font-style: italic;"> viz:</span><br><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; August 20, 1987<br><br>Clover Manufacturing Corporation<br>28 Novaliches, Balintawak<br>Quezon City<br><br>Attention: Mr. Joseph U.

As previously agreed, the excess shall be refunded to you by way of credit to the savings account to be set up for Pacific Mills, Inc. with DBP. Herewith are the application/specimen signature forms and the list of other requirements.<br><br>With regards to the remaining assets of Clover mortgaged with DBP, our Legal Department is now preparing the necessary Deed of Cancellation of Mortgage. This document shall be released after clearance of your account with our Transaction Processing Department.<br><br>Thank you.</blockquote><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 400px;">Very truly yours,<br></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 440px;"><br>(SGD)AMANDA S.

Radio Corporation of the Philippines.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Gonzales,</span> we held in part:<br><blockquote>Revision of accounts that have already been approved may be demanded only in the cases in which the law so permits for justifiable reasons, and as was said in the decision of Pastor v. Nicasio (6 Phil. Rep. 152), such revision will not be permitted unless the plaintiff can show that there was fraud, deceit, error, or mistake in the approval of the accounts.<br><br>The plaintiff is now barred from assailing as false and incorrect the accounts approved by him for the years 1907 to 1910, inasmuch as he made no objection and took no exception to them before their acceptance and approval, nor has he shown that he was deceived for the purpose of obtaining his approval thereof. Even if the accounts were erroneous, they could not now be revised, since the plaintiff, by stating in his receipt that the sum received by him was the liquidated balance of, and full satisfaction for, all the revenues that appertained or might appertain to him, has explicitly and completely waived all right, he might have had to any amounts he may then have failed to collect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Herman,</span> we held:<br><blockquote>. . . [W]henever a party has, by his own declaration, act, or omission, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true, and to act upon such belief, he cannot, in any litigation arising out of such declaration, act, or omission, be permitted to falsify it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>In response to this, private respondent DBP contends that the petitioners did not submit any accounting records to prove full payment of their loans, much more overpayment.&nbsp; It further asserted that the petitioners merely capitalized on the letter from Senior Manager Ms. Amanda S. Guiam dated 20 August 1987 to prove that they have fully paid their loans to DBP.&nbsp; While the authenticity and due execution of aforesaid letter were never an issue, the correctness of its content had been squarely raised by the private respondents DBP and APT in their respective answers for being erroneous and a clear case of mistake in computation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Respondent APT, on the other hand, in its Comment, underscores that nowhere in the petition for review did petitioners point out any particular provision of law that was actually contravened by the Court of Appeals in resolving the issues presented. APT further argues that our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gonzales</span> does not squarely apply in the instant case. <span style="font-style: italic;">Gonzales</span> was anchored on an approved account and on the principle of estoppel.&nbsp; In the instant case, according to APT, there was no final approval of petitioners' account with DBP.&nbsp; The principle of estoppel, therefore, finds no application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Part of the decision of the Court of Appeals declared:<br><blockquote>The lower court ruled that by virtue of this letter defendant DBP is now estopped to claim otherwise and ask for the payment of the alleged balance. However, it is clear from the third paragraph that the cancellation of the mortgages constituted in favor of defendant DBP was subject to the clearance or approval of plaintiffs' accounts by the Transaction Processing Department (TPD). The latter's approval can only be made after verification of the complete payment of the loans by plaintiffs. There was no clearance issued by the TPD since it was found out later on that there was a mistake in the computation of the accounts of plaintiffs. As succinctly explained by defendant DBP in its letter, dated March 21, 1988, the mistake was discovered in the course of the processing of plaintiffs' accounts preparatory to their eventual closure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>We find no compelling reason to reverse the decision of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo,</span> and therefore, the instant petition must fail.<br><br>The reliance of petitioners in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Gonzalez </span>case is misplaced, for, as ingeniously pointed out by the private respondents, it does not squarely apply herein.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Gonzalez,</span> the petitioner approved certain accounts for a period of three (3) years.&nbsp; He made no objection and took no exception to them before their acceptance and approval.&nbsp; He did not show that he was deceived for the purpose of obtaining his approval thereof.<br><br>In the instant case, the letter of DBP dated 20 August 1987, which supposedly declared that the obligations of petitioners have been fully complied with, was corrected by the former after a period of five (5) months only. &nbsp;This five-month period was devoted by DBP in processing all the clearances needed for the closure of petitioners' accounts.&nbsp; It was during this time that the mistake in the computation was discovered during post audit adjustments.&nbsp; A letter dated 06 January 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> was sent by DBP communicating to petitioners about the remaining balance still due from the latter.&nbsp; Another letter dated 21 March 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> was again sent by DBP to petitioners explaining that the mistake was discovered in the course of the processing of petitioners' accounts which was preparatory to their eventual closure.&nbsp; The petitioners were even invited to reconcile the accounts with the Transaction Processing Department (TPD).&nbsp; In addition to all these, the third paragraph of the letter dated 20 August 1987 stated that the account must be cleared first with the TPD.&nbsp; Conspicuously, no clearance was issued by the TPD.&nbsp; This was admitted by the witness for the petitioners, Paulino Lim, during cross-examination, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q: </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The last paragraph thereof which was quoted earlier states that the "legal department is now preparing the necessary Deed of Cancellation of Mortgage", further this document states that "this document shall be released after clearance of your account with our Transaction Processing Department."
