Basilisa had the vehicle insured against third-party liability, with herself as the assured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Basilisa thereafter got married to Felix Lim on July 19, 1995. Her husband drove and used the jitney to transport passengers.<br><br>On October 13, 1995, Arleni Dungaran Koschnicke, Salvador and Basilisa's older sister filed a Complaint, through the Public Attorney's Office, against Basilisa for replevin and damages in the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo City. Arleni alleged that Salvador purchased the engine from the B.S.B. JunRose Auto Parts Corporation in Sta. Cruz, Manila, and had the jitney assembled by the JMC Motors in San Pablo City; that the jitney was to be operated as a passenger jitney and the income therefrom was to be used by Basilisa, their brother Salvador, and their father; she allowed the jitney to be registered under Basilisa's name because she loved and trusted her, but despite demands, she refused to return the jitney to her.<br><br>Arleni prayed that the trial court render judgment after due proceedings, as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed before this Honorable Court:    <ol type="1"><li> That the above-described Jitney be ordered delivered to the plaintiff;<br><br>    </li><li> Ordering the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff the sum of not less than TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED (P12,500.00) PESOS as litigation expenses;<br><br>    </li><li> Ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of NINETY THOUSAND (P90,000.00) as actual damages.<br></li></ol>Plaintiff further prays for such other reliefs and remedies which the Honorable Court may deem it just and proper under the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Appended to the complaint were the sworn statements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of Salvador and Jose de Guia, Production Manager of the JMC Motors.<br><br>Arleni filed an application for replevin, which the trial court denied on October 24, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In her answer to the complaint, Basilisa claimed that she purchased the chassis and engine block with her money, and had the jitney assembled also at her expense. As evidenced by LTO Certificate of Registration No. 22527606, she was the lawful owner of the jitney; hence, Arleni had no cause of action against her. She, thus, prayed that the complaint be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Upon Arleni's motion, the trial court issued a writ of preliminary attachment over the vehicle on April 18, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> However, on August 14, 1997, the trial court ordered the Sheriff to return the jitney to Basilisa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Arleni testified that she had been a resident of Germany since 1970 and had married a German, an engineer by profession, who was employed by Lufthanza Airlines.

She asked her brother Salvador to have the jitney assembled by the JMC Motors in San Pablo City, and gave him P10,000.00 as initial payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Arleni had the jitney registered under the name of Basilisa because she loved and trusted her. She returned to Germany on May 2, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Salvador testified that, on April 17, 1993, he contracted the services of the JMC Motors in San Pablo City to assemble the jitney, including accessories, wiring and upholstery, for P208,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> On December 1, 1993, he made a down payment for the job, for which he was issued Provisional Receipt No. 0037<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> under his name.

JunRose Auto Parts Corporation, with the money Arleni deposited in Basilisa's account with the PNB. He averred that he caused the registration of the vehicle in Basilisa's name because he and Arleni loved and trusted her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Jose de Guia testified that he was the production manager of JMC Motors in San Pablo City from 1992 to 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He corroborated Salvador's testimony, and further declared that he started the assembly of the jitney in December 1993 and finished it in April 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He was in the company of Salvador and Basilisa when the engine for the vehicle was purchased from the JunRose Auto Parts in Antipolo Street, Blumentritt, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He had the vehicle registered under Basilisa's name upon Arleni and Salvador's request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Salvador and his driver, in the company of Basilisa, took delivery of the vehicle after the job was completed, but returned it later for repairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, Basilisa took the vehicle; he then reported the matter to the barangay authorities on February 14, 1995, and had the matter placed in the barangay blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Basilisa testified that she alone purchased the chassis and engine block; through her brother, Salvador, she had the jitney assembled by the JMC Motors where the chassis and engine block were installed, all at her expense. She further testified that Arleni did not give her the US$1,150.00 deposited in her account - the amount was, in fact, withdrawn on the said date. She had money of her own: she was employed for almost three months in 1986 in Brunei and earned P10,000.00 a month;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> her German paramour had also been remitting money to her and her son since 1984, ranging from P5,000.00 to P7,000.00 a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> She had a peso deposit of P100,817.00 as of March 26, 1992 in her account with the PNB Account No. 210-677526-8.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> She had a store in Cainta, Rizal, which she used as an outlet for the sale of rice purchased from the National Food Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Aside from the vehicle subject of the case, she owned a Honda tricycle from which she earned additional income; the tricycle was registered in her name in 1990, under Certificate of Registration No. 03993557.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She purchased a residential lot located in Cupang, Antipolo, Rizal, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 243157<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> issued on June 24, 1993 which she declared for taxation purposes in her name;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> she then caused the construction of three small houses over the lot, which she rented out for P400.00 each a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> She was also engaged in the business of providing electrical services to 89 residential houses, from which she earned P7,000.00 a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On December 27, 1999, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of Arleni.

The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW WHEREOF, the appeal is DENIED and the appealed Decision dated December 27, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 74 of Antipolo City is AFFIRMED with modification. The award of P10,000.00 as moral damages to plaintiff-appellee is hereby deleted.

The CA denied the motion. Thus, Basilisa, now the petitioner, filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> against the respondent, Arleni, insisting that:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS SUSTAINING THE EARLIER DECISION OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT THAT RESPONDENT IS THE TRUE AND REAL OWNER OF THE PASSENGER JEEPNEY THEREBY ORDERING THE PETITIONER TO DELIVER THE SAME TO THE RESPONDENT, <i>ETC.</i>, IS CONTRARY TO EVIDENCE, JURISPRUDENCE AND LAW.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DISMISSING THE PETITION FOR REVIEW AS WELL AS THE PETITIONER'S COUNTERCLAIM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner asserts that the respondent, as the plaintiff in the trial court, was burdened to prove her ownership of the vehicle, and that she failed to do so. The testimonial and documentary evidence adduced by the respondent, besides being inadmissible in evidence, is insufficient to overthrow her documentary evidence showing that she is the registered owner of the vehicle.<br><br>The sole issue in this case is who, as between the petitioner and the respondent, is the lawful owner of the jitney. The resolution of this issue is riveted to the matter of determining whose money was used to buy the jitney engine and chassis, and for its assembly.<br><br>Prefatorily, the rule is that, only questions of facts may be raised in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended. However, the rule allows exceptions, such as in this case where (1) the conclusion is grounded on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (2) the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) there is no citation of specific evidence on which the factual findings are based; (7) the finding of absence of facts is contradicted by the presence of evidence on record; (8) the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; (9) the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; (10) the findings of the CA are beyond the issues of the case; and (11) such findings are contrary to the admissions of both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As in all civil cases, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the material allegations of his complaint. He must rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weakness of the evidence of the defendant.<br><br>In the present case, the respondent (plaintiff in the trial court) failed to adduce preponderant evidence to prove her ownership of the subject jitney.<br><br>Salvador and Jose, the respondent's witnesses, declared that Engine Block bearing No. 4D30-338666 was purchased from B.S.B. JunRose Auto Parts Corporation in Antipolo Street, Blumentritt, Manila. The respondent appended to her complaint, as Annex "H" thereof, a copy of Delivery Receipt No. 29513 to prove her claim that she purchased the said engine. However, she failed to produce the original copy of the said receipt and to corroborate the testimony of Salvador and Jose. The respondent, likewise, failed to adduce any document to show that the chassis of the jitney was purchased from the said corporation. Moreover, she offered no explanation for her failure to produce the original copy of the receipt.<br><br>On the other hand, the petitioner purchased the engine from the JICOR Merchandizing at Grace Park, Caloocan City, on December 14, 1993, as evidenced by Sales Invoice No. 3173.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> She purchased the chassis of the vehicle from the Ever-Built Metal Manufacturing Corporation located at San Roque, San Pablo City, as evidenced by Sales Invoice No. 25343.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Representatives of the LTO examined the chassis and engine, and ascertained the assembler/manufacturer/sales reports, after which it issued Confirmation Certificates on December 9 and December 15, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> respectively. The LTO also issued its Motor Vehicle Inspection Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> relative to the documentation and ownership of the vehicle. Based on these documents, LTO issued Certificate of Registration No. 22527606<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> to and in the name documentation and ownership of the vehicle. Based on these documents, of the petitioner on February 17, 1994.  The petitioner likewise secured an insurance policy against third-party liability over the vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The respondent failed to adduce any documentary evidence to prove her claim that her husband was an engineer employed with Lufthanza Airlines with a monthly salary of 5,400 Deutsch Marks, and that she was engaged in honeybee farming, with a monthly income of 3,000 Deutsch Marks.<br><br>Even PNB Passbook No. 0124107<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which the respondent adduced in evidence to prove that she had deposited US$1,150.00 on April 30, 1993 negates her testimony.

The amount of US$1,150.00 was deposited on June 7, 1993, but was withdrawn on June 17, 1993.<br><br>As gleaned from the evidence of the petitioner, she was financially capable of buying the engine and chassis and paying the cost for the assembly of the jitney.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
