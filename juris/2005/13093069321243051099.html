Meris<br>Chief, Industrial Service Unit<br>Capitol Medical Center<br><br>Dear Dr. Meris:<br><br>Greetings!<br><br>Please be formally advised that the hospital management has decided to <b>abolish CMC’s Industrial Service Unit as of April 30, 1992 in view of the <u>almost extinct demand for direct medical services</u> by the private and semi-government corporations in providing health care for their employees. Such a decision was arrived at, <u>after considering the existing trend of industrial companies allocating their health care requirements to Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or thru a tripartite arrangement with medical insurance carriers and designated hospitals.</u></b><br><br>As a consequence thereof, all positions in the unit will be decommissioned at the same time industrial services [are] deactivated. In that event, you shall be entitled to return to your private practice as a consultant staff of the institution and will become eligible to receive your retirement benefits as a former hospital employee. Miss Jane Telan on the other hand will be transferred back to Nursing Service for reassignment at the CSR.<br><br>We wish to thank you for your long and faithful service to the institution and hope that our partnership in health care delivery to our people will continue throughout the future.

THELMA NAVARETTE-CLEMENTE<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Dr. Meris, doubting the reason behind the management’s decision to close the ISU and believing that the ISU was not in fact abolished as it continued to operate and offer services to the client companies with Dr. Clemente as its head and the notice of closure was a mere ploy for his ouster in view of his refusal to retire despite Dr. Clemente’s previous prodding for him to do so,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> sought his reinstatement but it was unheeded.<br><br>Dr. Meris thus filed on September 7, 1992 a complaint against Capitol and Dr. Clemente for illegal dismissal and reinstatement with claims for backwages, moral and exemplary damages, plus attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finding for Capitol and Dr. Clemente, the Labor Arbiter held that the abolition of the ISU was a valid and lawful exercise of management prerogatives and there was convincing evidence to show that ISU was being operated at a loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The decretal text of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint. Respondents are however ordered to pay complainant all sums due him under the <b>hospital retirement plan</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>On appeal by Dr. Meris, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) modified the Labor Arbiter’s decision. It held that in the exercise of Capitol’s management prerogatives, it had the right to close the ISU even if it was not suffering business losses in light of Article 283 of the Labor Code and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>And the NLRC set aside the Labor Arbiter’s directive for the payment of retirement benefits to Dr. Meris because he did not retire. Instead, it ordered the payment of separation pay as provided under Article 283 as he was discharged due to closure of ISU, to be charged against the retirement fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, Dr. Meris elevated the case to the Court of Appeals via petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which, in the interest of substantial justice, was treated as one for certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Discrediting Capitol’s assertion that the ISU was operating at a loss as the evidence showed a continuous trend of increase in its revenue for three years immediately preceding Dr. Meris’s dismissal on April 30, 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and finding that the ISU’s “Analysis of Income and Expenses” which was prepared long after Dr. Meris’s dismissal, hence, not yet available, on or before April 1992, was tainted with irregular entries, the appellate court held that Capitol’s evidence failed to meet the standard of a sufficient and adequate proof of loss necessary to justify the abolition of the ISU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The appellate court went on to hold that the ISU was not in fact abolished, its operation and management having merely changed hands from Dr. Meris to Dr. Clemente; and that there was a procedural lapse in terminating the services of Dr. Meris, no written notice to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) of the ISU abolition having been made, thereby violating the requirement embodied in Article 283.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The appellate court, concluding that Capitol failed to strictly comply with both procedural and substantive due process, a condition sine qua non for the validity of a case of termination,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> held that Dr. Meris was illegally dismissed. It accordingly reversed the NLRC Resolution and disposed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the assailed resolutions of the NLRC are hereby set aside, and another one entered –<br><br>1 – declaring illegal the dismissal of petitioner as Chief of the Industrial Service Unit of respondent Medical Center;<br><br>2 – ordering respondents to pay petitioner<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) backwages from the date of his separation in April 1992 until this decision has attained finality;<br><br>b) separation pay in lieu of reinstatement computed at the rate of one (1) month salary for every year of service with a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one year;<br><br>c) other benefits due him or their money equivalent;<br><br>d) moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00;<br><br>e) exemplary damages in the sum of P50,000.00; and<br><br>f) attorney’s fees of 10% of the total monetary award payable to petitioner.<br></div><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, the present petition for review assigning to the appellate court the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>. . .

The social justice and protection to labor provisions in the Constitution dictate so.<br><br>Employers are also accorded rights and privileges to assure their self-determination and independence and reasonable return of capital. This mass of privileges comprises the so-called management prerogatives. Although they may be broad and unlimited in scope, the State has the right to determine whether an employer’s privilege is exercised in a manner that complies with the legal requirements and does not offend the protected rights of labor. One of the rights accorded an employer is the right to close an establishment or undertaking.<br><br>The right to close the operation of an establishment or undertaking is explicitly recognized under the Labor Code as one of the authorized causes in terminating employment of workers, the only limitation being that the closure must not be for the purpose of circumventing the provisions on termination of employment embodied in the Labor Code.<br><br><blockquote>ART. 283. Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel. – The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the installation of labor saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or <b>the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking <u>unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title</u></b>, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The phrase “closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking” includes a partial or total closure or cessation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x Ordinarily, the closing of a warehouse facility and the termination of the services of employees there assigned is a matter that is left to the determination of the employer in the good faith exercise of its management prerogatives. The applicable law in such a case is Article 283 of the Labor Code which permits ‘closure or cessation of operation of an establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses,’ which, in our reading includes both the complete cessation of operations and the cessation of only part of a company’s business. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>And the phrase “closures or cessation x x x <u>not due to serious business losses or financial reverses</u>” recognizes the right of the employer to close or cease his business operations or undertaking even if he is not suffering from serious business losses or financial reverses, as long as he pays his employees their termination pay in the amount corresponding to their length of service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>It would indeed be stretching the intent and spirit of the law if a court were to unjustly interfere in management’s prerogative to close or cease its business operations just because said business operation or undertaking is not suffering from any loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As long as the company’s exercise of the same is <b>in good faith to advance its interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of employees under the law or a valid agreement</b>, such exercise will be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Clearly then, the right to close an establishment or undertaking may be justified on grounds other than business losses but it cannot be an unbridled prerogative to suit the whims of the employer.<br><br>The ultimate test of the validity of closure or cessation of establishment or undertaking is that it must be bona fide in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> And the burden of proving such falls upon the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Capitol failed to sufficiently prove its good faith in closing the ISU.<br><br>From the letter of Dr. Clemente to Dr. Meris, it is gathered that the abolition of the ISU was due to the “almost extinct demand for direct medical service by the private and semi-government corporations in providing health care for their employees;” and that such extinct demand was brought about by “the existing trend of industrial companies allocating their health care requirements to Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or thru a tripartite arrangement with medical insurance carriers and designated hospitals.”<br><br>The records of the case, however, fail to impress that there was indeed extinct demand for the medical services rendered by the ISU.
