P100,000.00 as moral damages;<br>b. P50,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br>c. P30,000.00 as attorney's fees; and<br></blockquote><li>Plaintiff Carmelito Villapaz to pay the costs.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.&nbsp; (Underscoring in the original)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals which, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of January 25, 2001, credited his version and accordingly reversed the trial court's decision in this wise:<br><blockquote>Briefly stated, the lower Court gave four reasons for ruling out a loan, namely:&nbsp; (a) the defense of defendants-appellees that they did not go to plaintiff-appellant's place on February 6, 1992, date the check was given to them; (b) defendants-appellees could not have borrowed money on that date because from January to March, 1992, they had an average daily deposit of P700,000 and on February 6, 1992, they had P1,211,400.64 in the bank, hence, they had "surely no reason nor logic" to borrow money from plaintiff-appellant; (c) the alleged loan was not reduced in writing and (d) the check could not be a competent evidence of loan.<br><br>The four-fold reasoning cannot be sustained.&nbsp; They are faulty and do not accord either with law or ordinary conduct of men.&nbsp; For one thing, the first two given reasons partake more of alibi and speculation, hence, deserve scant consideration.&nbsp; For another, the last two miss the applicable provisions of law.<br><br><b>The existence of a contract of loan cannot be denied merely because it is not reduced in writing.</b>&nbsp; Surely, there can be a verbal loan.&nbsp; Contracts are binding between the parties, whether oral or written.&nbsp; The law is explicit that contracts shall be obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present. A loan (simple loan or mutuum) exists when a person receives a loan of money or any other fungible thing and acquires the ownership thereof.&nbsp; He is bound to pay to the creditor the equal amount of the same kind and quality.<br><br>Contracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, maybe in keeping with good faith, usage and law.<br><br><b>The lower Court misplaced its reliance on Article 1358 of the Civil Code providing that to be enforceable, contracts where the amount involved exceed five hundred pesos, must appear in writing.</b>&nbsp; Such requirement, it has been held, is <b>only for convenience</b>, not for validity.&nbsp; It bears emphasis that at the time plaintiff-appellant delivered the crossed-check to defendants-appellees, plaintiff-appellant had no account whatsoever with them.&nbsp; <b>Defendants-appellees' contention that they did not obtain any loan but merely exchanged the latter's check for cash is not borne by any evidence.</b><br><br>Notably, plaintiff-appellant and defendant-appellee Antonio Tan are compadres, one of them being a godfather to the other's son.&nbsp; There is no established enmity between them such that plaintiff-appellant would be motivated to institute an unfounded action in court.&nbsp; Plaintiff-appellant's sole purpose was to be paid back the loan he extended to defendants-appellees.&nbsp; Thus, a pertinent portion of his testimony on cross-examination discloses:<br><blockquote>ATTY. TAN (On Cross Examination): <br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Now, aside from this check that you issued, did you let the defendant sign a cash voucher?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>A:</b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b> I did not require him any cash voucher or any written document because as I said</b> <u>we are close friends and I trusted</u> him so I issued a check in his name Tony Tan.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">You said that the spouses Tan were in need of money on February 6, 1992.&nbsp; Why did you have to issue a cross-check?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><u>I issued a cross-check in order to be sure that he received the money from me so that he could not deny that he did not receive.&nbsp; (TSN of Villapaz dtd 7/25/95, p. 21)</u></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Apart from their self-serving testimonies, there is no evidence or proof that defendants-appellees actually delivered to plaintiff-appellant the cash amount of P250,000.00 in exchange for the check.&nbsp; Defendant-appellee Tan testified that he records his transactions if it involves a huge cash amount.&nbsp; But surprisingly in this case, he did not follow his usual practice.<br><blockquote>ATTY. CARPENTERO (On Cross-Examination): <br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">x x x&nbsp;

(TSN of Tan dtd 5/9/96, pp. 12-13.</u></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Plaintiff-appellant has a checking account with PBCom Bank.&nbsp; This is located within walking distance (300 meters) from defendants-appellees' store.&nbsp; <b>If plaintiff-appellant was in dire need of money, he could have personally withdrawn said money from his own account, since it was sufficiently funded.</b>&nbsp; Defendant-appellee Antonio Tan himself testified that plaintiff-appellant's check was sufficiently funded.<br><br>It is well-nigh unlikely that the wife who was supposed to have delivered the money on such a short notice, produced, prepared and counted the money at home from Obrero, Davao City, then delivered it to plaintiff-appellant who was in the Golden Harvest Store at Sta Ana Avenue, Davao City.&nbsp; In contrast, <b>PBCom Bank where plaintiff-appellant has his account is in the same vicinity of the store of Golden Harvest</b>.<br><br>Certainly, <b>by way of exception to the general rule, the erroneous inferences in the factual finding of the trial Court cannot bind the appellate courts.</b><br><br>The trial Court placed much emphasis on the daily and time deposit accounts of defendants-appellees.&nbsp; It is immaterial whether or not one is financially capable.&nbsp; A pauper may borrow money for survival; a prince may incur a loan for expansion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied; underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>Thus, the Court of Appeals disposed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Defendants-appellees are ordered to pay plaintiff-appellant the sum of P250,000.00 with 12% interest per annum from judicial demand or filing of the complaint in Court until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal by petitioners anchored on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals <u>erred in concluding that the transaction in dispute was a contract of loan</u> and not a mere matter of check encashment as found by the trial court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>The Honorable Court likewise <u>erred in reasoning that the trial court placed much emphasis on the daily and time deposits of herein petitioners</u> to determine their financial capability.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>The Honorable Court <u>failed to consider the wanton, reckless manner of respondent in attempting to enforce an obligation that does not even exist,</u> thus justifying the award for moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees and costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners maintain that they did not secure a loan from respondent, insisting that they encashed in Davao City respondent's February 6, 1992 crossed check; in the ordinary course of business, prudence dictates that a contract of loan must be in writing as in fact the New Civil Code provides that to be enforceable "contracts where the amount involved exceed[s] P500.00 must appear in writing even a private one,"&nbsp; hence, respondent's "self-serving" claim does not suffice to prove the existence of a loan; respondent's allegation that no memorandum in writing of the transaction was executed because he and they are <span style="font-style: italic;">"</span><i>kumpadres"</i> does not inspire belief for respondent, being a businessman himself, was with more reason expected to be more prudent; and the mere encashment of the check is not a contractual transaction such as a sale or a loan which ordinarily requires a receipt and that explains why they did not issue a receipt when they encashed the check of respondent.<br><br>Petitioners add that they could not have gone to Malita on February 6, 1992, as claimed by respondent, to obtain the alleged loan represented by the check because February 6, 1992 was the opening for business in Davao City of Golden Harvest of which petitioner Antonio Tan is treasurer and in-charge of the bodega, during which opening guests and well-wishers including respondent were entertained.<br><br>Petitioners furthermore maintain that they were financially stable on February 6, 1992 as shown by the entries of their bank passbook,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> hence, there was no reason for them to go to a distant place like Malita to borrow money.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>By petitioner Antonio Tan's account, respondent arrived at the Golden Harvest place of business at Davao City on February 6, 1992 at about 10:30 in the morning<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and left before noon of the same day;&nbsp; respondent, however, returned to Golden Harvest shortly before 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day upon which he informed him (petitioner Antonio Tan) that he needed to bring cash to Malita in the amount of P250,000.00 but "time was running out and . . . he was so busy that was why he requested [him] to accommodate (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) the said amount at 3:00 p.m."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Still by petitioner Antonio Tan's account, he thereupon inquire by telephone from his wife who was at their house whether she had P250,000.00 cash and as his wife replied she had, he asked her to bring the cash, as she did, to the Golden Harvest where she gave the amount of P250,000.00 to him (petitioner Antonio Tan); in the meantime, as respondent had left for a while but not before leaving the check, he (petitioner Antonio Tan) kept the P250,000.00 cash and gave the check to his wife who had it deposited on the <u>same afternoon</u> to his account at PBCom Monteverde branch after he received clearance from the bank manager, who knows him (petitioner Antonio Tan) very well, that respondent's account at same branch of the bank was funded and the check could be deposited and credited to his (petitioner Antonio Tan's) account that same afternoon; and when later that same afternoon respondent returned to the Golden Harvest, he turned over to him the P250,000.00 cash.<br><br>Petitioner Antonio Tan's foregoing tale hardly inspires credence.&nbsp; For it is contrary to common experience. If indeed respondent, who came all the way from Malita to Davao City, arriving at petitioner Antonio Tan's workplace at Golden Harvest at 10:30 in the morning, needed cash of&nbsp; P250,000.00, and the drawee bank PBCom Davao City, Monteverde branch where respondent maintained a current account could even be reached by foot from the Golden Harvest in just a few minutes (albeit by petitioner Antonio Tan's own information respondent brought his truck with him),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> it being about 300 meters away,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> respondent could just have gone there and drew cash from his current account <i>via </i>over the counter transaction.&nbsp; After all, his account had sufficient funds. In other words, he did not have to encash his check from petitioners.<br><br>Even assuming that, as claimed by petitioner Antonio Tan,&nbsp; at the time respondent needed to have his check encashed, it was already close to 3:00 oï¿½clock in the afternoon, why could not have PBCom Monteverde branch also accommodated him and allow him to encash his check that same time when he, like petitioners, was also a client-depositor and the bank was still open for business?<br><br>Petitioners' version was thus correctly denied credit by the appellate court.<br><br>That apart from the check no written proof of the grant of the loan was executed was credibly explained by respondent when he declared that petitioners' son being his godson, he, out of trust and respect, believed that the crossed check sufficed to prove their transaction.<br><br>As for petitioners' reliance on Art. 1358<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the Civil Code, the same is misplaced for the requirement that contracts where the amount involved exceeds P500.00 must appear in writing is only for convenience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>At all events, a check, the entries of which are no doubt in writing, could prove a loan transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>That petitioner Antonio Tan had, on February 6, 1992, an outstanding balance of more than P950,000.00 in his account at PBCom Monteverde branch where he was later to deposit respondent's check did not rule out petitioners' securing a loan.&nbsp; It is pure naivete to believe that if a businessman has such an outstanding balance in his bank account, he would have no need to borrow a lesser amount.<br><br>In fine, as petitioners' side of the case is incredible as it is inconsistent with the principles by which men similarly situated are governed, whereas respondent's claim that the proceeds of the check, which were admittedly received by petitioners, represented a loan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> extended to petitioner Antonio Tan is credible, the preponderance of evidence inclines on respondent.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Corona, </i>and <i>Garcia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 85-99.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Records at 70-73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 5-18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Records at 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exhibit "B", <i>Id</i>. at 48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibits "B-3" and "B-4", <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, May&nbsp; 9, 1996 at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Records at 1-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 9-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 11-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 70-73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 85-99.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 92-98.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 98.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Exh.
