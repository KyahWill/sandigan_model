The failure to deny the genuineness and due execution of an actionable document does not preclude a party from arguing against it by evidence of fraud, mistake, compromise, payment, statute of limitations, estoppel, and want of consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On the merits, this Court rules in petitioners’ favor.<br><br>It is a basic rule in evidence that the burden of proof lies on the party who makes the allegations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <i>– ei incumbit probatio, qui dicit, non qui negat; cum per rerum naturam factum negantis probatio nulla sit</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> If he claims a right granted by law, he must prove it by competent evidence, relying on the strength of his own evidence and not upon the weakness of that of his opponent.<br><br>More specifically, allegations of a defect in or lack of valid consent to a contract by reason of fraud or undue influence are never presumed but must be established not by mere preponderance of evidence but by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> For the circumstances evidencing fraud and misrepresentation are as varied as the people who perpetrate it in each case, assuming different shapes and forms and may be committed in as many different ways.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it was incumbent on the plaintiff-herein respondent Villaner to prove that he was deceived into executing the Deed of Absolute Sale. Except for his bare allegation that the transaction was one of lease, he failed to adduce evidence in support thereof. His conjecture that “perhaps those copies of the deed of sale were placed by Mr. Cadalin under the documents which I signed the contract of lease,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> must fail, for facts not conjectures decide cases.<br><br>Attempting to seek corroboration of his account, Villaner presented Atty. Vicente Real who notarized the document. While on direct examination, Atty. Real virtually corroborated Villaner’s claim that he did not bring the document to him for notarization,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> on cross-examination, Atty. Real conceded that it was impossible to remember every person who would ask him to notarize documents:<br><blockquote><blockquote> Q:<b> And in the course of your notarization, can you remember each and every face that come (<i>sic</i>) to you for notarization?</b><br></blockquote>A: <b>No, it is impossible.</b><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Q:<b> In the case of Villaner Acabal which you have his document notarized (sic) in 1990, <u>can you remember his face when he came to you?</u></b><br></div><br>A:<u><b> No.</b></u><br><blockquote> Q: <b>And can you also say, if a person who came to you having a document to be notarized and if he will appear again after a month, can you remember whether he was the one who came to you?</b><br><br>A: <b>Not so much because everyday <u>there are many people who appear with documents to be notarized,</u> </b> Q: <b>So, it is safe to say that if Villaner Acabal came to you on April 25 or rather April 16, 1990 andhave (sic) his document notarized if he comes back in, say May 25, can you still remember if he was the one who came to you?</b><br><br>A:<b><u> I cannot be sure</u> but at least, there are times I can remember persons because he seems to be close to me already.</b><br></blockquote><blockquote> Q: Is this Villaner close to you? <b><br><br></b>A: Because he has been frequenting the house/asking for a copy of the document. </blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Q: <span style="font-weight: bold;">So, he became close to you after you notarized the document?</span><br></div><br>A: <b>Yes</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On Villaner’s claim that two women employees of Judge Villegas signed as witnesses to the deed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> but that the signatures appearing thereon are not those of said witnesses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the same must be discredited in light of his unexplained failure to present such alleged women employee-witnesses.<br><br>In another vein, Villaner zeroes in on the purchase price of the property — P10,000.00 — which to him was unusually low if the transaction were one of sale. To substantiate his claim, Villaner presented Tax Declarations covering the property for the years 1971,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> 1974,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> 1977,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> 1980,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> 1983,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> 1985,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as well as a Declaration of Real Property executed in 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>It bears noting, however, that Villaner failed to present evidence on the fair market value of the property as of April 19, 1990, the date of execution of the disputed deed. Absent any evidence of the fair market value of a land as of the time of its sale, it cannot be concluded that the price at which it was sold was inadequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Inadequacy of price must be proven because mere speculation or conjecture has no place in our judicial system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Victor Ragay, who was appointed by the trial court to conduct an ocular inspection<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the property and to investigate matters relative to the case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> gave an instructive report dated December 3, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the pertinent portions of which are hereby reproduced verbatim:<br><blockquote> a) Only three (3) to four (4) hectares of the eighteen (18) were planted to sugar cane, the rest was never cultivated;<br><br>b) the soil is reddish and somewhat sandy in composition;<br><br>c) the soil contains so much limestones (rocks consisting mainly of calcium carbonate);<br><br>d) no part of the land in question is plain or flat, contrary to claim of the plaintiff that almost 10 hectares of the land in question is plain or flat;<br><br>e) some areas, eastward of and adjacent of the land in question (mistakenly to be owned by the defendant Nicolas) were planted to sugar cane by the owners – Kadusales;<br><br>f) the road going to the land in question (as claimed to be the road) is no longer passable because it has been abandoned and not maintained by anyone, thus it makes everything impossible for anybody to get and haul the sugar cane from the area;<br><br>g) the Commissioner has discovered some stockpiles of abandoned harvested sugar canes left to rot, along the side of the road, undelivered to the milling site because of the difficulty in bringing up trucks to the scene of the harvest;<br><br>h) the sugarcanes presently planted on the land in question at the time of the ocular inspection were three (3) feet in height and their structural built was thin or lean;<br><br>i) Most of the part of the 18 hectares is not planted or cultivated because the same is too rocky and not suitable for planting to sugarcane.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </blockquote> Additionally, Ragay reported that one Anatolio Cabusog recently purchased a 6-hectare property adjoining that of the subject property for only P1,600.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> or P266.67 per hectare. Given that, had the 18-hectare subject property been sold at about the same time, it would have fetched the amount of P4,800.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> hence, the P10,000.00 purchase price appearing in the questioned April 19, 1990 document is more than reasonable.<br><br>Even, however, on the assumption that the price of P10,000.00 was below the fair market value of the property in 1990, mere inadequacy of the price per se will not rule out the transaction as one of sale. For the price must be<b> grossly </b>inadequate or shocking to the conscience such that the mind revolts at it and such that a reasonable man would neither directly nor indirectly be likely to consent to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Still in another vein, Villaner submits that Leonardo’s transfer of the property to Nicolas in a span of one month for a profit of P30,000.00 conclusively reflects Leonardo’s fraudulent intent. This submission is a <i>non sequitur.</i><br><br>As for Villaner’s argument that the sale of the property to Leonardo and the subsequent sale thereof to Nicolas are void for being violative of the retention limits imposed by Republic Act No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the same fails.&nbsp; The pertinent provisions of said law read:<br><br>SECTION 6.<i> Retention Limits</i>. – Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person may retain, directly or indirectly, any public or agricultural land, the size of which may vary according to factors governing a viable family-sized farm, such as commodity produced, terrain, infrastructure, and soil fertility as determined by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) created hereunder, <u><b>but in no case shall retention by the landowner exceed five (5) hectares</b></u>.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>As the above-quoted provisions of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law show, only those private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture are covered by it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As priorly related, Victor Ragay, who was appointed by the trial court to conduct an ocular inspection of the property, observed in his report that only three (3) to four (4) hectares were planted with sugarcane while the rest of the property was not suitable for planting as the soil was full of limestone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> He also remarked that the sugarcanes were only 3 feet in height and very lean,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> whereas sugarcanes usually grow to a height of 3 to 6 meters (about 8 to 20 feet) and have stems 2 to 5 centimeters (1-2 inches) thick.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>It is thus gathered that the property was not suitable for agricultural purposes. In any event, since the area devoted to the planting of sugarcane, hence, suitable for agricultural purposes, comprises only 4 hectares at the most, it is less than the maximum retention limit prescribed by law. There was then no violation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.<br><br>Even assuming that the disposition of the property by Villaner was contrary to law, he would still have no remedy under the law as he and Leonardo were in pari delicto, hence, he is not entitled to afirmative relief – one who seeks equity and justice must come to court with clean hands.<i> In pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b>The proposition is universal that no action arises, in equity or at law, <u>from an illegal contract;</u> no suit can be maintained for its specific performance, or <u>to recover the property agreed to be sold or delivered,</u> or the money agreed to be paid, or damages for its violation</b>. The rule has sometimes been laid down as though it were equally universal, that where the parties are in pari delicto, no affirmative relief of any kind will be given to one against the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>The principle of <i>pari delicto</i> is grounded on two premises: first, that courts should not lend their good offices to mediating disputes among wrongdoers;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and second, that denying judicial relief to an admitted wrongdoer is an effective means of deterring illegality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This doctrine of ancient vintage is not a principle of justice but one of policy as articulated in 1775 by Lord <i>Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The objection, that a contract is immoral or illegal as between the plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice, as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may so say. The principle of public policy is this; <i>ex dolo malo non oritur actio.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise <i>ex turpi causa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and the defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both are equally in fault <i>potior est conditio defendentis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Thus, to serve as both a sanction and as a deterrent, the law will not aid either party to an illegal agreement and will leave them where it finds them.<br><br>The principle of <i>pari delicto,</i> however, is not absolute, admitting an exception under Article 1416 of the Civil Code.<br><br>ART. 1416. When the agreement is not illegal per se but is merely prohibited, and the prohibition by the law is designed for the protection of the plaintiff, he may, if public policy is thereby enhanced, recover what he has paid or delivered.<br><br>Under this article, recovery for what has been paid or delivered pursuant to an inexistent contract is allowed only when the following requisites are met: (1) the contract is not illegal per se but merely prohibited; (2) the prohibition is for the protection of the plaintiffs; and (3) if public policy is enhanced thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> The exception is unavailing in the instant case, however, since the prohibition is clearly not for the protection of the plaintiff-landowner but for the beneficiary farmers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In fine, Villaner is estopped from assailing and annulling his own deliberate acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>More. Villaner cannot feign ignorance of the law, nor claim that he acted in good faith, let alone assert that he is less guilty than Leonardo. Under Article 3 of the Civil Code, “ignorance of the law excuses no one from compliance therewith.”<br><br>And now, Villaner’s co-heirs’ claim that as co-owners of the property, the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Villaner in favor of Leonardo does not bind them as they did not consent to such an undertaking. There is no question that the property is conjugal. Article 160 of the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> provides:<br><br>ART. 160. All property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership, unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The presumption, this Court has held, applies to all properties acquired during marriage. For the presumption to be invoked, therefore, the property must be shown to have been acquired during the marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the property was acquired on July 6, 1971 during Villaner’s marriage with Justiniana Lipajan. It cannot be seriously contended that simply because the tax declarations covering the property was solely in the name of Villaner it is his personal and exclusive property.<br><br>In <i>Bucoy v. Paulino</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> and <i>Mendoza v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> which both apply by analogy, this Court held that registration alone of the properties in the name of the husband does not destroy the conjugal nature of the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> What is material is the time when the land was acquired by Villaner, and that was during the lawful existence of his marriage to Justiniana.<br><br>Since the property was acquired during the existence of the marriage of Villaner and Justiniana, the presumption under Article 160 of the Civil Code is that it is the couple’s conjugal property. The burden is on petitioners then to prove that it is not. This they failed to do.<br><br>The property being conjugal, upon the death of Justiniana Lipajan, the conjugal partnership was terminated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> With the dissolution of the conjugal partnership, Villaner’s interest in the conjugal partnership became actual and vested with respect to an undivided one-half portion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Justiniana's rights to the other half, in turn, vested upon her death to her heirs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> including Villaner who is entitled to the same share as that of each of their eight legitimate children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> As a result then of the death of Justiniana, a regime of co-ownership arose between Villaner and his co-heirs in relation to the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>With respect to Justiniana’s one-half share in the conjugal partnership which her heirs inherited, applying the provisions on the law of succession, her eight children and Villaner each receives one-ninth (1/9) thereof. Having inherited one-ninth (1/9) of his wife’s share in the conjugal partnership or one eighteenth (1/18)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> of the entire conjugal partnership and is himself already the owner of one half (1/2) or nine-eighteenths (9/18), Villaner’s total interest amounts to ten-eighteenths (10/18) or five-ninths (5/9).<br><br>While Villaner owns five-ninths (5/9) of the disputed property, he could not claim title to any definite portion of the community property until its actual partition by agreement or judicial decree. Prior to partition, all that he has is an ideal or abstract quota or proportionate share in the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Villaner, however, as a co-owner of the property has the right to sell his undivided share thereof. The Civil Code provides so:<br><br>ART. 493. Each co-owner shall have the full ownership of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may therefore alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved. But the effect of the alienation or the mortgage, with respect to the co-owners, shall be limited to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership.<br><br>Thus, every co-owner has absolute ownership of his undivided interest in the co-owned property and is free to alienate, assign or mortgage his interest except as to purely personal rights. While a co-owner has the right to freely sell and dispose of his undivided interest, nevertheless, as a co-owner, he cannot alienate the shares of his other co-owners – <i>nemo dat qui non habet.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Villaner, however, sold the entire property without obtaining the consent of the other co-owners. Following the well-established principle that the binding force of a contract must be recognized as far as it is legally possible to do so – <i>quando res non valet ut ago, valeat quantum valere potest</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> – the disposition affects only Villaner’s share pro indiviso, and the transferee gets only what corresponds to his grantor’s share in the partition of the property owned in common.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>As early as 1923, this Court has ruled that even if a co-owner sells the whole property as his, the sale will affect only his own share but not those of the other co-owners who did not consent to the sale. This is because under the aforementioned codal provision, the sale or other disposition affects only his undivided share and the transferee gets only what would correspond to this grantor in the partition of the thing owned in common. Consequently, by virtue of the sales made by Rosalia and Gaudencio Bailon which are valid with respect to their proportionate shares, and the subsequent transfers which culminated in the sale to private respondent Celestino Afable, the said Afable thereby became a co-owner of the disputed parcel of land as correctly held by the lower court since the sales produced the effect of substituting the buyers in the enjoyment thereof.<br><br>From the foregoing, it may be deduced that since a co-owner is entitled to sell his undivided share, a sale of the entire property by one co-owner without the consent of the other co-owners is not null and void. However, only the rights of the co-owner-seller are transferred., thereby making the buyer a co-owner of the property.<br><br><i>The proper action in cases like this is not for the nullification of the sale or the recovery of possession of the thing owned in common from the third person who substituted the co-owner or co-owners who alienated their shares, but the DIVISION of the common property as if it continued to remain in the possession of the co-owners who possessed and administered it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></i><br><br>Thus, it is now settled that the appropriate recourse of co-owners in cases where their consent were not secured in a sale of the entire property as well as in a sale merely of the undivided shares of some of the co-owners is an action for PARTITION under Rule 69 of the Revised Rules of Court. Neither recovery of possession nor restitution can be granted since the defendant buyers are legitimate proprietors and possessors in joint ownership of the common property claimed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Italics in the original; citations omitted; underscoring supplied)<br><br>This Court is not unmindful of its ruling in <u><i>Cruz v.

Article 493 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><center> x&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<br><br></center>Unfortunately for private respondents, however, the property was registered in TCT No. 43100 solely in the name of “Gertrudes Isidro, widow.” Where a parcel of land, forming part of the undistributed properties of the dissolved conjugal partnership of gains, is sold by a widow to a purchaser who merely relied on the face of the certificate of title thereto, issued solely in the name of the widow, the purchaser acquires a valid title to the land even as against the heirs of the deceased spouse. The rationale for this rule is that “a person dealing with registered land is not required to go behind the register to determine the condition of the property. He is only charged with notice of the burdens on the property which are noted on the face of the register or the certificate of title. To require him to do more is to defeat one of the primary objects of the Torrens system.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br><br>Cruz, however, is not applicable for the simple reason that in the case at bar the property in dispute is unregistered.

In that way the public secures the benefit of a rigid adherence to the law.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> 1 Cowp. 341 (1775).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Out of fraud no action arises; fraud never gives a right of action.

The primordial aim of this prohibition is to preserve and keep in the family of the homesteader the piece of land that the State had gratuitously given. Thus, in <i>Santos v. Roman Catholic Church of Midsayap, et al.</i> (94 Phil. 405, 411 [1954]) this Court held:<br><br>The case under consideration comes within the exception above adverted to. Here appellee desires to nullify a transaction which was done in violation of the law. Ordinarily the principle of <i>pari delicto</i> would apply to her because her predecessor-in-interest has carried out the sale with the presumed knowledge of its illegality, but because the subject of the transaction is a piece of public land, public policy requires that she, as heir, be not prevented from re-acquiring it because it was given by law to her family for her home and cultivation. This is the policy on which our homestead law is predicated. This right cannot be waived. “It is not within the competence of any citizen to barter away what public policy by law seeks to preserve.” We are, therefore, constrained to hold that appellee can maintain the present action it being in furtherance of this fundamental aim of our homestead law.

Article 1623 provides:<br><br><blockquote> ART. 1623. The right of legal pre-emption or redemption shall not be exercised except within thirty days from the notice in writing by the prospective vendor, or by the vendor, as the case may be. The deed of sale shall not be recorded in the Registry of Property, unless accompanied by an affidavit of the vendor that he has given written notice thereof to all possible redemptioners.<br><br>The right of redemption of co-owners excludes that of adjoining owners.<br><br>Under Article 1623, when a vendor sells real property, he must notify in writing his co-owners who may redeem the same within thirty (30) days from notice. The general rule is that written notice of the sale to all possible redemptioners is indispensable. The 30 day period which is a condition precedent to the exercise of the right of legal redemption is counted from the written notice. However, in <i>Alonzo v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i> (150 SCRA 259), this Court held that as an exception to the general rule the co-heirs who lived with the vendors in the same lot are deemed to have received actual notice of the sale. Alonzo is applicable in this case since the co-heirs are deemed to have received actual notice of the sale since they live in the same house as the vendor. Hence, they may no longer exercise their right of redemption. </blockquote> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><i> Bailon-Casilao v.
