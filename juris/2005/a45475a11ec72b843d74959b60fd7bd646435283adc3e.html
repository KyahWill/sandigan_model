However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third-party defendant failed to make the necessary arrangement for the payment of Atty. Suelto's attorney's fees</span> as a consequence of which third-party plaintiffs were unnecessarily haled to court by Atty.

As for the addition by petitioner of a sentence to paragraph 5(h) bearing on the Road Right-of-Way provision, the trial court held:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The clause</span> "x x x exact location of the Road Right of Way which should be incorporated in an affidavit of confirmation thereof to be executed by the parties therein and/or their duly authorized representatives and which should be accordingly registered in the involved certificates of title in the office of the Register of Deeds by and at the expense of the FIRST PARTY", <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which was added on by the plaintiff to the MOA is but an <span style="font-weight: bold;">amplification</span> of the first clause in the paragraph, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">may even be dispensed with</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.&nbsp;</span> As a matter of fact, the Memorandum of Agreement (Exh. 6) which was already signed by the SISONS when presented to SUELTO had this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">last sentence in its paragraph 5(h)</span>: "The delineation shall include the Technical Description of the road register (sic) with the Register of Deeds" which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">practically encompasses the idea suggested in the revision made by the plaintiff</span>.&nbsp; If the delineation shall include the technical description then the exact location of the road will definitely be identified.&nbsp; This delineation will definitely be in a public instrument in order that it will be registered with the Register of Deeds.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no need for the confirmation</span> of Sol T. Carpio because the original Road Right of Way Agreement was already embodied in a public instrument, and binding on the successors-in-interest of the contracting parties, and there is no indication that the heirs of Bernardo Carpio are reneging on that agreement</span>.&nbsp; At most, plaintiff could have refined the last sentence in paragraph 5(h) of Exh. 6 by adding a word or words between "road" and "register" and it would have served the import of paragraph 5(h).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>In other words, the trial court found that petitioner's addition of the second sentence to paragraph 5(h) of the MOA was a mere amplification of the first sentence thereof, and the execution of the Joint Affidavit was not necessary as the Road Right-of-Way Agreement dated May 29, 1984 was embodied in a public instrument which is binding on the successors-in-interest of the parties absent any indication that the heirs of Bernardo D. Carpio are reneging on that agreement.<br><br>In any event, the trial court held that petitioner's preparation and notarization of&nbsp; the Joint Affidavit was done "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not for the benefit of the Sisons but for the benefit of his client, the corporation</span>, and that the argument of petitioner that the January 10, 1994 Road Right-of-Way Agreement earlier prepared, signed by the parties, and notarized by the Sisons" counsel Atty. Agudo could not be registered in the absence of technical description of the properties covered is untenable, for the Registry of Deeds has the ministerial duty to register deeds, conveyances, and the like, whether effecting registered or unregistered land, executed in accordance with law in the form of public instruments.<br><br>The trial court added that the technical description of the Road Right-of-Way is needed only for purposes of issuing a separate title and that even without the technical description, the agreement may still be annotated on the grantor's certificate of title.<br><br>Be that as it may, the trial court held that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">since the Sisons were likewise benefited by petitioner's <span style="font-weight: bold;">notarization</span> of the MOA and of the Joint Affidavit</span>, "it is only proper that they should recompense" him, pursuant to the earlier-quoted provision of the MOA on the retention of 10% of the purchase price, citing Article 2142 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 2142.&nbsp; Certain lawful, voluntary and unilateral acts give rise to the juridical relation of quasi contract to the end that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another.<br></blockquote>Holding that the notarial services done by petitioner must be based on <span style="font-style: italic;">quantum meruit,</span> there being no prior agreement thereon, the trial court found petitioner's bill for P604,123.05 unreasonable, unconscionable and grossly inflated, citing Section 24, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 24. An attorney shall be entitled to have and recover <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from his client</span> no more than a reasonable compensation for his services, with a view to the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the extent of the services rendered, and the professional standing of the attorney.&nbsp; No court shall be bound by the opinion of attorneys as expert witnesses as to the proper compensation, but may disregard such testimony and base its conclusion on its own professional knowledge.&nbsp; A written contract for services shall control the amount to be paid therefore unless found by the court to be unconscionable or unreasonable.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>The trial court, <span style="font-style: italic;

what [had] already been agreed upon and therefore, in [petitioner's] own word, he could not change what [the parties thereto] had agreed upon, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">making two (2) additions in the MOA</span>, one of which, as stated earlier, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mere amplification</span> of what had already been agreed upon, [the other being the furnishing of the names of the respective spouses of the Sisons], and . . . <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">preparing the Joint Affidavit of Clarification and Confirmation</span>, which to the mind of the Court benefited most his client, and which could have been prepared by [the] SISONS' lawyer just as well,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">taking into account</span> the value of the properties sold — P40 million plus — ,&nbsp; held that the amount of P100,000.00 as notarial fees is reasonable and conscionable.<br><br>Accordingly, the trial court disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered adjudging the defendants SISON liable to pay SUELTO the sum of P100,000.00 for and as notarial fees for services the latter has rendered, as well as actual litigation costs in the form of filing and docket

factual findings that it was the corporation which engaged petitioner's services in connection with the finalization and notarization of the MOA and preparation and notarization of the Joint Affidavit.&nbsp; It too agreed with the Sisons' claim that the corporation, being in the real estate business, agreed to assume petitioner's notarial fees.<br><br>In another vein, the appellate court, noting the provision in the MOA regarding the retention of the 10% selling price by the buyer corporation to be applied to expenses including notarial and attorney's fees and the corporation's returning of the balance thereof to the seller-Sisons in the amount of more than P600,000.00 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">despite the corporation's previous receipt of petitioner's Statement of Account and copy of petitioner's demand letter to the Sisons</span>, held that the return of the said balance elicited "the clear and unrebutted <span style="font-weight:

reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> having been denied by Resolution of April 11, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> by the Court of Appeals, petitioner comes
