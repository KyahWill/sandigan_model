				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Having satisfactorily proven to the Court of Tax Appeals, to the Court of Appeals and to this Court that it is a bona fide cooperative, respondent is entitled to exemption from the payment of taxes on life insurance premiums and documentary stamps.  Not being governed by the Cooperative Code of the Philippines, it is not required to be registered with the Cooperative Development Authority in order to avail itself of the tax exemptions.  Significantly, neither the Tax Code nor the Insurance Code mandates this administrative registration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to nullify the January 23, 2003 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the April 21, 2003 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 69125.  The dispositive portion of the Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petition for review is hereby DENIED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]<br></sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></div><br>The antecedents, as narrated by the CA, are as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sun Life is a mutual life insurance company organized and existing under the laws of Canada.  It is registered and authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Insurance Commission to engage in business in the Philippines as a mutual life insurance company with principal office at Paseo de Roxas, Legaspi Village, Makati City.<br><br>"On October 20, 1997, Sun Life filed with the [Commissioner of Internal Revenue] (CIR) its insurance premium tax return for the third quarter of 1997 and paid the premium tax in the amount of P31,485,834.51.  For the period covering August 21 to December 18, 1997, petitioner filed with the CIR its [documentary stamp tax (DST)] declaration returns and paid the total amount of P30,000,000.00.<br><br>"On December 29, 1997, the [Court of Tax Appeals] (CTA) rendered its decision in <i>Insular Life Assurance Co. Ltd. v. [CIR]</i>, which held that mutual life insurance companies are purely cooperative companies and are exempt from the payment of premium tax and DST.  This pronouncement was later affirmed by this court in <i>[CIR] v. Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd</i>. Sun Life surmised that[,] being a mutual life insurance company, it was likewise exempt from the payment of premium tax and DST.  Hence, on August 20, 1999, Sun Life filed with the CIR an administrative claim for tax credit of its alleged erroneously paid premium tax and DST for the aforestated tax periods.<br><br>"For failure of the CIR to act upon the administrative claim for tax credit and with the 2-year period to file a claim for tax credit or refund dwindling away and about to expire, Sun Life filed with the CTA a petition for review on August 23, 1999.  In its petition, it prayed for the issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P61,485,834.51 representing P31,485,834.51 of erroneously paid premium tax for the third quarter of 1997 and P30,000[,000].00 of DST on policies of insurance from August 21 to December 18, 1997.  Sun Life stood firm on its contention that it is a mutual life insurance company vested with all the characteristic features and elements of a cooperative company or association as defined in [S]ection 121 of the Tax Code.  Primarily, the management and affairs of Sun Life were conducted by its members; secondly, it is operated with money collected from its members; and, lastly, it has for its purpose the mutual protection of its members and not for profit or gain.<br><br>"In its answer, the CIR, then respondent, raised as special and affirmative defenses the following:<br><blockquote>"7. Petitioner's (Sun Life's) alleged claim for refund is subject to administrative routinary investigation/examination by respondent's (CIR's) Bureau.<br><br>"8. Petitioner must prove that it falls under the exception provided for under Section 121 (now 123) of the Tax Code to be exempted from premium tax and be entitled to the refund sought.<br><br>"9. Claims for tax refund/credit are construed strictly against the claimants thereof as they are in the nature of exemption from payment of tax.<br><br>"10. In an action for tax credit/refund, the burden is upon the taxpayer to establish its right thereto, and failure to sustain this burden is fatal to said claim x x x.<br><br>"11. It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that it has complied with the provisions of Section 204[,] in relation to Section 229, both in the 1997 Tax Code."<br></blockquote>"On November 12, 2002, the CTA found in favor of Sun Life.  Quoting largely from its earlier findings in <i>Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd. v. [CIR]</i>, which it found to be on all fours with the present action, the CTA ruled:<br><blockquote>"The [CA] has already spoken.  It ruled that a mutual life insurance company is a purely cooperative company[;] thus, exempted from the payment of premium and documentary stamp taxes.  Petitioner Sun Life is without doubt a mutual life insurance company. x x x.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;               x x x<br></div><br>"Being similarly situated with Insular, Petitioner at bar is entitled to the same interpretation given by this Court in the earlier cases of The Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd. vs. [CIR] (CTA Case Nos. 5336 and 5601) and by the [CA] in the case entitled [CIR] vs. The Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd., C.A. G.R. SP No. 46516, September 29, 1998.  Petitioner Sun Life as a mutual life insurance company is[,] therefore[,] a cooperative company or association and is exempted from the payment of premium tax and [DST] on policies of insurance pursuant to Section 121 (now Section 123) and Section 199<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>) (now Section 199[a]) of the Tax Code."<br></blockquote>"Seeking reconsideration of the decision of the CTA, the CIR argued that Sun Life ought to have registered, foremost, with the Cooperative Development Authority before it could enjoy the exemptions from premium tax and DST extended to purely cooperative companies or associations under [S]ections 121 and 199 of the Tax Code.  For its failure to register, it could not avail of the exemptions prayed for.  Moreover, the CIR alleged that Sun Life failed to prove that ownership of the company was vested in its members who are entitled to vote and elect the Board of Trustees among [them].  The CIR further claimed that change in the 1997 Tax Code subjecting mutual life insurance companies to the regular corporate income tax rate reflected the legislature's recognition that these companies must be earning profits.<br><br>"Notwithstanding these arguments, the CTA denied the CIR's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>"Thwarted anew but nonetheless undaunted, the CIR comes to this court via this petition on the sole ground that:<br><blockquote>"The Tax Court erred in granting the refund[,] because respondent does not fall under the exception provided for under Section 121 (now 123) of the Tax Code to be exempted from premium tax and DST and be entitled to the refund."<br></blockquote>"The CIR repleads the arguments it raised with the CTA and proposes further that the [CA] decision in <i>[CIR] v. Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd</i>. is not controlling and cannot constitute <i>res judicata</i> in the present action.  At best, the pronouncements are merely persuasive as the decisions of the Supreme Court alone have a universal and mandatory effect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></div><br>In upholding the CTA, the CA reasoned that respondent was a purely cooperative corporation duly licensed to engage in mutual life insurance business in the Philippines.  Thus, respondent was deemed exempt from premium and documentary stamp taxes, because its affairs are managed and conducted by its members with money collected from among themselves, solely for their own protection, and not for profit.  Its members or policyholders constituted both insurer and insured who contribute, by a system of premiums or assessments, to the creation of a fund from which all losses and liabilities were paid.  The dividends it distributed to them were not profits, but returns of amounts that had been overcharged them for insurance.<br><br>For having satisfactorily shown with substantial evidence that it had erroneously paid and seasonably filed its claim for premium and documentary stamp taxes, respondent was entitled to a refund, the CA ruled.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></div><br>Petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I.<br></div><br>"Whether or not respondent is a purely cooperative company or association under Section 121 of the National Internal Revenue Code and a fraternal or beneficiary society, order or cooperative company on the lodge system or local cooperation plan and organized and conducted solely by the members thereof for the exclusive benefit of each member and not for profit under Section 199 of the National Internal Revenue Code.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II.<br></div><br>"Whether or not registration with the Cooperative Development Authority is a sine qua non requirement to be entitled to tax exemption.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III.<br></div><br>"Whether or not respondent is exempted from payment of tax on life insurance premiums and documentary stamp tax."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>We shall tackle the issues <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>First Issue:</u></b><br><b><i><u>Whether Respondent Is a Cooperative</u></i></b><br></div><br>The Tax Code defines a cooperative as an association "conducted by the members thereof with the money collected from among themselves and solely for their own protection and not for profit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Without a doubt, respondent is a cooperative engaged in a mutual life insurance business.<br><br><i>First</i>, it is managed by its members.

Since they vary with the kind of insurance taken and with the group of policyholders insured, any excess in the amount anticipated by a mutual company to cover the cost of providing for the insurance over its actual realized cost will also vary.  If a member-policyholder receives an excess payment, then the apportionment must have been based upon a calculation of the actual cost of insurance that the company has provided for that particular member-policyholder.  Accordingly, in apportioning divisible surpluses, any mutual company uses a contribution method that aims to distribute those surpluses among its member-policyholders, in the same proportion as they have contributed to the surpluses by their payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Sharing in the common fund, any member-policyholder may choose to withdraw dividends in cash or to apply them in order to reduce a subsequent premium, purchase additional insurance, or accelerate the payment period.  Although the premium made at the beginning of a year is more than necessary to provide for the cost of carrying the insurance, the member-policyholder will nevertheless receive the benefit of the overcharge by way of dividends, at the end of the year when the cost is actually ascertained.

It remains an <i>overpayment</i>, a benefit to which the member-policyholder is equitably entitled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Verily, a mutual life insurance corporation is a cooperative that promotes the welfare of its own members.

No tax provision requires a mutual life insurance company to register with that agency in order to enjoy exemption from both percentage and documentary stamp taxes.<br><br>A provision of Section 8 of Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 48-91 requires the submission of the Certificate of Registration with the CDA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> before the issuance of a tax exemption certificate. That provision cannot prevail over the clear absence of an equivalent requirement under the Tax Code.  <i>One</i>, as we will explain below, the Circular does not apply to respondent, but only to cooperatives that need to be registered under the Cooperative Code.  <i>Two</i>, it is a mere issuance directing all internal revenue officers to publicize a new tax legislation.  Although the Circular does not derogate from their authority to implement the law, it cannot add a registration requirement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> when there is none under the law to begin with.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the provisions of the Cooperative Code of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> do not apply.  Let us trace the Code's development in our history.<br><br>As early as 1917, a cooperative company or association was already defined as one "conducted by the members thereof with money collected from among themselves and solely for their own protection and not profit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In 1990, it was further defined by the Cooperative Code as a "duly registered association of persons, with a common bond of interest, who have voluntarily joined together to achieve a lawful common social or economic end, making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting a fair share of the risks and benefits of the undertaking in accordance with universally accepted cooperative principles."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The Cooperative Code was actually an offshoot of the old law on cooperatives.  In 1973, Presidential Decree (PD) No. 175 was signed into law by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos in order to strengthen the cooperative movement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The promotion of cooperative development was one of the major programs of the "New Society" under his administration.  It sought to improve the country's trade and commerce by enhancing agricultural production, cottage industries, community development, and agrarian reform through cooperatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The whole cooperative system, with its vertical and horizontal linkages -- from the market cooperative of agricultural products to cooperative rural banks, consumer cooperatives and cooperative insurance -- was envisioned to offer considerable economic opportunities to people who joined cooperatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As an effective instrument in redistributing income and wealth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> cooperatives were promoted primarily to support the agrarian reform program of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Notably, the cooperative under PD 175 referred only to an organization composed primarily of small producers and consumers who voluntarily joined to form a business enterprise that they themselves owned, controlled, and patronized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The Bureau of Cooperatives Development -- under the Department of Local Government and Community Development (later Ministry of Agriculture)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> -- had the authority to register, regulate and supervise only the following cooperatives: (1) barrio associations involved in the issuance of certificates of land transfer; (2) local or primary cooperatives composed of natural persons and/or barrio associations; (3) federations composed of cooperatives that may or may not perform business activities; and (4) unions of cooperatives that did not perform any business activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Respondent does not fall under any of the above-mentioned types of cooperatives required to be registered under PD 175.<br><br>When the Cooperative Code was enacted years later, all cooperatives that were registered under PD 175 and previous laws were also deemed registered with the CDA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Since respondent was not required to be registered under the old law on cooperatives, it followed that it was not required to be registered even under the new law.<br><br>Furthermore, only cooperatives to be formed or organized under the Cooperative Code needed registration with the CDA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Respondent already existed before the passage of the new law on cooperatives.

The former is a function of a service cooperative,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the latter is not.  Cooperative insurance under the Code is limited in scope and local in character.  It is not the same as mutual life insurance.<br><br>We have already determined that respondent is a cooperative.  The distinguishing feature of a cooperative enterprise<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> is the mutuality of cooperation among its member-policyholders united for that purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> So long as respondent meets this essential feature, it does not even have to use<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and carry the name of a cooperative to operate its mutual life insurance business.  <i>Gratia argumenti</i> that registration is mandatory, it cannot deprive respondent of its tax exemption privilege merely because it failed to register.  The nature of its operations is clear; its purpose well-defined.  Exemption when granted cannot prevail over administrative convenience.<br><br><i>Third</i>, not even the Insurance Code requires registration with the CDA.  The provisions of this Code primarily govern insurance contracts; only if a particular matter in question is not specifically provided for shall the provisions of the Civil Code on contracts and special laws govern.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>True, the provisions of the Insurance Code relative to the organization and operation of an insurance company also apply to cooperative insurance entities organized under the Cooperative Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The latter law, however, does not apply to respondent, which already existed as a cooperative company engaged in mutual life insurance prior to the laws passage of that law.  The statutes prevailing at the time of its organization and mutualization were the Insurance Code and the Corporation Code, which imposed no registration requirement with the CDA.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Third Issue:</u></b><br><b><i><u>Whether Respondent Is Exempted</u></i></b><br><b><i><u>from Premium Taxes and DST</u></i></b><br></div><br>Having determined that respondent is a cooperative that does not have to be registered with the CDA, we hold that it is entitled to exemption from both premium taxes and documentary stamp taxes (DST).<br><br>The Tax Code is clear.  On the one hand, Section 121 of the Code exempts cooperative companies from the 5 percent percentage tax on insurance premiums.  On the other hand, Section 199 also exempts from the DST, policies of insurance or annuities made or granted by cooperative companies.  Being a cooperative, respondent is thus exempt from both types of taxes.<br><br>It is worthy to note that while RA 8424 amending the Tax Code has deleted the income tax of 10 percent imposed upon the gross investment income of mutual life insurance companies -- domestic<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and foreign<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> -- the provisions of Section 121 and 199 remain unchanged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Having been seasonably filed and amply substantiated, the claim for exemption in the amount of P61,485,834.51, representing percentage taxes on insurance premiums and documentary stamp taxes on policies of insurance or annuities that were paid by respondent in 1997, is in order.
