They also alleged that their agreement with the spouses Concepcion that the latter would not register the said deeds in the Office of the Register of Deeds and secure titles over the properties in their names; the defendants, in evident bad faith, registered the said deeds and secured titles in their names; the market price of the whole property amounted to P10,000,000.00, but it appeared that the property was sold to the spouses Concepcion for only P2,000,000.00, which was the amount the spouses Concepcion remitted to the bank in their account; they offered to repay their loans and their offers were rejected.&nbsp; The spouses Salonga prayed that judgment be rendered in their favor, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that after due hearing, judgment be rendered in accordance with the several causes of action hereof; <br><blockquote><ol><li>Declaring the Deed[s] of Absolute Sales, (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>), (Annexes "I" and "J") dated August 31, 1993 and October 18, 1993, respectively as a simulated contracts and therefore <i><u>VOID AB INITIO;</u></i><br><br></li><li>Ordering the Register of Deeds of Dagupan City to cancel TCT Nos. 60533, 60534, 60695, 60694, 60624 in the name of the defendants and TCT Nos. 60530, 60531 and 60532 in the name of Florencia Realty Corporation, Inc., and to restore TCT Nos. 40886, 40887, 43547, 20506, 35156, 49460, 49459 and 53650 in the name of the plaintiffs Spouses Natalio Salonga and Felicidad Salonga;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendants spouses Manuel Concepcion and Nenita Viado to pay plaintiffs the sum of P500,000.00 as damages authorized to be awarded under Article 19 of the same code;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendants Spouses Manuel Concepcion and Nenita Viado to pay plaintiffs the sum of P2,000,000.00 for moral damages; the sum of P100,000.00 for exemplary damages;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendants Spouses Manuel Concepcion and Nenita Viado to pay plaintiffs the sum of P100,000.00 as and for attorney's fees plus the sum of P1,000.00 as per Court appearance fee; the sum of P100,000.00 for litigation expenses.<br></li></ol></blockquote>PLAINTIFFS further pray for such other reliefs just and equitable in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>In their answer to the complaint, the spouses Concepcion admitted that they gave loans to the spouses Salonga in the total amount of P3,131,154.54 which they remitted to the DBP, the PNB and Associated Bank for the plaintiffs' account, with the assurance that they would sell the property within three months; from the proceeds of the sale, their loans and the interest thereof at 3% per month and a commission of 5% of the purchase price of the property would be paid. &nbsp;They further alleged that despite extensions granted to them, the plaintiffs failed to pay their loans, and offered, instead, to sell their property for the price equivalent to the spouses Concepcion's remittances to the creditors-banks, plus an additional amount; the lots covered by TCT Nos. 53650 and 26506 were not part of the said sale; the spouses Salonga requested for more time to sell the remaining two lots.<br><br>The spouses Concepcion further alleged that they agreed to spouses Salonga's offer, and the latter executed a deed of absolute sale on August 31, 1993 covering the lots described in TCT Nos. 43547, 40886, 40887, 35156 and 49459; when the plaintiffs failed to sell the lots covered by TCT Nos. 53650 and 26506, they executed a deed of absolute sale over the said lots on October 18, 1993 and received the additional purchase price of P1,500.000.00 from the defendants; the plaintiffs promised to vacate their house in April 1994, but refused to do so; worse, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against them.<br><br>Subsequently, the spouses Concepcion as plaintiffs filed an action for ejectment against the spouses Salonga on August 23, 1994 with the Municipal Trial Court of Dagupan City, praying for their eviction from the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The case was docketed as Civil Case No. CV-95-&nbsp;&nbsp; 00671-D.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Felicidad Salonga testified that there was no period agreed upon to repay their loans from the defendants, and while they executed the Deeds of Absolute Sale dated August 31, 1993 and October 18, 1993 in favor of the defendants, they did not receive the amounts stated therein.&nbsp; The plaintiffs also adduced in evidence Olivia Arafiles' valuation of the property, pegged at P10,270,600.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Julio A. Garcia testified that he was in the house of the plaintiffs and affixed his signature on a document signed by the defendant Manuel Concepcion, quoted, <i>infra</i>:<br><blockquote>I Manuel Concepcion of legal aged (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>), married to Nenita Viado and resident of Bautista Pangasinan have agreed (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) to Mr. And Mrs. Natalio Salonga a resident of Dagupan city to sign a Deed of Sale and I will not registered (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) as long as the spouses Salonga will pay the principal cash involved plus the interest of 3% per month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Felicidad further testified that she and her husband continued residing in their house even after the spouses Concepcion had paid their loans to the creditor banks. &nbsp;However, upon the latter's suggestion, they had the commercial building repainted and leased to a tenant, with the agreement that the rentals would be credited to their (spouses Salonga's) account.&nbsp; The latter paid interests on their account, but the spouses Concepcion refused to issue receipts therefor.&nbsp; Felicidad further declared that on March 10, 1993, Manuel Concepcion arrived in their house and suggested that a deed of sale over the property be executed in their favor while looking for prospective buyers.&nbsp; The spouses Salonga agreed, provided that said deed would not be registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds.&nbsp; Felicidad wrote an undertaking on a piece of paper, in which the spouses Concepcion promised not to register the said deed of sale in the Office of the Register of Deeds.&nbsp; Manuel Concepcion signed the note in the presence of Julio Garcia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Felicidad likewise testified that when she and her husband failed to sell their property and pay their account with the spouses Concepcion, she and her husband executed on August 31, 1993 a deed of sale over five (5) parcels of land previously mortgaged with the Associated Bank, for the latter to assume the right of the creditor banks to collect their loan account and interests; the property will only serve as security for the payment of their account. &nbsp;She further testified that she and her husband did not receive from the defendant the P575,000.00 and P1,500,000.00 stated in the said deeds as the purchase price of the subject properties.<br><br>Felicidad further narrated that when her daughter arrived in the Philippines in 1994, they sought to redeem the property from the spouses Concepcion, but the latter informed them that the titles to the property had already been transferred in their names and that the property could be redeemed for P10,000,000.00.&nbsp; In April 1996, they were finally evicted from the property by a sheriff and soldiers.<br><br>Manuel Concepcion testified that he and his wife agreed to grant loans to the plaintiffs to enable them to pay their loan account with their creditor banks, with their assurance that they will be able to sell their property within 60 days and pay their accounts plus interests and 5% commission.&nbsp; Despite several extensions granted to the spouses Salonga, they failed to sell their properties.&nbsp; Sometime in April 1993, the spouses Salonga offered to sell their properties previously mortgaged with the Associated Bank in payment for the P586,520.50 advanced by them to the Associated Bank, plus P575,000.00 on top of said amount.&nbsp; The spouses Salonga agreed.&nbsp; The latter's lawyers then prepared a Deed of Absolute Sale dated August 31, 1993, which they signed following their receipt of P575,000.00.&nbsp; The spouses Salonga pleaded that they be given a period of one month to execute a deed of absolute sale over the two parcels of land previously mortgaged to the PNB and DBP and to a third-party, to which the spouses Concepcion also agreed.&nbsp; However, the spouses Salonga failed to sell the properties.<br><br>On October 18, 1993, the spouses Salonga executed a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> over the parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 53650 and 26506 as payment of their loan account, plus P1,500,000.00.&nbsp; Manuel Concepcion further narrated that they spent P1,200,000.00 for the renovation of the commercial building<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and had it leased to tenants.&nbsp; They also paid for the realty taxes due for the building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> He denied having known Julio Garcia and having signed the note<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> on March 10, 1993.<br><br>In the meantime, the MTC rendered judgment ordering the spouses Salonga to vacate the property.&nbsp; They appealed to the RTC of Dagupan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 94-00249-D.&nbsp; On December 4, 1995, the spouses Salonga filed a motion to stay the execution of the appealed decision, which the RTC denied. &nbsp;The spouses Salonga were ejected by a sheriff sometime in April 1996.<br><br>On December 10, 1996, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered judgment in favor of the spouses Concepcion ordering the dismissal of the complaint.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">fallo</span> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Complaint is DISMISSED. In this connection, the plaintiffs are ordered to pay defendants the sum of P500,000.00 as moral damages and the sum of P200,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>The plaintiffs are also ordered to pay defendants the sum of P50,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fee plus P10,000.00 as litigation expenses aside from the costs of suit.<br><br>Furnish copies of this Decision to Atty. Mariano Mel Ramos and Atty. Rodolfo Palma.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC ruled that the August 31 and October 18, 1993 Deeds of Absolute Sale were valid in fact and in law.<br><br>The spouses Salonga appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals (CA) wherein they alleged that: <br><blockquote><ol><li>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT OF PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS AND IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE DEEDS OF SALE SIGNED BY PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS CONVEYING THE PROPERTIES IN QUESTION TO DEFENDANTS-APPELLEES ARE ACTUALLY EQUITABLE MORTGAGE;<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS LIABLE FOR MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AS WELL AS ATTORNEY'S FEES AND LITIGATION EXPENSES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>They averred that, as admitted by Manuel Concepcion, the parties had agreed that the former would return their advance/s for their account, with 3% interest a month, and that no sale was agreed upon by the parties. &nbsp;They even granted extensions to the spouses Salonga to repay their loans.<br><br>The spouses Salonga assert that their transactions with the spouses Concepcion relative to their property were in the nature of equitable mortgages as shown, <i>inter alia</i>, by the fact that the prices of the property as appearing in the deeds of absolute sale were a little more than P2,000,000.00, grossly inadequate as compared to their market value of P10,000,000.00;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the parties had agreed that the deeds of sale would not be registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds, but that the spouses Concepcion registered the said deeds in gross and evident bad faith; despite the existence of the deeds of absolute sale, the spouses Salonga remained in possession of the property.<br><br>On December 21, 2001, the CA rendered judgment dismissing the appeal and affirming the appealed decision with modification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The CA ruled that the spouses Salonga had sold their property to the spouses Concepcion with a right to repurchase, and that the said spouses failed to repurchase the same.&nbsp; The appellate court also declared that the spouses Salonga failed to prove that the said transactions were in the nature of equitable mortgages.&nbsp; They took possession of the house for a limited period of time, while the spouses Concepcion took possession of the estate of the property after the execution of the deed of absolute sale.<br><br>The spouses Salonga, now the petitioners, filed the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> with this Court, assailing the decision and resolution of the CA.&nbsp; They contend that:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN THAT ITS CONCLUSIONS ARE CONTRARY TO LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE, AS </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote><div style="font-style: italic;" align="center">I<br></div><span style="font-style: italic;">THE DEEDS OF SALE IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS CONCEPCIONS ARE NULL AND VOID AS THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY SIMULATED AND THEIR CAUSES WERE INEXISTENT AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IF UPHELD THEIR PURPOSE IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY, THUS VOID.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><div style="font-style: italic;" align="center">II<br></div><span style="font-style: italic;">THE PETITIONERS DID NOT GIVE THEIR CONSENT TO A SALE.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><div style="font-style: italic;" align="center">III<br style="font-style: italic;"></div><span style="font-style: italic;">ASSUMING EX GRATIA ARGUMENTI THAT THE DEEDS WERE NOT VOID AB INITIO, THEY ARE VOIDABLE OR AT LEAST THE PETITIONERS ARE ENTITLED TO REFORMATION OF THE DEEDS AS THEY DID NOT EXPRESS THE TRUE INTENT OF THE PARTIES AS THEY ARE EQUITABLE MORTGAGES AT BEST.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The issues in this case are factual.&nbsp; Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, the reason being that the Court is not a trier of facts; hence, is not to re-examine and re-evaluate the evidence on record.&nbsp; Furthermore, the conclusions of the CA on appeal are binding and conclusive on the Court, unless there is a convincing showing that the appellate court ignored, misapplied or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances which, if considered, would warrant the modification or reversal of the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court is not proscribed, however, from delving into and resolving factual issues, if the findings and conclusions of the trial court are inconsistent with those of the appellate court;

Besides, in times of grave financial distress which render persons hard-pressed to answer an emergency, such persons would have no choice but to sign a deed of absolute sale of property if only to obtain a much-needed loan from unscrupulous money lenders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The notarization of the document does not guarantee its validity because it is not the function of the notary public to validate an instrument that was never intended by the parties to have any binding legal effect on him.&nbsp; Neither is the notarization of a document conclusive of the nature of the transaction conferred by the said document, nor is it conclusive of the true agreement of the parties thereto.<br><br>After a thorough examination of the records, we find and so hold that the August 31 and October 18, 1993 Deeds of Absolute Sale are mere equitable mortgages and not <i>bona fide</i> absolute sale of the parcels of land therein described.<br><br><b>FIRST.</b>&nbsp; The petitioners were hard-pressed to pay their account to the respondents in the total principal amount of P3,198,886.47; the said amount paid by the respondents for the account of the petitioners to the PNB, the Associated Bank and the DBP, excluding the amount of 36% interest a month or 36% interest per annum. &nbsp;The petitioners tried to sell the property to third-persons, but failed.&nbsp; The respondents refused to give the petitioners any further extensions of time to sell the property, unless they execute the deeds of absolute sale in favor of the respondents and insure the payment of their account.&nbsp; The specter of the petitioners being evicted from their residence loomed large in the horizon.&nbsp; To give themselves more time to sell their property and avert eviction from their house, the petitioners opted to execute the deeds of absolute sale.<br><br><b>SECOND.</b>&nbsp; It was made to appear under the August 31, 1993 Deed of Absolute Sale that the petitioners had sold their five parcels of land to the respondents for the principal amount of P575,000.00, and that the petitioners received the said amount from the respondents.&nbsp; However, at the time of the execution of said deed, the petitioners were indebted to the respondents for the principal amount of P586,520.50, which the respondents had remitted to the Associated Bank for the account of the petitioners.&nbsp; It is incredible that the petitioners would sell the said parcels of land to the respondents, and that the latter would remit the purchase price of P575,000.00 to the petitioners, and retain the said amount to be applied as payment to the petitioners' account of P586,520.50.<br><br>It was also made to appear under the October 18, 1993 Deed of Absolute 0Sale that the petitioners sold two parcels of land to the respondents (on which their commercial building and their house were constructed) for P1,500,000.00, and that the petitioners received the said amount from the respondents following the execution of the deed.&nbsp; However, the evidence on record shows that the petitioners had an outstanding account of P2,042,377.19 as of October 18, 1993 to the respondents.&nbsp; It is incredible that, instead of applying the aforesaid amount of P1,500,000.00 in partial payment of the petitioners' outstanding account, the respondents would choose to remit the same upon the execution of the October 18, 1993 deed of absolute sale.&nbsp; In fine, the petitioners' account to the respondents, in the total amount of P3,198,886.47, remained outstanding despite the sale of the petitioners' seven&nbsp; parcels of land in favor of the respondents.<br><br>We reject the respondents' contention that the petitioners sold their seven parcels of land, not only for P2,078,000.00 but also for the outstanding account of P3,198,886.47, for the total price of P5,876,886.47.&nbsp; The respondents were burdened to prove that the petitioners agreed to sell their property partly in payment of the said account; the respondents failed to do so.<br><br>A plain reading of the two (2) deeds of absolute sale shows that the seven lots were sold to the respondents for only P2,078,000.00.&nbsp; There is no provision in said deeds stating that the petitioners sold their property in partial payment of their outstanding account to the respondents (P3,198,886.47), and partly for an additional P2,078,000.00.&nbsp; If it is true, as claimed by the respondents, that the petitioners sold the seven parcels of land to them not only for P2,078,000.00 as appearing in said deeds, but also for the outstanding account of P3,198,886.47, the same should have been specifically and positively stated in the said deeds.&nbsp; No such provision appears in the two deeds.&nbsp; There is likewise no provision in the said deeds that, by the execution thereof, the petitioners' outstanding account to the respondents in the amount of P3,198,886.47 was extinguished and paid.&nbsp; The absence of any provision in the two deeds of absolute sale that the seven parcels of land were sold by the petitioners to the respondents in partial payment of their outstanding account, and partly for P2,078,000.00, and any declaration therein that the said outstanding account was thereby extinguished negates the respondents' contention.<br><br><b>THIRD.</b>&nbsp; Respondent Manuel Concepcion had earlier signed on March 10, 1993 an undertaking that he would not register the deed of absolute sale as long as the petitioners will pay their outstanding account plus interests thereon at the rate of 3% per month:<br><blockquote>I Manuel Concepcion, of legal aged (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>), married to Nenita Viado and resident of Bautista, Pangasinan have agreed to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Natalio Salonga, a resident of Dagupan City to sign a Deed of Sale and I will not registered (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) as long as the spouses Salonga will pay the principal cash involved plus the interest of 3% per month&nbsp;&nbsp;

Forgery must be proved with clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The fact that respondent Manuel Concepcion signed the note on March 10, 1993, before the petitioners executed the said deeds of absolute sale in August and October 1993, does not militate against the probative weight thereof.&nbsp; The petitioners had only 60 days from January 1993 within which to repay the respondents from the proceeds of the sale; however, the petitioners failed to sell their property and repay the respondents.&nbsp; When the respondents pressed the petitioners for the payment of their account, the latter agreed to execute deeds of absolute sale by the petitioners over the property, with the agreement not to present the said deed to the Office of the Register of Deeds for registration.&nbsp; However, despite their written undertaking to the contrary, the respondents filed the August 31 and October 18, 1993 Deeds of Sale in the Office of the Register of Deeds and registered the same.<br><br><b>THIRD.</b>&nbsp; When the petitioners' daughter arrived in the Philippines from abroad, they had offered to redeem the parcels of land from the respondents, only to discover that the two deeds of absolute sale had already been registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds; that the respondents had acquired titles over the said parcels of land; and that the said lots had been sold to Florencia Realty Corporation. &nbsp;Worse, the respondents demanded the amount of P8,000,000.00, later increased to P10,000,000.00, for the redemption of the property. <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">WITNESS:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td> <div align="justify">When my daughter arrived from abroad, we're trying to pay same, there is no one year yet from that time when my daughter is trying to redeem the property.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">And you claim that Mr. Concepcion refuse to accept the payment?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">He wanted that it may pay in accordance with the price which he is going to peg, and my daughter said, could it be possible that it be paid in the amount in respect to the principal and plus the interest.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">When was that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
