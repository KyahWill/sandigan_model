				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the present case, the Court stresses that the use of facts admitted in the Complaint will not subject the judgment based thereon to a claim of nullity grounded on lack of due process.&nbsp; Clearly, the facts alleged in the Complaint bound the plaintiff.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court correctly&nbsp; used &nbsp;the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; or&nbsp; admissions&nbsp; therein&nbsp; as&nbsp; basis&nbsp; to grant the Motion to Dismiss, in the same manner that it could have done so on a motion to render judgment on the pleadings.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the December 16, 2003 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 71589 and its April 14, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; The challenged Decision disposed thus:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case REMANDED for further proceedings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></div><br>According to the CA, the facts are as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x.&nbsp; Feliciano Conquilla was the president of an educational institution located at Noveleta Cavite and known as Columbia College.&nbsp; He was joined by his children Benedicto, Cornelio and Dorotea in mortgaging the three properties on which the school sat and titled in their names as TCT No. T-593582 to 84 to secure a loan from the Luzon Development Bank.&nbsp; The transaction underwent a series of amendments.&nbsp; Initially, on March 7, 1996, they borrowed P4,720,000, which was increased to P7,220,000 on April 2 by way of a <i>Promissory Note and Amendment Of Real Estate Mortgage</i>. The <i>Promissory Note</i> appears to have been signed by the four in their personal capacities, but Feliciano's name in the <i>Amendment of Real Estate Mortgage</i> was preceded by the telling phrase <i>Columbia College By</i>.&nbsp; An amount of P2,500,000 was specifically earmarked for <i>building construction</i>.&nbsp; On May 2, they acknowledged a loan of P10,000,000 in a promissory note signed by them again without any qualification, and raising the amount for building construction to P2,780,000.<br><br>"After some months, Feliciano Conquilla applied for a restructuring of the loan.&nbsp; He wrote the bank that they had sought extra funding to finish the school building, and with the increased enrollment that would follow on the heels of their expansion program, assured that their loan obligations would be met.&nbsp; The request granted, they again issued on December 27, 1996 a <i>Promissory Note</i> for P12,242,000 payable monthly for the next five years.<br><br>"They failed to deliver on their promise, and by March 1998, their unpaid amortizations rose to more than P4 million.&nbsp; To prevent the impending foreclosure of the mortgaged properties, Feliciano filed in the name of Columbia College with the RTC of Cavite City [C]ivil [C]ase N-6659 against Luzon Development Bank and the notary public[,] Rolando Torres.&nbsp; This suit was filed on February 18, 1998.&nbsp; Less than a month later, on March 11, 1998, Judge Christopher [Lock] of Branch 88 of the court dismissed the case on the ground that the plaintiff failed to establish its cause of action.&nbsp; As mentioned in his order, the case was set for hearing on March 5, and on this date only Feliciano Conquilla appeared.&nbsp; Nothing more was said about the hearing, but it is difficult to see what else could happen in the absence of the other parties[,] and all the lawyers.&nbsp; 6 days later, in the order, he declared that there was no reason why the foreclosure of mortgage should be enjoined, and ruled that <i>in the face of the clear admission of plaintiff that they were unable to settle their obligations[,] which were secured by the mortgage, defendants have a clear right to foreclose the mortgage[,] which is the remedy provided by law</i>.<br><br>The next day, March 12, Feliciano Conquilla[,] joined by his wife Salud[,] filed case N-6669 in his own name[,] which still fell in the sala of Judge [Lock], praying for the same remedy of injunction against the foreclosure.&nbsp; On a motion to dismiss, he ruled that the complaint was a rehash of the one made in N-6659 and already dismissed.&nbsp; His order of March 16 contained this disquisition:<br><blockquote>'Except for the allegations that the defendants did not comply with the requirement of notice and publication, and that the plaintiffs are now suing in their personal capacity, the averments in the complaint are mere rehash of the allegations in the complaint docketed as [C]ivil [C]ase No. N-6659[,] filed by the plaintiff Feliciano Conquilla on behalf of Columbia College Inc.[,] which has been dismissed by this court per its order dated March 11, 1998.<br><br>'It appearing from the opposition filed by the defendants that the latter (have) complied with the notice and publication requirements under Act 3135, and it appearing further that the plaintiffs (have) no cause of action to institute the present complaint, the reasons of which (have) already been discussed in the order of the court dated March 11, 1998, the prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order is hereby denied; and finding merit in the motion to dismiss filed by defendants, the same is granted.&nbsp; Consequently, let the complaint filed in this case be, as it is hereby dismissed.'<br></blockquote>"With the cases out of the way, the properties were auctioned off to Luzon Development Bank.&nbsp; In June, it advised Columbia College through Feliciano of its right to buy back the lots within the redemption period.&nbsp; Not amenable to this solution, Feliciano Conquilla and his children filed the present case in January 1999, their final trump card against the inevitable outcome of the foreclosure proceeding.<br><br>"As the plaintiffs in LP 99-0019, the Conquillas alleged in their complaint that of the amount of the loan of P7.2 million agreed to on April 2, 1996, the defendant Luzon Development Bank failed to release to them the amount of P1,940,000, thus causing a breach of contract and rendering the foreclosure premature.&nbsp; The contract obligation was, furthermore, increased to over P12 million without further releases.&nbsp; Even as it bidded for the properties in the amount of over P18 million, it failed to turn over to them the difference between this price and the amount of the actual releases, representing a balance of about P13 million."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>The defendant bank moved to dismiss the Complaint on the ground that the case had already been barred by two prior judgments in Civil Case Nos. N-6659 ("First Case") and N-6669 ("Second Case").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; On May 4, 2000, the trial court issued an Order dismissing Civil Case No. LP 99-0019 ("Third Case") on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; In denying the Motion for Reconsideration, the trial court explained that the causes of action in the Third Case were so intimately and closely related to those in the First and the Second Cases that to allow a re-litigation would constitute a circuity of suits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Respondents appealed this Order, alleging that the dismissal of the Third Case was a denial of their right to be heard;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> that the First and the Second Cases did not constitute <i>res judicata</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and that the foreclosure was premature, because the entire loan had yet to be released.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Respondents argued that the trial court had erred in dismissing Civil Case No. LP 99-0019 on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>.&nbsp; They added that the Third Case had a different cause of action and was not barred by the unfavorable judgments in the previous two cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> &nbsp;While the First and the Second Cases were filed in order to <i>prevent</i> the mortgage foreclosure, the object of the Third Case was the <i>nullification</i> of the foreclosure proceedings and the collection of the balance of the loan.<br><br>Elaborating, respondents explained that of the P7.2 million loan agreed upon, only P5.28 million had been released at the time of the foreclosure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, they argued, the foreclosure was premature and should be nullified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Further, respondents criticized the dismissal of the case by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) on the basis of a mere Motion to Dismiss.&nbsp; They argued that the RTC should have ordered petitioner to file a responsive pleading.&nbsp; Because the trial court had failed to do so, their Complaint was dismissed without trial on the merits. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Lastly, respondents pointed out that petitioner bank should have been declared in default because of its failure to file a responsive pleading in Civil Case No. LP 99-0019.&nbsp; They theorized that its Motion to Dismiss, grounded on <i>res judicata</i>, was defective, considering that Rule 16 of the Rules of Court did not include <i>res judicata</i> among the grounds for dismissal.&nbsp; They contended that the grounds mentioned in Rule 16 were "prior judgment or statute of limitations," which were <i>different</i> from <i>res judicata</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></div><br>The appellate court noted that the lower court had ordered the dismissal of the previous cases without any pretrial or trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Although the CA recognized that a formal trial was not necessary for a judgment to be on the merits, it nevertheless held that the parties should have been given the opportunity to be heard on their claims before judgment was passed.&nbsp; Thus, it ruled that the orders of dismissal were violative of respondents' right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the appellate court observed that the denial of the First Case was grounded on the failure of the Complaint to state a cause of action.&nbsp; Under Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, dismissals on this particular ground did not constitute <i>res judicata</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>For these reasons, the CA remanded Civil Case No. LP 99-0019 to the trial court for further proceedings.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></div><br>Petitioner raised the following issues in its Memorandum:<br><blockquote>"I. Whether or not the Court of Appeals acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion when they decided to remand the case back to the lower [court] despite finality of the order of dismissal[; and]<br><br>II. Whether or not the Court of Appeals' decision to remand the case to the lower court violates jurisprudence on forum shopping and res judicata."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>After going over the arguments of petitioner, the Court believes that the resolution of this case hinges on the principal issue of whether the dismissal of the First Case on the ground of failure to establish a cause of action operates as <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> on the Third Case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The Petition is partially meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Main Issue:</b></u><br><u><b>Res Judicata</b></u><br></div><br>A case is barred by prior judgment or <i>res judicata</i> when the following requisites concur:&nbsp; (1) the former judgment is final; (2) it is rendered by a court having <i>jurisdiction</i> over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it is a judgment or an order <i>on the merits</i>; (4) there is -- between the first and the second actions -- <i>identity</i> of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The parties do not dispute the fact that Branch 88 of the RTC of Cavite has jurisdiction over the First Case, and that its Order of dismissal has long become final and executory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> because of respondents' failure to appeal it.&nbsp; There is no controversy, either, regarding the identity of the subject matter.<br><br>Therefore, the dispute lies only in the presence of the three remaining elements -- judgment on the merits, identity of parties, and identity of causes of action.<br><br><i><b><u>The Ground for Dismissal:<br>"Failure to Establish Cause of Action,"<br>Not "Failure to State a Cause of Action"</u></b></i><br><br>Preliminarily, we have to determine the actual ground for the dismissal of Civil Case No. N-6659.&nbsp; According to the CA, the ground for dismissal could not possibly be "failure to <i>establish</i> [respondents'] cause of action," as stated by the trial court, because there was no hearing on the case. Rather, the CA ruled that the ground for dismissal could only be "failure to <i>state</i> a cause of action" in the light of the fact that the trial court had looked only at the allegations in the Complaint. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>"Cause of action" is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; It contains three elements:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; a right existing in favor of the plaintiff, (2)&nbsp; a duty on the part of the defendant to respect the right of the plaintiff, and (3)&nbsp; a breach of the defendant's duty.<br><br>Civil Case No. N-6659 stated a cause of action: <i>first,</i> plaintiff (Respondent Feliciano) had a right to apply for an injunction to enjoin a premature foreclosure – a foreclosure before December 27, 2001; <i>second,</i> defendant (petitioner herein) had a duty not to foreclose the mortgage prematurely; <i>third,</i> the alleged breach arose when defendant applied for foreclosure in 1998, three years prior to the stipulated maturity of the loan.<br><br>From the foregoing, it is clear that plaintiff had a cause of action to apply for an injunction on the basis of the alleged breach.&nbsp; In other words, the allegations in the Complaint are <i>sufficient</i> to enable the trial court to grant the relief prayed for.&nbsp; Therefore, we do not agree that there was a "failure to state a cause of action"; on the contrary, there was no "insufficiency of allegations" in the pleading.<br><br>To repeat, the actual ground for dismissal was the insufficiency of the <i>factual basis</i> for the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; It may be raised at any time after the questions of fact shall have been resolved on the basis of stipulations, <i>admissions</i>, or evidence presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Usually, the declaration that a plaintiff failed to establish a cause of action is postponed until <i>after</i> the parties are given the opportunity to present all relevant evidence on questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the First Case, the trial judge clearly deviated from the usual course when he dismissed the Complaint on the ground of "failure to <i>establish</i> its cause of action" without giving the parties an opportunity to present their evidence.&nbsp; Under the special circumstances of this case, however, we find that the absence of a trial did not substantively deprive the respondents of their day in court.<br><br>Notably, the Complaint (and its Annexes) admitted that respondents' own default triggered the acceleration clause of the mortgage Contract.&nbsp; An acceleration clause is a stipulation stating that, on the occasion of the mortgagors' default, the whole sum remaining unpaid automatically becomes due and payable.&nbsp; The presence and activation of the acceleration clause, the validity of which was never questioned by respondents, negates their contention that the foreclosure was premature.<br><br>To state it simply, respondents are saying in their own pleading that the breach committed by petitioner bank is actually justified in the light of their breach of the agreement on the monthly installments.&nbsp; Hence, on the basis of their admission of their breach of their own obligations to the bank, the trial court found that petitioner had a right to foreclose the mortgage.<br><br>This is not a flimsy conclusion arrived at by the trial court.&nbsp; It is a fact derived from respondents' Complaint and its Annexes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Being in the nature of a judicial admission made in the course of the proceedings, it <i>did not</i> require proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This factual admission in the pleadings on record dispensed with the need for petitioner to present evidence to prove the admitted fact.<br><br>Moreover, findings of fact are not unbendingly postponed until after trial, but may be made as soon as there is sufficient evidence available.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, the evidence that the trial court needed in order to make a decision on the matter was the admission contained in respondents' Complaint and its Annexes.<br><br>Although the procedure in the RTC was not conducted in the usual manner, this Court is not prepared to say that it deprived respondents of their right to due process.&nbsp; The factual finding that they defaulted on their monthly payments for a period of fifteen months was their own uncontroverted admission.&nbsp; If the trial court's factual finding was wrong, respondents should have sought a reconsideration of the matter by showing that no such admission was made, or that it was made through a palpable mistake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration was the remedy provided them by law, but they took no such action.&nbsp; Thus, they are bound by their admission. On this basis, the trial court cannot be completely faulted for concluding that they failed to establish their cause of action.<br><br>What transpired in the court below is akin to a judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; A judgment on the pleadings may be rendered by the court either on motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the plaintiff or <i>motu proprio</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Such judgment is based exclusively upon the pleadings without introduction of evidence; therefore, it is proper whenever it appears that there is no controverted factual issue.<br><br>There was no controverted factual issue in the First Case because, in filing a Motion to Dismiss, petitioner was hypothetically admitting all the allegations in the Complaint.&nbsp; Although no motion for a judgment on the pleadings was filed by respondents, the trial court -- on the authority akin to that granted by Rule 18 Section&nbsp; 2(g) --decided <i>motu proprio</i> to render a judgment on the pleadings.<br><br>The only difference between what transpired in Civil Case No. N-6659 and a Rule 34 judgment on the pleadings is the absence of an answer in the former; instead, what was filed was a motion to dismiss.&nbsp; This procedural flaw could have injured, not the plaintiff (Respondent Feliciano), but the defendant (petitioner herein), because a judgment was rendered without giving it the opportunity to counter plaintiffï¿½s factual allegations.&nbsp; Considering, however, that the defendant did not object to this procedural lapse, it is clear that it had waived whatever procedural injury was caused by the court's action.<br><br><u><i><b>Dismissal on the Ground of<br>Failure to Establish Cause of Action,<br>a Judgment on the Merits</b></i></u><br><br>The CA ruled that Civil Case No. N-6659 did not operate as <i>res judicata</i>, because <i>no trial</i> had ever been conducted in the trial court; hence, no judgment on the merits could have possibly been issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>While it is indisputable that there was no trial on the merits in Civil Case No. N-6659, the ruling was nonetheless a judgment on the merits.&nbsp; <i>Escarte v. Office of the President</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> held that a ruling based on a motion to dismiss, without any trial on the merits or formal presentation of evidence, can still be a judgment on the merits.<br><br>"Merits" has been defined as a matter of substance in law, as distinguished from a matter of form; it refers to the real or substantial grounds of action or defense, as contrasted with some technical or collateral matter raised in the course of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; A judgment is "on the merits" when it amounts to a legal declaration of the respective rights and duties of the parties, based upon the disclosed facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In <i>Allied Banking Corporation v. CA,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the trial court, after finding that "on the basis of the allegations of the Complaint, there [was] really no cause of action against defendant Alano,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; granted the Motion to Dismiss.&nbsp; Four months later, the plaintiff (Allied Bank) filed a new Complaint against Alano, which practically restated the causes of action in the earlier case.&nbsp; Both the trial and the appellate courts found that the filing of the second case was barred by <i>res judicata</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; The issue presented before the Court was whether the CA erred in affirming the dismissal of the second case on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner contended that the judgment dismissing the earlier case for failure to state a cause of action was not a judgment on the merits.<br><br>In denying the Petition, this Court held that, although the Complaint had stated a cause of action, its allegations showed that Alano had not incurred any liability at all.&nbsp; The <i>dismissal was on the merits</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> because "it unequivocally determined the rights and obligations of the [bank] and [Alano] with respect to the causes of action and the subject matter of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the Complaint in the present Civil Case No. N-6659 alleged a cause of action, but since plaintiff himself showed through his allegations that defendant had not incurred any liability, the trial court dismissed the Complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through its Order of Dismissal, the RTC ruled on the issue presented before it -- the propriety of foreclosing the mortgaged property.&nbsp; Relevant portions of the Order are quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>"Paragraph 5 of the complaint clearly show[s] that the [respondent] has not paid the amortizations due from December 1996 up to March 1998 or a period covering 15 months.&nbsp; Paragraph 4 of the promissory notes executed by the [respondent] also disclose[s] that the [respondent] agreed that in case of default in the payment of any of the installments and advance interest, the whole sum remaining unpaid shall automatically become due and payable.&nbsp; As it appears that there is a clear admission on the part of [respondent] that [he] failed to settle to the fullest [his] obligation, foreclosure is valid.&nbsp; Foreclosure is valid where the debtors, as in this case, are in default in the payment of their obligation.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"x x x. In the case at bench, we fail to see any reason why the foreclosure of the mortgages should be enjoined.&nbsp; On the face of the clear admission of [respondent] that they were unable to settle their obligations which were secured by the mortgages, [petitioners] have a clear right to foreclose the mortgages[,] which is the remedy provided for by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>Contrary to the findings of the appellate court, the dismissal of Civil Case No. N-6659 was a dismissal on the merits.&nbsp; The Order was based on the finding that the Complaint contained an admission that respondents had violated the terms of the Mortgage Contract, a violation that gave petitioner the right to foreclose the mortgaged property.&nbsp; The judgment was on the merits, because it ruled that petitioner's defense was substantial enough to overcome the relief sought by respondents. The Order applied the law to the facts as stated in the Complaint; it was and is thus conclusive on the propriety of foreclosure and determinative of the legal rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the mortgage.&nbsp; The Order definitively put an end to the controversy and barred any&nbsp; subsequent action on the same subject matter.<br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the ground for dismissal in the First Case was the "failure to state a cause of action," that particular Order of Dismissal was still a judgment on the merits and operated as <i>res judicata</i> on a subsequent case.<br><br>In <i>Manalo v.

This fact explains why they are also claiming the balance of the loan, instead of merely asking for the nullification of the foreclosure of their property.&nbsp; Together with Columbia College, Inc., they are interested in annulling the contracted loan and in preventing the foreclosure of the properties.<br><br>Moreover, we find that Columbia College, Inc. claimed that it had mortgaged <i>its</i> properties to petitioner bank and executed the Promissory Note.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Reconciling this fact with the finding of the CA that respondents were the mortgagors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> we can only come to the conclusion that they and Columbia College were not only common debtors; all of them were also mortgagors.<br><br>Therefore, they were all parties to the same Contract, protecting the same interests, and seeking the same relief.&nbsp; Clearly, the actions were instituted for the protection of the <i>common interest</i> of respondents in the loan and the mortgage.&nbsp; They shared an identity of interest from which flowed an identity of relief sought; that is, to have the foreclosure nullified. Their identity of interest in the loan and the mortgaged property is enough to hold them privy-in-law; this fact meets the substantive requisite of identity of parties.<br><br>That the children-respondents were not joined in the First Case is not enough to show that there is no identity of parties.

Hence, respondents can no longer assail the validity of the foreclosure on the ground of prematurity.<br><br>The second cause of action in the Third Case (recovery of the balance of the loan) is likewise identical with that in the First Case.&nbsp; Respondents allege that petitioner bank released only P5.2 million of the total P7.42 million agreed upon;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> thus, there was a breach of the Contract.&nbsp; What respondents are saying is that petitioner has no right to foreclose, on the ground that it has yet to comply fully with its obligation.&nbsp; In other words, the foreclosure is allegedly premature and invalid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; In order to sustain their claim, respondents should have presented proof that petitioner had no right to foreclose at the time of their application.&nbsp; It will be recalled that this was the same proof needed to sustain the claim in the First Case.&nbsp; Since the same evidence sustains both actions, they are considered to be the same for purposes of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br>Moreover, the alleged failure of petitioner bank to release the balance of the loan was a fact already in existence at the time that the First Case was filed in court.&nbsp; If petitioner had really violated the terms of the loan agreement, this fact should have been pleaded by respondents in the First Case. If true, such fact bolstered the claim of respondents that petitioner had no right to foreclose.
