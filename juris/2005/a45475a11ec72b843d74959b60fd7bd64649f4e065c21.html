In their Complaint, the Gibe spouses alleged, among other things, the following:<br><blockquote>1. In 1992 they acquired a parcel of land (the property) from the heirs of the late Judge Gregorio Lantin, designated as Lot 1-B-153-A with an area of approximately 27,064 square meters (sq. m.).<br><br>2. The property was originally part of Lot 1-B-153 with an area of approximately 34,829 sq. m., which was subdivided into seven parcels in 1989 among Judge Lantin and four of his tenants as follows:<br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td style="text-align: left; text-decoration: underline;" width="35%">Lot No.</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="42%"><div align="center">Tenant/Owner/Claimant</div></td><td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="23%"><div align="center">Area <br>(in sq. m.)</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-A</td><td>Gregorio Lantin</td><td><div align="right">27,064</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-B</td><td>Felix Victoria</td><td><div align="right">883</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-C</td><td>Guillermo Becina</td><td><div align="right">3,900</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-D</td><td>Juan Becina</td><td><div align="right">2,019</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-E</td><td>Felix Victoria</td><td><div align="right">624</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-F</td><td>Eusebio Arida</td><td><div align="right">224</div></td></tr><tr><td>1-B-153-G </td><td>Gregorio Lantin</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">115</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">Total Area</div></td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">34,829</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>Felix Victoria, now deceased, was the husband of Isidra Victoria.&nbsp; All the defendants in the Ejectment Case, as former tenants, were given home lots, while Lot 1-B-153-A which was allotted to Gregorio Lantin was sold to the spouses Gibe.<br><br>3. In the course of fencing Lot 1-B-153-A, it was discovered that the Victoria house was standing on the northwestern portion of the property; that Mrs. Victoria was harvesting and picking fruits from the citrus trees&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;planted in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Gibe spouses; and that Eusebio Arida, Juan Becina and Guillermo Becina were also surreptitiously planting palay on the northwestern portion.<br><br>4. The fencing was discontinued after the children of Mrs. Victoria threatened to shoot at the workers of the Gibe spouses with an armalite rifle, leaving approximately 8,000 sq. m. of the northwestern portion of Lot 1-B-153-A open and unfenced.<br></blockquote>In her Answer (With Motion to Dismiss),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Mrs. Victoria denied having entered Judge Lantin’s lot alleged to have been purchased by the spouses Gibe, claiming that her farmhouse was constructed on the very lot awarded to her family by the DAR. Moving thus for the dismissal of the Ejectment Case for lack of cause of action, she interposed a counterclaim praying that, as a tenant of Judge Lantin, she be maintained in the peaceful possession and cultivation of her lot or, in the alternative, awarded disturbance compensation; and, in either event, reimbursed for the expenses she incurred as a result of the Ejectment Case.<br><br>At the Preliminary Conference of the Ejectment Case, the parties mutually agreed to a relocation survey of the property to be conducted by a geodetic engineer.<br><br>After the court-appointed geodetic engineer had submitted the results of the relocation survey, Mrs. Victoria and her co-defendants in the Ejectment Case filed a Manifestation with Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> requesting the trial court to allow them to engage the services of an independent surveyor, at their expense, to conduct another survey.

The petitioner actively participated in all stages of the instant case, setting up a counterclaim and asking for affirmative relief in his answer.

After relying on the jurisdiction of the regular courts, he cannot be permitted to turn around and question it.</span> It is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In the present case, neither petitioner nor his predecessor-in-interest submitted evidence to substantiate the existence of the essential requisites of tenancy.

Considering that petitioner’s predecessor-in-interest actively participated in the proceedings before the MTC and invoked its jurisdiction to secure an affirmative relief, petitioner cannot now turn around and question that court’s jurisdiction.<br><br>Finally, this Court notes with consternation petitioner’s attempts, with the aid of his counsel, Atty.
