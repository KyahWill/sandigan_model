				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the February 19, 2001 decision of the Court of Appeals granting a petition, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39112, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Manuel Carbonell Phua v. The Presiding Judges, Branches 10 and 11, Regional Trial Court, Cebu City, et al,</span>” for Annulment of Judgment of the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu City, Branch 11 which declared null and void a transfer certificate of title covering a 5,311 square meters of land in Cebu City subject of the present case, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari was lodged before this Court.<br><br>The material antecedents of the case are as follows:<br><br>The Spouses Enemesio Emerillo and Urbana Taborada (Amarillo Spouses or Spouses Amarillo), registered owners of subject lot, Lot 7746 of the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cadastral Survey of Cebu which was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. RT-7585, conveyed the same on July 9, 1975 to herein respondent Manuel Carbonell Phua (Phua), following which or on July 14, 1975, the Amarillo Spouses’ title was cancelled and, in its place, TCT No. 62176 was issued in the name of Phua.<br><br>More than a decade later or on June 22, 1987, the Heirs of Josefa Gacho Pacaña (Heirs of Pacaña), claiming that the subject&nbsp; lot was originally decreed under Decree No. 74768 issued in 1919, to be registered and “apparently” registered under Original Certificate of Title No. 1684 in the name of Josefa Gacho after she had died, filed before the RTC of Cebu City a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for Declaration of Nullity of Title and Annulment of the Deed of Sale covering subject lot against the Spouses Amarillo and Phua, docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-6057.<br><br>Summons together with copy of the complaint was served to the therein defendants Spouses Amarillo but not to Phua who was unknown at his given address at Salinas Compound, Salinas Drive, Lahug, Cebu City.<br><br>The Branch Clerk of Branch 11 of the RTC Cebu City, to which Civil Case No. CEB-6057 was raffled, thus effected service of summons to Phua by postal service but the same failed, drawing the Heirs of Pacaña to file a motion to effect service of summons by publication which motion was granted.<br><br>Summons and a copy of the complaints were accordingly published once a week for three consecutive weeks or on October 17, 24, 31, 1988 in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Visayan Herald</span>.<br><br>No answer having been received from Phua within the reglementary period, the trial court declared him in default and the Heirs of Pacaña were allowed to, as they did, present their evidence<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex-parte</span>.<br><br>By Decision of April 3, 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the therein plaintiff Heirs of Pacaña.&nbsp; A copy of the decision was served to the therein defendants Amarillo Spouses and Phua by publication in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Freeman</span>, a newspaper printed in Cebu City and circulated in the provinces and cities of Cebu and in the rest of the Visayas and Mindanao.<br><br>The decision was declared to have become final and executory on August 19, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Acting upon the motion of the Heirs of Pacaña for declaration of compliance with P.D.

Phua asseverated that in 1988, he was employed as Managing Director Syanibat Malayan Adjustment Co., Edu Blvd., Bldg., Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia when the summons was served by publication in a Cebu newspaper.&nbsp; In 1975, he bought Lot 7746 from Spouses Amarillo when he spent his vacation in the house of his brother-in-law at Salinas Compound, Lahug, Cebu City.&nbsp; Instead of using 957-B C. Aragon St., Malate, Manila, which was his residence at the time of the purchase, he merely stated in the Deed of Absolute Sale that he is a resident of Cebu City.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Juanito C. Mendoza, his brother-in-law transferred residence to 26 Paseo Annabelle, Maria Luisa Estate Park, Banilad, Cebu City sometime in 1976.&nbsp; He is presently residing at 31 Vicente R. Jayme St., BF Resort/Vista Grande Village, Las Piñas, Metro Manila.<br><br>Phua further claimed that the service of summons by publication suffered from fatal defects, namely:&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motion</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">service</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">summons</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">publication</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supported</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affidavit</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stating</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grounds</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">application</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">violation</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">19</span>; (2)</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">editor’s</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affidavit</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">state</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;

(Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>By the present assailed decision, the Court of Appeals ruled in Phua’s favor in this wise:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">First.&nbsp;</span> a careful scrutiny of the pleadings showed that the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;motion for leave to serve summons to Phua by publication was granted by the court (Memorandum for Respondents, p. 4, Rollo, p. 406) although it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supported</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affidavit</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">setting</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forth</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grounds</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relied</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">upon</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">plaintiffs</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effect</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">such</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">service</span>.&nbsp; (Annex 7, Memorandum for Respondents, p. 438)<br><br>Respondents, on their part, argued that Phua was not an unknown defendant under the contemplation of Section 16, Rule 14, which provides:<br><blockquote>“Whenever the defendant is designated as an unknown owner, or the like, or whenever the address of a defendant is unknown and cannot be ascertained by diligent inquiry, service may, by leave of court, be effected upon him by publication in a newspaper of general circulation and such places and for such time as the court may order.”<br></blockquote>The respondents further asserted that the foregoing circumstances (<span style="font-style: italic;">unknown owner, defendant whose address is unknown and cannot be ascertained by diligent inquiry</span>) were absent.&nbsp; Certainly, Phua was a known buyer of Lot 7746 but he indicated an erroneous address in a public document.&nbsp; No less than the branch clerk of court and the process server exerted diligent efforts to serve the summons by personal service and postal service.&nbsp; They regarded these as substantial compliance with the rules.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">19,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">categorical</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">requiring</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">said</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;

Ineludible, this Court has no authority to dispense with such mandatory requirement.&nbsp; The law is unambiguous and its rationale clear.&nbsp; Time and again, this Court has declared that where the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no room for interpretation, vacillation or equivocation; there is room only for application.&nbsp; There is no alternative.&nbsp; The respondents cannot proffer excuse and rely on the efforts exerted by the personnel of the court who were not remised in their duties.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second.</span>&nbsp;

Court of Appeals, et al., 303 SCRA 278, 286 citing Sadang and Lachica v. Government Service Insurance System, 18 SCRA 491, 494</span>, the Supreme Court ruled that the customary affidavit of the editor of “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voz de Manial,</span>” duly introduced in evidence, that it was published in a newspaper of general circulation constitutes <span style="font-weight: bold;">prima facie</span> evidence of such fact.&nbsp; In another case, the High Tribunal regarded the affidavit of publication, executed by the publisher, business/advertising manager of the Luzon Weekly Courier, which states that it is a newspaper of general circulation in Rizal, as sufficient to consider the newspaper one of general circulation.&nbsp; (Bonnevie et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al., 125 SCRA 122)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suit,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;
