				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated June 13, 2000 and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 31, 2001 rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 32624, entitled "<span style="font-style: italic;">Metro Properties, Inc. vs. Home Insurance and Guaranty Corp. and Magallanes Village Association, Inc</span>.."<br><br>The factual antecedents as borne by the records are:<br><br>On September 9, 1993, Magallanes Village Association, Inc., <span style="font-style: italic;">respondent</span>, filed with the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation (HIGC) a complaint for injunction and damages with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or preliminary injunction against Metro Properties, Inc., <span style="font-style: italic;">petitioner</span>, docketed as HIGC Case No. HOA-93-046.<br><br>The complaint alleges that Makati Development Corporation sold to petitioner two (2) lots situated at No. 244 EDSA corner Victoria Street, Magallanes Village, Makati City, covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) No. 160184 and 160185 of the Registry of Deeds, same city.  A Deed of Restrictions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> annotated on both titles, provides that "the owner of these lots or his successors in interest is required to be and is automatically a member of the Magallanes Village Association, and must abide by such rules and regulation laid down by the Association in the interest of the sanitation, security and the general welfare of the community."  It also provides that "buildings shall not be higher than nine (9) meters, measured from the highest level of the grade of the lot at the time of acquisition"; and that "all building plans must be approved by the Association before construction begins."<br><br>On April 2, 1993, petitioner filed with respondent an application for major renovation/repair permit with a detailed plan of renovation/repair work which includes the installation of a proposed roof with a 1.50 meter maximum height or elevation from the building's roof deck.  Respondent approved petitioner's application.<br><br>Subsequently or on August 25, 1993, respondent's Manager and Head of Security conducted an inspection and found that petitioner violated the approved renovation/repair plan by surreptitiously increasing the roof's maximum height or elevation from 1.50 to 3.705 meters.   As a consequence, respondent sent a notice to petitioner demanding that the construction be discontinued since it poses a serious danger to the residents of Magallanes Village considering that the structure exceeded the allowable height of nine (9) meters pursuant to the Deed of Restrictions.   However, despite such demand, petitioner refused to discontinue its renovation/repair work, prompting respondent to file with the HIGC a complaint for injunction and damages with prayer for issuance of a TRO and/or preliminary injunction.<br><br>Acting thereon, the HIGC, on September 17, 1993, issued a TRO and then set on September 23, 1993 the hearing of respondent's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>On September 27, 1993, petitioner filed an answer to respondent's complaint, denying specifically the allegations therein, coupled with a motion for preliminary hearing of the following affirmative defenses:  (1) that the HIGC has no jurisdiction over the case; (2) that the complaint fails to state respondent's legal personality to sue and/or enforce the Deed of Restrictions; (3) that the Deed of Restrictions is unenforceable since it was not annotated on TCT Nos. 160184 and 160185; and (4) that no certification against forum shopping has been attached to the complaint, in violation of Supreme Court Circular 28-91.   Petitioner prayed that the complaint be dismissed.<br><br>In a Resolution dated October 7, 1993, the HIGC ruled that under Executive Order No. 535, a controversy between a homeowner association and its member falls within its exclusive jurisdiction.   The HIGC also held that "the other special defenses, as to the personality of the complainant to institute the case, the unenforceability of the alleged restrictions, not being annotated, and the violation of the Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91" are "insufficient to warrant the summary dismissal of the complaint."<br><br>On November 18, 1993, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari and prohibition (with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction) alleging that in ruling that it has jurisdiction over the case, the HIGC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>On June 13, 2000, the Appellate Court rendered a Decision dismissing the petition.   In finding that the HIGC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in assuming jurisdiction over the case, the Court of Appeals ratiocinated as follows:<br><blockquote>"The petition is unmeritorious.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                                                                 x x x<br><br>SECOND.
