				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is the petition for certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court by petitioner GULF RESORTS, INC., against respondent PHILIPPINE CHARTER INSURANCE CORPORATION.  Petitioner assails the appellate court decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which dismissed its two appeals and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<br><br>For review are the warring interpretations of petitioner and respondent on the scope of the insurance company’s liability for earthquake damage to petitioner’s properties.  Petitioner avers that, pursuant to its earthquake shock endorsement rider, Insurance Policy No. 31944 covers all damages to the properties within its resort caused by earthquake.  Respondent contends that the rider limits its liability for loss to the two swimming pools of petitioner.<br><br>The facts as established by the court a quo, and affirmed by the appellate court are as follows:<br><blockquote>[P]laintiff is the owner of the Plaza Resort situated at Agoo, La Union and had its properties in said resort insured originally with the American Home Assurance Company (AHAC-AIU).  In the first four insurance policies issued by AHAC-AIU from 1984-85; 1985-86; 1986-1987; and 1987-88 (Exhs. “C”, “D”, “E” and “F”; also Exhs. “1”, “2”, “3” and “4” respectively), the risk of loss from earthquake shock was extended only to plaintiff’s two swimming pools, thus, “earthquake shock endt.” (Item 5 only) (Exhs. “C-1”; “D-1,” and “E” and two (2) swimming pools only (Exhs. “C-1”; ‘D-1”, “E” and “F-1”). “Item 5” in those policies referred to the two (2) swimming pools only (Exhs. “1-B”, “2-B”, “3-B” and “F-2”); that subsequently AHAC(AIU) issued in plaintiff’s favor Policy No. 206-4182383-0 covering the period March 14, 1988 to March 14, 1989 (Exhs. “G” also “G-1”) and in said policy the earthquake endorsement clause as indicated in Exhibits “C-1”, “D-1”, Exhibits “E” and “F-1” was deleted and the entry under Endorsements/Warranties at the time of issue read that plaintiff renewed its policy with AHAC (AIU)  for the period of March 14, 1989 to March 14, 1990 under Policy No. 206-4568061-9 (Exh. “H”) which carried the entry under “Endorsement/Warranties at Time of Issue”, which read “Endorsement to Include Earthquake Shock (Exh. “6-B-1”) in the amount of P10,700.00 and paid P42,658.14 (Exhs. “6-A” and “6-B”) as premium thereof, computed as follows:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="55%">Item -P7,691,000.00 -</td> <td width="45%">on the Clubhouse only @ .392%;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>1,500,000.00 - </td> <td>on the furniture, etc. contained in the building above-mentioned@ .490%;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>393,000.00-</td> <td>on the two swimming pools, only (against the peril of earthquake shock only) @ 0.100%</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>116,600.00-</td> <td>other buildings include as follows:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>a) Tilter House-</td> <td>P19,800.00- 0.551%</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>b) Power House- </td> <td>P41,000.00-0.551%</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>c) House Shed- </td> <td>P55,000.00 -0.540%</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>P100,000.00</td> <td>for furniture, fixtures, lines air-con and operating equipment</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>that plaintiff agreed to insure with defendant    the properties covered by AHAC (AIU) Policy No. 206-4568061-9 (Exh. “H”) provided that the policy wording and rates in said policy be copied in the policy to be issued by defendant; that defendant issued Policy No. 31944 to plaintiff covering the period of March 14, 1990 to March 14, 1991 for P10,700,600.00 for a total premium of P45,159.92 (Exh. “I”); that in the computation of the premium, defendant’s Policy No. 31944 (Exh. “I”), which is the policy in question, contained on the right-hand upper portion of page 7 thereof, the following:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="55%">Rate-Various</td> <td width="45%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Premium -</td> <td>P37,420.60 F/L</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td>2,061.52 – Typhoon</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td>1,030.76 – EC</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td>393.00 – ES</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Doc.

Respondent instructed petitioner to file a formal claim, then assigned the investigation of the claim to an independent claims adjuster, Bayne Adjusters and Surveyors, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On July 30, 1990, respondent, through its adjuster, requested petitioner to    submit various documents in support of its claim.  On August 7, 1990, Bayne Adjusters and Surveyors, Inc., through its Vice-President A.R. de Leon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> rendered a preliminary report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> finding extensive damage caused by the earthquake to the clubhouse and to the two swimming pools.  Mr. de Leon stated that “except for the swimming pools, all affected items have no coverage for earthquake shocks.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On August 11, 1990, petitioner filed its formal demand<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for settlement of the damage to all its properties in the Agoo Playa Resort.  On August 23, 1990, respondent denied petitioner’s claim on the ground that its insurance policy only afforded earthquake shock coverage to the two swimming pools of the resort.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petitioner and respondent failed to arrive at a settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thus, on January 24, 1991, petitioner filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> with the regional trial court of Pasig praying for the payment of the following:<br><blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">1.) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">The sum of P5,427,779.00, representing losses sustained by the insured properties, with interest thereon, as computed under par. 29 of the policy (Annex “B”) until fully paid; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">2.) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The sum of P428,842.00 per month, representing continuing losses sustained by plaintiff on account of defendant’s refusal to pay the claims;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">3.)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The sum of P500,000.00, by way of exemplary damages;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">4.)</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify">The sum of P500,000.00 by way of attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"> <br></td> <td valign="top"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">5.)</div></td> <td valign="top"> Costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Respondent filed its Answer with Special and Affirmative Defenses with Compulsory Counterclaims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On February 21, 1994, the lower court after trial ruled in favor of the respondent, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>The above schedule clearly shows that plaintiff paid only a premium of P393.00 against the peril of earthquake shock, the same premium it paid against earthquake shock only on the two swimming pools in all the policies issued by AHAC(AIU) (Exhibits “C”, “D”, “E”, “F” and “G”).  From this fact the Court must consequently agree with the position of defendant that the    endorsement rider (Exhibit “7-C”) means that only the two swimming pools were insured against earthquake shock.<br><br>Plaintiff correctly points out that a policy of insurance is a contract of adhesion hence, where the language used in an insurance contract or application is such as to create ambiguity the same should be resolved against the party responsible therefor, i.e., the insurance company which prepared the contract.  To the mind of [the] Court, the language used in the policy in litigation is clear and unambiguous hence there is no need for interpretation or construction but only application of the provisions therein.<br><br>From the above observations the Court finds that only the two (2) swimming pools had earthquake shock coverage and were heavily damaged by the earthquake which struck on July 16, 1990.  Defendant having admitted that the damage to the swimming pools was appraised by defendant’s adjuster at P386,000.00, defendant must, by virtue of the contract of insurance, pay plaintiff said amount.<br><br>Because it is the finding of the Court as stated in the immediately preceding paragraph that defendant is liable only for the damage caused to the two (2) swimming pools and that defendant has made known to plaintiff its willingness and readiness to settle said liability, there is no basis for the grant of the other damages prayed for by plaintiff. As to the counterclaims of defendant, the Court does not agree that the action filed by plaintiff is baseless and highly speculative since such action is a lawful exercise of the plaintiff’s right to come to Court in the honest belief that their Complaint is meritorious.  The prayer, therefore, of defendant for damages is likewise denied.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, defendant is ordered to pay plaintiffs the sum of THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P386,000.00) representing damage to the two (2) swimming pools, with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the filing of the Complaint until defendant’s obligation to plaintiff is fully paid. <br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration was denied.  Thus, petitioner filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals based on the following assigned errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT CAN ONLY RECOVER FOR THE DAMAGE TO ITS TWO SWIMMING POOLS UNDER ITS FIRE POLICY NO. 31944, CONSIDERING ITS PROVISIONS, THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ISSUANCE OF SAID POLICY AND THE ACTUATIONS OF THE PARTIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE EARTHQUAKE OF JULY 16, 1990.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT’S RIGHT TO RECOVER UNDER DEFENDANT-APPELLEE’S POLICY (NO. 31944; EXH “I”) BY LIMITING ITSELF TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE SAID POLICY <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ISOLATED </span>FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING ITS ISSUANCE AND THE ACTUATIONS OF THE PARTIES AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE OF JULY 16, 1990.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT IS ENTITLED TO THE DAMAGES CLAIMED, WITH INTEREST COMPUTED AT 24% PER ANNUM ON CLAIMS ON PROCEEDS OF POLICY.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On the other hand, respondent filed a partial appeal, assailing the lower court’s failure to award it attorney’s fees and damages on its compulsory counterclaim.<br><br>After review, the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court and ruled, thus:<br><blockquote>However, after carefully perusing the documentary evidence of both parties, We are not convinced that the last two (2) insurance contracts (Exhs. “G” and “H”), which the plaintiff-appellant had with AHAC (AIU) and upon which the subject insurance contract with Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation is said to have been based and copied (Exh. “I”), covered an extended earthquake shock insurance on all the insured properties.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>We also find that the Court a quo was correct in not granting the plaintiff-appellant’s prayer for the imposition of interest – 24% on the insurance claim and 6% on loss of income allegedly amounting to P4,280,000.00.  Since the defendant-appellant has expressed its willingness to pay the damage caused on the two (2) swimming pools, as the Court a quo and this Court correctly found it to be liable only, it then cannot be said that it was in default and therefore liable for interest.<br><br>Coming to the defendant-appellant’s prayer for an attorney’s fees, long-standing is the rule that the award thereof is subject to the sound discretion of the court.  Thus, if such discretion is well-exercised, it will not be disturbed on appeal (Castro et al. v. CA, et al., G.R. No. 115838, July 18, 2002).  Moreover, being the award thereof an exception rather than a rule, it is necessary for the court to make findings of facts and law that would bring the case within the exception and justify the grant of such award (Country Bankers Insurance Corp. v. Lianga Bay and Community Multi-Purpose Coop., Inc., G.R. No. 136914, January 25, 2002).  Therefore, holding that the plaintiff-appellant’s action is not baseless and highly speculative, We find that the Court a quo did not err in granting the same.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, both appeals are hereby DISMISSED and judgment of the Trial Court hereby AFFIRMED in toto.  No costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed the present petition raising the following issues:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY HELD THAT UNDER RESPONDENT’S INSURANCE POLICY NO. 31944, ONLY THE TWO (2) SWIMMING POOLS, RATHER THAN ALL THE PROPERTIES COVERED THEREUNDER, ARE INSURED AGAINST THE RISK OF EARTHQUAKE SHOCK.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY DENIED PETITIONER’S PRAYER FOR DAMAGES WITH INTEREST THEREON AT THE RATE CLAIMED, ATTORNEY’S FEES AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner contends:<br><br><b>First</b>, that the policy’s earthquake shock endorsement clearly covers all of the properties insured and not only the swimming pools.  It used the words “any property insured by this policy,” and it should be interpreted as all inclusive.<br><br><b>Second</b>, the unqualified and unrestricted nature of the earthquake shock endorsement is confirmed in the body of the insurance policy itself, which states that it is “[s]ubject to: Other Insurance Clause, Typhoon Endorsement, Earthquake Shock Endt., Extended Coverage Endt., FEA Warranty &amp; Annual Payment Agreement On Long Term Policies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>Third</b>, that the qualification referring to the two swimming pools had already been deleted in the earthquake shock endorsement.<br><br><b>Fourth</b>, it is unbelievable for respondent to claim that it only made an inadvertent omission when it deleted the said qualification.<br><br><b>Fifth</b>, that the earthquake shock endorsement rider should be given precedence over the wording of the insurance policy, because the rider is the more deliberate expression of the agreement of the contracting parties.<br><br><b>Sixth</b>, that in their previous insurance policies, limits were placed on the endorsements/warranties enumerated at the time of issue.<br><br><b>Seventh</b>, any ambiguity in the earthquake shock endorsement should be resolved in favor of petitioner and against respondent.  It was respondent which caused the ambiguity when it made the policy in issue.<br><br><b>Eighth</b>, the qualification of the endorsement limiting the earthquake shock endorsement should be interpreted as a caveat on the standard fire insurance policy, such as to remove the two swimming pools from the coverage for the risk of fire.  It should not be used to limit the respondent’s liability for earthquake shock to the two swimming pools only.<br><br><b>Ninth</b>, there is no basis for the appellate court to hold that the additional premium was not paid under the extended coverage.  The premium for the earthquake shock coverage was already included in the premium paid for the policy.<br><br><b>Tenth</b>, the parties’ contemporaneous and subsequent acts show that they intended to extend earthquake shock coverage to all insured properties.  When it secured an insurance policy from respondent, petitioner told respondent that it wanted an exact replica of its latest insurance policy from American Home Assurance Company (AHAC-AIU), which covered all the resort’s properties for earthquake shock damage and respondent agreed.  After the July 16, 1990 earthquake, respondent assured petitioner that it was covered for earthquake shock.  Respondent’s insurance adjuster, Bayne Adjusters and Surveyors, Inc., likewise requested petitioner to submit the necessary documents for its building claims and other repair costs.  Thus, under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, it cannot deny that the insurance policy it issued to petitioner covered all of the properties within the resort.<br><br><b>Eleventh</b>, that it is proper for it to avail of a petition for review by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court as its remedy, and there is no need for calibration of the evidence in order to establish the facts upon which this petition is based.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent made the following counter arguments:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>First</b>, none of the previous policies issued by AHAC-AIU from 1983 to 1990 explicitly extended coverage against earthquake shock to petitioner’s insured properties other than on the two swimming pools. Petitioner admitted that from 1984 to 1988, only the two swimming pools were insured against earthquake shock. From 1988 until 1990, the provisions in its policy were practically identical to its earlier policies, and there was no increase in the premium paid. AHAC-AIU, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> by its representative Manuel C. Quijano, categorically stated that its previous policy, from which respondent’s policy was copied, covered only earthquake shock for the two swimming pools.<br><br><b>Second</b>, petitioner’s payment of additional premium in the amount of P393.00 shows that the policy only covered earthquake shock damage on the two swimming pools.  The amount was the same amount paid by petitioner for earthquake shock coverage on the two swimming pools from 1990-1991.  No additional premium was paid to warrant coverage of the other properties in the resort.<br><br><b>Third</b>, the deletion of the phrase pertaining to the limitation of the earthquake shock endorsement to the two swimming pools in the policy schedule did not expand the earthquake shock coverage to all of petitioner’s properties.  As per its agreement with petitioner, respondent copied its policy from the AHAC-AIU policy provided by petitioner.  Although the first five policies contained the said qualification in their rider’s title, in the last two policies, this qualification in the title was deleted. AHAC-AIU, through Mr. J. Baranda III, stated that such deletion was a mere inadvertence.  This inadvertence did not make the policy incomplete, nor did it broaden the scope of the endorsement whose descriptive title was merely enumerated.  Any ambiguity in the policy can be easily resolved by looking at the other provisions, specially the enumeration of the items insured, where only the two swimming pools were noted as covered for earthquake shock damage.<br><br><b>Fourth</b>, in its Complaint, petitioner alleged that in its policies from 1984 through 1988, the phrase “Item 5 – P393,000.00 – on the two swimming pools only (against the peril of earthquake shock only)” meant that only the swimming pools were insured for earthquake damage.  The same phrase is used in toto in the policies from 1989 to 1990, the only difference being the designation of the two swimming pools as “Item 3.”<br><br><b>Fifth</b>, in order for the earthquake shock endorsement to be effective, premiums must be paid for all the properties covered. In all of its seven insurance policies, petitioner only paid P393.00 as premium for coverage of the swimming pools against earthquake shock. No other premium was paid for earthquake shock coverage on the other properties.  In addition, the use of the qualifier “ANY” instead of “ALL” to describe the property covered was done deliberately to enable the parties to specify the properties included for earthquake coverage.<br><br><b>Sixth</b>, petitioner did not inform respondent of its requirement that all of its properties must be included in the earthquake shock coverage.  Petitioner’s own evidence shows that it only required respondent to follow the exact provisions of its previous policy from AHAC-AIU.  Respondent complied with this requirement.  Respondent’s only deviation from the agreement was when it modified the provisions regarding the replacement cost endorsement.  With regard to the issue under litigation, the riders of the old policy and the policy in issue are identical.<br><br><b>Seventh</b>, respondent did not do any act or give any assurance to petitioner as would estop it from maintaining that only the two swimming pools were covered for earthquake shock.  The adjuster’s letter notifying petitioner to present certain documents for its building claims and repair costs was given to petitioner before the adjuster knew the full coverage of its policy.<br><br>Petitioner anchors its claims on AHAC-AIU’s inadvertent deletion of the phrase “Item 5 Only” after the descriptive name or title of the Earthquake Shock Endorsement.  However, the words of the policy reflect the parties’ clear intention to limit earthquake shock coverage to the two swimming pools.<br><br>Before petitioner accepted the policy, it had the opportunity to read its conditions.  It did not object to any deficiency nor did it institute any action to reform the policy.  The policy binds the petitioner.<br><br><b>Eighth</b>, there is no basis for petitioner to claim damages, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.  Since respondent was willing and able to pay for the damage caused on the two swimming pools, it cannot be considered to be in default, and therefore, it is not liable for interest.<br><br>We hold that the petition is devoid of merit.<br><br>In Insurance Policy No. 31944, four key items are important in the resolution of the case at bar.<br><br><b>First</b>, in the designation of location of risk, only the two swimming pools were specified as included, viz:<br><blockquote>ITEM 3 – 393,000.00 – On the two (2) swimming pools only (against the peril of earthquake shock only)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Second</b>, under the breakdown for premium payments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> it was stated that:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="4"><div align="center"><u>PREMIUM RECAPITULATION</u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="25%"><u>ITEM NOS.</u></td> <td width="25%"><u>AMOUNT</u></td> <td width="25%"> <u>RATES</u></td> <td width="25%"><u>PREMIUM</u></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3">x x x </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>393,000.00</td> <td>0.100%-E/S</td> <td>393.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><b>Third</b>, Policy Condition No. 6 stated:<br><br>6.

Thus, the policy extended earthquake shock coverage to all of the insured properties.<br><br>It is basic that all the provisions of the insurance policy should be examined and interpreted in consonance with each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> All its parts are reflective of the true intent of the parties.  The policy cannot be construed piecemeal. Certain stipulations cannot be segregated and then made to control; neither do particular words or phrases necessarily determine its character. Petitioner cannot focus on the earthquake shock endorsement to the exclusion of the other provisions.  All the provisions and riders, taken and interpreted together, indubitably show the intention of the parties to extend earthquake shock coverage to the two swimming pools only.<br><br>A careful examination of the premium recapitulation will show that it is the clear intent of the parties to extend earthquake shock coverage only to the two swimming pools. Section 2(1) of the Insurance Code defines a contract of insurance as an agreement whereby one undertakes for a consideration to indemnify another against loss, damage or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event. Thus, an insurance contract exists where the following elements concur:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>The insured has an insurable interest;<br><br></li><li>The insured is subject to a risk of loss by the happening of the designated peril;<br><br></li><li>The insurer assumes the risk;<br><br></li><li>Such assumption of risk is part of a general scheme to distribute actual losses among a large group of persons bearing a similar risk; and<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In consideration of the insurer's promise, the insured pays a premium</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Emphasis ours</span>)<br></li></ol></blockquote>An insurance premium is the consideration paid an insurer for undertaking to indemnify the insured against a specified peril.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In fire, casualty, and marine insurance, the premium payable becomes a debt as soon as the risk attaches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In the subject policy, no premium payments were made with regard to earthquake shock coverage, except on the two swimming pools.  There is no mention of any premium payable for the other resort properties with regard to earthquake shock.  This is consistent with the history of petitioner’s previous insurance policies from AHAC-AIU.

Petitioner cannot claim it did not know the provisions of the policy.  From the inception of the policy, petitioner had required the respondent to copy verbatim the provisions and terms of its latest insurance policy from AHAC-AIU.  The testimony of Mr. Leopoldo Mantohac, a direct participant in securing the insurance policy of petitioner, is reflective of petitioner’s knowledge, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>DIRECT EXAMINATION OF LEOPOLDO MANTOHAC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br>TSN, September 23, 1991<br>pp. 20-21<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Did you indicate to Atty.

It is true that there was variance in some terms, specifically in the replacement cost endorsement, but the principal provisions of the policy remained essentially similar to AHAC-AIU’s policy.  Consequently, we cannot apply the "fine print" or "contract of adhesion" rule in this case as the parties’ intent to limit the coverage of the policy to the two swimming pools only is not ambiguous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW WHEREOF</span>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
