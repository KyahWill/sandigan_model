He came to know about the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration only when he received a copy of the Administrative Complaint attaching said motion</span>.  The undersigned called a meeting with all the staff to know the circumstances behind the missing pleading.  The court's civil in charge, Thess Banaban, and clerk, Regina Manacas, who received the plaintiff's motion, both claimed that a copy of the motion was given to Mrs. Huerto, who is supposed to forward the same to the office of the Presiding Judge for appropriate action.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The undersigned confronted the OIC, Mrs. Huerto, about the missing motion but she could not explain the whereabouts of the said motion.  She gave a flimsy excuse that it was lost in her table</span>.  It was also stressed during the meeting that any office problem must be immediately brought to the attention of the Presiding Judge.<br><br></li><li> Upon receipt of the Administrative Complaint, the undersigned went over the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and after a cursory perusal thereon, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">admits that there was an <span style="font-weight: bold;">honest mistake or oversight</span> on the part of the undersigned.  Instead of reckoning the 15 days reglementary period from the date of receipt of the defendant's counsel, it should be the date of receipt by the defendant Panlilio</span>;<br><br></li><li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Had the said missing motion for reconsideration brought to the attention of the undersigned, the mistake could have been rectified or corrected.</span>  Unfortunately, the records were forwarded to the Clerk of Court of RTC without the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration;<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><ol start="8"><li> Plaintiff also charged the undersigned for rendering the unjust <span style="font-weight: bold;">interlocutory</span> order dated April 30, 2003 denying her motion for execution and approving defendants' appeal.  Contrary to the contention of the plaintiff, there was no deliberate and malicious intent on the part of the undersigned to <span style="font-weight: bold;">delay</span> (sic) the early disposition of her case.  As borne out by the records, all the pending motions filed before in Civil Case 29181 were acted upon with dispatched.  It is unfair that the court issued the last order which was not favorable to the plaintiff, she accused the undersigned <span style="font-weight: bold;">of delaying</span> (sic) her case;<br><br></li><li> Plaintiff further charged the undersigned for violation of Section 3(E) of the anti-graft and corrupt practices act (R.A. 3019, as amended) allegedly for issuing null and void order of April 30, 2003 and improperly approving a farce appeal after the expiration of the period provided by law which caused undue injury to her and gave the defendants unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in obliging them to satisfy the judgments, showing manifest partiality in the discharge of his judicial functions and violation of Section 1 Article 3 of the  1987 Constitution.<br>x x x The assailed order was issued on the belief of the undersigned that it was the proper order to be issued then.

The Supreme Court in the case of Dizon v. Borja (Adm. Case No. 163-J, January 28, 1971), Justice Makalintal categorically stated that: "to hold a judge administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders, assuming that he has erred, would be nothing short of harassment and would make his position unbearable;<br><br></li><li> Viewed from the foregoing facts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the complaint at bar, if ever understood, is UNFOUNDED and a plain harassment which should be outrightly dismissed</span>.

It is further recommended that the instant case be docketed as a regular administrative matter as against <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent OIC Leonila Huerto finding <span style="font-weight: bold;">her guilty of simple neglect of duty</span> and sentencing her to suffer the penalty of suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day</span>.  A formal investigation is not necessary since the discussion in this case is based on undisputed and admitted facts as disclosed in the complaint and in the comments of the respondents.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In support of its recommendation to dismiss the complaint against respondent Judge, the Court Administrator submits:<br><blockquote>Respondent Judge Bellosillo admitted that his order dated April 30, 2003 denying plaintiff's motion for execution was erroneous.  He should have reckoned the 15-day reglementary period from date of receipt by the defendants of a copy of the decision on April 4, 2003.  He could have rectified his error but he had no opportunity to do so since plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was never referred to him.  He learned of the said motion for reconsideration when he received the administrative complaint that was indorsed to him by the Court Administrator.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With the consideration that he decided Civil Case No. 29181 in favor of the plaintiff and he had disposed of the incidents with dispatch</span> prior to the filing of the motion for reconsideration, and that there being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no showing in the record that his actuation in Civil Case No. 29181 was tainted with bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption</span>, it is not fair and just that he should be held liable for any of the offenses as charged by complainant against him in the instant administrative matter.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In recommending that respondent Huerto be faulted for simple neglect of duty, the OCA submits:<br><blockquote>The vital issue is whether or not the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration in Civil Case No. 29181 was brought to the attention of the respondent judge before the filing of the present administrative matter.  On this issue, the respondent legal researcher OIC Leonila Huerto did not tell the truth in claiming that she did personally refer the motion to the respondent judge for his comment.  She did not mention any specific date.  The motion for reconsideration was filed on June 4, 2003 and set for hearing June 10, 2003.  It is clear from her comment that on the same date June 4, 2003, she did receive the motion for reconsideration which was handed to her by receiving clerk Regina Malacas. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plaintiff and her counsel appeared on June 10, 2003 but they were told by respondent Huerto that the presiding judge was then attending a convention and that their motion for reconsideration was deemed submitted for resolution.  The motion for reconsideration should have been reset for hearing as there was no court order declaring that motion be deemed submitted for resolution</span>.  Evidently, the motion for reconsideration was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not brought to the attention of the respondent Judge Bellosillo during the period from June 4, 2003 to June 10, 2003</span>.<br><br>On June 23, 2003, respondent OIC Huerto forwarded the record of Civil Case No. 29181 to the RTC.  Same respondent categorically admitted in her comment that on the dame date June 23, 2003, the subject motion for reconsideration together with other voluminous files were on her table.  She did not mention a court order resolving the said motion for reconsideration on her table for no such order existed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The non-existence of an order resolving the motion for reconsideration only shows that respondent Mrs. Huerto had not really referred said motion to respondent Judge for his appropriate action</span>.  That is why she did not include the motion for reconsideration as part of the record of the case that was forwarded to the RTC.  On June 30, 2003, after her attendance in the seminar, the receiving clerk Ms. Malakas inquired from her the status of the motion for reconsideration.  Respondent Huerto said that is was in her possession.  She told Mrs. Malakas not to worry about it for there was an order from the court giving due course to the appeal, the same order which was the subject of the motion for reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Section 6, Rule 40 of the Revised Rules of Court prescribes the duty of the clerk of court in case of appeal from the Municipal Trial Court to the proper Regional Trial Court.  The rule provides that within fifteen (15) days from the perfection of the appeal, the clerk of court shall transmit the original record together with the transcripts and exhibits which he shall certify as complete, to the proper Regional Trial Court.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The appeal in Civil Case No. 29181 was not yet perfected in view of the pending motion for reconsideration</span>.  As already discussed in the foregoing, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the record of the case that was transmitted on June 23, 2003 by respondent OIC Huerto to the RTC was not complete</span>.  Due to her own fault she did not include as part of the record the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.  Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on the same date, June 23, 2003, the motion for reconsideration was on her table but without an order resolving the motion for she never referred the motion to the respondent judge</span>.  x x x  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondent Judge categorizes as an "honest mistake or oversight" his reliance on Atty. Manicad's allegation that he received copy of the decision on April <span style="font-weight: bold;">8</span>, 2003-basis of his (respondent Judge's) denial of complainant's motion for execution filed on April 22, 2003.  He hastens to add that "[h]ad the missing motion for reconsideration [of his order denying [complainant's] Motion for Execution] [been] brought to his [his] attention, the mistake could have been rectified or corrected."<br><br>A judge is expected to observe the care and diligence required of him in the performance of his duties.  In resolving the Motion for Execution filed by complainant, since the finality of the decision subject thereof had been rendered doubtful in light of the claim by the defendants' "counsel" Atty. Manicad that he received a copy of the decision on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April <span style="font-weight: bold;">8</span>, 2003</span> to thereby render his Notice of Appeal timely filed on April 23, 2003, respondent Judge rightfully ordered the Sheriff to inform the court when copy of the decision was received by the defendants.  The <span style="font-weight: bold;">documented</span> information of the Sheriff in his Return that the defendant Jose Marcell Panlilio received a copy of the decision on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April <span style="font-weight: bold;">4</span>, 2003</span> notwithstanding, respondent still relied on Atty. Manicad's <span style="font-weight: bold;">undocumented</span> claim that he, as "counsel" of the defendants, received it on April 8, 2003.<br><br>The only conclusion that can thus be derived from respondent Judge's reliance on Atty. Manicad's representation is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he did not verify the record of the case</span> or, if he did,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> he did not do so carefully</span>.  For, had he done so, he would have found out that the defendants Jose Marcell Panlilio et al. did not, as stated earlier, file any answer or responsive pleading to the complaint, resulting in their, on motion of complainant, being declared in default;  and that Atty. Manicad's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">maiden appearance</span> as "Counsel for the Defendant" was via the Notice of Appeal he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed on April 23, 2003</span>, nineteen (19) days after the defendant Panlilio received on April 4, 2003 a copy of the decision or four (4) days <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> the period of appeal had expired on April 19, 2003.<br><br>Respondent Judge's taking refuge under Legal Researcher-OIC Branch Clerk of Court Huerto's failure to refer to him complainant's Motion for Reconsideration does not lie.  For there would have been no Motion for Reconsideration if, in the first place, he went over the record of the case or, if he did, he carefully did so, before issuing his order denying complainant's Motion for Execution.<br><br>Clearly, respondent Judge was remiss in observing the care and diligence expected of him in the discharge of his duties.<br><br>As for respondent Huerto, the Court Administrator's above-quoted evaluation of and consequent recommendation in the case against her is well-taken.<br><br>Respecting respondent Clerk III Banaban, the Court Administrtor's following evaluation of and consequent recommendation in the case against her is likewise well-taken.<br><blockquote>As against respondent Theresa Banaban, the complaint alleged that she was the one "who confirmed the setting of the hearing at 2:00 p.m. on June 20, 2003 as approved by OIC-Branch Clerk of Court Leonila Huerto."  Even if true, there is nothing wrong about that confirmation.  In her Comment, respondent Banaban stated that the motion for reconsideration did not pass through her and that she had no participation in any office work related to the appeal.  Said respondent Banaban should be exonerated.<br></blockquote>While this Court takes note of the Court Administrator's appreciation in respondent Judge's favor his disposition with dispatch of complainant's case and the absence of any showing of "bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption" in his actuations, he should be admonished for failing, as reflected above, to observe the care and diligence required of him in the performance of his duties.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, respondent Judge Edgardo B. Bellosillo is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">ADMONISHED</span> to observe the care and diligence required of him in the performance of his duties as a judge.<br><br>Respondent Legal Researcher-Officer-in-Charge Branch Clerk of Court Leonila S. Huerto is hereby, for simple neglect of duty, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUSPENDED</span> for One (1) Month and One (1) Day.<br><br>Respondent Clerk III Theresa T.
