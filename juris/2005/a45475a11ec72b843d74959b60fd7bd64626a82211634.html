The title or mode of acquisition upon which they based their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">belief of such ownership stemmed from a Contract to Sell (Exhibit "P") of which they were not even parties, the designated buyer being Elizabeth Yson Cruz and the sale even subjected to the judicial reconstitution of the title</span>.  And by their own actions, particularly defendant Miguel Castelltort, defendants betrayed this very belief in their ownership when realizing the inutility of anchoring their ownership on the basis of the Contract of Sale, defendant Miguel Castelltort in his testimony declared Elizabeth Yson Cruz as his wife (tsn, pp. 7-8, March 24, 1998) despite an admission in their answer that they are the spouses named as defendants (tsn, p. 8, January 12, 1998) and which declaration is an utter falsehood as the Contract to Sell itself indicates the civil status of said Elizabeth Yson Cruz to be single.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even if we are to concede that defendants built their house in good faith on account of the representation of attorney-in-fact Rene Villegas, their failure to comply with the requirements of the National Building Code, particularly the procurement of a building permit, stained such good faith and belief</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>From any and all indications, this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberate breach is an unmitigated manifestation of bad faith</span>.  And from the evidence thus adduced, we hold that defendants and the intervenor were equally <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guilty of negligence which led to the construction of the defendants' house</span> on plaintiffs' property and therefore jointly and severally liable for all the damages suffered by the plaintiffs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the trial court's Decision reads, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiffs and against the defendants, ordering the latter to surrender the possession of the property covered by TCT No. 36856 of the Register of Deeds of Laguna including any and all improvements built thereon to the plaintiffs.<br><br>Defendants and intervenors are likewise jointly and severally directed to pay to plaintiffs the following damages:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) TWO THOUSAND (P2,000.00) PESOS per month from February 1995 by way of reasonable compensation for the use of plaintiffs' property until the surrender of the same;<br><br>b) FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS by way of moral damages;<br><br>c) THIRTY THOUSAND (P30,000.00) PESOS as exemplary damages;<br><br>d) TWENTY THOUSAND (P20,000.00) PESOS as attorney's fees and cost of suit.<br></div><br>The counterclaim interposed by the defendants in their responsive pleading is hereby dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents thereupon filed their respective appeals with the CA.<br><br>Petitioner Rodolfo Rosales, in the meantime, died on December 7, 2001.

The dispositive portion of the Decision reads, quoted verbatim:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span> and the assailed decision of the court a quo <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</span>.  In accordance with the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Technogas Philippines Manufacturing Corp. vs. Court of Appeals</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Depra vs. Dumlao</span>, applying Article 448 of the Civil Code, this case is <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> to the Regional Trial Court of Calamba, Laguna, Branch 34, for further proceedings, as follows:<br><br>1. to determine the present fair price of appellees' 315 square meter area of land and the amount of the expenses actually spent by the appellants for building the house as of 21 August 1995, which is the time they were notified of appellees' rightful claim over Lot 17.<br><br>2. to order the appellees to exercise their option under the law (Article 448, Civil Code), whether to appropriate the house as their own by paying to the appellants the amount of the expenses spent for the house as determined by the court a quo in accordance with the limitations as aforestated or to oblige the appellants to pay the price of the land.<br><br>In case the appellees exercise the option to oblige the appellants to pay the price of the land but the latter reject such purchase because, as found by the court, the value of the land is considerably more than that of the house, the court shall order the parties to agree upon the terms of a forced lease, and give the court a quo a formal written notice of such agreement and its provisos.  If no agreement is reached by the parties, the court a quo shall then fix the terms of the forced lease, provided that the monthly rental to be fixed by the Court shall not be less that Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00) per month, payable within the first five (5) days of  each calendar month and the period thereof shall not be more than two (2) years, counted from the finality of the judgment.<br><br>Upon the expiration of the forced lease, or upon default by the appellants in the payment of rentals for two (2) consecutive months, the appellees shall be entitled to terminate the forced lease, to recover their land, and to have the improvement removed by the appellants at the latter's expense.  The rentals herein provided shall be tendered by the appellants to the court for payment to the appellees, and such tender shall constitute evidence of whether or not compliance was made within the period fixed by the court.<br><br>In any event, the appellants shall pay the appellees the amount of Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00) as reasonable compensation for their occupancy of the encroached property from the time said appellants' good faith cease (sic) to exist until such time the possession of the property is delivered to the appellees subject to the reimbursement of the aforesaid expenses in favor of the appellants or until such time the payment of the purchase price of the said lot be made by the appellants in favor of the appellees in case the latter opt for the compulsory sale of the same.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>In reversing the trial court, the CA held:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>x x x A perusal of the records readily reveals that said court instead relied on flimsy, if not immaterial, allegations of the appellees, which have no direct bearing in the determination of whether the appellants are builders in bad faith.<br><br>For one, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the pivotal issue to be resolved in this case, i.e. whether appellant Miguel is a builder in good faith, was ignored by the court a quo</span>.  The instant case does not in any way concern the personal and property relations of spouses-appellants and Elizabeth Yson Cruz which is an altogether different matter that can be ventilated by the concerned parties through the institution of a proper action. xxx The court a quo should have focused on the issue of whether appellant Miguel built, in good faith, the subject house without notice of the adverse claim of the appellees and under the honest belief that the lot which he used in the construction belongs to him. xxx<br><br>xxx As it is, appellant Miguel relied on the title which the intervenor showed to him which, significantly, has no annotation that would otherwise show a prior adverse claim.  Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as far as appellant Miguel is concerned, his title over the subject lot, as well as the title of the intervenor thereto, is clean and untainted by an adverse claim or other irregularities</span>.<br><br>For another, the appellants' failure to secure a building permit from the Municipal Engineer's Office on their construction on Lot 17 does not impinge on the good faith of the appellants.  In fact, it can be told that a building permit was actually filed by appellant Miguel with respect to Lot 16 and it was only due to the confusion and misapprehension by the intervenor of the exact parameters of the property which caused appellant's belief that Lot 17 [the questioned lot], is his.  This fact bolsters appellant Miguel's good faith in building his house on appellees' lot under the mistaken belief that the same is his property.  Otherwise, he should have secured a building permit on Lot 17 instead or should not have bothered to take the necessary measures to obtain a building permit on Lot 16 in the first place.<br><br>By and large, the records show that, as testified to by Engr. Rebecca T. Lanuang, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appellant Miguel had already applied for a building permit as early as February 1994 and was in fact issued a temporary building permit</span> pending the completion of the requirements for said permit.  Although the building permit was belatedly issued in January 1996, this does not in any way detract from appellant Miguel's good faith.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>In holding the appellants as builders in bad faith, the court a quo defied law and settled jurisprudence considering that the factual basis of its findings and the incontrovertible evidence in support thereof prove that the appellant Miguel, in good faith, built the house on appellees' land without knowledge of an adverse claim or any other irregularities that might cast a doubt as to the veracity of the assurance given to him by the intervenor.  Having been assured by the intervenor that the stone monuments were purposely placed, albeit wrongfully, by the land surveyor in said land to specifically identify the lot and its inclusive boundaries, the appellants cannot be faulted for having relied on the expertise of the land surveyor who is more equipped and experienced in the field of land surveying.  Although under the Torrens system of land registration, the appellant is presumed to have knowledge of the metes and bounds of the property with which he is dealing, appellant however, considering that he is a layman not versed in the technical description of his property, cannot be faulted in his reliance on the survey plan that was delivered to him by the intervenor and the stone monuments that were placed in the encroached property.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Peremptorily, contrary to the flawed pronouncements made by the court a quo that appellant Miguel is deemed as a builder in bad faith on the basis of a mere assertion that he built his house without initially satisfying himself that he owns the said property, this Court finds reason to maintain good faith on the part of the appellant.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Admittedly, the appellants' house erroneously encroached on the property of the appellees due to a mistake in the placement of stone monuments as indicated in the survey plan, which error is directly attributable to the fault of the geodetic engineer who conducted the same.  This fact alone negates bad faith on the part of appellant Miguel</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Moreover, it is quite illogical for appellant Miguel to knowingly build his house on a property which he knew belongs to another person. x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">In view of the good faith of both parties in this case, their rights and obligations are to be governed by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 448</span>, which has been applied to improvements or portions of improvements built by mistaken belief on land belonging to the adjoining owner. x x x</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated October 22, 2002 having been denied by the CA by Resolution of March 13, 2002, the present petition was filed raising the following issues:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN MAKING A FINDING THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE ADMISSIONS BY THE PARTIES<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR OF LAW IN CONCLUDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT, IN DECIDING THE CASE, RELIED ON FLIMSY, IF NOT IMMATERIAL, ALLEGATIONS OF THE PETITIONERS, WHICH HAVE NO DIRECT BEARING IN THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE RESPONDENTS ARE BUILDERS IN GOOD FAITH<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR OF LAW IN RENDERING A DECISION THAT IS UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST BOTH RESPONDENT JUDITH CASTELLTORT AND THIRD-PARTY ELIZABETH CRUZ<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners initially hammer against respondents' proving that Castelltort and a certain Elizabeth Cruz are the builders of the house on the subject property, they faulting them with estoppel for alleging in their Answer before the trial court that "they (respondents Castelltort and Judith) caused the construction of their house which they bought from a certain Lina Lopez-Villegas."<br><br>Petitioners rely on the following doctrine established in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elayda v. Court of Appeals</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote>"an admission made in the pleadings cannot be controverted by the party making such admission and are conclusive as to him and that all proofs submitted by him contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith, should be ignored, whether objection is interposed by the party or not x x x"<br></blockquote>Petitioners' contention is hardly relevant to the case at bar.  Whether it was Castelltort and Judith or Castelltort and Elizabeth Cruz who purchased the property from Lina is not material to the outcome of the instant controversy.  As found by the CA:<br><blockquote>The fact remains that appellant [Castelltort] is the builder of the house on Lot 17 xxx The court a quo should have focused on the issue of whether appellant Miguel built, in good faith, the subject house without notice of the adverse claim of the appellees and under the honest belief that the lot which he used in the construction belongs to him.  xxx it cannot be gainsaid that appellant Miguel has a title over the land that was purchased from the intervenor x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>At all events, as this Court held in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gardner v. Court of Appeals</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>In its Resolution reversing the original Decision, respondent Court discredited the testimony of Ariosto SANTOS for being at variance with the allegations in his Answer.  The fact, however, that the allegations made by Ariosto SANTOS in his pleadings and in his declarations in open Court differed will not militate against the findings herein made nor support the reversal by respondent Court. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> As a general rule, facts alleged in a party's pleading are deemed admissions of that party and binding upon it, but this is not an absolute and inflexible rule</span>.  An Answer is a mere statement of fact which the party filing it expects to prove, but it is not evidence.  As Ariosto SANTOS himself, in open Court, had repudiated the defenses he had raised in his Answer and against his own interest, his testimony is deserving of weight and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The issue determinative of the controversy in the case at bar hinges on whether Castelltort is a builder in good faith</span>.<br><br>A builder in good faith is one who builds with the belief that the land he is building on is his, or that by some title one has the right to build thereon, and is ignorant of any defect or flaw in his title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Article 527 of the Civil Code provides that good faith is always presumed, and upon him who alleges bad faith on the part of a possessor rests the burden of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Lot 16 was sold by Lina, through her attorney-in-fact Villegas, to Castelltort and a certain Elizabeth Cruz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> for a consideration of P500,000.00.  While prior to the sale, what Villegas showed Castelltort as evidence of his mother Lina's ownership of the property was only a photocopy of her title TCT No. (T-42171) T-18550<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> he explaining that the owner's duplicate of the title was lost and that judicial reconstitution thereof was ongoing, Castelltort acted in the manner of a prudent man and went to the Registry of Deeds of Laguna to procure a certified true copy of the TCT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  The certified true copy bore no annotation indicating any prior adverse claim on Lot 16.<br><br>The records indicate that at the time Castelltort began constructing his house on petitioners' lot, he believed that it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Lot 16</span> he bought and delivered to him by Villegas.<br><br>In his cross-examination, Villegas testified:<br><br> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">Q: </td> <td width="90%">You said the surveyor placed a mujon along boundary of the property?</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A: </td> <td>Yes.</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Q: </td> <td>When were the mujons placed in the boundary of the property?</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A:</td> <td> These mujons were the basis for my locating the property in pointing to Mr. Castelltort.</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Is it not a fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before Miguel Castelltort started constructing that house he sought your advice or permission to construct the same over that particular lot</span>?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A: </td> <td>Yes.</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Q: </td> <td>And you gave your consent?</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></td> <td><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yes, because based on my knowledge also that that was the lot <span style="font-weight: bold;">as pointed by Engr.

However, the builder or planter cannot be obliged to buy the land if its value is considerably more than that of the building or trees.  In such case, he shall pay reasonable rent, if the owner of the land does not choose to appropriate the building or trees after proper indemnity.  The parties shall agree upon the terms of the lease and in case of disagreement, the court shall fix the terms thereof.<br></blockquote>Under the foregoing provision, the landowner can choose between appropriating the building by paying the proper indemnity or obliging the builder to pay the price of the land, unless its value is considerably more than that of the structures, in which case the builder in good faith shall pay reasonable rent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>    If the parties cannot come to terms over the conditions of the lease, the court must fix the terms thereof.<br><br>The choice belongs to the owner of the land, a rule that accords with the principle of accession, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, that the accessory follows the principal and not the other way around.

In view of the impracticability of creating a state of forced co-ownership, the law has provided a just solution by giving the owner of the land the option to acquire the improvements after payment of the proper indemnity, or to oblige the builder or planter to pay for the land and the sower the proper rent.  He cannot refuse to exercise either option.  It is the owner of the land who is authorized to exercise the option, because his right is older, and because, by the principle of accession, he is entitled to the ownership of the accessory thing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>Possession acquired in good faith does not lose this character except in the case and from the moment facts exist which show that the possessor is not unaware that he possesses the thing improperly or wrongfully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  The good faith ceases or is legally interrupted from the moment defects in the title are made known to the possessor, by extraneous evidence or by suit for recovery of the property by the true owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Castelltort's good faith ceased on August 21, 1995 when petitioners personally apprised him of their title over the questioned lot.

In such event, appellants would have a right to retain the land on which they have built in good faith until they are reimbursed the expenses incurred by them.  This is so because the right to retain the improvements while the corresponding indemnity is not paid implies the tenancy or possession in fact of the land on which it is built, planted or sown.<br><br>However, considering that appellants had ceased as builders in good faith at the time that appellant Miguel was notified of appellees' lawful title over the disputed property, the payment of reasonable rent should accordingly commence at that time since he can no longer avail of the rights provided under the law for builders in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>If the option chosen by petitioners is compulsory sale, however, the payment of rent should continue up to the actual transfer of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Respecting petitioners' argument that the appellate court erred in rendering a decision that is "unenforceable against Judith who is not the owner of the house and Elizabeth Cruz who was found to be a part owner of the house built on their lot but is not a party to the case," the same does not lie.<br><br>While one who is not a party to a proceeding shall not be affected or bound<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> by a judgment rendered therein,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> like Elizabeth Cruz, this does not detract from the validity and enforceability of the judgment on petitioners and respondents Castelltorts.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.

Verily, execution of a judgment can only be issued against one who is a party to the action, and not against one who, not being a party in the case, has not yet had his day in court.<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></sup><span style="font-style: italic;">Orquiola v.
