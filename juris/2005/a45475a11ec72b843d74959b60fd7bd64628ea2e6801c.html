CR No. 24162 affirming, on appeal, the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bacolod City, Branch 49, in <i>People v. Rubin Tad-y, et al.</i>, Criminal Case No. 98-19401. The RTC ruling had affirmed the decision of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) in Criminal Case No. 57216 finding the petitioner guilty of direct bribery.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Antecedents</span><br></div><br>Engineer Rubin Tad-y, Structural Analyst and Engineer Nestor Velez, Building Inspector, both of the Office of the City Engineer (OCE), Bacolod City, were charged with direct bribery under Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code in an Information filed on July 26, 1995 with the MTCC of Bacolod City, docketed as Criminal Case No. 57216.  The accusatory portion of the Information for direct bribery reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 24<sup>th</sup> day of July 1995, in the City of Bacolod, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein accused, public officers, being then engineers at the City Engineer's Office, Bacolod City, with corrupt intent and motivated with pecuniary interest for themselves, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously receive and accept marked money in the amount of Four Thousand (P4,000.00) Pesos from Julio Encabo, electrical contractor and duly-authorized representative of Mildred Wong, offended party and owner of Atrium Building located at Gonzaga Street, Bacolod City, in an entrapment operation conducted by the PNP Criminal Investigation Service Command at Andre's Bakeshop, Bacolod City, which amount was earlier solicited by said accused from the offended party in exchange for the signing/approval of permit for building occupancy of the building owned by the offended party, the signing/approval of said building permit is in connection with the performance of the official duties of said accused as engineers in the Office of the City Engineer, Bacolod City, in violation of the aforementioned law.<br><br>Acts contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Velez and Tad-y were also charged with violation of Section 3(c) of Republic Act No. 3019<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in an Information filed with the RTC, docketed as Criminal Case No. 17186. This case was raffled to Branch 44 of the RTC of Bacolod City.<br><center><br><b>The Case for the People</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></center><br>The prosecution presented Julio Encabo, a licensed master electrician and electrical contractor, who testified that Mildred Wong contracted his services for the construction of her 6-storey Atrium building along Gonzaga Street, in front of the Central Market in Bacolod City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On February 16, 1994, the Office of the City Engineer/Building Official issued Building Permit No. 0694509798<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for the construction of the building. The construction of the building was finished by April 25, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m. of even date, Encabo arrived at the OCE to arrange the conduct of final building inspections, and, thereafter, the signing of the corresponding certificates.  Rene Cornel, Jose Sotecinal, Ephraim Hechanova, Jose Mari Sales, Mateo Tuvida and Rubin Tad-y, were the OCE officers-in-charge of the various aspects<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the building construction. If all went well, the Building Official would then sign the certificate of occupancy, conformably with the provisions of the National Building Code (Presidential Decree No. 1096).<br><br>Encabo had the certificates of final inspection and occupancy form typed by an OCE secretary.  However, Tad-y, Encabo's <i>compadre</i>, approached the latter and dissuaded him from processing the certificates of final inspection and occupancy on the building since he (Tad-y) was the one responsible for it; also, Mildred Wong still had an unpaid balance of P4,000.00 for his services.  When Encabo told Tad-y that collecting the amount from Wong would be problematic, Tad-y replied, "[It's] up [to] you."<br><br>Shortly thereafter, some of the officers at the OCE, including Tad-y and Tuvida, conducted their final inspection of the building. During the first week of May 1995, Encabo and Tad-y had an altercation and in his anger, Tad-y squeezed Encabo's neck in the presence of the latter's wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thus, the relations between Tad-y and Encabo became strained.<br><br>In the meantime, other officers of the OCE made their respective final inspections during the months of May to June 1995, and signed the respective certificates of final inspection for the building.  Tad-y did not make his final inspection, and refused to do so unless the money he had demanded was given to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Encabo even sought the aid of the City Mayor but did not tell the latter that Tad-y was demanding money because he did not want to place the latter in a bad light.<br><br>Nonetheless, on July 6, 1995, Encabo reported the matter to the Criminal Investigation Section (CIS) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Bacolod City, and signed a complaint sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> against Tad-y for extortion.  Police officer Alexander Muñoz was then ordered to conduct an investigation on the complaint.<br><br>Muñoz decided to conduct entrapment operations against Tad-y. He asked Encabo to procure P4,000.00, consisting of forty (40) pieces of P100.00 bills for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Encabo complied.  Muñoz listed the serial numbers of the bills and placed his initials "AM" on the right lower corner of each bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The PNP Crime Laboratory in Bacolod City applied ultraviolet powder on the bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The money was placed in a white envelope,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and the envelope was turned over to Encabo for the entrapment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The police officers and Encabo had agreed that the police officers would position themselves within the vicinity of the Andre's Bakeshop, and after giving the envelope to Tad-y, Encabo would place his eyeglasses in front of his shirt collar to indicate that Tad-y had already received the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After two aborted attempts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Encabo informed Muñoz by telephone that he and Tad-y would inspect the building at about 3:00 p.m. on July 24, 1995, and that Tad-y would sign the certificate of final inspection afterwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Police officers Eriberto Castañeda and Muñoz, along with civilian agents, proceeded to Gonzaga Street and positioned themselves as planned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Encabo and Tad-y, accompanied by OCE building inspector Engr. Nestor Velez, arrived at the building at about 5:00 p.m. on July 24, 1995.  Encabo brought with him the envelope<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> containing the forty P100.00 bills and the certificate of final inspection bearing the signatures of all the other OCE officers concerned, which Tad-y was to sign after the inspection of the building.  Tad-y was then wearing his orange OCE bowling team t-shirt.  Encabo and Tad-y inspected the building together for about ten to twenty minutes. Velez, on his own, made a separate inspection of the building.  After the inspection, Encabo, Tad-y and Velez agreed to have a snack and proceeded to the Andre's Bakeshop at the ground floor of the Atrium Building along Gonzaga Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Velez and Tad-y walked side by side while Encabo followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> By then, Muñoz, Castañeda and the other police officers were already in the vicinity to await Encabo's signal.<br><br>Inside the bakeshop, Encabo brought out the certificate of final inspection, which Tad-y forthwith signed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Encabo then gave the envelope containing the forty P100.00 bills to Tad-y. The latter asked Encabo, "What is it for?" Encabo replied that it was the money Tad-y had been waiting for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Tad-y opened the envelope and saw its contents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He asked Encabo if it was dangerous for him to receive the envelope, and the latter answered that it was not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Instead of putting the envelope in his pocket, Tad-y handed the same to Velez under the table.  Velez asked Tad-y what it was, and Tad-y told Velez to just keep it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thereafter, Tad-y and Velez, followed by Encabo, exited from the bakeshop.  Encabo then removed his eyeglasses and placed it on his shirt collar, the signal that Tad-y had received the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The police officers then accosted Velez and Tad-y, and asked the latter where the white envelope was. Tad-y denied that he received the envelope.  Encabo told the police officers that Velez had the envelope.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> When asked where the envelope was, Velez brought it out from the right pocket of his pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Muñoz told Velez to open the envelope and inspected its contents.  Velez did as he was told, and saw that the envelope contained P100.00 bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Tad-y and Velez were arrested and brought to the CIS Headquarters, PNP Crime Laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Tad-y's shirt was turned over by the accosting officers. Castañeda also turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory the white envelope and its contents, with a request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> for the PNP Crime Laboratory to test Velez and Tad-y for ultraviolet powder and the latter's shirt to be tested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Forensic Chemist Rea Villavicencio conducted the examination and prepared an Initial Laboratory Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> stating that Rubin B. Tad-y was positive for the presence of yellow ultraviolet powder on his right arm.  Villavicencio, likewise, prepared a sketch<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> depicting the body of Tad-y, and showing that his right forearm was positive for ultraviolet powder.<br><br>On cross-examination, Encabo admitted that Velez was not aware of everything.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Edgar Occeña, the Chief of the Inspection Division, later affixed his signature on the certificate of final inspection bearing Tad-y's signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  The City Building Official approved and issued the certificate of occupancy on  July 27, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><b><center><br>The Case for the Accused Tad-y<br></center><br></b>Accused Tad-y denied demanding and receiving P4,000.00 from Encabo in consideration for the conduct of the building inspection, and his signature on the certificate of inspection and the certificate of occupancy.  He insists that under P.D. No. 1096, he is not authorized to sign and issue a certificate of occupancy.  He testified that in the afternoon of April 25, 1995, Encabo arrived at the OCE requesting that the appropriate officials inspect the 6-storey Atrium building preparatory to the issuance of a certificate of final inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The next day, he, Tuvida, Tordesillas, Baja and Danoy conducted the building inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> They discovered that only four floors were completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Encabo agreed to inspect the building at 3:00 p.m. of July 24, 1995, which, at Encabo's request, was reset to 4:30 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> He and Engr. Velez conducted the inspection of the building on that day and found some defects in the construction of the building.<br><br>After the inspection, Tad-y left Velez and Encabo behind as he was going to a bowling tournament, but, as he was crossing Gonzaga Street, Velez and Encabo called him and invited him to join them for a snack at Andre's Bakeshop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> He agreed because he was hungry.  He and Encabo were seated beside each other at the table in the bakeshop, while Velez was seated at the opposite side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> While taking their snacks, Encabo brought out the certificate of final inspection bearing the signatures of the other officers of the OCE who had inspected the building.  Tad-y affixed his signature above his typewritten name with the notation "see back page for structural requisites" at the dorsal portion of the document.  Appearing at the dorsal portion of the certificate is Tad-y's handwritten notation: "Please Post the Allowable Load on [conspicuous] places especially [in the] area to be used as storage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Before then, he inquired from Encabo where the other requisite certificates of final inspection, plumbing,  Fire Safety Inspection and logbook were, and Encabo replied that he brought the requisite certificates with him gesturing to his portfolio.  Encabo assured him that all the requirements were in his portfolio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> With Encabo's assurance, he then affixed his signature in the certificate of final inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Momentarily, Encabo told him that he had another document, and forthwith handed a white envelope to him.  Believing that the envelope contained the requisite certificate of final inspection signed by the other officers in the OCE, he received the envelope and, without opening it, immediately handed it over to Velez who would examine its contents. He then left the bakeshop with Velez ahead of him, followed by Encabo.  He was crossing Gonzaga Street on his way to the bowling tournament when he was arrested by policemen, who asked him where the white envelope he had earlier received from Encabo was.  He told them that the envelope was with Velez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Tad-y then saw Velez being held by a policeman, and that the envelope was already opened. A policeman forced Velez to go near him.  Another policeman forced him (Tad-y) to touch the envelope, but he parried the arm of the policeman with his right forearm and refused to touch it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> They were then brought to the PNP headquarters where they were tested for ultraviolet powder.<br><br>Encabo filed a complaint against him because on four (4) prior occasions, he refused to sign the certificate of final inspection of a house owned by a certain Nelson Señores, as well as the application for a building permit of Joey Yao, unless the latter paid a 100% surcharge for deficiencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Señores and Yao were the principals of Encabo.  In the evening of April 25, 1995, after he, Tuvida, Baja and Tordesillas had their initial inspections of the building, they had dinner at the Tasty Treat. When he was about to pay the bill for their food and drinks, Encabo insisted that he would pay the said bill.  This infuriated him, and he squeezed Encabo's chin with his hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Jimmy Gonzales, a newspaper vendor, corroborated the testimony of the accused that someone forced Velez to hand over the opened envelope to Tad-y,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> but that Tad-y parried the attempt and refused to receive the envelope.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Tad-y marked and offered in evidence the transcript of stenographic notes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> taken during the trial of September 25, 1995 in Criminal Case No. 17186.<br><center><br><b>The Case For the Accused Nestor Velez</b><br></center><br>Nestor Velez denied the charge.  He corroborated the testimony of Tad-y and declared that he was appointed as building inspector of the OCE only on March 16, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> When he and Tad-y inspected the building in the afternoon of July 24, 1995, they did so separately.  After the inspection, Tad-y told him and Encabo that he was going ahead because he was going to play bowling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> When Encabo invited him and Tad-y for a snack, Tad-y reluctantly agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Momentarily, Encabo brought out the certificate of final inspection and handed it to Tad-y for the latter's signature.  However, Tad-y told Encabo that he would note the deficiencies of the building. Tad-y then signed the certificate after being assured by Encabo that he had all the other certificates.  Tad-y gave Velez the envelope and told him to keep it because he was going to a bowling game.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Velez received the envelope and put it inside the right pocket of his pants, thinking that it contained the requisite final safety inspection certificate and other certificates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>On his way from the bakeshop, he and Tad-y were arrested by policemen.  He opened the white envelope as the policemen ordered, and saw money inside.  He was forced to approach Tad-y, and another policeman forced the latter to touch the money contained in the envelope. Tad-y resisted.<br><br>Edgar Occeña testified that he signed the original and duplicate copies of the certificate of final inspection with the requisite certificates of the other officers appended thereto.  The City Engineer/City Building Official signed the Certificate of Occupancy on July 27, 1995. The original copy of the certificate of final inspection and occupancy was then released to Wong, while the duplicate was retained by the OCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Mateo Tuvida testified that he was the engineer in charge of the Mechanical Section of the OCE of Bacolod City since February 1975.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> On April 25, 1995, he, Baja, Tad-y, Cornel and Yolando Ilog inspected the building at the Gonzaga side of the street and found that it was already complete but that the structure along Cuadra Street was still incomplete.  He found the mechanical aspect of the building completed when he inspected it in the first week of June 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> He then affixed his signature on the certificate of final inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Venancio Baja testified that he had been in charge of the Electrical Division of the OCE since 1990.  He was the assistant of Jose Sotecinal, the Chief Electrical Engineer.  He inspected the Atrium building on April 25, 1995 and found it incomplete.  He again inspected the building and found it in accord with the plans.  He then signed the certificate of final inspection only in the first week of June 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>On September 28, 1998, the MTC rendered judgment convicting Tad-y of direct bribery defined and penalized under Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code.  Velez was acquitted of the charges. The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:   <br> <ol type="1"><li> Accused Engineer Nestor Velez is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime of violation of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code on the ground that it is the finding of this Court that he was innocent of the crime charged;<br><br></li><li> Accused Engineer Ruben Tad-y is hereby pronounced GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of Violation of Paragraph 2 of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of 2 years and 4 months, as minimum, to 3 years, as maximum, in the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, in accordance with the mandatory provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and, to pay the fine in the amount of P8,000.00 pesos.<br><br></li><li> Accused Ruben Tad-y, in case of his insolvency to pay the fine, shall suffer a subsidiary penalty of imprisonment at the rate of one day for each 8 pesos and shall remain in confinement until his fine is satisfied.  However, his subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed one-third of the term of the sentence, and in no case shall it continue for more than one year, and no fraction or part of day shall be counted against the prisoner, in accordance with Article 39 of the Revised Penal Code; and<br><br></li><li> Accused Ruben Tad-y is also hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of special temporary disqualification and is hereby ordered to be deprived of his right to hold office and employment in the City Engineer's Office, as well as for holding similar offices or employments either perpetually or during the term of his sentence in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 210, in relation to Article 31, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Revised Penal Code.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>The MTC gave full credence and probative weight to Encabo's testimony, ruling that Tad-y demanded and received P4,000.00 from Encabo on July 24, 1995 in consideration for his signing a certificate of occupancy. It further ruled that the accused signed the said certificate on the said date.<br><br>Tad-y appealed the decision to the RTC, which rendered judgment on September 13, 1999, affirming the decision of the MTC with modification as to the penalty imposed.  The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed except for the modifications that the accused Ruben Tad-y y Babor's sentence should consist of an indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of <i>Arresto Mayor</i>, as minimum, to one (1) year, eight (8) months and twenty- one (21) days of <i>Prision Correccional</i>, as maximum, and for him to pay the cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC denied Tad-y's motion for reconsideration.  However, the RTC agreed with Tad-y's contention that what the latter signed was a certificate of final inspection and not a certificate of occupancy.<br><br>In a parallel development, the RTC rendered judgment on May 18, 2001 in Criminal Case No. 17186, acquitting Tad-y and Velez of the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The accused, now the petitioner, filed a petition for review of the decision of the RTC.  The CA rendered judgment on February 2, 2001 affirming the RTC decision <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Upon the denial of the motion for reconsideration of the said decision, the petitioner filed his petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> with this Court.<br><br>The threshold issue raised by the petitioner is factual - whether the prosecution adduced proof beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt for direct bribery under the second paragraph of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The petitioner avers that under the Information, and as held by the courts <i>a quo</i>, he was charged with direct bribery under the second paragraph of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code, for soliciting and receiving P4,000.00 on July 24, 1995 from Mildred Wong, through Encabo, in consideration for his signing/approval of the certificate of occupancy of the Atrium Building, and that he signed said certificate on said date.<br><br>The petitioner maintains that he did not sign a certificate of occupancy.  He posits that a certificate of occupancy is signed by the city building official, and that he has nothing to do with the execution of such certificate.  Hence, he is not criminally liable for direct bribery, one of the essential elements for the crime being that the act which he agreed to do or execute is connected to the performance of his official duties.<br><br>The petitioner assails the credibility and probative weight of Encabo's testimony.  He avers that Encabo had an axe to grind against him because, on prior occasions, he had denied the applications for building permit filed by his principals due to structural deficiencies in the buildings.<br><br>The petitioner further insists that he did not demand, nor could have demanded the amount of P4,000.00 on April 25, 1995, or thereafter, because as of the said date, the Atrium building had not yet been completed. The petitioner avers that Encabo's claim that he demanded P4,000.00 for the signing the certificate of final inspection is belied by the fact that he indicated the deficiencies of the building at the dorsal portion of the certificate. It was only in the first week of June 1995 that Baja and Tuvida made their final inspection and signed the certificate of final inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Even Encabo admitted that the petitioner refused to sign the said certificate because as of July 24, 1995, there had been no final inspection of the building, and not because he was demanding P4,000.00 from Encabo.<br><br>The petitioner posits that the case for the prosecution was enfeebled by its failure to adduce in evidence the certificate of final inspection he signed on July 24, 1995.  It adduced in evidence only the certificate of final inspection bearing all the signatures of the officers in the OCE, except his.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> He claims that the respondent failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he knew of the contents of the white envelope.  He, in fact, believed that the envelope contained the requisite certificates of inspection.  Moreover, he did not open the envelope and instead passed it over to Velez for verification, as he was on his way to a bowling game.<br><br>The petitioner further contends that the respondent even failed to adduce in evidence the white envelope he received from Encabo, or prove that the said white envelope was what he actually received from Encabo.  He posits that there is no probable cause for his and Velez's warrantless arrest; hence, any evidence confiscated by the policemen from them is inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>The respondent, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), avers that it adduced proof beyond reasonable doubt of the petitioner's guilt for direct bribery.  It insists that the petitioner failed to prove that Encabo had any ulterior motive to falsely charge and testify against him.  The OSG points that the testimony of Encabo is honest and straightforward; hence, entitled to full probative weight.  It is hard to believe, the OSG avers, that the petitioner would accept the envelope without knowing its contents.  The petitioner demanded and received from Encabo the P4,000.00 contained in a white envelope in consideration of his signing the certificate of occupancy.<br><br>The OSG avers that the petitioner's signing of the certificate of occupancy was his duty as the engineer in charge of the structural design in the City Engineer's Office of Bacolod City.

The reason is that the Court is not a trier of facts.  However, the rule is subject to several exceptions.  The Court may delve into and resolve factual issues in those cases where the findings of the trial court and the CA are absurd, contrary to the evidence on record, impossible, capricious or arbitrary, or based on a misappreciation of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court is convinced that the findings of the MTC, the RTC and the CA, on the substantial matters at hand, are absurd and arbitrary, and contrary to the evidence on record.<br><br>Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 210.  <i>Direct Bribery</i>. - Any public officer who shall agree to perform an act constituting a crime, in connection with the performance of his official duties, in consideration of any offer, promise, gift or present received by such officer, personally or through the mediation of another, shall suffer the penalty of <i>prison mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods and a fine of not less than three times the value of the gift, in addition to the penalty corresponding to the crime agreed upon, if the same shall have been committed.<br><br>If the gift was accepted by the officer in consideration of the execution of an act which does not constitute a crime, and the officer executed said act, he shall suffer the same penalty provided in the preceding paragraph; and if said act shall not have been accomplished, the officer shall suffer the penalties of <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium period and a fine of not less than twice the value of such gift.<br><br>If the object for which the gift was received or promised was to make the public officer refrain from doing something which it was his official duty to do, he shall suffer the penalties of <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period and a fine not less than three times the value of the gift.<br><br>In addition to the penalties provided in the preceding paragraphs, the culprit shall suffer the penalty of special temporary disqualification.<br><br>The provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs shall be made applicable to assessors, arbitrators, appraisal and claim commissioners, experts or any other persons performing public duties.<br></blockquote>Direct bribery has the following essential elements:    <ol type="1"><li><span style="font-style: italic;">the offender is a public officer</span>;<br><br>    </li><li><span style="font-style: italic;"> the offender accepts an offer or promise or receives a gift or present by himself or through another</span>;<br><br>    </li><li> such offer or promise be accepted or gift or present be received by the public officer with a view to committing some crime, or in consideration of the execution of an act which does not constitute a crime but the act must be unjust, or to refrain from doing something which it is his official duty to do; and<br><br>    </li><li><span style="font-style: italic;"> the act which the offender agrees to perform or which he executes is connected with the performance of his official duties</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></li></ol>The prosecution is mandated to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the essential elements of the felony and that the petitioner is the perpetrator thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Official duties include any action authorized.  It is sufficient if the officer has the official power, ability or apparent ability to bring about or contribute to the desired end.  The acts referred to in the law, which the offender agrees to perform or execute, must be ultimately related to or linked with the performance of his official duties.  It is sufficient if his actions, affected by the payment of the bribe, are parts of any established procedure consistent with the authority of the government agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> However, where the act is entirely outside of the official functions of the officer to whom the money is offered, the offense is not bribery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The agreement between the public officer and the bribe-giver may be express or implied. Such agreement may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.  Proof of such an agreement may rest upon relevant and competent circumstantial evidence. To hold, otherwise, would allow the culprit to escape liability with winks and nods even when the evidence as a whole proves that there has been a meeting of the minds to exchange official duties for money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>It is not necessary that the money is received by the offender before or at the time he agreed to perform or execute an act. It is sufficient if he received the money afterwards in pursuance of a prior arrangement or agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Indisputably, the petitioner is a public officer under Article 203 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> There is no allegation in the Information that the issuance of the certificate of occupancy is a crime or is unjust.<br><br>The Court agrees with the petitioner's contention that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt for the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The MTC convicted the petitioner of direct bribery on its finding that the petitioner demanded P4,000.00 from Wong, through Encabo, in consideration of signing a certificate of occupancy, and that on July 24, 1995, the petitioner received the said amount from Encabo and signed the  said certificate for the Atrium building.  The CA affirmed the said findings of the MTC in its decision, thus:<br><blockquote>All the elements above are present in the case at bench.  Petitioner Ruben Tad-y was an employee at the City Engineer's Office of Bacolod City.  That petitioner-accused accepted the amount of P4,000.00 which he demanded from Julio Encabo, a representative of Mildred Wong who will secure a certificate of occupancy for the building of the latter and handed it over to his subordinate Nestor Velez, petitioner's co-accused, on April 24, 1995 at Andre Bakeshop.  And in consideration of the amount thus given, petitioner would sign the certificate of occupancy, which is his duty as engineer in charge of structural designs at the City Engineer's Office of Bacolod City.  It must be added that petitioner signed the certificate of occupancy, the original of which was kept at the records section of the City Engineer's Office, after receiving the envelope containing P4,000.00. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>However, there is no iota of competent and credible evidence to support these findings.  There is no evidence on record that the petitioner and Encabo met on April 24, 1995.  In fact, it was only on April 25, 1995 that Encabo arrived at the OCE to make arrangements for the final inspection of the building by the officers concerned, the signing of the certificate of inspection by said officers, and the signing of the certificate of occupancy by the building official.<br><br>There is also no dispute that what was signed by the petitioner, on July 24, 1995, following his final inspection of the building, was the certificate of final inspection and not a certificate of occupancy of the building.

No. 1096,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the authority to sign said certificate is vested specifically on the building official, and not on the petitioner:<br><blockquote>Section 309.

However, Encabo also claimed that the petitioner agreed to conduct a final inspection of the building and sign a certificate of final inspection if the money was given to the latter.  When he testified in Criminal Case No. 17186, Encabo declared that the petitioner refused to sign a certificate of inspection on April 25, 1995 unless the P4,000.00 he demanded was paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> However, Encabo gave a completely different story to the CIS when he gave his sworn statement; he claimed that, on April 25, 1995, the petitioner demanded P4,000.00 in consideration for his signature on the certificate of occupancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>When he testified in Criminal Case No. 17186, Encabo admitted that the petitioner did not demand P4,000.00 as a precondition to his final inspection of the building and his signing of the certificate of final inspection.

Indeed, on September 21, 1995, Encabo was already testifying in Criminal Case No. 17186 for the prosecution against the petitioner.<br><br>The prosecution cannot find solace in the entrapment operations conducted by the CIS and the aftermath thereof.<br><br>First.  The petitioner brought along Engineer Nestor Velez, a building inspector in the OCE, on his final inspection of the building after which they had a snack with Encabo.  If, as claimed by Encabo, the petitioner expected to receive P4,000.00 from him, as bribe, it would be contrary to human experience to bring another person along (in this case, Velez) to witness the receipt of the envelope containing the money.  Moreover, the Andre Bakeshop is a public place where people enter to make purchases.  Indeed, this Court in <i>Formilleza v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> declared -<br><blockquote>However, what is revealing is that Mrs. Sevilla and Mrs. Dimaano were present around the table in the canteen with the petitioner and Mrs. Mutia when the latter allegedly handed the money to the petitioner.  There were other persons in the premises like the PC agents whose identities petitioner possibly did not know.  Under the circumstances and in such a public place it is not probable that petitioner would have the nerve to accept bribe money from Mrs. Mutia even under the table.  If the petitioner knew and was prepared to accept the money from Mrs. Mutia at the canteen, the petitioner would not have invited her officemate Mrs. Sevilla to join them.  Mrs. Sevilla stated she did not see the alleged passing of the money.  She could not have seen the money as it was passed on under the table or when, as petitioner said, it was quickly placed in her hand when she stood up.  What Mrs. Sevilla is sure of is that when they were about to leave the canteen, two (2) men approached petitioner, one of whom took pictures, and the petitioner shouted at Mrs. Mutia, "What are you trying to do to me?"  The reaction of petitioner is far from one with a guilty conscience.<br></blockquote>Second.  The petitioner walked ahead of Velez and Encabo out of the Atrium building after the final inspection, and was on his way to the bowling tournament.  However, he joined Encabo and Velez for a snack only because Encabo had invited him.  Such behavior on the part of the petitioner is inconsistent with one who expected to receive P4,000.00 from Encabo after his final inspection of the building.<br><br>Third.  When Encabo handed the envelope to the petitioner, the latter inquired what the envelope was for.  The petitioner opened the envelope in full view of Velez and saw its contents.  He handed the envelope to Velez instead of putting it into his pocket, even after Encabo had assured the petitioner that it was not dangerous for the latter to receive it.  It is incredible that, as claimed by Encabo, the petitioner handed over the envelope to Velez under the table.<br><br>Such facts and circumstances show that the petitioner had no intention to accept the money and consider it his own; they negate the prosecution's contention that the petitioner demanded and expected to receive P4,000.00 as bribe money.  Indeed, this Court ruled in <i>Formilleza</i> -<br><blockquote>The essential ingredient of indirect bribery as defined in Article 211 of the Revised Penal Code is that the public officer concerned must have accepted the gift material consideration.  There must be a clear intention on the part of the public officer to take the gift so offered and consider the same as his own property from then on, such as putting away the gift for safekeeping or pocketing the same.  Mere physical receipt unaccompanied by any other sign, circumstance or act to show such acceptance is not sufficient to lead the court to conclude that the crime of indirect bribery has been committed.  To hold otherwise will encourage unscrupulous individuals to frame up public officers by simply putting within their physical custody some gift, money or other property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br></blockquote>The foregoing ruling of this Court applies not only to charges of indirect bribery but also to direct bribery.  The respondent's contention that the petitioner handed the envelope to Velez under the table is belied by the testimonies of the petitioner and Velez.<br><br>Fourth.  The police officers even forced the petitioner to incriminate himself by forcing him to touch the contents of the envelope, but the petitioner managed to parry the attempt with his right arm.
