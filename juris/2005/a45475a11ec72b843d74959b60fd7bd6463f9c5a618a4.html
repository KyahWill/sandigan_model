Brown, City Mayor of Basilan City, as such, has organized groups of police patrol and civilian commandoes consisting of regular policemen and xxx special policemen appointed and provided by him with pistols and high power guns and then established a camp xxx at Tipo-tipo which is under his command xxx supervision and control where his co-defendants were stationed, entertained criminal complaints and conducted the corresponding investigations as well as assumed the authority to arrest and detain persons without due process of law and without bringing them to the proper court and that in line with this set-up established by said Mayor of Basilan City as such, and acting upon his orders, his co-defendants arrested and maltreated Awalin Tebag who died in consequence thereof.<br></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Alarilla</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> apart from the phrase “in relation to and taking advantage of his official functions,” the information alleged specific factual allegations showing how the therein petitioner committed the crime of grave threats as a consequence of his office as municipal mayor, which allegations led this Court to conclude that the crime charged was intimately connected with the discharge of his official functions.  Thus it read:<br><blockquote>That on or about October 13, 1982, in Meycauayan, Bulacan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a public officer, being then the Municipal Mayor of Meycauayan, Bulacan, committing the crime herein charged in relation to and taking advantage of his official functions, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously level and aim a .45 caliber pistol at and threaten to kill one Simeon G. Legaspi, during a public hearing about the pollution from the operations of the Giant Achievers Enterprises Plastic Factory and after the said complainant rendered a privilege speech critical of the abuses and excesses of the administration of said accused.<br></blockquote>Although herein petitioner was described in the information as “a public officer being then the Mayor with salary grade 27 of Jose Dalman, Zamboanga del Norte,” there was no allegation showing that the act of falsification of public document attributed to him was intimately connected to the duties of his office as mayor to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  Neither was there any allegation to show how he made use of his position as mayor to facilitate the commission of the crimes charged.  The information merely alleges that petitioner falsified the disbursement voucher by counterfeiting therein the signature of Mejorada.  For the purpose of determining jurisdiction, it is this allegation that is controlling, not the evidence presented by the prosecution during the trial.<br><br>In Bartolome v. People<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> where the therein accused was charged with falsification of official document, the information alleged as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 12th day of January, 1977, in the City of Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Rolando Bartolome y Perez, a public officer having been duly appointed and qualified as Senior Labor Regulation Officer and Chief of the Labor Regulations Section, Ministry of Labor, National Capital Region, Manila, conspiring and conniving with the other accused Elino Coronel y Santos, also a public officer having been duly appointed and qualified as Labor Regulation Officer of the same office, taking advantage of their official positions, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously prepare and falsify an official document, to wit: the CS Personal Data Sheet (Civil Service Form No. 212) which bears the Residence Certificate No. A-9086374 issued at Manila on January 12, 1977, by making it appear in said document that accused Rolando Bartolome y Perez had taken and passed the ‘Career Service (Professional Qualifying Examination)’ on ‘May 2, 1976’ with a rating of ‘73.35% in Manila’ and that he was a ‘4th Year AB’ student at the Far Eastern University (FEU), when in truth and in fact, as both accused well knew, accused Rolando Bartolome y Perez had not taken and passed the same nor was he a ‘4th Year AB’ student, thereby making untruthful statements in a narration of facts. (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>This Court held:<br><blockquote>In the instant case, there is no showing that the alleged falsification was committed by the accused, if at all, as a consequence of, and while they were discharging, official functions.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The information does not allege that there was an intimate connection between the discharge of official duties and the commission of the offense. </span> xxx<br><br>Clearly therefore, as the alleged falsification was not an offense committed in relation to the office of the accused, it did not come under the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  It follows that all its acts in the instant case are null and void<span style="font-style: italic;"> ab initio</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As for petitioner’s assertion that the Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over the offense of falsification under Article 172 in relation to Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code, to buttress which he argues that the offender under Article 172, paragraph 1 is not supposed to be a public official who takes advantage of his position, thus equating the requirement of “taking advantage of one’s public position” as stated in the aforementioned provisions of the Revised Penal Code with the prerequisite “in relation to one’s office” for the acquisition of jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan as provided for in R.A. 8249, the same must be discredited.<br><br>Article 171 reads:<br><blockquote>ART. 171. <span style="font-style: italic;">Falsification <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by public officer</span>, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister.</span> – The penalty of prision mayor and a fine not to exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><br>1. Counterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;<br><br>2. Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;<br><br>3. Attributing to persons who have participated in an act or proceeding statements other than those in fact made by them;<br><br>4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;<br><br>5. Altering true dates;<br><br>6. Making any alteration or intercalation in a genuine document which changes its meaning;<br><br>7. Issuing in an authenticated form a document purporting to be a copy of an original document when no such original exists, or including in such copy a statement contrary to, or different from, that of the genuine original; or<br><br>8. Intercalating any instrument or note relative to the issuance thereof in a protocol, registry, or official book.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div></blockquote></div>On the other hand, Article 172, paragraph 1 reads:<br><br>ART. 172. <span style="font-style: italic;">Falsification </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">by private individuals</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> and use of falsified documents.</span> – The penalty of prision correccional in its medium and maximum periods and a fine of not more than 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon:<br><br>1.   Any private individual who shall commit any of the falsifications enumerated in the next preceding article in any public or official document or letter of exchange or any other kind of commercial document; xxx<br><br>The offender under Article 172 must be a private individual or maybe a public officer, employee or notary public who does not “take advantage of his official position.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Under Article 171, an essential element of the crime is that the act of falsification must be committed by a public officer, employee or notary who “takes advantage of his official position.”<br><br>The offender “takes advantage of his official position” in falsifying a document when (1) he has the duty to make or to prepare or otherwise intervene in the preparation of the document; or (2) he has the official custody of the document which he falsifies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>It is thus apparent that for purposes of acquisition of jurisdiction by the Sandiganbayan, the requirement imposed by R.A. 8249 that the offense be “committed in relation” to the offender’s office is entirely distinct from the concept of “taking advantage of one’s position” as provided under Articles 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>R.A. 8249 mandates that for as long as the offender’s public office is intimately connected with the offense charged or is used to facilitate the commission of said offense and the same is properly alleged in the information, the Sandiganbayan acquires jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Indeed, the law specifically states that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over all “other offenses or felonies whether simple or complexed with other crimes committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection a of Section 4 in relation to their office.” Public office, it bears reiterating, need not be an element of the offense charged.<br><br>On the other hand, the element of “taking advantage of one’s position” under the Revised Penal Code becomes relevant only in the present case, not for the purpose of determining whether the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction, but for purposes of determining whether petitioner, if he is held to be liable at all, would be legally responsible under Article 171 or Article 172.<br><br>While the Sandiganbayan is declared bereft of jurisdiction over the criminal case filed against petitioner, the prosecution is not precluded from filing the appropriate charge against him before the proper court.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, further discussion on the other issues raised has become unnecessary.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is GRANTED.  The Decision dated June 19, 2002 and Resolution dated July 3, 2002 of the Sandiganbayan are SET ASIDE and declared NULL and VOID for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>No
