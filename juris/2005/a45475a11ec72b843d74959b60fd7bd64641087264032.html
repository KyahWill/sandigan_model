Having been sanctioned by the court, it is entered as a determination of a controversy and has the force and effect of a judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It is immediately executory and not appealable, except for vices of consent or forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The nonfulfillment of its terms and conditions justifies the issuance of a writ of execution; in such an instance, execution becomes a ministerial duty of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Following these basic principles, apparently unnecessary is a compromise agreement after final judgment has been entered.  Indeed, once the case is terminated by final judgment, the rights of the parties are settled.  There are no more disputes that can be compromised.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Compromise Agreements</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">after    Final Judgment</span><br><br>The Court is tasked, however, to determine the <span style="font-style: italic;">legality</span> of a compromise agreement after final judgment, not the <span style="font-style: italic;">prudence</span> of entering into one.  Petitioners vehemently argue that a compromise of a final judgment is invalid under Article 2040 of the Civil Code, which we quote:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><blockquote>"Art. 2040.  If after a litigation has been decided by a final judgment, a compromise should be agreed upon, either or both parties being <span style="font-weight: bold;">unaware</span> of the existence of the final judgment, the compromise may be <span style="font-weight: bold;">rescinded</span>.<br><br>"Ignorance of a judgment which may be revoked or set aside is not a valid ground for attacking a compromise." (Bold types supplied)<br></blockquote>The first paragraph of Article 2040 refers to a scenario in which either or both of the parties are <span style="font-style: italic;">unaware</span> of a court's final judgment at the time they agree on a compromise.  In this case, the law allows either of them to <span style="font-style: italic;">rescind</span> the compromise agreement.  It is evident from the quoted paragraph that such an agreement is not prohibited or void or voidable.  Instead, a remedy to impugn the contract, which is an action for rescission, is declared available.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The law allows a party to <span style="font-style: italic;">rescind</span> a compromise agreement, because it could have been entered into in ignorance of the fact that there was already a final judgment.  Knowledge of a decision's finality may affect the resolve to enter into a compromise agreement.<br><br>The second paragraph, though irrelevant to the present case, refers to the instance when the court's decision is still appealable or otherwise subject to modification.  Under this paragraph, ignorance of the decision is not a ground to rescind a compromise agreement, because the parties are still unsure of the final outcome of the case at this time.<br><br>Petitioners' argument, therefore, fails to convince.  Article 2040 of the Civil Code does not refer to the validity of a compromise agreement entered into after final judgment.  Moreover, an important requisite, which is    lack of knowledge of the final judgment, is wanting in the present case.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Supported by Case Law</span><br><br>The issue involving the validity of a compromise agreement notwithstanding a final judgment is not novel.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Jesalva v. Bautista</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> upheld a compromise agreement that covered cases pending trial, on appeal, and with final judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Court noted that Article 2040 impliedly allowed such agreements; there was no limitation as to when these should be entered into.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Palanca v. Court of Industrial Relations</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> sustained a compromise agreement, notwithstanding a final judgment in which only the amount of back wages was left to be determined.  The Court found no evidence of fraud or of any showing that the agreement was contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gatchalian v. Arlegui</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> upheld the right to compromise prior to the execution of a final judgment.  The Court ruled that the final judgment had been novated and superseded by a compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Also, <span style="font-style: italic;">Northern Lines, Inc. v. Court of Tax Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> recognized the right to compromise final and executory judgments, as long as such right was exercised by the proper party litigants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rovero v. Amparo,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> which petitioners cited, did not set any precedent that all compromise agreements after final judgment were invalid.  In that case, the customs    commissioner imposed a fine on an importer, based on the appraised value of the goods illegally brought to the country.  The latter's appeal, which eventually reached this Court, was denied.  Despite a final judgment, the customs commissioner still reappraised the value of the goods and effectively reduced the amount of fine.  Holding that he had no authority to compromise a final judgment, the Court explained:<br><blockquote>"It is argued that the parties to a case may enter into a compromise about even a final judgment rendered by a court, and it is contended x  x  x that the reappraisal ordered by the Commissioner of Customs and sanctioned by the Department of Finance was authorized by Section 1369 of the [Revised Administrative Code].  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The contention may be correct as regards private parties who are the owners of the property subject-matter of the litigation, and who are therefore free to do with what they own or what is awarded to them, as they please, even to the extent of renouncing the award, or condoning the obligation imposed by the judgment on the adverse party.</span>  Not so, however, in the present case.  Here, the Commissioner of Customs is not a private party and is not the owner of the money involved in the fine based on the original appraisal.  He is a mere agent of the Government and acts as a trustee of the money or property in his hands or coming thereto by virtue of a favorable judgment.  Unless expressly authorized by his principal or by law, he is not authorized to accept anything different from or anything less than what is adjudicated in favor of the Government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Bold types supplied)<br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Compliance with the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Rule on Contracts</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><br>There is no justification to disallow a compromise agreement, solely because it was entered into after final judgment.  The validity of the agreement is determined by compliance with the requisites and principles of contracts, not by when it was entered into.  As provided by the law on contracts, a valid compromise must have the following elements: (1) the consent of the parties to the compromise, (2) an object certain that is the subject matter of the compromise, and (3) the cause of the obligation that is established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the present factual milieu, compliance with the elements of a valid contract is not in issue.  Petitioners do not challenge the factual finding that they entered into a compromise agreement with respondent.  There are no allegations of vitiated consent.  Neither was there any proof that the agreement was defective or could be characterized as rescissible,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> voidable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> unenforceable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> or void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Instead, petitioners base their argument on the sole fact that the agreement was executed despite a final judgment, which the Court had previously ruled to be allowed by law.<br><br>Petitioners voluntarily entered into the compromise agreement, as shown by the following facts: (1) they signed respondent's Manifestation (filed with the labor arbiter) that the judgment award had been satisfied;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (2) they executed a Joint Affidavit dated May 5, 1997, attesting to the receipt of payment and the waiver of all other benefits due them;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and (3) 6 of the 8 petitioners filed a Manifestation with the labor arbiter on October 20, 1997, requesting that the cases be terminated because of their receipt of payment in full satisfaction of their claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> These circumstances also reveal that respondent has already complied with its obligation pursuant to the compromise agreement.  Having already benefited from the agreement, estoppel bars petitioners from challenging it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Advantages of Compromise</span><br><br>A reciprocal concession inherent in a compromise agreement assures benefits for the contracting parties.  For the defeated litigant, obvious is the advantage of a compromise after final judgment.  Liability arising from the judgment may be reduced.  As to the prevailing party, a compromise agreement assures receipt of payment.  Litigants are sometimes deprived of their winnings because of unscrupulous mechanisms meant to delay or evade the execution of a final judgment.<br><br>The advantages of a compromise agreement appear to be recognized by the NLRC in its Rules of Procedure.  As part of the proceedings in executing a final judgment, litigants are required to attend a pre-execution conference to thresh out matters relevant to the execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In the conference, any agreement that would settle the final judgment in a particular manner is necessarily a compromise.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Novation of an Obligation</span><br><br>The principle of novation supports the validity of a compromise after final judgment.  Novation, a mode of extinguishing an obligation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> is done by changing the object or principal condition of an obligation, substituting the person of the debtor, or surrogating a third person in the exercise of the rights of the creditor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>For an obligation to be extinguished by another, the law requires either of these two conditions: (1) the substitution is unequivocally declared, or (2) the old and the new obligations are incompatible on every point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> A compromise of a final judgment operates as a novation of the judgment obligation, upon compliance with either requisite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In the present case, the incompatibility of the final judgment with the compromise agreement is evident, because the latter was precisely entered into to supersede the former.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Validity of the Waiver</span><br></div><br>Having ruled on the validity of the compromise agreement in the present suit, the Court now turns its attention to the waiver of claims or quitclaim executed by petitioners.  The subject waiver was their concession when they entered into the agreement.  They allege, however, that the absence of their counsel and the labor arbiter when they executed the waiver invalidates the document.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Not Determinative</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">of the Waiver's Validity</span><br><br>The presence or the absence of counsel when a waiver is executed does not determine its validity.  There is no law requiring the presence of a counsel to validate a waiver.  The test is whether it was executed voluntarily, freely and intelligently; and whether the consideration for it was credible and reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Where there is clear proof that a waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or a gullible person, the law must step in to annul such transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In the present case, petitioners failed to present any evidence to show that their consent had been vitiated.<br><br>The law is silent with regard to the procedure for approving a waiver after a case has been terminated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Relevant, however, is this reference to the NLRC's New Rules of Procedure:<br><blockquote>"Should the parties arrive at any agreement as to the whole or any part of the dispute, the same shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties and their respective counsel, or authorized representative, if any,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> before the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>"The settlement shall be approved by the Labor Arbiter after being satisfied that it was voluntarily entered into by the parties and after having explained to them the terms and consequences thereof.<br><br>"A compromise agreement entered into by the parties not in the presence of the Labor Arbiter before whom the case is pending shall be approved by him, if after confronting the parties, particularly the complainants, he is satisfied that they understand the terms and conditions of the settlement and that it was entered into freely and voluntarily by them and the agreement is not contrary to law, morals, and public policy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>This provision refers to proceedings in a mandatory/conciliation conference during the initial stage of the litigation.  Such provision should be made applicable to the proceedings in the pre-execution conference, for which the procedure for approving a waiver after final judgment is not stated.  There is no reason to make a distinction between the proceedings in mandatory/conciliation and those in pre-execution conferences.<br><br>The labor arbiter's absence when the waivers were executed was remedied upon compliance with the above procedure.  The Court observes that the arbiter made searching questions during the pre-execution conference to ascertain whether petitioners had voluntarily and freely executed the waivers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Likewise, there was evidence that they made an intelligent choice, considering that the contents of the written waivers had been explained to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The labor arbiter's absence when those waivers were executed does not, therefore, invalidate them.<br><br>The Court declines to rule on the allegation that respondent's counsels encroached upon the professional employment of petitioners' lawyer when they facilitated the waivers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The present action is not the proper forum in which to raise any charge of professional misconduct.  More important, petitioners failed to present any supporting evidence.<br><br>The third issue, which refers to the timely filing of petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration filed with the CA, will no longer be discussed because this Court's decision has resolved the case on the merits.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">DENIED</span> and the assailed Decision <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.
