Thus, upon submission of the said TSNs on early part of March 2000, he rendered the decision in Civil Case No. 96-9412 on March 15, 2000. He also reported that the incident in Criminal Case No. 13339 was resolved and said case was decided on April 5, 2000 and is ready for promulgation.<br><br>However, Judge Gellada failed to mention in his letter whether decisions had been rendered in Criminal Cases Nos. 170 and 1128 and in Civil Cases Nos. 4498, 4628, 5399 and 6200.

Tañoso stated that Criminal Case No. 98-19422 was decided on September 30, 1999 but no promulgation was scheduled as it has been their practice in cases of appeal from the lower court to dispense with the promulgation and serve the copies of the decision to the parties. In his letter dated October 24, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> he reported that Civil Cases Nos. 5399 and 6200 had been decided by Judge Gellada<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>; that all TSNs in Criminal Case No. 170 were submitted to Judge Gellada for decision writing; and that the TSNs in Civil Cases Nos. 4628 and 4498 are now ready for submission to Judge Gellada except the one taken on February 4, 1991 since the stenographer who took down the notes requested more time to retrieve the TSN from her voluminous files. He further informed that the TSNs in Criminal Case No. 1128 is still not available explaining that the case is an inherited case and the whereabouts of the stenographers who took down the stenographic notes are already unknown.<br><br>In a Resolution dated April 1, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court referred this administrative matter to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.

Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct mandates judges to decide cases within the required period. Delay in the disposition of cases not only deprives litigants of their right to speedy disposition of their cases, but it also tarnishes the image of the judiciary. Failure to decide cases on time constitutes inefficiency that merits administrative sanction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Anent Judge De Los Santos:<br><br>Indubitably, Judge De Los Santos violated this mandate.

He holds sessions for three (3) days in Kabankalan City and two (2) days in Bacolod City and he has to go home weekly to his hometown in Sibulan, Negros Oriental, which is about five (5) hours drive from Bacolod City;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> He was designated to hear cases from other courts due to the inhibition of other judges, to wit:<br><blockquote>a) Civil Case No. 531 at RTC, Branch 55, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental on January 19, 1999;<br><br>b) Criminal Cases Nos. 4430-69, 4431-69 and 4432-69 at RTC, Silay City on November 16, 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</blockquote></li><li> His frequent travels adversely affected his health and he had to take sick leaves on several occasions. He suffers from high blood sugar, high cholesterol and has very low calcium, potassium levels and experiences migraine headaches.<br></li></ol>Judge De Los Santos added that there was even delay in the submission of his explanation/comment on the directive of the Court on the present case as he had been sick or indisposed on several occasions not to mention the untimely demise of his mother in May 2000. Judge De Los Santos pleads for mercy and understanding for his failure to meet the deadlines in the performance of his functions. He however assured the Court of his continued desire and commitment to do better in his job to decongest his court docket.<br><br>Judge De Los Santos’s heavy caseload brought about by his regular load and those of the other <i>salas</i> he handled and his deteriorating health condition mitigate his liability but are not sufficient grounds to exonerate him from an administrative sanction. Inability to decide a case within the required period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Court has constantly reminded judges to decide cases promptly. Delay not only results in undermining the people’s faith in the judiciary from whom the prompt hearing of their supplications is anticipated and expected; it also reinforces in the mind of the litigants the impression that the wheels of justice grind ever so slowly,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and worse, it invites suspicion of ulterior motives on the part of the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Whenever a judge cannot decide a case within the required period, all he has to do is to inform the Court of his predicament and request for an extension of time to resolve the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> There is no showing that Judge De Los Santos requested for an extension of time to decide the cases. The only instance that he asked for an extension was on May 4, 2000 requesting for additional time of twenty days from May 5, 2000 within which to decide Civil Case No. 261, by which time this administrative case was already pending and now way past the reglementary period.<br><br>Anent Judge Gellada:<br><br>Judge Gellada decided Civil Case No. 96-9412 beyond the reglementary period. The said case was decided on March 15, 2000 but the due date within which to decide the same was on July 11, 1999. Likewise, the incidents in Criminal Case No. 13339 were acted upon beyond the reglementary period. Said incidents were due on May 25, 1998 but were only resolved and the case decided on April 5, 2000. Judge Gellada explained that the delay in taking action on the cases was due to the unavailability of transcripts. Thus, when the TSNs were completed, he immediately decided and resolved the aforecited cases.<br><br>Judge Gellada also failed to give information on whether decisions have been rendered on Criminal Cases Nos. 170 and 1128 and Civil Cases Nos. 4498, 4628, 5399 and 6200 and whether he took appropriate action on Criminal Cases Nos. 10220, 95-16950, 95-17417 and 95-17418.<br><br>To reiterate, it is the duty of a judge to dispose of court’s business promptly. It has been a well-settled rule that judges are not required to await the transcription of the stenographic notes before they could render a decision. This would cause undue delays since judges could easily find justification for failing to comply with the mandatory period to decide cases. Proper and efficient court management is the responsibility of the judge – he is the one directly responsible for the proper discharge of official functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Considering that Civil Case No. 96-9412 and Criminal Case No. 13339 were totally heard by him, Judge Gellada is not justified in deciding cases beyond the required period on the ground of late submission of TSNs.<br><br>Moreover, in spite of the Court’s resolution dated February 23, 2000, Judge Gellada failed to report up to this date whether decisions have been rendered in Criminal Cases Nos. 170 and 1128 and Civil Cases Nos. 4498 and 4628 and to inform whether or not he took appropriate action in Criminal Cases Nos. 10220, 95-16950, 95-17417 and 95-17418. However, the Court notes that Judge Gellada has already decided Civil Cases Nos. 5399 and 6200 as reported by Branch Clerk Tañoso in his letter-compliance.<br><br>Under Section 9 of Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, undue delay in rendering a decision or order, or in transmitting the records of a case is a less serious charge. Section 11 of the same Rule provides for the applicable penalty, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 11. <i>Sanctions</i>. – . . .<br><br>B. If the respondent is guilty of a less serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<ol type="1"><li> Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> A fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">. . .<br></div></blockquote>Regarding the directives to Branch Clerks of Court Tan and Tañoso:<br><br>Clerk of Court Tan fully complied with the directive of the Court by causing the completion of the TSNs in Criminal Cases Nos. 8612 and 8613 and Civil Cases Nos. 261, 7556 and 4434. All TSNs were submitted to her presiding judge while decisions in Criminal Cases Nos. 13351 to 53 and 13637 were already promulgated. The dates of promulgation however were not mentioned.<br><br>The compliance of Clerk of Court Tañoso is noted. However, he failed to submit the TSNs for Criminal Case No. 1128 claiming that this is an inherited case and that the 2 court stenographers who took down the notes can no longer be found, one has retired from service and the other one became a lawyer and the addresses of both are unknown. As to the consolidated Civil Cases Nos. 4628 and 4498, the TSNs are ready except for the one taken on February 4, 1991 reasoning that the concerned stenographer requested for more time to transcribe the same. As to Criminal Case No. 98-19422, he reported that it was decided on September 30, 1999 but no promulgation was scheduled as it has been their practice in cases on appeal from the lower court to dispense with the promulgation and serve the copies of the decision to the parties.<br><br>Indeed, there is no need to promulgate the decision in Criminal Case No. 98-19422 it appearing that the said case was decided by the Regional Trial Court by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction. The judgment which the rule requires to be promulgated is the sentence rendered by the trial court, not the judgment of the appellate court sent to the trial court, the latter being unnecessary to be promulgated to the defendant because it is presumed that the accused or his attorney had already been notified thereof by the appellate court. The latter court sends the copy of his judgment to the trial court not for promulgation or reading thereof to the defendant, but for execution of the judgment against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> Judge Edgardo L.
