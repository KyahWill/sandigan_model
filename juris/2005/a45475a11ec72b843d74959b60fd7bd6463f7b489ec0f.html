Asuncion concluded that respondent did not commit insubordination or disobedience so as to warrant his transfer, and that petitioner was not aggrieved by respondent's failure to settle his obligation with De Manuel.&nbsp; The dispositive portion read:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the respondents are hereby ordered to reinstate the complainant to his former position, with full backwages from the time his salary was withheld until he is actually reinstated.&nbsp; As of this date, the complainant's backwages has reached the sum of P97,324.17.&nbsp; The respondents are further directed to pay the complainant his 13<sup>th</sup> month pay for 1998 in the sum of P3,611.89.&nbsp; The claims for allowance and unpaid commission are dismissed for lack of sufficient basis to make an award.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner lodged an appeal with the NLRC, raising as a ground the lack of jurisdiction of the labor arbiter over respondent's complaint. Significally, this issue was not raised by petitioner in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; In its <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated 16 March 2001, the NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter on the ground that thee latter had no jurisdiction over the case, it being a grievance issue properly cognizable by the voluntary arbitrator.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the NLRC <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision under review is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one entered, DISMISSING the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The motion for reconsideration having been denied on 18 May 2001, respondent elevated the case before the Court of Appeals (CA) through a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> under Rule 65.<br><br>The CA Fifteenth Division reversed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of NLRC, and reinstated the earlier ruling of the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; Adopting the doctrines by this Court in the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alfredo Marquez v.

Respondent heavily relies on this doctrinal jurisprudence.<br><br>On the other hand, the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dy v.

NLRC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> buttress the position of petitioner that jurisdiction is conferred by law and lack of jurisdiction may be questioned at any time even on appeal.<br><br>The Court of Appeals adopted the principles in the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez, Marquez </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> ABS-CBN</span> in resolving the jurisdictional issue presented for its resolution, to wit:<br><blockquote>Indeed, we agree with petitioner that private respondent was estopped from raising the question of jurisdiction before public respondent NLRC and the latter gravely abused its discretion in addressing said question in private respondents' favor.&nbsp; As early as <span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez vs. De la Merced</span>, 174 SCRA 182, the Supreme Court has clearly ruled thus: "<span style="font-style: italic;">For it has been consistently held by this Court that while lack of jurisdiction may be assailed at any stage, a party's active participation in the proceedings before a court without jurisdiction will estop such party from assailing such lack of jurisdiction</span>."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">. . . .<br></div><br>The same principle was adopted by the Highest Tribunal in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alfredo Marquez vs. Sec. of Labor,</span> 171 SCRA 337 and quoted in the latter case of <span style="font-style: italic;">ABS-CBN Supervisors Employees Union Members vs. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation</span>, 304 SCRA 497, where it was ruled that: "<span style="font-style: italic;">The active participation of the party against whom the action was brought, coupled with his failure to object to the jurisdiction of the court or quasi-judicial body where the action is pending, is tantamount to an invocation of that jurisdiction and a willingness to abide by the resolution of the case and will bar said party from later on impugning the court or body's jurisdiction.</span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>We rule differently.&nbsp; A cursory glance at these cases will lead one to the conclusion that a party who does not raise the jurisdictional question at the outset will be estopped to raise it on appeal.&nbsp; However, a more circumspect analysis would reveal that the cases cited by respondent do not fall squarely within the issue and factual circumstances of the instant case.&nbsp; We proceed to demonstrate.<br><br>The notion that the defense of lack of jurisdiction may be waived by estoppel on the party invoking the same most prominently emerged in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tijam v. Sibonghanoy</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Indeed, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez </span>case relied upon by the CA is in turn grounded on <span style="font-style: italic;">Tijam,</span> where We held that:<br><blockquote>. . . a party can not invoke the jurisdiction of a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same jurisdiction (Dean vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A.L.R. 79). In the case just cited, by way of explaining the rule, it was further said that the question whether the court had jurisdiction either of the subject-matter of the action or of the parties is barred from such conduct not because the judgment or order of the court is valid and conclusive as an adjudication, but for the reason that such a practice can not be tolerated—obviously for reasons of public policy.<br><br>Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of the court . . . And in <span style="font-style: italic;">Littleton vs. Burges</span>, 16 Wyo, 58, the Court said that it is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>However, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tijam</span> represented an exceptional case wherein the party invoking lack of jurisdiction did so only after fifteen (15) years, and at a stage when the proceedings had already been elevated to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Even <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez </span>recognizes that <span style="font-style: italic;">Tijam</span> stands as an exception, rather than a general rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The CA perhaps though felt comfortable citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span> owing to the pronouncement therein that the Court would not hesitate to apply <span style="font-style: italic;">Tijam</span> even absent the extraordinary circumstances therein:<br><blockquote>". . . where the entertainment of the jurisdictional issue at a belated stage of the proceedings will result in a failure of justice and render nugatory the constitutional imperative of protection to labor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>In this case, jurisdiction of the labor arbiter was questioned as early as during appeal before the NLRC, whereas in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span>, the question of jurisdiction was raised for the first time only before this Court.&nbsp; The viability of <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span> as controlling doctrine in this case is diminished owing to the radically different circumstances in these two cases.&nbsp; A similar observation can be made as to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayoca</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Jimenez</span> cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Neither do the other like-minded cases squarely settle the issue in favor of the respondent.&nbsp; In the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez</span>, the issue is not jurisdiction by estoppel but waiver of preliminary conference.&nbsp; In that case, we said:<br><blockquote>As pointed out by petitioners, private respondents had at least three opportunities to raise the question of lack of preliminary conference first, when private respondents filed a motion for extension of time to file their position paper; second, at the time when they actually filed their position paper in which they sought affirmative relief from the Metropolitan Trial Court; and third; when they filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of the Metropolitan Trial Court expunging from the records the position paper of private respondents, in which motion private respondents even urged the court to sustain their position paper. And yet, in none of these instances was the issue of lack of preliminary conference raised or even hinted at by private respondents. In fine, these are acts amounting to a waiver of the irregularity of the proceedings. For it has been consistently held by this Court that while lack of jurisdiction may be assailed at any stage, a party's active participation in the proceedings before a court without jurisdiction will estop such party from assailing such lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>The case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ducat</span> was categorical in saying that if the parties acquiesced in submitting an issue for determination by the trial court, they are estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the same court to pass upon the issue.&nbsp; But this should be taken in the context of the "agreement" of the parties.&nbsp; We quote from said case:<br><blockquote>Petitioner's filing of a Manifestion and Urgent Motion to Set Parameters of Computation is indicative of its conformity with the questioned order of the trial court referring the matter of computation of the excess to SGV and simultaneously thereafter, the issuance of a writ of possession.&nbsp; If petitioner thought that subject order was wrong, it could have taken recourse to the Court of Appeals but petitioner did not.&nbsp; Instead he manifested his acquiescence in the said order by seeking parameters before the trial court.&nbsp; It is now too late for petitioner to question subject order of the trial court.&nbsp; Petitioner cannot be allowed to make a mockery of judicial processes, by changing his position from one of the agreement to disagreement, to suit his needs.&nbsp; If the parties acquiesced in submitting an issue for determination by the trial court, they are estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the same court to pass upon the issue.&nbsp; Petitioner is consequently estopped from questioning subject order of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Centeno</span> involved the question of jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Arbitration Board (DARAB). The Court did rule therein that "participation by certain parties in the administrative proceedings without raising any objection thereto, bars them from any jurisdictional infirmity after an adverse decision is rendered against them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Still, the Court did recognize therein that the movants questioning jurisdiction had actually sought and litigated for affirmative reliefs before the DARAB in support of a submitted counterclaim. No similar circumstance obtains in this case concerning the petitioner.<br><br>Evidently, none of these cited precedents squarely operates as <span style="font-style: italic;">stare decisis</span> on this case, involving as they did different circumstances.&nbsp; The question now lies as to whether the precedents cited by petitioner are more <span style="font-style: italic;">apropos</span> to this case.<br><br>Petitioner seeks to convince this Court that the instant case falls squarely within the purview of this Court's ruling in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dy</span>.&nbsp; Admittedly, a different factual mileu was present insofar as the questioned jurisdiction was alleged to have been properly lodged in the SEC instead of NLRC.&nbsp; Yet the rationale employed by the Court therein warrants serious consideration.&nbsp; The aforementioned case was ruled in this wise:<br><blockquote>. . . .More importantly, estoppel cannot be invoked to prevent this Court from taking up the question of jurisdiction, which has been apparent on the face of the pleadings since the start of litigation before the Labor Arbiter. It is well settled that the decision of a tribunal not vested with appropriate jurisdiction is null and void. Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Calimlim vs. Ramirez,</span> this Court held:<br><br>"A rule that had been settled by unquestioned acceptance and upheld in decisions so numerous to cite is that the jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter of the action is a matter of law and may not be conferred by consent or agreement of the parties. The lack of jurisdiction of a court may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal. This doctrine has been qualified by recent pronouncements which stemmed principally from the ruling in the cited case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sibonghanoy</span>. It is to be regretted, however, that the holding in said case had been applied to situations which were obviously not contemplated therein. The exceptional circumstances involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sibonghanoy</span> which justified the departure from the accepted concept of non-waivability of objection to jurisdiction has been ignored and, instead a blanket doctrine had been repeatedly upheld that rendered the supposed ruling in Sibonghanoy not as the exception, but rather the general rule, virtually overthrowing altogether the time honored principle that the issue of jurisdiction is not lost by waiver or by estoppel.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">. . . .<br></div><br>"It is neither fair nor legal to bind a party by the result of a suit or proceeding which was taken cognizance of in a court which lacks jurisdiction over the same irrespective of the attendant circumstances. The equitable defense of estoppel requires knowledge or consciousness of the facts upon which it is based. The same thing is true with estoppel by conduct which may be asserted only when it is shown, among others, that the representation must have been made with knowledge of the facts and that the party to whom it was made is ignorant of the truth of the matter (<span style="font-style: italic;">De Castro vs. Gineta,</span> 27 SCRA 623). The filing of an action or suit in a court that does not possess jurisdiction to entertain the same may not be presumed to be deliberate and intended to secure a ruling which could later be annulled if not favorable to the party who filed such suit or proceeding in a court that lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same, such act may not at once be deemed sufficient basis of estoppel. It could have been te result of an honest mistake or of divergent interpretation of doubtful legal provisions. If any fault is to be imputed to a party taking such course of action, part of the blame should be placed on the court which shall entertain the suit, thereby lulling the parties into believing that they pursued their remedies in the correct forum. Under the rules, it is the duty of the court to dismiss an action `whenever it appears that court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter.' (Section 2, Rule 9, Rules of Court) Should the Court render a judgment without jurisdiction, such judgment may be impeached or annulled for lack of jurisdiction (Sec. 30, Rule 132,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ibid</span>), within ten (10) years from the finality of the same (Art. 1144, par. 3, Civil Code)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>The jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter was assailed in the cases of De Rossi v. NLRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and Union Motors Corporation v. NLRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> during appeal to the NLRC.&nbsp; Since the same circumstance obtains in this case, the rulings therein, favorable as they are to the petitioner, are germane.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">De Rossi,</span> this Court elucidated:<br><blockquote>Petitioner maintains that MICC can not question now the issue of jurisdiction of the NLRC, considering that MICC did not raise this matter until after the case had been brought on appeal to the NLRC. However, it has long been established as a rule, that jurisdiction of a tribunal, agency, or office, is conferred by law, and its lack of jurisdiction may be questioned at any time even on appeal. In <span style="font-style: italic;">La Naval Drug Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, </span>236 SCRA 78, 90, this Court said:<br><br>"Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit is yet another matter. Whenever it appears that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the action shall be dismissed. This defense may be interposed at any time, during appeal or even after final judgment. Such is understandable, as this kind of jurisdiction is conferred by law and not within the courts, let alone the parties, to themselves determine or conveniently set aside."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>We held in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Union Motors</span> Case:<br><blockquote>The long-established rule is that jurisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by law. [<span style="font-style: italic;">Ilaw at Buklod ng Manggaggawa v. NLRC, </span>219 SCRA 536 (1993); <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlas Developer &amp; Steel Industries, Inc. v. Sarmiento Enterprises, Inc.,</span> 184 SCRA 153 (1990); <span style="font-style: italic;">Tijam v. Sibonghanoy</span>, 23 SCRA 29, 30 (1968)].&nbsp; Estoppel does not apply to confer jurisdiction to a tribunal that has none over a cause of action. Where it appears that the court or tribunal has no jurisdiction, then the defense may be interposed at any time, even on appeal or even after final judgment. Moreover, the principle of estoppel cannot be invoked to prevent this court from taking up the question of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lozon v. NLRC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> addresses the issue at hand.&nbsp; This Court came up with a clear rule as to when jurisdiction by estoppel applies and when it does not:<br><blockquote>Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit is yet another matter. Whenever it appears that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the action shall be dismissed (Section 2, Rule 9, Rules of Court). This defense may be interposed at any time, during appeal (<span style="font-style: italic;">Roxas vs. Rafferty</span>, 37 Phil. 957) or even after final judgment (<span style="font-style: italic;">Cruzcosa vs. Judge Concepcion, et al.</span>, 101 Phil. 146). Such is understandable, as this kind of jurisdiction is conferred by law and not within the courts, let alone the parties, to themselves determine or conveniently set aside. In <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Casiano</span> (111 Phil. 73, 93-94), this Court, on the issue of estoppel, held:<br><br>"The operation of the principle of estoppel on the question of jurisdiction seemingly depends upon whether the lower court actually had jurisdiction or not.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">If it had no jurisdiction, but the case was tried and decided upon the theory that it had jurisdiction, the parties are not barred, on appeal, from assailing such jurisdiction, for the same 'must exist as a matter of law, and may not be conferred by consent of the parties or by estoppel</span>' (5 C.J.S., 861-863). <span style="font-weight: bold;">However, if the lower court had jurisdiction, and the case was heard and decided upon a given theory, such, for instance, as that the court had no jurisdiction, the party who induced it to adopt such theory will not be permitted, on appeal, to assume an inconsistent position—that the lower court had jurisdiction.</span> Here, the principle of estoppel applies. The rule that jurisdiction is conferred by law, and does not depend upon the will of the parties, has no bearing thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Verily, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lozon, Union Motors, Dy </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> De Rossi </span>aptly resolve the jurisdictional issue obtaining in this case.&nbsp; Applying the guidelines in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lozon</span>, the labor arbiter assumed jurisdiction when he should not.&nbsp; In fact, the NLRC correctly reversed the labor arbiter's decision and ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>What appears at first blush to be an issue which pertains to the propriety of complainant's reassignment to another job on account of his having contracted a private loan, is one which may be considered as falling within the jurisdiction of the Office of the Labor Arbiter. Nevertheless, since the complainant is a union member, he should be bound by the covenants provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">. . . .<br></div><br>Based on the foregoing considerations, it appears that the issue of validity of complainant's reassignment stemmed from the exercise of a management prerogative which is a matter apt for resolution by a Grievance Committee, the parties having opted to consider such as a grievable issue.&nbsp; Further, a review of the records would show that the matter of reassignment is one not directly related to the charge of complainant's having committed an act which is inimical to respondents' interest, since the latter had already been addressed to by complainant's service of a suspension order.&nbsp; The transfer, in effect, is one which properly falls under Section 1, Article IV of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and, as such, questions as to the enforcement thereof is one which falls under the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>In line with the cases cited above and applying the general rule that estoppel does not confer jurisdiction, petitioner is not estopped from assailing the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter before the NLRC on appeal.<br><br>Respondent relied solely on estoppel to oppose petitioner's claim of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the labor arbiter.&nbsp; He adduced no other legal ground in support of his contention that the Labor Arbiter had jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Thus, his claim falls flat in light of our pronouncement, and more so considering the NLRC's correct observation that jurisdiction over grievance issues, such as the propriety of the reassignment of a union member falls under the jurisdiction of the voluntary arbitrator.<br><br>Since jurisdiction does not lie with the Labor Arbiter, it is futile to discuss about the computation of the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the questioned decision of the Labor Arbiter and the Court of Appeals are hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>, and the decision of the NLRC in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction <span style="font-weight: bold;">REINSTATED</span>.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 10-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Id</span>. at 87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Id</span>. at 88-89.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 90-91.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Particularly, for "committing other culpable acts or omission not embraced by other provisions which caused damage to company interest."<span style="font-style: italic;"> Id</span>. at 90.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Id</span>. at 92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 93.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 95.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 118-122.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 122<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Penned by Presiding Commissioner Raul T.
