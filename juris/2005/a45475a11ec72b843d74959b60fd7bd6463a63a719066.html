Except for the summary and schedules of input VAT payments prepared by respondent itself, no other evidence was adduced in support of its claim.<br><br>As for respondent's claim for input VAT refund for the <u>second semester of 1991</u>, it employed the services of Joaquin Cunanan &amp; Co. on account of which it (Joaquin Cunanan &amp; Co.) executed a certification that:<br><blockquote>We have examined the information shown below concerning the input tax payments made by the Makati Office of Manila Mining Corporation for the period from July 1 to December 31, 1991.
