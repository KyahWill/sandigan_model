				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present Petition is anchored on the alleged lack of legal personality of respondent, a matter that was finally settled in an earlier case when petitioners challenged a decision of the secretary of labor.&nbsp; Necessarily petitioners are now barred from re-litigating this issue.&nbsp; The earlier finding that respondent possessed legal personality as a legitimate labor organization is already the law of the case between the parties. <br><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the July 31, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the January 21, 2003 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 66065.&nbsp; The challenged Decision disposed as follows: <br><br>“WHEREFORE, the December 5, 2000 Writ of Execution issued by then Labor Secretary Bienvenido E.

Laguesma, resolved the stalemate between petitioner and the Union as he 1) awarded, for mandatory inclusion into a [Collective Bargaining Agreement or ‘CBA’] to be executed by the parties, wage increases in favor of petitioner’s rank and file of P900.00 per month for both school years 1998 to 1999 and 1999 to 2000 and P1,000.00 a month for school year 2000 to 2001, 2) fixed the effectivity to the proposed CBA at the start of school year 1998 to 1999, 3) advised the parties to negotiate on the personnel’s retirement benefits in accordance with Republic Act No. 7641 or the Retirement Law, and 4) denied the Union’s claim for the grant of a signing bonus.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>“Upon motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner, the Labor Secretary, by April 12, 1999 Resolution, modified his January 4, 1999 Decision by awarding lower wage increases of P800.00 a month for school years 1998 to 1999 and 1999 to 2000 and P900.00 per month for school year 2000 to 2001.&nbsp; In the same Resolution, acting on petitioner’s contention that it cannot be compelled to enter into a CBA with the Union which was not a legitimate labor organization, petitioner invoking a November 27, 1998 Order of DOLE Regional Director Carlos L. Boteros dismissing its (petitioner’s) [Petition for Cancellation of Union Registration] against the Union (docketed as RP601-9809-RU-001) on the ground that the Union had not yet been conferred any legitimate personality at the time, the Labor Secretary held that the Union was a legitimate labor organization in light of the issuance to it of a Certificate of Creation of Local/Chapter No. RP601-9809-LC-001 on November 19, 1998.<br><br>“Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court, ‘Kabankalan Catholic College v. Kabankalan Catholic College Union – PACIWU-TUCP’ (docketed as GR No. 139216) assailing the January 4, 1999 Decision of the Labor Secretary on the principal grounds that the Union was without legal status and thus could not execute any CBA with petitioner and the awards made therein were tainted with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; By Resolution of August 16, 1999, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition for certiorari due to late filing and late payment of docket fees.&nbsp; And petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied by Resolution of October 27, 1999, as was the second motion for reconsideration by Resolution of January 24, 2000.<br><br>“Meanwhile, twin complaints for unfair labor practice, RAB CASE NO. 06-10-10727-98 and RAB CASE NO. 06-03-10310-99, filed by the Union together with others against petitioner and its president Msgr. Rogelio B. Cruz were dismissed by separate Decisions dated July 26, 1999 and October 28, 1999, respectively, rendered by Labor Arbiter Ray Alan T. Drilon who therein found that the Union was not a duly registered labor organization and thus had no personality to bring suit.&nbsp; The Union appealed Labor Arbiter Drilon’s decisions to the National Labor Relations Commission x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x.<br><br>“Upon motion filed by the Union, the Labor Secretary, by Order of February 24, 2000, directed the issuance of a writ of execution to enforce his January 4, 1999 Decision, as modified by his April 12, 1999 Resolution.&nbsp; Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of the Order of Execution but was denied by Order of September 11, 2000, which also ordered the Director of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB), Regional Branch No. VI, Adorico D. Dadivas, Jr. to compute the award of wage increase in favor of petitioner’s rank and file.<br><br>“Petitioner then filed a petition for Certiorari with [the CA], docketed as CA-GR No. 62049, seeking the nullification of the above Orders of February 24, 2000 and September 11, 2000 of the Labor Secretary on the ground that the Union in the labor cases invoked by petitioner had already been adjudged to be an unregistered union without the usual rights of a legitimate labor organization.&nbsp; The petition was dismissed, however, by Resolution of December 11, 2000 for being procedurally defective.&nbsp; By Resolution of April 25, 2001, [the CA] denied the motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the petition since a similar petition, that adverted to earlier, had already been brought to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; An Entry of Judgment was later issued by the Clerk of Court of [the CA] declaring that the December 11, 2000 Resolution (dismissing petitioner’s petition filed with [the CA]) had already become final and executory on May 25, 2001.<br><br>“The Labor Secretary, by Order dated November 29, 2000, later approved the computation made by NCMB Director Dadivas and subsequently issued a Writ of Execution dated December 5, 2000 the essential particulars of which are as follows:<br><br>‘ACCORDINGLY, a Writ of Execution is hereby issued commanding the Sheriff to proceed to the premises of KABANKALAN CATHOLIC COLLEGE at Guanzon St., Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental and execute fully and faithfully the Decision dated 04 January 1999 as modified by the 12 April 1999 Resolution and to collect from the COLLEGE the amount of P4,120,000.00, representing the award on wage increase as of September 2000, and to turn over the amount collected to the Cashier of DOLE Regional Branch No. VI, Bacolod City.<br><br>‘In case you fail to collect said amount in cash from the COLLEGE, you are to cause the satisfaction of the same out of the movables or chattels or, in the absence thereof, from the immovable properties not exempt from execution.’<br><br>“Notices of Garnishment all dated December 19, 2000 were thereafter served by x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x Sheriff Enrico Y. Paredes on petitioner’s depository banks in Kabankalan City, namely, Philippine National Bank, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Traders Royal Bank and Allied Bank.<br><br>“Petitioner immediately filed a ‘Motion to Quash Writ of Execution and Motion to Lift Notice of Garnishment’ with the Secretary of Labor, alleging that the September 11, 2000 Order for the execution of the Labor Secretary’s modified January 4, 1999 Decision had not yet attained finality due to the pending certiorari petition (CA-GR No. 62048) in [the CA], and that petitioner was not notified nor given a chance to contest NCMB Director Dadivas’ computation.&nbsp; By Order of February 2, 2001, both motions were denied by the Labor Secretary, the decision sought to be implemented by the subject writ of execution having become final and executory.&nbsp; Petitioner was, however, given the opportunity to file its comment on the computation arrived at by Director Dadivas.<br><br>“The incumbent Labor Secretary x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x, Patricia A. Sto. Tomas, by July 25, 2001 Order, similarly denied the motion for reconsideration of the abovesaid February 2, 2001 Order, rejecting petitioner’s principal contention that the December 5, 2000 Writ of Execution went beyond the terms of the January 4, 1999 Decision by ordering the actual payment of the wage increases awarded in such decision, instead of merely compelling the parties to enter into a CBA which would incorporate said wage increases.<br><br>“Secretary Sto. Tomas, however, directed a recomputation of the P4,120,000.00 award of wage increase in light of petitioner’s submission that there were some employees who left its employ at the time the wage increases became due and demandable.&nbsp; And she did not allow petitioner to credit wage increases it already gave to its personnel during the covered school years, those increases not having been made in compliance with the January 4, 1999 Decision, as modified by the April 12, 1999 Resolution.<br><br>“[Petitioner filed a] petition for certiorari [with the CA] ascribing to Secretary Sto. Tomas grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, first, in affirming the validity, instead of ordering the quashal of the December 5, 2000 Writ of Execution issued by then Labor Secretary Laguesma even if the Writ purportedly exceeded the terms of the January 4, 1999 Decision, as modified; second, in not ordering the lifting of the notices of garnishment although they were served by the sheriff on the strength of an invalid writ of execution; third, in disallowing petitioner from deducting wage increases it had actually given all its personnel for the covered school years from the wage increase award contained in the January 4, 1999 Decision, as amended by the April 12, 1999 Resolution; and lastly, in declaring that the Certification of Creation of Local/Chapter issued to the Union on November 19, 1998 had an effectivity retroactive to November 17, 1996.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>The CA granted the Petition for Certiorari.&nbsp; The Writ of Execution dated December 5, 2000, was quashed; set aside were the February 2, 2001 and the July 25, 2001 Orders of Labor Secretary Patricia A.

Allegedly, because the union was not a legitimate labor organization, in effect, it had no legal personality (1) when it filed its Petition for a certification election, (2) during that election, and (3) during the negotiations that resulted in a deadlock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Second, petitioner relies on two cases in the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch (RAB) at Bacolod City, in which the union’s Complaints for unfair labor practice were dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The dismissal was due to a finding that the union was not a legitimate labor organization and therefore had no legal personality to sue and represent its members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Question of Fact</span><br><br>Because the existence of the union’s legal personality is a question of fact, it is not a proper issue in a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Even assuming that a factual review is in order, petitioner has presented no evidence to rebut the findings of two labor secretaries and the CA with regard to the union’s registration as a legitimate labor organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Accordingly, these factual findings affirm the contention of the union that it was chartered as a chapter of PACIWU-TUCP on November 17, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The Implementing Rules of the Labor Code allows chartering by a federation or a national union as a means of qualifying as a legitimate labor organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The factual findings affirmed by the CA are supported by substantial evidence and are therefore accorded finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The Law of the Case</span><br><br>The issue involving the alleged lack of legal personality to conclude a CBA had already been litigated and finally decided when petitioner challenged Labor Secretary Laguesma’s arbitral award.&nbsp; That case eventually reached this Court, which denied the Petition because of petitioner’s own fault in failing to pay the docket fees on time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Necessarily, the validity of the arbitral award became the <span style="font-style: italic;">law of the case</span> between the parties.&nbsp; Under this legal principle, whatever is irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, so long as the facts on which the decision was predicated continues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Otherwise stated, the principle holds that once an appellate court has declared the law in a case, that declaration continues to hold even in a subsequent appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Reasons of public policy, judicial orderliness and economy require such stability in the final judgments of courts or tribunals of competent jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner is therefore barred from challenging the legal personality of the union with the intention of nullifying the arbitral award.&nbsp; Having been declared valid by a final judgment, the award can no longer be assailed.&nbsp; Issues should be laid to rest at some point; otherwise, there would be no end to litigation.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">De Villa v. Jacob</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> explained thus:<br><blockquote>“It is well established that when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, so long as it remains unreversed, it should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them. The dictum therein laid down became the law of the case and what was once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision, continues to be binding between the same parties as long as the facts on which the decision was predicated, continue to be the facts of the case before the court. Hence, the binding effect and enforceability of that dictum can no longer be relitigated anew since said issue had already been resolved and finally laid to rest in that aforementioned case (Miranda v. C.A., 141 SCRA 306 [1986]), if not by the principle of res judicata, but at least by conclusiveness of judgment (Vda. de Sta. Romana v.
