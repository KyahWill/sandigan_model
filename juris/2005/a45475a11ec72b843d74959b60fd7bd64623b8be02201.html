				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Order</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated April 30, 2003 and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Order of Demolition</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 9, 2003 of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Parañaque City, Branch 77. Petitioners had applied for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) but the Court in a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 15, 2003 denied the application.<br><br>The facts in this case, culled from the record, are as follows.<br><br>The present controversy arose from a complaint for ejectment, docketed as Civil Case No. 11799, filed before the MeTC by private respondents Cecilia B. Palisoc and Marina B. Mata. In a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 27, 2002, the court declared respondents as the rightful possessors of the properties in dispute. It also ordered the petitioners to vacate the premises and pay to private respondents the rentals.<br><br>Petitioners appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Parañaque City, Branch 274 while private respondents moved for execution pending appeal. On January 8, 2003, the RTC affirmed the MeTC decision with the modification that petitioners must start paying rentals from the date of the appealed decision.<br><br>On January 28, 2003, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Opposition to the Issuance of a Writ of Execution. In an order dated March 3, 2003, the RTC denied the motion and granted private respondents' motion for execution for failure of petitioners to post a supersedeas bond or to pay the back rentals. Thus, a writ of execution pending appeal was issued. On March 7, 2003, petitioners were served with the writ and notice to vacate.<br><br>On March 11, 2003, petitioners filed a Motion to Defer Implementation of the Writ of Execution. On March 14, 2003, private respondents filed a Motion to Issue a Special Order of Demolition since petitioners refused to vacate the premises. The RTC deferred action on the motions to allow petitioners to exhaust legal remedies available to them.<br><br>Petitioners thereafter filed a Supplement to the Motion to Defer Implementation of Writ of Execution and Opposition to Motion to Issue Special Order of Demolition, contending that Section 28 of Republic Act No. 7279<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was not complied with.<br><br>On April 4, 2003, private respondents filed a Motion Reiterating the Motion for Issuance of Special Order of Demolition. In an order dated April 11, 2003, the RTC declared the decision denying petitioners' appeal final and executory, and remanded the records of the case to the MeTC without acting on the motions.<br><br>However, on April 10, 2003, petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Prayer for Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction before the Court of Appeals. They also filed an Urgent Vigorous Opposition and Motion to Suspend Proceedings on respondents' Motion Reiterating the Motion for Issuance of Special Order of Demolition before the MeTC.<br><br>The MeTC set the Motion for the Issuance of Special Order of Demolition for hearing. The court granted said motion on April 30, 2003, but gave petitioners five (5) days from receipt of its order to voluntarily vacate the premises and remove all structures and improvements made thereon.<br><br>On May 6, 2003, MeTC Branch Sheriff Reynaldo T. Nepomuceno reported that petitioners refused to vacate the premises. Petitioners instead filed a Motion to Quash and Recall the Order dated April 30, 2003 and/or Special Order of Demolition. The MeTC denied the motion and issued the Special Order of Demolition on May 9, 2003.<br><br>Hence, this petition where petitioners raise the lone error that<br><blockquote>THE COURT A QUO, IN BRUSHING ASIDE REPUBLIC ACT [NO.] 7279 IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE CASE AGAINST THESE UNDERPRIVILEGED PETITIONERS, HAS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE, NOT THERETOFORE DETERMINED BY THE SUPREME COURT, AND/OR HAS DECIDED IT IN A WAY PROBABLY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Simply, the issue is, are the Orders of the MeTC proper?<br><br>Petitioners contend that the Orders of the MeTC violated the mandatory requirements of Section 28<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of Rep. Act No. 7279 since there was no 30-day notice prior to the date of eviction or demolition and there had been no consultation on the matter of resettlement. They also claim that there was neither relocation nor financial assistance given. They insist that the MeTC orders are patently unreasonable, impossible and in violation of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Private respondents for their part argue that Rep. Act No. 7279 is not applicable. They aver that there was no proof that petitioners are registered as eligible socialized housing program beneficiaries in accordance with procedure set forth in the Implementing Rules and Regulations Governing the Registration of Socialized Housing Beneficiaries issued by the Department of Interior and Local Government and the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council. They aver that even if Rep. Act No. 7279 was applicable, the required notices under the law had already been complied with. According to them, petitioners were already notified on March 7, 2003 of an impending demolition, when the writ of execution was served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>We find for respondents.<br><br>Under Section 19,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Rule 70 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure, a judgment on a forcible entry and detainer action is immediately executory to avoid further injustice to a lawful possessor, and the court's duty to order the execution is practically ministerial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The defendant may stay it only by (a) perfecting an appeal; (b) filing a supersedeas bond; and (c) making a periodic deposit of the rental or reasonable compensation for the use and occupancy of the property during the pendency of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Once the Regional Trial Court decides on the appeal, such decision is immediately executory under Section 21,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rule 70, without prejudice to an appeal, via a petition for review, before the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>However, petitioners failed to file a petition for review. Records show that petitioners received on March 12, 2003 the RTC decision denying their motion for reconsideration. They had until March 27, 2003 to file a petition for review before the Court of Appeals. Instead, they filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition on April 10, 2003. In said petition, which is still pending, petitioners contended that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the MeTC decision and insisted that the latter court had no jurisdiction over the complaint.<br><br>The remedy to obtain reversal or modification of the judgment on the merits in the instant case is appeal. This holds true even if the error ascribed to the court rendering the judgment is its lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or the exercise of power in excess thereof, or grave abuse of discretion in the findings of fact or of law set out in the decision. The existence and availability of the right of appeal prohibits the resort to certiorari because one of the requirements for the latter remedy is that "there should be no appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Clearly, petitioners' petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals was filed as a substitute for the lost remedy of appeal. Certiorari is not and cannot be made a substitute for an appeal where the latter remedy is available but was lost through fault or negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, the filing of the petition for certiorari did not prevent the RTC decision from becoming final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The RTC acted correctly when it remanded the case to the court of origin in the order dated April 11, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Thus, we find that the MeTC cannot be faulted for issuing the assailed orders to enforce the RTC judgment. Both orders were issued after the requisite notice and hearing. Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not issue any writ of preliminary injunction to stay the execution of the judgment.<br><br>Petitioners tried to stay the execution of the order of demolition by filing a petition for review with prayer for TRO before us. We earlier denied said prayer for TRO. We also find petitioners' contention that the said orders violated Rep. Act No. 7279, particularly Section 28(c),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> totally without merit. Under the provision, eviction or demolition may be allowed when there is a court order for eviction and demolition, as in the case at bar. Moreover, nothing is shown on record that petitioners are underprivileged and homeless citizens as defined in Section 3(t) of Rep. Act No. 7279.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The procedure for the execution of the eviction or demolition order under Section 28(c) is, in our view, not applicable.<br><br>It also appears that the order of demolition had already been executed. Petitioners had already vacated the area and private respondents now possess the properties free from all occupants, as evidenced by the sheriff's turn-over of possession dated May 19, 2003. Thus, the instant case before us has indeed become moot and academic.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition for review assailing the Order dated April 30, 2003 and the Special Order of Demolition dated May 9, 2003 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Parañaque City, Branch 77, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span> for mootness and lack of merit.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Rollo, p. 30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 25-29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 36-38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 31-35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> An Act to Provide for a Comprehensive and Continuing Urban Development and Housing Program, Establish the Mechanism for its Implementation, and for other purposes.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Section 28. <span style="font-style: italic;">Eviction and Demolition</span>.—Eviction or demolition as a practice shall be discouraged.
