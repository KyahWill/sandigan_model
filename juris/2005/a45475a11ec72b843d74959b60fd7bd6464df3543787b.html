				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner San Miguel Corporation (SMC), represented by its Assistant Vice President and Visayas Area Manager for Aquaculture Operations Leopoldo S. Titular, and Sunflower Multi-Purpose Cooperative (Sunflower), represented by the Chairman of its Board of Directors Roy G. Asong, entered into a one-year Contract of Services<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> commencing on January 1, 1993, to be renewed on a month to month basis until terminated by either party.&nbsp; The pertinent provisions of the contract read:<br><blockquote>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The cooperative agrees and undertakes to perform and/or provide for the company, on a non-exclusive basis for a period of one year</span> the following services for the Bacolod Shrimp Processing Plant:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. Messengerial/Janitorial<br>B. Shrimp Harvesting/Receiving<br>C. Sanitation/Washing/Cold Storage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></div><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; To carry out the undertaking specified in the immediately preceding paragraph, the cooperative shall employ the necessary personnel and provide adequate equipment, materials, tools and apparatus, to efficiently, fully and speedily accomplish the work and services undertaken by the cooperative. xxx<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; In consideration of the above undertaking the company expressly agrees to pay the cooperative the following rates per activity:<br><br>A. Messengerial/Janitorial Monthly Fixed Service Charge of: Nineteen Thousand Five Hundred Pesos Only (P19,500.00)<br><br>B. Harvesting/Shrimp Receiving. – Piece rate of P0.34/kg. Or P100.00 minimum per person/activity whichever is higher, with provisions as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">P25.00 Fixed Fee per person<br>Additional meal allowance P15.00 every meal time in case harvest duration exceeds one meal. <br>This will be pre-set every harvest based on harvest plan approved by the Senior Buyer.<br></div><br>C. Sanitation/Washing and Cold Storage P125.00/person for 3 shifts.<br><br>One-half of the payment for all services rendered shall be payable on the fifteenth and the other half, on the end of each month.&nbsp; The cooperative shall pay taxes, fees, dues and other impositions that shall become due as a result of this contract.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The cooperative shall have the entire charge, control and supervision of the work and services</span> herein agreed upon. xxx<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no employer-employee relationship</span> between the company and the cooperative, or the cooperative and any of its members, or the company and any members of the cooperative.&nbsp; The cooperative is an association of self-employed members, an independent contractor, and an entrepreneur.&nbsp; It is subject to the control and direction of the company only as to the result to be accomplished by the work or services herein specified, and not as to the work herein contracted.&nbsp; The cooperative and its members recognize that it is taking a business risk in accepting a fixed service fee to provide the services contracted for and its realization of profit or loss from its undertaking, in relation to all its other undertakings, will depend on how efficiently it deploys and fields its members and how they perform the work and manage its operations.<br><br>5. T<span style="text-decoration: underline;">he cooperative shall, whenever possible, maintain and keep under its control the premises where the work under this contract shall be performed.</span><br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cooperative shall have exclusive discretion in the selection, engagement and discharge of its member-workers or otherwise in the direction and control thereof.&nbsp; The determination of the wages, salaries and compensation of the member-workers of the cooperative shall be within its full control.&nbsp; It is further understood that the cooperative is an independent contractor, and as such, the cooperative agrees to comply with all the requirements of all pertinent laws and ordinances, rules and regulations.&nbsp; Although it is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that the cooperative, in the performance of its obligations, is subject to the control or direction of the company merely as a (sic) result to be accomplished by the work or services herein specified, and not as to the means and methods of accomplishing such result, the cooperative hereby warrants that it will perform such work or services in such manner as will be consistent with the achievement of the result herein contracted for.<br><br>xxx<br><br>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The cooperative undertakes to pay the wages or salaries of its member-workers</span>, as well as all benefits, premiums and protection in accordance with the provisions of the labor code, cooperative code and other applicable laws and decrees and the rules and regulations promulgated by competent authorities, assuming all responsibility therefor.<br><br>The cooperative further undertakes to submit to the company within the first ten (10) days of every month, a statement made, signed and sworn to by its duly authorized representative before a notary public or other officer authorized by law to administer oaths, to the effect that the cooperative has paid all wages or salaries due to its employees or personnel for services rendered by them during the month immediately preceding, including overtime, if any, and that such payments were all in accordance with the requirements of law.<br><br>xxx<br><br>12. Unless sooner terminated for the reasons stated in paragraph 9 this contract shall be for a period of one (1) year commencing on January 1, 1993.&nbsp; Thereafter, this Contract will be deemed renewed on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party by sending a written notice to the other at least thirty (30) days prior to the intended date of termination.<br><br>xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Pursuant to the contract, Sunflower engaged private respondents to, as they did, render services at SMC’s Bacolod Shrimp Processing Plant at Sta. Fe, Bacolod City.&nbsp; The contract was deemed renewed by the parties every month after its expiration on January 1, 1994 and private respondents continued to perform their tasks until September 11, 1995.<br><br>In July 1995, private respondents filed a complaint before the NLRC, Regional Arbitration Branch No. VI, Bacolod City, praying to be declared as regular employees of SMC, with claims for recovery of all benefits and privileges enjoyed by SMC rank and file employees.<br><br>Private respondents subsequently filed on September 25, 1995 an Amended Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to include illegal dismissal as additional cause of action following SMC’s closure of its Bacolod Shrimp Processing Plant on September 15, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which resulted in the termination of their services.<br><br>SMC filed a Motion for Leave to File Attached Third Party Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated November 27, 1995 to implead Sunflower as Third Party Defendant which was, by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of December 11, 1995, granted by Labor Arbiter Ray Alan T. Drilon.<br><br>In the meantime, on September 30, 1996, SMC filed before the Regional Office at Iloilo City of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) a Notice of Closure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of its aquaculture operations effective on even date, citing serious business losses.<br><br>By Decision of September 23, 1997, Labor Arbiter Drilon dismissed private respondents’ complaint for lack of merit, ratiocinating as follows:<br><blockquote>We sustain the stand of the respondent SMC that it could properly exercise its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">management prerogative to contract out the preparation and processing aspects of its aquaculture operations.</span>&nbsp; Judicial notice has already been taken regarding the general practice adopted in government and private institutions and industries of hiring independent contractors to perform special services. xxx<br><br>xxx<br><br>Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the law allows job contracting</span>.&nbsp; Job contracting is permissible under the Labor Code under specific conditions and we do not see how this activity could not be legally undertaken by an independent service cooperative like the third-party respondent herein.<br><br>There is no basis to the demand for regularization simply on the theory that complainants performed activities which are necessary and desirable in the business of respondent.&nbsp; It has been held that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the definition of regular employees as those who perform activities which are necessary and desirable for the business of the employer is not always determinative</span> because any agreement may provide for one (1) party to render services for and in behalf of another for a consideration even without being hired as an employee.<br><br>The charge of the complainants <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that third-party respondent is a mere labor-only contractor is a sweeping generalization and completely unsubstantiated</span>.&nbsp; xxx In the absence of clear and convincing evidence showing that third-party respondent acted merely as a labor only contractor, we are firmly convinced of the legitimacy and the integrity of its service contract with respondent SMC.<br><br>In the same vein, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">closure of the Bacolod Shrimp Processing Plant was a management decision purely dictated by economic factors</span> which was (sic) mainly serious business losses.&nbsp; The law recognizes the right of the employer to close his business or cease his operations for bonafide reasons, as much as it recognizes the right of the employer to terminate the employment of any employee due to closure or cessation of business operations, unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of the law on security of tenure.&nbsp; The decision of respondent SMC to close its Bacolod Shrimp Processing Plant, due to serious business losses which has (sic) clearly been established, is a management prerogative which could hardly be interfered with.<br><br>xxx The closure did affect the regular employees and workers of the Bacolod Processing Plant, who were accordingly terminated following the legal requisites prescribed by law.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The closure, however, in so far as the complainants are concerned, resulted in the termination of SMC’s service contract with their cooperative</span> xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Private respondents appealed to the NLRC.<br><br>By Decision of December 29, 1998, the NLRC dismissed the appeal for lack of merit, it finding that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third party respondent Sunflower was an independent contractor</span> in light of its observation that “[i]n all the activities of private respondents, they were under the actual direction, control and supervision of third party respondent Sunflower, as well as the payment of wages, and power of dismissal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Private respondents’ Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> having been denied by the NLRC for lack of merit by Resolution of September 10, 1999, they filed a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> before the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>Before the CA, SMC filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> private respondents’ petition for non-compliance with the Rules on Civil Procedure and failure to show grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.<br><br>SMC subsequently filed its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to the petition on March 30, 2000.<br><br>By Decision of February 7, 2001, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the appellate court <span style="font-weight: bold;">reversed</span> the NLRC decision and accordingly found for private respondents</span>, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.&nbsp; Accordingly, judgment is hereby RENDERED: (1) REVERSING and SETTING ASIDE both the 29 December 1998 decision and 10 September 1999 resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Fourth Division, Cebu City in NLRC Case No. V-0361-97 as well as the 23 September 1997 decision of the labor arbiter in RAB Case No. 06-07-10316-95; (2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORDERING the respondent, San Miguel Corporation, to GRANT petitioners: (a) separation pay</span> in accordance with the computation given to the regular SMC employees working at its Bacolod Shrimp Processing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plant with full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent</span>, from 11 September 1995, the time their actual compensation was withheld from them, up to the time of the finality of this decision; (b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">differentials pays</span> (sic) effective as of and from the time petitioners acquired regular employment status pursuant to the disquisition mentioned above, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and all such other and further benefits as provided by applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) or other relations, or by law</span>, beginning such time up to their termination from employment on 11 September 1995; and ORDERING private respondent SMC to PAY unto the petitioners <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attorney’s fees</span> equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the total award.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Justifying its reversal of the findings of the labor arbiter and the NLRC, the appellate court reasoned:<br><blockquote>Although the terms of the non-exclusive contract of service between SMC and [Sunflower] showed a clear intent to abstain from establishing an employer-employee relationship between SMC and [Sunflower] or the latter’s members, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the extent to which the parties successfully realized this intent in the light of the applicable law is the controlling factor in determining the real and actual relationship</span> between or among the parties.<br><br>xxx<br><br>With respect to the power to control petitioners’ conduct, it appears that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioners were under the direct control and supervision of SMC supervisors</span> both as to the manner they performed their functions and as to the end results thereof.&nbsp; It was only after petitioners lodged a complaint to have their status declared as regular employees of SMC that certain members of [Sunflower] began to countersign petitioners’ daily time records to make it appear that they (petitioners) were under the control and supervision of [Sunflower] team leaders (rollo, pp. 523-527). xxx<br><br>Even without these instances indicative of control by SMC over the petitioners, it is safe to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assume that SMC would never have allowed the petitioners to work within its premises, using its own facilities, equipment and tools, alongside SMC employees discharging similar or identical activities unless it exercised a substantial degree of control and supervision over the petitioners</span> not only as to the manner they performed their functions but also as to the end results of such functions.<br><br>xxx<br><br>xxx it becomes apparent that [Sunflower] and the petitioners do not qualify as independent contractors.&nbsp; [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunflower] and the petitioners did not have substantial capital or investment</span> in the form of tools, equipment, implements, work premises, et cetera necessary to actually perform the service under their own account, responsibility, and method.&nbsp; The only “work premises” maintained by [Sunflower] was a small office within the confines of a small “carinderia” or refreshment parlor owned by the mother of its chair, Roy Asong; the only equipment it owned was a typewriter (rollo, pp. 525-525) and, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only assets it provided SMC were the bare bodies of its members, the petitioners herein</span> (rollo, p. 523).<br><br>In addition, as shown earlier, petitioners, who worked inside the premises of SMC, were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under the control and supervision of SMC both as to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">manner</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">method</span> in discharging their functions and as to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">results</span> thereof.</span><br><br>Besides, it should be taken into account that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">activities undertaken by the petitioners</span> as cleaners, janitors, messengers and shrimp harvesters, packers and handlers were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly related to the aquaculture business of SMC</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">See Guarin vs. NLRC,</span> 198 SCRA 267, 273).&nbsp; This is confirmed by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">renewal of the service contract from January 1993 to September 1995, a period of close to three (3) years.</span><br><br>Moreover, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioners here numbering ninety seven (97), by itself, is a considerable workforce and raises the suspicion that the non-exclusive service contract between SMC and [Sunflower] was “designed to evade the obligations inherent in an employer-employee relationship</span>” (See <span style="font-style: italic;">Rhone-Poulenc Agrochemicals Philippines, Inc. vs. NLRC</span>, 217 SCRA 249, 259).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Equally suspicious is the fact that the notary public who signed the by-laws of [Sunflower] and its [Sunflower] retained counsel are both partners of the local counsel of SMC</span> (rollo, p. 9).<br><br>xxx<br><br>With these observations, no other logical conclusion can be reached except that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Sunflower] acted as an agent of SMC</span>, facilitating the manpower requirements of the latter, the real employer of the petitioners.&nbsp; We simply cannot allow these two entities through the convenience of a non-exclusive service contract to stipulate on the existence of employer-employee relation.&nbsp; Such existence is a question of law which cannot be made the subject of agreement to the detriment of the petitioners (Tabas vs. California Manufacturing, Inc., 169 SCRA 497, 500).<br><br>xxx<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There being a finding of “labor-only” contracting, liability must be shouldered either by SMC or [Sunflower] or shared by both (See Tabas vs. California Manufacturing, Inc., <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">supra,</span> p. 502).&nbsp; SMC however should be held <span style="font-weight: bold;">solely liable</span> for [Sunflower] <span style="font-weight: bold;">became non-existent with the closure of the aquaculture business of SMC.</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Furthermore, since the closure of the aquaculture operations of SMC appears to be valid, reinstatement is no longer feasible.&nbsp; Consistent with the pronouncement in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante, et al., vs. NLRC,</span> G.R. No. 111651, 28 November 1996, petitioners are thus entitled to separation pay (in the computation similar to those given to regular SMC employees at its Bacolod Shrimp Processing Plant) “with full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent, from the time their actual compensation was withheld from them” up to the time of the finality of this decision.&nbsp; This is without prejudice to differentials pays (sic) effective as of and from the time petitioners acquired regular employment status pursuant to the discussion mentioned above, and all such other and further benefits as provided by applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) or other relations, or by law, beginning such time up to their termination from employment on 11 September 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>SMC’s Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> having been denied for lack of merit by Resolution of July 11, 2001, it comes before this Court via the present petition for review on certiorari assigning to the CA the following errors:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING DUE COURSE AND GRANTING RESPONDENTS’ PATENTLY DEFECTIVE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI.&nbsp; IN DOING SO, THE COURT OF APPEALS DEPARTED FROM THE ACCEPTED AND USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN RECOGNIZING ALL THE RESPONDENTS AS COMPLAINANTS IN THE CASE BEFORE THE LABOR ARBITER.&nbsp; IN DOING SO, THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED THIS CASE IN A MANNER NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT RESPONDENTS ARE EMPLOYEES OF SMC.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT FINDNG (sic) THAT RESPONDENTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY RELIEF.&nbsp; THE CLOSURE OF THE BACOLOD SHRIMP PROCESSING PLANT WAS DUE TO SERIOUS BUSINESS LOSSES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>SMC bewails the failure of the appellate court to outrightly dismiss the petition for certiorari as only three out of the ninety seven named petitioners signed the verification and certification against forum-shopping.<br><br>While the general rule is that the certificate of non-forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case and the signature of only one of them is insufficient,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> this Court has stressed that the rules on forum shopping, which were designed to promote and facilitate the orderly administration of justice, should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Strict compliance with the provisions regarding the certificate of non-forum shopping merely underscores its mandatory nature in that the certification cannot be altogether dispensed with or its requirements completely disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It does not, however, thereby interdict substantial compliance with its provisions under justifiable circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Thus in the recent case of <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">HLC Construction and Development Corporation v. Emily Homes Subdivision Homeowners Association</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>Respondents (who were plaintiffs in the trial court) filed the complaint against petitioners as a group, represented by their homeowners’ association president who was likewise one of the plaintiffs, Mr. Samaon M. Buat.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respondents raised one cause of action</span> which was the breach of contractual obligations and payment of damages.&nbsp; They <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shared a common interest</span> in the subject matter of the case, being the aggrieved residents of the poorly constructed and developed Emily Homes Subdivision.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Due to the collective nature of the case, there was no doubt that Mr. Samaon M. Buat could validly sign the certificate of non-forum shopping in behalf of all his co-plaintiffs</span>.&nbsp; In cases therefore where it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly impractical to require all the plaintiffs to sign</span> the certificate of non-forum shopping, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sufficient, in order not to defeat the ends of justice, for one of the plaintiffs, acting as representative, to sign the certificate provided that xxx the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> plaintiffs share a common interest in the subject matter of the case or filed the case as a “collective,” raising only one common cause of action or defense</span></span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Given the collective nature of the petition filed before the appellate court by herein private respondents, raising one common cause of action against SMC, the execution by private respondents Winifredo Talite, Renelito Deon and Jose Temporosa in behalf of all the other private respondents of the certificate of non-forum shopping constitutes substantial compliance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> That the three indeed represented their co-petitioners before the appellate court is, as it correctly found, “subsequently proven to be true as shown by the signatures of the majority of the petitioners appearing in their memorandum filed before Us.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the merits of the substantive aspects of the case may also be deemed as “special circumstance” or “compelling reason” to take cognizance of a petition although the certification against forum shopping was not executed and signed by all of the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>SMC goes on to argue that the petition filed before the CA is fatally defective as it was not accompanied by “copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto” in contravention of Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>This Court is not persuaded.&nbsp; The records show that private respondents appended the following documents to their petition before the appellate court:&nbsp; the September 23, 1997 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decision of the Labor Arbiter</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> their Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum dated October 16, 1997 filed before the NLRC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the December 29, 1998 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NLRC Decision</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motion for Reconsideration</span> dated March 26, 1999 filed with the NLRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and the September 10, 1999 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NLRC Resolution</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing at any rate that it is the appellate court which ultimately determines if the supporting documents are sufficient to make out a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It discerns whether on the basis of what have been submitted it could already judiciously determine the merits of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In the case at bar, the CA found that the petition was adequately supported by relevant and pertinent documents. <br><br>At all events, this Court has allowed a liberal construction of the rule on the accomplishment of a certificate of non-forum shopping in the following cases: (1) where a rigid application will result in manifest failure or miscarriage of justice;
