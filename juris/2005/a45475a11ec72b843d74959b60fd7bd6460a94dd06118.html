The latter, on the other hand, failed to perform his correlative obligation of paying in full the contract price in the manner and within the period agreed upon.<br><br>The terms of the Deed are clear and unequivocal:&nbsp; Carrascoso was to pay the balance of the purchase price of the property amounting to P1,300,000.00 plus interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum within a period of three (3) years from the signing of the contract on March 23, 1972.&nbsp; When Jose Leviste informed him that El Dorado was seeking rescission of the contract by letter of February 21, 1977, the period given to him within which to fully satisfy his obligation had long lapsed.<br><br>The El Dorado Board Resolution and the Affidavit of Jose Leviste interposing no objection to Carrascoso's mortgaging of the property to any bank did not have the effect of suspending the period to fully pay the purchase price, as expressly stipulated in the Deed, pending full payment of any mortgage obligation of Carrascoso.<br><br>As the CA correctly found:<br><blockquote>The adverted resolution (Exhibit 2) does not say that the obligation of Carrascoso to pay the balance was extended.&nbsp; Neither can We see in it anything that can logically infer said accommodation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A partially unpaid seller can agree to the buyer's mortgaging the subject of the sale without changing the time fixed for the payment of the balance of the price.&nbsp; The two agreements are not incompatible with each other such that when one is to be implemented, the other has to be suspended.</span>&nbsp; In the case at bench, there was no impediment for Carrascoso to pay the balance of the price after mortgaging the land.<br><br>Also, El Dorado's subordinating its "preferred claim" or waiving its superior "vendor's lien" over the land in favor of the mortgagee of said property only means that in a situation where the unpaid price of the Land and loan secured by the mortgage over the Land both become due and demandable, the mortgagee shall have precedence in going after the Land for the satisfaction of the loan.&nbsp; Such accommodations do not necessarily imply the modification of the period fixed in the contract of sale for the payment by Carrascoso of the balance.<br><br>The palpable purpose of El Dorado in not raising any objection to Carrascoso's mortgaging the land was to eliminate any legal impediment to such a contract.&nbsp; That was so succinctly expressed in the Affidavit (Exhibit 2-A) of President Feleciano (sic) Leviste.&nbsp; El Dorado's yielding its "superior lien" over the land in favor of the mortgagee was plainly intended to overcome the natural reluctance of lending institutions to accept a land whose price has not yet been fully paid as collateral of a loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Respecting Carrascoso's insistence that he was granted verbal extensions within which to pay the balance of the purchase price of the property by El Dorado's directors and officers Jose and Angel Leviste, this Court finds the same unsubstantiated by the evidence on record.<br><br>It bears recalling that Jose Leviste wrote Carrascoso, by letter of February 21, 1977, calling his attention to his failure to comply, despite "numerous" requests, with his obligation to pay the amount of P1,300,000.00 and 10% annual interest thereon, and advising him that "we would like to rescind the contract of sale." This letter reiterated the term of payment agreed upon in the March 23, 1972 Deed of Sale of Real Property and Carrascosos's non-compliance therewith.<br><br>Carrascoso, harping on Jose Leviste's March 10, 1977 letter to Lauro's counsel wherein he (Jose Leviste) stated that "some of the Directors of the corporation could not see their way clear in complying with the demands of [Lauro] and have failed to reach a consensus to bring the corresponding action for rescission of the contract against Dr. Fernando Carrascoso," argues that the extensions priorly given to him "no doubt lead to the logical conclusion on some of the directors' inability to file suit against him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The argument is specious.&nbsp; As the CA found, even if some officers of El Dorado were initially reluctant to file suit against him, the same should not be interpreted to mean that this was brought about by a prior extension of the period to pay the balance of the purchase price of the property as such reluctance could have been due to a myriad of reasons totally unrelated to the period of payment of the balance.<br><blockquote>The bottomline however is, if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">El Dorado really intended to extend the period of payment of the balance there was absolutely no reason why it did not do it in writing in clear and unmistakable terms.</span>&nbsp; That there is no such writing negates all the speculations of the court a quo and pretensions of Carrascoso.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The unalterable fact here remains that on March 23, 1973, with or without demand, the obligation of Carrascoso to pay P519,933.33 became due.&nbsp; The same was true on March 23, 1974 and on March 23, 1975 for equal amounts.</span>&nbsp; Since he did not perform his obligation under the contract of sale, he, therefore, breached it.&nbsp; Having breached the contract, El Dorado's cause of action for rescission of that contract arose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Carrascoso goes on to argue that the appellate court erred in ignoring the import of the warranty of non-tenancy expressly stipulated in the March 23, 1972 Deed of Sale of Real Property.&nbsp;

Thus, for a property right to be vested, there must be a transition from the potential or contingent to the actual, and the proprietary interest must have attached to a thing; it must have become fixed or established and is no longer open to doubt or controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>In the case at bar, the July 11, 1975 Agreement to Buy and Sell was not registered, which act of registration is the operative act to convey and affect the land.<br><blockquote>An agreement to sell is a voluntary instrument as it is a willful act of the registered owner.&nbsp; As such voluntary instrument, Section 50 of Act No. 496 [now Section 51 of PD 1529] expressly provides that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the land</span>.&nbsp; And Section 55 of the same Act [now Section 53 of PD 1529] requires the presentation of the owner's duplicate certificate of title for the registration of any deed or voluntary instrument.&nbsp; As the agreement to sell involves an interest less than an estate in fee simple, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the same should have been registered by filing it with the Register of Deeds</span> who, in turn, makes a brief memorandum thereof upon the original and owner's duplicate certificate of title.&nbsp; The reason for requiring the production of the owner's duplicate certificate in the registration of a voluntary instrument is that, being a willful act of the registered owner, it is to be presumed that he is interested in registering the instrument and would willingly surrender, present or produce his duplicate certificate of title to the Register of Deeds in order to accomplish such registration.&nbsp; However, where the owner refuses to surrender the duplicate certificate for the annotation of the voluntary instrument, the grantee may file with the Register of Deeds a statement setting forth his adverse claim, as provided for in Section 110 of Act No. 496.&nbsp;

It further asserts that it always acted in good faith:<br><blockquote>xxx The contract to sell between the Petitioner [Carrascoso] and PLDT was executed in July 11, 1975.&nbsp; There is no evidence that El Dorado was notified of this contract.&nbsp; The property is located in Mindoro, El Dorado is based in Manila.&nbsp; The land was planted to rice.&nbsp; This was not an unusual activity on the land, thus it could have been the Petitioner who was using the land.&nbsp; Not having been notified of this sale, El Dorado could not have stopped PLDT from developing the land.<br><br>The absolute sale of the land to PLDT took place on April 6, 1977, or AFTER the filing of this case on March 15, 1977 and the annotation of a notice of lis pendens on March 16, 1977.&nbsp; Inspite of the notice of lis pendens, PLDT then PLDTAC persisted not only in buying the land but also in putting up improvements on the property such as buildings, roads, irrigation systems and drainage.&nbsp; This was done during the pendency of this case, where PLDT and PLDTAC actively participated as intervenors.&nbsp; They were not innocent bystanders. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup></blockquote>This Court finds the above-quoted testimony of Atty.

In the case at bar, however, apart from Carrascoso's claim that he in fact notified several of the directors about his intention to sell the 1,000 hectare portion of the property to PLDT, no evidence was presented to substantiate his claim.&nbsp; Such self-serving, uncorroborated assertion is indubitably inadequate to prove that El Dorado had notice of the July 11, 1975 Agreement to Buy and Sell before the annotation of the notice of<span style="font-style: italic;"> lis pendens</span> on his title.<br><br>PLDT is, of course, not without recourse.&nbsp; As held by the CA:<br><blockquote>Between Carrascoso and PLDT/PLDTAC, the former acted in bad faith while the latter acted in good faith.&nbsp; This is so because it was Carrascoso's refusal to pay his just debt to El Dorado that caused PLDT/PLDTAC to suffer pecuniary losses.&nbsp; Therefore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carrascoso should return to PLDT/PLDTAC the P3,000,000.00 price of the farm plus legal interest from receipt thereof until paid</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup>&nbsp;
