N-217643 and N-217644 were actually issued sometime between August 8 and 13 1998 and not on October 20, 1997.<br><br>Regarding the claim that these decrees were prematurely issued as the motion for the issuance of the decrees in favor of the Heirs of Eugenio Lopez, the properties involved having been sold to him by the applicants, is still pending with the court, it is informed that no copy of said motion nor of the order directing this Office to comment thereon appears on file in the records of the case.&nbsp; Hence, these matters could not have been taken into consideration in the issuance of the decrees.&nbsp; Had the Administration been apprised of these incidents, perhaps the issuance of the decrees could have been held in abeyance until the court has resolved the same.<br><br>As to the recall of the decrees of registration, we regret to inform you that since the certificates of title transcribed pursuant to said decrees have already been issued and released by the Registrar of Deeds concerned, it is now beyond our authority to recall them unless duly authorized by the court.<br><br>We hope that we have satisfactorily disposed of the concerns raised in your letter.<br><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 280px; text-align: center;">Very truly yours,<br></div><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 320px; text-align: center;"><br>(signed)<br>ALFREDO R.

First, it keeps the subject matter of the litigation within the power of the court until the entry of the final judgment to prevent the defeat of the final judgment by successive alienations.&nbsp; Second, it binds a purchaser,<span style="font-style: italic;"> bona fide</span> or not, of the land subject of the litigation to the judgment or decree that the court will promulgate subsequently.&nbsp; However, the filing of a notice of<span style="font-style: italic;"> lis pendens</span> does not create a right or lien that previously did not exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Without a notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span>, a third party who acquires the property after relying only on the certificate of title is a purchaser in good faith.&nbsp; Against such third party, the supposed rights of a litigant cannot prevail, because the former is not bound by the property owner’s undertakings not annotated in the transfer certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, we have consistently held that —<br><blockquote>The notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens </span>x x x is ordinarily recorded without the intervention of the court where the action is pending.&nbsp; The notice is but an incident in an action, an extrajudicial one, to be sure.&nbsp; It does not affect the merits thereof.&nbsp; It is intended merely to constructively advise, or warn, all people who deal with the property that they so deal with it at their own risk, and whatever rights they may acquire in the property in any voluntary transaction are subject to the results of the action, and may well be inferior and subordinate to those which may be finally determined and laid down therein.&nbsp; The cancellation of such a precautionary notice is therefore also a mere incident in the action, and may be ordered by the Court having jurisdiction of it at any given time.&nbsp; And its continuance or removal x x x is not contingent on the existence of a final judgment in the action, and ordinarily has no effect on the merits thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>A notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> may involve actions that deal not only with title or possession of a property, but also with the use or occupation of a property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; The litigation must directly involve a specific property which is necessarily affected by the judgment.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Magdalena Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> enumerated the cases where a notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> is appropriate:<br><blockquote>[A] notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> is proper in the following cases, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span><br><br>a) An action to recover possession of real estate;<br>b) An action to quiet title thereto;<br>c) An action to remove clouds thereon;<br>d) An action for partition; and<br>e) Any other proceedings of any kind in Court directly affecting the title to the land or the use or occupation thereof or the buildings thereon.<br></blockquote>On the other hand, the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> has no application in the following cases:<br><blockquote>a) Preliminary attachments;<br>b) Proceedings for the probate of wills;<br>c) Levies on execution;<br>d) Proceedings for administration of estate of deceased persons; and<br>e) Proceedings in which the only object is the recovery of a money judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>As decreed by Section 76 of PD 1529, a notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> should contain a statement of the institution of an action or proceeding, the court where the same is pending, and the date of its institution.&nbsp; A notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> should also contain a reference to the number of the certificate of title of the land, an adequate description of the land affected and its registered owner.<br><br>The Register of Deeds denied registration of the notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> because “the application was bereft of the original petition or complaint upon which this office will base its action.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">consulta</span> to the LRA, petitioners pointed out that they have complied with the requirements for the registration of the notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span>, as follows:<br><blockquote>7.2.1 The Notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lis Pendens</span> contains a statement of the filing by the Heirs of Eugenio Lopez of a motion to declare Original Certificates of Title Nos. O-1603 and O-1604 null and void;<br><br>7.2.2 It contains the name of the court wherein the motion is pending which is “the registration court, Regional Trial Court, Branch 152, Pasig City.”&nbsp; The date of the filing of the motion is shown on the motion itself wherein the receipt of said motion by the land registration court on <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">November 25, 1998</span> is duly stamped;<br><br>7.2.3 The numbers of the Original Certificates of Title Nos. O-1603 and O-1604 are clearly indicated in the notice;<br><br>7.2.4 There is adequate description of the land affected in the Notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lis Pendens</span>;<br><br>7.2.5 The names of the registered owners are indicated in Paragraph 4 of the Motion attached to the Notice;<br><br>7.2.6 A copy of the motion to declare OCT Nos. O-1603 and O-1604 null and void, dated November 25, 1998 upon which the Register of Deeds of the Province of Rizal will base its action is attached as Annex “A” of the Notice of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lis Pendens</span>.

Both the LRA and the appellate court denied the application for a notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> because petitioners are mere movants, and not original parties, in LRC No. N-18887.&nbsp; As petitioners are not parties to an action as contemplated in Section 76 of PD 1529, they failed to present the requisite pleading to the Register of Deeds of Marikina City.

Go Fay</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this Court explained the effect of an order of default to the party defaulted.&nbsp; A party declared in default loses his standing in court.&nbsp; As a result of his loss of standing, a party in default cannot appear in court, adduce evidence, be heard, or be entitled to notice.&nbsp; A party in default cannot even appeal from the judgment rendered by the court, unless he files a motion to set aside the order of default under the grounds provided in what is now Section 3, Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>Indeed, in its comment before this Court, the LRA stated thus:<br><blockquote>Under Section 26, PD 1429, petitioners are deemed to have been included by the default order.&nbsp; Those who did not file an answer should be considered as having lost their standing in court from that stage (Republic v. Dela Rosa, 173 SCRA 12) except when they file a motion to set aside the order [of] default on the grounds mentioned in Section 3, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court (Toco v. Fay, 80 Phil. 166).<br><br>In land registration cases (as in the said LRC No. N-18887), an order of general default was deemed to have been issued based on the presumption of regularity in judicial proceedings (Pascual, et al. v. Ortega, et al., 58 O.G. 12 March 1962 C.A.).&nbsp; Petitioners failed to adduce any evidence showing that the order of general default was lifted.&nbsp; Records disclosed that without first filing a motion to lift the order of general default, petitioners filed a motion to declare as null and void the decrees and titles.&nbsp; Until the order of general default is lifted by the court, petitioner could not be considered as a party to the action.&nbsp; They are deemed movants whose personality as far as the case is concerned is not yet admitted by the court considering that the order of default has not been lifted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>One should be careful, however, to distinguish between movants as mere interested parties prescribed under Section 22 of PD 1529 and movants as intervenors-oppositors to the land registration proceedings.&nbsp; It is only in the latter case that a motion to lift the order of general default is required.&nbsp; It is only in the latter case that the doctrine pronounced in<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> Serrano v. Palacio</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as repeatedly invoked by the LRA and OSG, is applicable:<br><blockquote>x x x [P]etitioners committed an error of procedure when they filed a motion to intervene in the x x x land registration case for the proper procedure would have been for them to ask first for the lifting of the order of general default, and then, if lifted, to file an opposition to the application of the applicants.&nbsp; This is so because proceedings in land registration are <span style="font-style: italic;">in rem</span>, and not<span style="font-style: italic;"> in personam</span>, the sole object being the registration applied for, and not the determination of any right not connected with the registration (Estila vs. Alvero, 37 Phil. 498).<br></blockquote>Petitioners are not mere interested parties in this case.&nbsp; By filing their motion to have the decrees and the corresponding certificates of title declared void, they took the role of oppositors to the application for land registration.<br><br>The appellate court stated that “in as much as it would want to oblige to the plea of petitioners to hasten or expedite the proceedings and to avoid further expenses on the part of the petitioners, however[,] (it) could not.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, it requires a delicate balancing act between the objective of the Rules of Court to secure a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and the strict requirements for a notice of lis pendens.&nbsp; The facts in this case show that petitioners have not complied with the requirements.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, we <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENY</span> the petition.&nbsp; We <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRM</span> the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
