				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 30, 2004, as well as the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 28, 2004, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 74110. The said decision denied the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Prayer for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction filed by petitioner International School Manila. The CA ruled that the court <i>a quo </i>acquired jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner and that there was no improper venue. The appellate court likewise added that the fair and speedy disposition of the case far outweighs the misapprehension by the court <i>a quo</i> of petitioner’s residence.<br><br>After the respondents, Spouses Pedrito and Carmencita Aniñon, filed their comment on the instant petition, a Joint Motion for Judgment Based on Compromise Agreement was filed with this Court by both parties.
