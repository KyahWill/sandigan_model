Dela Peña</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> lack of jurisdiction and excess of jurisdiction were distinguished.&nbsp; Respondent acts without jurisdiction if he does not have the legal power to determine the case.&nbsp; Where the respondent, being clothed with the power to determine the case, oversteps his authority as determined by law, then he is performing a function in excess of his jurisdiction.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment that is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; In other words, the power of discretion is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility.&nbsp; It must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty and a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In denying the motion to dismiss the preliminary investigation, the Ombudsman resolved: <blockquote> After a careful evaluation of the arguments/contentions of both parties, complainant (PCGG) and respondent Romualdez, the undersigned finds the contentions of the PCGG more credible.<br><br>The Motion to Dismiss filed by respondent Benjamin Romualdez should be expunged, the same being a prohibited pleading.&nbsp; Sec. 3 (c) of Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that "the respondents shall not be allowed to file a motion to dismiss in lieu of a counter-affidavit."&nbsp; Thus, it is incumbent upon the accused to file a counter-affidavit, and not a motion to dismiss.&nbsp; Moreover, Section 4 (d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman provides: "No motion to dismiss shall be allowed except for lack of jurisdiction."&nbsp; Respondent argued in his motion to dismiss that Criminal Cases Nos.&nbsp; 13406-13429 were already dismissed by the Sandiganbayan by virtue of its Minute Resolution dated February 10, 2004, and not lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Hence, such motion is a mere scrap of paper, without any legal force and effect.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">...<br></div><br>The authority of the Office of The Special Prosecutor/Ombudsman to conduct preliminary investigation in these cases is pursuant to the Supreme Court's Decision dated July 20, 2002 in G.R.F Nos. 143618-143641 entitled Benjamin "Kokoy" T. Romualdez vs. Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The Honorable Supreme Court specifically stated in said Decision that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion when it prematurely terminated the preliminary investigation being conducted by this Office on June 8, 2000, which the Supreme Court itself ordered....<br><br>Hence, the quashal of the informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 13406-13429 before the Sandiganbayan, First Division for lack of authority of the PCGG to file the same is without prejudice to the filing of new informations by this Office should it find probable cause after the conduct of preliminary investigation.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">...<br></div><br>Respondent Romualdez failed to file his counter-affidavit and/or present his controverting evidence despite the sending of notices and copies of the complaint with supporting evidence to his known address and through his counsel on record.&nbsp; However, he opted to file a Motion to Dismiss, through his counsel, which this Office cannot take cognizance for reasons cited hereof.<br><br>In view thereof, these cases must be resolved on the basis solely of the complainant's evidence.<br><br>Thus, after a careful evaluation of the evidence on records, the undersigned finds that respondent violated Section 7 of R.A. [3019] since the time he was appointed Technical Assistant, with the rank of FAO, Class III in the Philippine Consulate, Ambassador and Provincial Governor of Leyte from 1961 until February, 1986 he never filed his Statement of Assets and Liabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </blockquote> The ruling of the OSP/Ombudsman is consistent with the Decision of this Court in <i>Velasco v. Hon. Casaclang</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> where we held that, the Deputy Ombudsman properly denied the motion to quash and motion for reconsideration of petitioner therein, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Revised Rules of Court and Administrative Order (AO) No. 07 of the Ombudsman.&nbsp; Section 4 (d) of AO No. 07 disallows a motion to quash (or dismiss) except on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; In that case, as in this one, no absence of jurisdiction is perceived.<br><br>The Constitution vested the Office of the Ombudsman with powers and duties to investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient act or omission of any public official or employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Section 15(1) of R.A. No. 6770 or The Ombudsman Act of 1989 delineated the investigatory and prosecutory functions of the Ombudsman, to wit: <blockquote> SEC. 15. <i>Powers, Functions and Duties. </i>– The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties: <br><br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(1)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Investigate and prosecute <b>on its own or on complaint by any person</b>, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.&nbsp; It has the primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases;</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> We held that the OSP/Ombudsman is the proper authority to conduct the preliminary investigation of the alleged offenses committed by petitioner.&nbsp; Pursuant thereto, there is no need for a new complaint to be filed by PCGG because the Ombudsman, on its own, may conduct a preliminary investigation of offenses committed by public officers.&nbsp; Moreover, the denial of his motion to dismiss was concomitant with Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman disallowing a motion to dismiss except on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>Besides, we held in <i>Romualdez v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> that: <blockquote> The Sandiganbayan also committed grave abuse of discretion when it abruptly terminated the reinvestigation being conducted by Prosecutor Lucero.&nbsp; It should be recalled that our directive in G.R. No. 105248 for the holding of a preliminary investigation was based on our ruling that the right to a preliminary investigation is a substantive, rather than a procedural right.&nbsp; Petitioner's right was violated when the preliminary investigation of the charges against him were conducted by an officer without jurisdiction over the said cases.&nbsp; It bears stressing that our directive should be strictly complied with in order to achieve its objective of affording petitioner his right to due process. </blockquote> Petitioner's claim that the preliminary investigation be dismissed because it referred to the same docket numbers of the dismissed informations, is erroneous.&nbsp; The assignment of a docket number is an internal matter designed for efficient record keeping.&nbsp; It is usually written in the Docket Record in sequential order corresponding to the date and time of filing a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This Court agrees that the use of the docket numbers of the dismissed cases was merely for reference.&nbsp; In fact, after the new informations were filed, new docket numbers were assigned, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, Criminal Cases Nos. 28031-28049.&nbsp; Plainly, these are entirely different cases from those that have been dismissed given that Criminal Cases Nos. 13406-13429 were not mentioned.<br><br>Petitioner also alleges that respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion in not dismissing the preliminary investigation on the ground of prescription of the offense.&nbsp; This allegation is a matter of defense which must be settled in a full-blown trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence must be received to resolve the case on its merits.<br><br>In <i>Domingo v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> we considered the following in resolving the issue of prescription: (1) the period of prescription for the offense charged; (2) the time the period of prescription starts to run; and (3) the time the prescriptive period was interrupted.<br><br>Petitioner is being charged under Section 7 of R.A. No. 3019, a special law.&nbsp; Section 11 of the same statute provides for the period of prescription for the offense charged, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, 15 years.&nbsp; However, the applicable rule on the time the period of prescription starts to run is Section 2 of Act No. 3326, which provides: <blockquote> SEC. 2.&nbsp; Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same not be known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its investigation and punishment.<br><br>The prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted against the guilty person, and shall begin to run again if the proceedings are dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy. </blockquote> This Court quotes the concurring and dissenting opinion of Justice Reynato S. Puno in <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span><i>residential Ad Hoc Committee v. Hon. Desierto</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <blockquote> The law on prescription of special crimes like violation of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft Law) is provided for in Section 2 of Act No. 3326, viz: <blockquote>"SEC. 2.&nbsp; Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof ..." </blockquote> <b>The application of this provision is <i>not simple and each case must be decided according to its facts.</i>&nbsp; It involves a careful study and analysis of <i>contentious facts</i>:&nbsp; (a) when the commission of the violation of the law happened; (b) whether or not the violation was known at the time of its commission, and (c) if not known then, the time of its discovery.</b>&nbsp; In addition, there is the equally <i>difficult problem of choice of legal and equitable doctrines</i> to apply to the above elusive facts.&nbsp; For the <i>general rule</i> is that the mere fact that a person entitled to an action has no knowledge of his right to sue or of the facts out of which his right arises, does not prevent the running of the statute. This stringent rule, however, admits of an <i>exception</i>.&nbsp; Under the "<i>blameless ignorance</i>" doctrine, the statute of limitations runs only upon discovery of the fact of the invasion of a right which will support a cause of action.&nbsp; In other words, courts decline to apply the statute of limitations where the plaintiff neither knew nor had <i>reasonable means</i> of knowing the existence of a cause of action. <b>Given all these factual and legal difficulties, the public respondent should have ordered private respondents to answer the sworn complaint, required a reply from the petitioners and conducted such hearings as may be necessary so he could have all the vital facts at his front and, upon their basis, resolve whether the offense charged has already prescribed.</b> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> It is noteworthy that petitioner did not raise the defense of prescription in his motion to dismiss the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; It is only in this petition that he raised this issue.&nbsp; As this case has never progressed beyond the filing of the informations against petitioner, it is only prudent that evidence be gathered through trial on the merits to determine whether the offense charged has already prescribed.<br><br>A preliminary investigation is merely inquisitorial, and it is often the only means of discovering the persons who may be reasonably charged with a crime, to enable the fiscal to prepare the complaint or information.&nbsp; It is not a trial of the case on the merits and has no purpose except that of determining whether a crime has been committed and whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty thereof, and it does not place the person against whom it is taken in jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the Ombudsman did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's motion to dismiss the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Not only did the Ombudsman have the jurisdiction to conduct a preliminary investigation under the Constitution and R.A. No. 6770, but he also acted within the legal bounds of the authority conferred upon him when he denied the motion to dismiss under Administrative Order No. 07.<br><br>As a rule, the Court shall not unduly interfere in the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers, as provided in the Constitution, without good and compelling reasons to indicate otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>WHERFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The resolutions dated July 12, 2004 and September 6, 2004 of the Office of the Special Prosecutor, are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J.
