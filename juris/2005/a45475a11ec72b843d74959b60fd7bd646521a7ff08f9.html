The record of the case was thereupon returned to the court of origin which received it on December 11, 2001.<br><br>On complainant’s motion, the trial court ordered the execution of the judgment and a corresponding writ of execution was issued.<br><br>As the writ of execution could not be enforced, the judgment debtor having transferred residence, respondent found that the judgment debtor had real property registered in his name in the local Registry of Deeds.<br><br>Respondent thus informed complainant to prepare an estimated amount of at least P10,000.00 representing expenses for the notation of the Notice of Levy on the judgment debtor’s property in the local Registry of Deeds and expenses to be incurred in the execution sale including those for posting of notice and publication thereof to be done in Pagadian City, with the advice that if there was any excess in the amount requested, it would be returned to complainant and actual expenses incurred would be charged as costs against the judgment debtor.<br><br>Complainant, however, paid no heed to respondent’s request, hence, respondent could not implement the writ of execution.<br><br>On his receipt of complainant’s letter to the Justice Secretary, respondent asked complainant to produce the amount of P75.00 for the Sheriff’s General Fund and JDF representing payment for the levy on execution as well as the amount to be incurred in travelling to Zamboanga del Sur, which is approximately 130 kilometers from Ipil, but again complainant paid no heed.<br><br>With the help of a “common friend” who was aware of his predicament, respondent proceeded to cause the registration of the Notice of Levy on the judgment debtor’s property.<br><br>Respondent thus proffers that the delay in the execution of the decision is not attributable to him.<br><br>The OCA, in its request for the present case to be included in this Court’s agenda, gives the following Evaluation:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Based on the foregoing, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clearly</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shown</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grave</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disregard</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pertinent</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provisions</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rules</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collection</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">legal</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fees</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expenses</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sheriff</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> entitled. He committed a serious <span style="text-decoration: underline;">infraction</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">above-mentioned</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provision</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demanding</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span> from complainant the amount of P10,000.00 (which fact Sheriff Aposaga, Jr. admitted) for the annotation of the levy on execution of the property of the judgment debtor, without the requisite authority of the court.&nbsp; As&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sheriff he is duty bound to know at least these very basic rules relative to the implementation of writs of execution.&nbsp; What is worthy of note is that respondent has been a deputy sheriff for more than twelve years.&nbsp; Surely, respondent ought to have known the correct/proper procedure to be followed in requesting for expenses from a judgment creditor in order to ensure proper administration of justice especially in its concluding stage.&nbsp; In sum, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gravamen</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent’s</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shortcoming</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">observe</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sec.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">9</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">141</span>.&nbsp;

and<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; to require the parties to MANIFEST to the Court, within twenty (20) days from notice,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;whether they are submitting the case for resolution on the basis of the pleadings/records already filed and submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>The records show that the copy of this Court’s abovestated Resolution of December 18, 2002 addressed to complainant was received on February 6, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Nothing has been heard from him, however.<br><br>On respondent’s part, he filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which was received at the Docket and Clearance Division of this Court on March 13, 2003 informing that the decision was “already executed per return attached as Annex ‘A’ hereto dated August 6, 2002,” and that a Certificate of Sale dated August 2, 2002 was issued, xerox copy of which he attached as Annex “B.” He submits the case for resolution with prayer for its dismissal for “being utterly baseless and unfounded.”<br><br>The pertinent provision of Section 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 9.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Sheriff, and other persons serving processes.</span>—<br><br>x x x<br><br>In addition to the fees hereinabove fixed, the party requesting the process of any court, preliminary, incidental, or final, shall pay the sheriff’s expenses in serving or executing the process, or safeguarding the property levied upon, attached or seized, including kilometrage for each kilometer of travel, guards’ fees, warehousing and similar charges, in an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">amount</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">estimated</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sheriff</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">subject to the approval of the court</span>.&nbsp; Upon approval of said estimated expenses, the interested party shall deposit such amount with the clerk of court and ex-oficio sheriff, who shall disburse the same to the deputy sheriff assigned to effect the process, subject to liquidation within the same period for rendering a return on the process.&nbsp; Any unspent amount shall be refunded to the party making the deposit.&nbsp; A full report shall be submitted by the deputy sheriff assigned with his return, and the sheriff’s expenses hall be taxed as costs against the judgment debtor.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It bears emphasis that high standards are expected of sheriffs, they being agents of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> They are mandated to perform the duties of their office earnestly, faithfully and honestly.<br><br>In respondent’s case, instead of preparing an estimate of expenses to be incurred in implementing the writ of execution and thereafter securing the court’s approval thereof, he verbally estimated the expenses and directly conveyed the same to the judgment creditor-complainant.<br><br>For violation of Sec. 9 of Rule 141 then, respondent should be faulted.&nbsp; The recommendation of the OCA that he be fined the amount of P2,000.00 and sternly warned sits well with this Court.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, for violation of Sec. 9 of Rule 141 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, respondent Vicente P.
