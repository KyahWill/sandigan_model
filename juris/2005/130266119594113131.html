				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts which spawned the filing of the
 present administrative complaint by Nelda Apostol (complainant) against
 Junie Jovencio G. Ipac (respondent), Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court, 
Office of the Clerk of Court, Malolos City are as follows:<br><br>In Civil Case No. 809, “<i>Silver Spirit Plastics, Inc. v. CWB Plastics Corp. et al.,</i>”
 for&nbsp; ejectment, the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Pulilan, Bulacan, 
dismissed the case.&nbsp; On appeal,&nbsp; Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court 
(RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan reversed the MTC dismissal of the case and, by
 Decision of February 9, 2001, rendered judgment in favor of the therein
 plaintiff-appellant Silver Spirit Plastics Inc. (Silver Spirit) and 
against the therein defendants-appellees CWB Plastics Corporation (CWB) 
et al.,<br><blockquote> (a) Ordering the defendants and all persons claiming under [them] to immediately <u>vacate the leased premises</u> (parcel of land covered by TCT No. T-96407 of Bulacan, the factory and all improvements thereon).<br><br>(b) Ordering the defendants to immediately <u>pay to plaintiff </u>the
 sum of One Million Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P1,850,000.00), 
Philippine Currency, representing the unpaid monthly rentals from 
November 1, 1996 up to October 31, 1999 and the monthly sum of Fifty 
Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) every month thereafter, until defendants and
 all persons claiming under them shall finally vacate the leased 
premises; and<br><br>(c) Ordering the defendants to pay the reasonable amount of <u>attorney’s fees</u> in the sum of P200,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Its decision having become final and executory, the RTC by Order of May 4, 2001 directed the issuance of a writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>It
 is gathered that the case was brought on appeal to the Court of Appeals
 which eventually remanded it to the MTC for “proper execution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Upon
 motion by the plaintiff, the MTC of Pulilan issued an Order dated March
 7, 2003 directing the issuance of a writ of execution “to implement 
paragraphs b and c of the dispositive portion of the [RTC] decision . . .
 only against CWB Plastic Corporation and Mary Ann Deniza.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; A writ of execution was thus issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Assigned to enforce the writ was respondent who, on <u>April 10, 2003</u>, served it upon CWB&nbsp; through Teresita P. Calma, its Board Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Subsequently or on <u>August 14, 2003</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 respondent served on CWB a Notice of Levy on Execution of its 
properties.&nbsp; Also on August 14, 2003, respondent took possession of a 
Toyota Corolla GLI with Plate No. WEC-231, Engine No, 4A-M133930 with 
Chassis No. AE111-95437001 (the vehicle), <u>over the protest of herein complainant</u> who claimed ownership thereof, she presenting to him a Certificate of Registration of the vehicle and the Official Receipt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> covering payment of registration fees <u>both in her name, issued on August 8, 2003</u> by the Land Transportation Office of Malolos District, as well as a Deed of Absolute Sale dated <u>July 24, 2003</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> executed by CWB transferring the ownership of the vehicle to her.<br><br>Complainant
 having failed to restrain respondent from taking possession of the 
vehicle on August 14, 2003, she filed her Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> on August 18, 2003 charging respondent with grave abuse of authority.<br><br>By letter-comment dated September 25, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> respondent, in compliance with the 1st Indorsement of August 27, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) directing him to comment
 on the complaint, refuted the claim of complainant that she is the 
owner of the vehicle.&nbsp; Branding the alleged transfer of ownership of the
 vehicle as a sinister move on the part of judgment obligor CWB to 
defraud judgment obligee Silver Spirit, he alleged that during the 
pendency of the ejectment case, the vehicle remained registered in CWB’s
 name<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> but that after the decision therein had become final and executory and a writ of execution was <u>served on April 10, 2003 to CWB</u>, CWB caused the execution on July 24, 2003 of the notarized (by CWB’s company lawyer)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Deed of Sale in favor of complainant who is its secretary/accountant.<br><br>Complainant countered in her Reply-Affidavit of October 21, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 that if respondent was of the belief that her ownership of the vehicle 
was a sham or a ploy to defraud CWB’s creditor, he should have filed a 
case for the nullification of the Certificate of Registration in her 
name, instead of levying it and selling it at public auction.&nbsp; And 
complainant charged respondent to be ignorant of his duties as a sheriff
 under Rule 39, Section 26 of the Rules of Court, he having failed to 
state in the Certificate of Sale that the vehicle was the subject of a 
third party claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>By Resolution of July 21, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 this Court required the parties to manifest whether they were 
submitting the case on the basis of the pleadings/records already filed 
and submitted.&nbsp; In compliance therewith, respondent, by Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 received on January 6, 2005 by the OCA, answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; 
And he informed that before the auction sale of the vehicle, he required
 judgment obligee Silver Spirit to post an indemnity bond, which it did,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 to answer for all the damages that complainant as third party claimant 
may suffer by reason of the sale.&nbsp; Respondent went on to posit that if 
complainant did suffer damages due to the auction sale, she should have 
proceeded against the indemnity bond.<br><br>To stress that the present 
administrative case was intended to harass and intimidate him, 
respondent brought attention to complainant’s filing before the 
Prosecutors Office of Malolos, Bulacan of a criminal complaint for 
carnapping against him arising from his same act of levying on execution
 the vehicle, which complaint was, by Resolution of January 6, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dismissed for lack of probable cause.<br><br>The OCA, in its EVALUATION AND RECOMMEN-DATION on the case dated June 17, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 found that respondent “grievously erred in implementing the writ of 
execution by levying on the vehicle over the claim of ownership of the 
complainant who has the certificate of registration over it”; that it 
was not within respondent’s authority as sheriff to ignore complainant’s
 adverse claim over the vehicle as he did not have any discretion to 
determine who among the parties was entitled to the possession thereof;&nbsp;
 and that&nbsp; respondent failed to state in the Certificate of Sale that 
the vehicle was subject to a third party claim.<br><br>The rule is that 
execution may only be effected against the property of the judgment 
debtor, who must necessarily be a party to the case, and a sheriff who 
levies upon property other than that of the judgment debtor’s acts 
beyond the limits of his authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>When respondent levied and took possession of the vehicle, however, on <u>August 14, 2003</u>,
 he relied on Official Receipt No. 4772165-6 dated January 14, 2003 
covering the payment of registration fees for the year 2003 <u>in the name of CWB</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Complainant
 being a secretary/accountant of CWB, it can reasonably be inferred that
 she was aware of the case for ejectment filed against CWB et al. by 
Silver Spirit and the developments thereon. It is in this light that 
this Court finds well-founded respondent’s doubts on the motive behind 
the transfer to her by her employer CWB of its ownership of the vehicle 
by a Deed of Sale dated July 24, 2003,<b> after</b> the Writ of Execution of the decision had been served upon CWB on <u>April 10, 2003.</u><br><br>A sheriff’s duty in the execution of a writ issued by a court is purely ministerial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp;
 When he levies on a property which is claimed by one other than the 
judgment obligor, Rule 39, Section 16 of the Rules of Court directs him 
to observe the following procedure:<br><blockquote> <b>SEC. 16.</b>&nbsp;<i> Proceedings where property claimed by third person.</i>
 – If the property levied on is claimed by any person other than the 
judgment obligor or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his
 title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds 
of such right or title, and serves the same upon the officer making the 
levy and a copy thereof upon the judgment obligee, <u>the officer shall 
not be bound to keep the property, unless such judgment obligee, on 
demand of the officer, files a bond approved by the court to indemnify 
the third-party claimant in a sum not less than the value of the 
property levied on</u>.&nbsp; In case of disagreement as to such value, the 
same shall be determined by the court issuing the writ of execution.&nbsp; No
 claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be 
enforced against the bond unless the action therefore is filed within 
one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.<br></blockquote><center> x x x, </center><br>to free him from liability for damages in connection therewith.<br><blockquote> <u>The
 officer shall not be liable for damages for the taking or keeping of 
the property, to any third-party claimant if such bond is filed</u>.&nbsp; 
Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third person
 from vindicating his claim to the property in a separate action, or 
prevent the judgment obligee from claiming damages in the same or a 
separate action against a third-party claimant who filed a frivolous 
plainly spurious claim.<br><br><center> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></center> </blockquote>Notably,
 on August 15, 2003, a day after respondent took possession of the 
vehicle, he, in accordance with the above-quoted&nbsp; rule, <u>made a demand upon the judgment obligee Silver Spirit that it post an indemnity bond.</u>&nbsp;
 In compliance therewith, Silver Spirit procured on August 18, 2003 from
 Pacific Union Insurance Company an indemnity bond in the amount of Two 
Hundred Fifty Thousand (P250,000) Pesos which was approved by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; It was only then that the public auction of the vehicle<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> was scheduled, as it did take place on August 25, 2003.<br><br>As
 reflected in the above-quoted Rule 39, Section 16, the purpose of the 
indemnity bond is to protect and indemnify the third-party claimant for 
all damages and responsibilities which said party may suffer if the 
sheriff proceeds with the levy and sale of the contested property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; It also serves to shield the sheriff from any personal liability for such damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Contrary
 to complainant’s assertion, respondent is not duty bound to file a case
 for the nullification of complainant’s Certificate of Registration. 
Silver Spirit having posted an indemnity bond, complainant’s remedy was 
to file an independent reinvindicatory action against Silver Spirit 
which purchased the property at the public auction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As for the charge that respondent failed to observe his duty under Rule 39, Section 26 reading:<br><blockquote> Sec. 26. <i>Certificate of sale where property claimed by third person.</i> – When a property sold by virtue of a writ of execution has been claimed by a third person, <u>the certificate of sale to be issued by the sheriff</u> pursuant to sections 23, 24 and 25 of this Rule shall <u>make express mention of the existence of such third-party claim</u>.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>a
 perusal of the Certificate of Sale dated August 25, 2003, issued after 
the vehicle was sold to Silver Spirit at public auction on even date, 
shows that the sheriff who issued said certificate was not respondent 
but one Emmanuel L. Ortega who signed as Ex-officio Sheriff<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the RTC of Malolos.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the complaint against JUNIE JOVENCIO IPAC, Sheriff IV of RTC-OCC, Malolos City is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,</i> and <i>Garcia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><i> Ibid</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><i> Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Vide Final Deed of Sale, Id. at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 2-3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><i> Id.</i>at 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <u>Vide</u> note 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 7-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp;Revised Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 26 provides to wit: <blockquote> <b>SEC. 26.</b>&nbsp; <i>Certificate of sale where property claimed by third person.</i>
