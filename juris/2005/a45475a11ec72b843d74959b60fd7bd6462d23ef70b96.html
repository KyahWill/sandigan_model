				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent Federico Cabanit was a sales representative of petitioner Central Luzon Conference Corporation of Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Inc.&nbsp; After six months, he became its regular employee, assigned to the accounting department.&nbsp; Promoted, he became branch manager from 1981 to 1990, and auditor from 1990 to 1996.<br><br>On June 11, 1997, respondent Cabanit was informed that he erred in recording US$40 and was later suspended from July 1-31, 1997 but the suspension was rescinded and he was assigned as general auditor.<br><br>Subsequently, he was required to appear before petitioner corporation's office and its ExecutiveCommittee pursuant to two letters.&nbsp; He was placed under preventive suspension on October 16, 1997 and required to explain in 15 days why he should not be dismissed due to irregularities committed.&nbsp; He requested copies of pertinent documents to enable him to explain his side but petitioner corporation allegedly did not oblige.&nbsp; On November 18, 1997, petitioner corporation, through an EXECOM meeting, adopted a resolution terminating his employment effective October 16, 1997.<br><br>Federico Cabanit filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<br><br>The Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.<br><br>On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the decision of the LA.<br><br>On petition to the Court of Appeals (CA), the CA agreed that the dismissal was for a just cause but found that therein respondents failed in the second requirement of due process in that the employee was not given a chance to explain his side.<br><br>The CA ordered payment of backwages from the time of termination to the time the decision becomes final and remanded the case to the LA for computation of backwages.<br><br>Hence, this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, principally to question the award of backwages.<br><br>The issue is squarely covered by the recent Agabon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> ruling of this Court:<br><blockquote>The violation of the petitioners' right to statutory due process by the private respondent warrants the payment of indemnity in the form of nominal damages.&nbsp; The amount of such damages is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, taking into account the relevant circumstances (Savellano v. Northwest Airlines, G.R. No. 151783, 8 July 2003, 405 SCRA 416).&nbsp; Considering the prevailing circumstances in the case at bar, we deem it proper to fix it at P30,000.00.&nbsp; We believe this form of damages would serve to deter employers from future violations of the statutory due process rights of employees. At the very least, it provides a vindication or recognition of this fundamental right granted to the latter under the Labor Code and its Implementing Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED, by deleting the award of backwages and granting only P30,000 as nominal damages.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Agabon v.
