All the other aspects of the assailed Resolutions are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br></blockquote>Not satisfied, the petitioners filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> before this Court.<br><br><b><center>The Issues<br></center></b><br>The petitioners raise the following issues:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<ol type="1"><li> WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REVERSIBLE ERROR IN THE COURT OF APPEALS’ UPHOLDING THE DOLE-NCR AND BLR-DOLE DECISIONS BASED ONLY ON THE COMPLAINT AND ANSWER;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> WHETHER OR NOT IT IS REVERSIBLE ERROR FOR THE COURT OF APPEALS TO HOLD THE ELECTION OF APRIL 7, 2000 AS INVALID AND A NULLITY;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> WHETHER OR NOT IT IS REVERSIBLE ERROR TO UPHOLD BLR-DOLE’S FINDING THAT THE SUSPENSION WAS ILLEGAL; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> WHETHER OR NOT THE ALLEGED NON-HOLDING OF MEETINGS AND ALLEGED NON-SUBMISSION OF REPORTS ARE MOOT AND ACADEMIC, AND WHETHER THE DECISION TO HOLD MEETINGS AND SUBMIT REPORTS CONTRADICT AND OVERRIDE THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE MAJORITY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></li></ol><b><center>The Court’s Rulings<br><br></center></b>We shall discuss the issues in <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br>First Issue:&nbsp; was the court <i>a quo</i> correct in upholding the DOLE-NCR and BLR-DOLE decisions based only on the complaint and answer?<br><br>Petitioners contend that the complaint filed by the private respondents in DOLE-NCR was a mere recital of bare, self serving and unsubstantiated allegations.&nbsp; Both parties did not submit position papers, and the DOLE-NCR resolved the case based only on the complaint and answer.&nbsp; Also, by failing to submit a reply to the answer, private respondents, in effect admitted the petitioners’ controversion of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> They further argue that the private respondents did not exhaust administrative remedies and that the requirement of support by at least 30% of the members of the association pursuant to Section 1, Rule XIV, Article I, Department Order No. 9 of DOLE, was not complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Private respondents, on the other hand, assert that the records show that despite their failure to submit their position papers, they nonetheless moved that the case be resolved by DOLE-NCR based on the complaint, answer and available exhibits or annexes integrated with the aforesaid pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The principle of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies that would warrant the dismissal of the case should not operate against them because they were deprived of their right to due process when they were indefinitely suspended without the benefit of a formal charge which is sufficient in form and substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The respondents also point out that the thirty percent (30%) support requirement pursuant to Section 1, Rule XIV, Article I, Department Order No. 9, is not applicable to them because their complaint was primordially predicated on their suspension while the rest of the causes of action were mere collateral consequences of the principal cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>It is worthy to note that the BLR-DOLE, in its Resolution dated 22 September 2000, underscored the negligence of herein petitioners not only in the submission of their pleadings but also in attending the hearings called for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Even the Court of Appeals, in its decision, made this observation, thus:<br><blockquote>It is apparent, however, that petitioners were to blame for their predicament. They repeatedly failed to appear in a series of conferences scheduled by the DOLE-NCR, asked for resetting of hearings, and requested for extension of time to file its answer. Hence, when they again did not attend a hearing on a date they themselves asked for, private respondents (complainants therein) moved for the submission of the case based on their complaint, position paper and annexes attached thereto.<br><br>When DOLE-NCR directed the parties to submit their respective position papers, petitioners again moved for extension of time to file the same. When another notice was given to the parties to comply with the directive, petitioners prayed for another extension of time. (Private respondents, however, reiterated their earlier motion to have the case resolved based on available pleadings.) After six (6) months or so, petitioners finally filed not their position paper but their answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals was justified in upholding the DOLE-NCR and BLR-DOLE decisions based on the complaint and answer.&nbsp; We cannot accept petitioners’ line of reasoning that since no position papers were submitted, no decision may be made by the adjudicating body.&nbsp; As ruled by Regional Director Maximo B. Lim in his decision, the complaint and the answer thereto were adopted as the parties’ position papers.&nbsp; Thereafter, the case shall be deemed submitted for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Labor laws mandate the speedy disposition of cases, with the least attention to technicalities but without sacrificing the fundamental requisites of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In this case, it cannot be said that there was a denial of due process on the part of the petitioners because they were given all the chances to refute the allegations of the private respondents, and the delay in the proceedings before the DOLE-NCR was clearly attributable to them.<br><br>The argument that there was failure to exhaust administrative remedies cannot be sustained.&nbsp; One of the instances when the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies may be disregarded is when there is a violation of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this case, the respondents have chronicled from the very beginning that they were indefinitely suspended without the benefit of a formal charge sufficient in form and substance.&nbsp; Therefore, the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies cannot squarely apply to them.<br><br>On the matter concerning the 30% support requirement needed to report violations of rights and conditions of union membership, as found in the last paragraph of Article 241 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> we likewise cannot sanction the petitioners. We have already made our pronouncement in the case of <i>Rodriguez v. Director, Bureau of Labor Relations</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> that the 30% requirement is not mandatory.&nbsp; In this case, the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> held in part:<br><blockquote>The respondent Director’s ruling, however, that the assent of 30% of the union membership, mentioned in Article 242 of the Labor Code, was mandatory and essential to the filing of a complaint for any violation of rights and conditions of membership in a labor organization (such as the arbitrary and oppressive increase of union dues here complained of), cannot be affirmed and will be reversed. The very article relied upon militates against the proposition. It states that a report of a violation of rights and conditions of membership in a labor organization <i>may</i> be made by “(a)t least thirty percent (30%) of all the members of a union or <i>any member or members specially concerned</i>.” The use of the permissive “may” in the provision at once negates the notion that the assent of 30% of all the members is mandatory. More decisive is the fact that the provision expressly declares that the report may be made, alternatively by “<i>any member or members specially concerned</i>.” And further confirmation that the assent of 30% of the union members is not a factor in the acquisition of jurisdiction by the Bureau of Labor Relations is furnished by Article 226 of the same Labor Code, which grants original and exclusive jurisdiction to the Bureau, and the Labor Relations Division in the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor, over “<i>all inter-union and intra-union conflicts, and all disputes, grievances or problems arising from or affecting labor management relations,</i>” making no reference whatsoever to any such 30%-support requirement. Indeed, the officials mentioned are given the power to act “on all inter-union and intra-union conflicts (1) “<i>upon request of either or both parties</i>” as well as (2) “<i>at their own initiative</i>.”<br></blockquote>Second Issue: was the election held on 07 April 2000 valid or a nullity?<br><br>This issue arose from the fact that the original decision of the DOLE-NCR dated 22 November 1999, ordered petitioners, among other things, to “immediately hold/conduct an election of officers . . .”&nbsp; Petitioners, it must be recalled, appealed from the DOLE-NCR decision to the BLR-DOLE. During the pendency of the appeal, however, an election of officers was held on 07 April 2000.&nbsp; Subsequently, the BLR-DOLE affirmed the decision of the DOLE-NCR, but with the pronouncement that “. . . the supposed election conducted on (07) April 2000 is null and void and cannot produce legal effects adverse to appellants.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The petitioners contend that since the election was held on 07 April 2000, and the original complaint before the DOLE-NCR was filed on 01 December 1997, the former could not have been the subject of the complaint.&nbsp; There was, according to petitioners, reversible error in the BLR-DOLE’s adding to the DOLE-NCR’s decision, the nullification of the 07 April 2000 election.&nbsp; The BLR–DOLE should have limited itself to affirming, modifying or setting aside and canceling the provisions of the dispositive portion of the DOLE-NCR’s decision which was subject of the appeal.&nbsp; The election was held because the term of the petitioners (extended for five years under Republic Act No. 6715<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>) expired on 07 April 2000.&nbsp; As amended by Republic Act 6715, paragraph (c) of Article 241 of the Labor Code now reads:<br><blockquote>(c) The members shall directly elect their officers in the local union, as well as their national officers in the national union or federation to which they or their local union is affiliated, by secret ballots at intervals of five (5) years.<br></blockquote>It just so happened that the holding of the election coincided with the DOLE-NCR decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The private respondents, in answer to this, point out that the 07 April 2000 election, as appearing in the 22 September 2000 Resolution of the BLR-DOLE, was set aside not on the flimsy reason that there was no complaint to invalidate it, but due to the appeal of the petitioners questioning the BLR-DOLE’s order.&nbsp; The appeal effectively suspended the effect of the DOLE-NCR Regional Director’s order for the immediate holding of election of officers in accordance with the union’s constitution and by-laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On this matter, the Court of Appeals made the following observation:<br><blockquote>Consequently, the Regional Director of DOLE-NCR erred in ordering the immediate holding of election of officers of UEEA, and the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR)-Department of Labor and Employment, insofar as it affirmed this particular order, committed an act amounting to grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Nonetheless, despite of this finding, the election of UEEA officers on 7 April 2000 cannot acquire a semblance of legality. First, it was conducted pursuant to the aforesaid (erroneous) order of the Regional Director as manifested by the petitioners. Second, it was purposely done to pre-empt the resolution of the case by the BLR and to deprive private respondents their substantial right to participate in the election. Third, petitioners cannot be allowed to take an inconsistent position to later on claim that the election of 7 April 2000 was held because it was already due while previously declaring that it was made in line with the order of the Regional Director, for this would go against the principle of fair play.<br><br>Thus, while the BLR was wrong in affirming the order of the Regional Director for the immediate holding of election, it was right in nullifying the 7 April 2000 UEEA election of officers. It was simply improper for the petitioners to implement the said order which was then one of the subjects of their appeal in the BLR. To hold otherwise would be to dispossess the BLR of its inherent power to control the conduct of the proceedings of cases pending before it for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Based on the prevailing facts of this case, we affirm the foregoing findings of the court <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; We cannot hold the election of 07 April 2000 valid as this would make us condone an iniquitous act.&nbsp; Said election was perceptibly done to hinder any resolution or decision that would be made by BLR-DOLE.&nbsp; The Regional Director indeed ordered the immediate holding of an election in its Order dated 22 November 1999.&nbsp; The records show that the petitioners questioned this order of the Regional Director before the BLR-DOLE by way of appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and yet, they conducted the election, allegedly because it was due under Republic Act No.&nbsp; 6715.&nbsp; Why this was done by the petitioners escapes us.&nbsp; But as rightfully observed by the BLR-DOLE:<br><blockquote>. . . Indeed, it is obvious that the general membership meeting and election of officers was done purposely to pre-empt our resolution of this case and, more importantly, the participation of appellees in the election. This cannot be tolerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>Third Issue: was the indefinite suspension of the private respondents illegal?<br><br>We rule in the affirmative.<br><br>The petitioners posit the theory that the records do not support the findings of the BLR-DOLE that no investigation was conducted making the suspension illegal because of lack of due process.<br><br>It is best to remind the petitioners that this Court, as we have held in a long line of decisions, is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; The instant case is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> where only questions of law may be raised. The exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> to this rule find no application here. This being the case, the findings of fact of the DOLE-NCR and the BLR-DOLE as affirmed by the Court of Appeals to the effect that no investigation was conducted, shall not be disturbed.&nbsp; As properly held by the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><blockquote>Petitioners have failed to show that the findings of facts and conclusions of law of both the DOLE-NCR and BLR-DOLE were arrived at with grave abuse of discretion or without substantial evidence. A careful review of the pleadings before Us reveals that the decision and resolutions of the concerned agencies were correctly anchored in law and on substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Fourth Issue: is the non-holding of meetings and non-submission of reports by the petitioners moot and academic, and whether the decision to hold meetings and submit reports contradict and override the sovereign will of the majority?<br><br>We do not believe so.<br><br>This issue was precipitated by the Court of Appeals decision affirming the order of DOLE Regional Director Maximo B.
