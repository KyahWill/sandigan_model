No. 9337)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> was enacted.  Reasons, the wisdom of which, the Court even with its extensive constitutional power of review, cannot probe.  The petitioners in these cases, however, question not only the wisdom of the law, but also perceived constitutional infirmities in its passage.<br><br>Every law enjoys in its favor the presumption of constitutionality.  Their arguments notwithstanding, petitioners failed to justify their call for the invalidity of the law.  Hence, R.A. No. 9337 is not unconstitutional.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</b><br></div><br>R.A. No. 9337 is a consolidation of three legislative bills namely, House Bill Nos. 3555 and 3705, and Senate Bill No. 1950.<br><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">House Bill No. 3555</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> was introduced on first reading on January 7, 2005.  The House Committee on Ways and Means approved the bill, in substitution of House Bill No. 1468, which Representative (Rep.) Eric D. Singson introduced on August 8, 2004.  The President certified the bill on January 7, 2005 for immediate enactment.  On January 27, 2005, the House of Representatives approved the bill on second and third reading.<br><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">House Bill No. 3705</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on the other hand, substituted House Bill No. 3105 introduced by Rep. Salacnib F. Baterina, and House Bill No. 3381 introduced by Rep. Jacinto V. Paras.  Its “mother bill” is House Bill No. 3555.  The House Committee on Ways and Means approved the bill on February 2, 2005.  The President also certified it as urgent on February 8, 2005.  The House of Representatives approved the bill on second and third reading on February 28, 2005.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Ways and Means approved <i style="font-weight: bold;">Senate Bill No. 1950</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on March 7, 2005, “in substitution of Senate Bill Nos. 1337, 1838 and 1873, taking into consideration House Bill Nos. 3555 and 3705.”  Senator Ralph G. Recto sponsored Senate Bill No. 1337, while Senate Bill Nos. 1838 and 1873 were both sponsored by Sens. Franklin M. Drilon, Juan M. Flavier and Francis N. Pangilinan.  The President certified the bill on March 11, 2005, and was approved by the Senate on second and third reading on April 13, 2005.<br><br>On the same date, April 13, 2005, the Senate agreed to the request of the House of Representatives for a committee conference on the disagreeing provisions of the proposed bills.<br><br>Before long, the Conference Committee on the Disagreeing Provisions of House Bill No. 3555, House Bill No. 3705, and Senate Bill No. 1950, “after having met and discussed in full free and conference,” recommended the approval of its report, which the Senate did on May 10, 2005, and with the House of Representatives agreeing thereto the next day, May 11, 2005.<br><br>On May 23, 2005, the enrolled copy of the consolidated House and Senate version was transmitted to the President, who signed the same into law on May 24, 2005.  Thus, came R.A. No. 9337.<br><br>July 1, 2005 is the effectivity date of R.A. No. 9337.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  When said date came, the Court issued a temporary restraining order, effective immediately and continuing until further orders, enjoining respondents from enforcing and implementing the law.<br><br>Oral arguments were held on July 14, 2005.  Significantly, during the hearing, the Court speaking through Mr. Justice Artemio V. Panganiban, voiced the rationale for its issuance of the temporary restraining order on July 1, 2005, to wit:<br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%">J. PANGANIBAN </td> <td width="80%"> <div align="justify">:           . . .  But before I go into the details of your presentation, let me just tell you a little background.  You know when the law took effect on July 1, 2005, the Court issued a TRO at about 5 o’clock in the afternoon.  But before that, there was a lot of complaints aired on television and on radio.  Some people in a gas station were complaining that the gas prices went up by 10%.  Some people were complaining that their electric bill will go up by 10%.  Other times people riding in domestic air carrier were complaining that the prices that they’ll have to pay would have to go up by 10%.  While all that was being aired, per your presentation and per our own understanding of the law, that’s not true.  It’s not true that the e-vat law necessarily increased prices by 10% uniformly isn’t it?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY.

PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           It is not?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY. BANIQUED</td> <td> <div align="justify">:           It’s not, because, Your Honor, there is an Executive Order that granted the Petroleum companies some subsidy . . . interrupted</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>J. PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           That’s correct . . .</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY. BANIQUED</td> <td> <div align="justify">:           . . . and therefore that was meant to temper the impact . . . interrupted</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>J.

PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           As a matter of fact a part of the mitigating measures would be the elimination of the Excise Tax and the import duties.  That is why, it is not correct to say that the VAT as to petroleum dealers increased prices by 10%.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY. BANIQUED</td> <td><div align="justify">:           Yes, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>J. PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           And therefore, there is no justification for increasing the retail price by 10% to cover the E-Vat tax.  If you consider the excise tax and the import duties, the Net Tax would probably be in the neighborhood of 7%?  We are not going into exact figures I am just trying to deliver a point that different industries, different products, different services are hit differently.  So it’s not correct to say that all prices must go up by 10%.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY. BANIQUED</td> <td><div align="justify">:           You’re right, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>J. PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           Now.  For instance, Domestic Airline companies, Mr. Counsel, are at present imposed a Sales Tax of 3%.  When this E-Vat law took effect the Sales Tax was also removed as a mitigating measure.  So, therefore, there is no justification to increase the fares by 10% at best 7%, correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY. BANIQUED</td> <td> <div align="justify">:           I guess so, Your Honor, yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr>     <tr valign="top"> <td>J. PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           There are other products that the people were complaining on that first day, were being increased arbitrarily by 10%.  And that’s one reason among many others this Court had to issue TRO because of the confusion in the implementation.  That’s why we added as an issue in this case, even if it’s tangentially taken up by the pleadings of the parties, the confusion in the implementation of the E-vat.  Our people were subjected to the mercy of that confusion of an across the board increase of 10%, which you yourself now admit and I think even the Government will admit is incorrect.  In some cases, it should be 3% only, in some cases it should be 6% depending on these mitigating measures and the location and situation of each product, of each service, of each company, isn’t it?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>ATTY. BANIQUED</td> <td> <div align="justify">:           Yes, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>J. PANGANIBAN</td> <td><div align="justify">:           Alright.  So that’s one reason why we had to issue a TRO pending the clarification of all these and we wish the government will take time to clarify all these by means of a more detailed implementing rules, in case the law is upheld by this Court.  . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The Court also directed the parties to file their respective Memoranda.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>G.R. No. 168056</b><br></div><br>Before R.A. No. 9337 took effect, petitioners <i>ABAKADA GURO</i> Party List, <i>et al.,</i> filed a petition for prohibition on May 27, 2005.  They question the constitutionality of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of R.A. No. 9337, amending Sections 106, 107 and 108, respectively, of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).  Section 4 imposes a 10% VAT on sale of goods and properties, Section 5 imposes a 10% VAT on importation of goods, and Section 6 imposes a 10% VAT on sale of services and use or lease of properties.  These questioned provisions contain a uniform proviso authorizing the President, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Finance, to raise the VAT rate to 12%, effective January 1, 2006, after any of the following conditions have been satisfied, to wit: <blockquote> . . . That the President, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Finance, shall, effective January 1, 2006, raise the rate of value-added tax to twelve percent (12%), after any of the following conditions has been satisfied:<br><br>(i) Value-added tax collection as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the previous year exceeds two and four-fifth percent (2 4/5%); or<br><br>(ii) National government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%). </blockquote> Petitioners argue that the law is unconstitutional, as it constitutes abandonment by Congress of its exclusive authority to fix the rate of taxes under Article VI, Section 28(2) of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>G.R. No. 168207</b><br></div><br>On June 9, 2005, Sen. Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr., <i>et al.,</i> filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> likewise assailing the constitutionality of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of R.A. No. 9337.<br><br>Aside from questioning the so-called <i>stand-by authority</i> of the President to increase the VAT rate to 12%, on the ground that it amounts to an undue delegation of legislative power, petitioners also contend that the increase in the VAT rate to 12% contingent on any of the two conditions being satisfied violates the due process clause embodied in Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, as it imposes an unfair and additional tax burden on the people, in that: (1) the 12% increase is ambiguous because it does not state if the rate would be returned to the original 10% if the conditions are no longer satisfied; (2) the rate is unfair and unreasonable, as the people are unsure of the applicable VAT rate from year to year; and (3) the increase in the VAT rate, which is supposed to be an incentive to the President to raise the VAT collection to at least 2 4/5 of the GDP of the previous year, should only be based on fiscal adequacy.<br><br>Petitioners further claim that the inclusion of a <i>stand-by authority</i> granted to the President by the Bicameral Conference Committee is a violation of the “no-amendment rule” upon last reading of a bill laid down in Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>G.R. No. 168461</b><br></div><br>Thereafter, a petition for prohibition was filed on June 29, 2005, by the Association of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pilipinas</span> Shell Dealers, Inc., <span style="font-style: italic;">et al.</span>, assailing the following provisions of R.A.

According to petitioners, the contested sections impose limitations on the amount of input tax that may be claimed.  Petitioners also argue that the input tax partakes the nature of a property that may not be confiscated, appropriated, or limited without due process of law.  Petitioners further contend that like any other property or property right, the input tax credit may be transferred or disposed of, and that by limiting the same, the government gets to tax a profit or value-added even if there is no profit or value-added.<br><br>Petitioners also believe that these provisions violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law under Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, as the limitation on the creditable input tax if: (1) the entity has a high ratio of input tax; or (2) invests in capital equipment; or (3) has several transactions with the government, is not based on real and substantial differences to meet a valid classification.<br><br>Lastly, petitioners contend that the 70% limit is anything but progressive, violative of Article VI, Section 28(1) of the Constitution, and that it is the smaller businesses with higher input tax to output tax ratio that will suffer the consequences thereof for it wipes out whatever meager margins the petitioners make.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>G.R. No. 168463</b><br></div><br>Several members of the House of Representatives led by Rep. Francis Joseph G. Escudero filed this petition for certiorari on June 30, 2005.

No. 168730</b><br></div><br>On the eleventh hour, Governor Enrique T. Garcia filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition on July 20, 2005, alleging unconstitutionality of the law on the ground that the limitation on the creditable input tax in effect allows VAT-registered establishments to retain a portion of the taxes they collect, thus violating the principle that tax collection and revenue should be solely allocated for public purposes and expenditures.  Petitioner Garcia further claims that allowing these establishments to pass on the tax to the consumers is inequitable, in violation of Article VI, Section 28(1) of the Constitution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>RESPONDENTS’ COMMENT</b><br></div><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Comment in behalf of respondents.  Preliminarily, respondents contend that R.A. No. 9337 enjoys the presumption of constitutionality and petitioners failed to cast doubt on its validity.<br><br>Relying on the case of <i>Tolentino vs. Secretary of Finance</i>, 235 SCRA 630 (1994), respondents argue that the procedural issues raised by petitioners, <i>i.e.,</i> legality of the bicameral proceedings, exclusive origination of revenue measures and the power of the Senate concomitant thereto, have already been settled.  With regard to the issue of undue delegation of legislative power to the President, respondents contend that the law is complete and leaves no discretion to the President but to increase the rate to 12% once any of the two conditions provided therein arise.<br><br>Respondents also refute petitioners’ argument that the increase to 12%, as well as the 70% limitation on the creditable input tax, the 60-month amortization on the purchase or importation of capital goods exceeding P1,000,000.00, and the 5% final withholding tax by government agencies, is arbitrary, oppressive, and confiscatory, and that it violates the constitutional principle on progressive taxation, among others.<br><br>Finally, respondents manifest that R.A. No. 9337 is the anchor of the government’s fiscal reform agenda.  A reform in the value-added system of taxation is the core revenue measure that will tilt the balance towards a sustainable macroeconomic environment necessary for economic growth.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>ISSUES</b><br></div><br>The Court defined the issues, as follows:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>PROCEDURAL ISSUE</b></u></div> <blockquote> Whether R.A.

It is levied on the sale, barter, exchange or lease of goods or properties and services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>   Being an indirect tax on expenditure, the seller of goods or services may pass on the amount of tax paid to the buyer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with the seller acting merely as a tax collector.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The burden of VAT is intended to fall on the immediate buyers and ultimately, the end-consumers.<br><br>In contrast, a direct tax is a tax for which a taxpayer is directly liable on the transaction or business it engages in, without transferring the burden to someone else.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Examples are individual and corporate income taxes, transfer taxes, and residence taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the Philippines, the value-added system of sales taxation has long been in existence, albeit in a different mode.  Prior to 1978, the system was a single-stage tax computed under the “cost deduction method” and was payable only by the original sellers.  The single-stage system was subsequently modified, and a mixture of the “cost deduction method” and “tax credit method” was used to determine the value-added tax payable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>   Under the “tax credit method,” an entity can credit against or subtract from the VAT charged on its sales or outputs the VAT paid on its purchases, inputs and imports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>It was only in 1987, when President Corazon C.

No. 9337, also referred to by respondents as the VAT Reform Act.<br><br>The Court will now discuss the issues in logical sequence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>PROCEDURAL ISSUE</u></b><br><br><b>I.</b><br></div><br>Whether R.A. No. 9337 violates the following provisions of the Constitution:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a.  Article VI, Section 24, and<br>b.  Article VI, Section 26(2)<br></div><br><i>A. The Bicameral Conference Committee</i><br><br>Petitioners Escudero, <i>et al.,</i> and Pimentel, <i>et al.,</i> allege that the Bicameral Conference Committee exceeded its authority by:<br><blockquote> 1) Inserting the <i>stand-by authority</i> in favor of the President in Sections 4, 5, and 6 of R.A. No. 9337;<br><br>2) Deleting entirely the <i>no pass-on</i> provisions found in both the House and Senate bills;<br><br>3) Inserting the provision imposing a 70% limit on the amount of input tax to be credited against the output tax; and<br><br>4) Including the amendments introduced only by Senate Bill No. 1950 regarding other kinds of taxes in addition to the value-added tax.<br></blockquote>Petitioners now beseech the Court to define the powers of the Bicameral Conference Committee.<br><br>It should be borne in mind that the power of internal regulation and discipline are intrinsic in any legislative body for, as unerringly elucidated by Justice Story, “<b>[i]f the power did not exist, it would be utterly impracticable to transact the business of the nation, either at all, or at least with decency, deliberation, and order.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Thus, Article VI, Section 16 (3) of the Constitution provides that “each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.” Pursuant to this inherent constitutional power to promulgate and implement its own rules of procedure, the respective rules of each house of Congress provided for the creation of a Bicameral Conference Committee.<br><br>Thus, Rule XIV, Sections 88 and 89 of the Rules of House of Representatives provides as follows: <blockquote> Sec. 88.  <i>Conference Committee. </i>– In the event that the House does not agree with the Senate on the amendment to any bill or joint resolution, the differences may be settled by the conference committees of both chambers.<br><br>In resolving the differences with the Senate, the House panel shall, as much as possible, adhere to and support the House Bill.  If the differences with the Senate are so substantial that they materially impair the House Bill, the panel shall report such fact to the House for the latter’s appropriate action.<br><br>Sec. 89. <i> Conference Committee Reports.</i> – . . . Each report shall contain a detailed, sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject measure.<br><br>. . .<br><br>The Chairman of the House panel may be interpellated on the Conference Committee Report prior to the voting thereon.  The House shall vote on the Conference Committee Report in the same manner and procedure as it votes on a bill on third and final reading.<br></blockquote>Rule XII, Section 35 of the Rules of the Senate states:<br><blockquote> Sec. 35.  In the event that the Senate does not agree with the House of Representatives on the provision of any bill or joint resolution, the differences shall be settled by a conference committee of both Houses which shall meet within ten (10) days after their composition.  The President shall designate the members of the Senate Panel in the conference committee with the approval of the Senate.<br><br>Each Conference Committee Report shall contain a detailed and sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in, or amendments to the subject measure, and shall be signed by a majority of the members of each House panel, voting separately.<br><br>A comparative presentation of the conflicting House and Senate provisions and a reconciled version thereof with the explanatory statement of the conference committee shall be attached to the report.<br><br>. . .<br></blockquote>The creation of such conference committee was apparently in response to a problem, not addressed by any constitutional provision, where the two houses of Congress find themselves in disagreement over changes or amendments introduced by the other house in a legislative bill.  Given that one of the most basic powers of the legislative branch is to formulate and implement its own rules of proceedings and to discipline its members, may the Court then delve into the details of how Congress complies with its internal rules or how it conducts its business of passing legislation?  Note that in the present petitions, the issue is not whether provisions of the rules of both houses creating the bicameral conference committee are unconstitutional, <b>but whether the bicameral conference committee has strictly complied with the rules of both houses, thereby remaining within the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Congress.</b><br><br>In the recent case of <i>Fariñas vs. The Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court <i>En Banc</i>, <b>unanimously</b> reiterated and emphasized its adherence to the “enrolled bill doctrine,” thus, declining therein petitioners’ plea for the Court to go behind the enrolled copy of the bill.  Assailed in said case was Congress’s creation of two sets of bicameral conference committees, the lack of records of said committees’ proceedings, the alleged violation of said committees of the rules of both houses, and the disappearance or deletion of one of the provisions in the compromise bill submitted by the bicameral conference committee.  It was argued that such irregularities in the passage of the law nullified R.A. No. 9006, or the Fair Election Act.<br><br>Striking down such argument, the Court held thus:<br><blockquote> Under the “enrolled bill doctrine,” the signing of a bill by the Speaker of the House and the Senate President and the certification of the Secretaries of both Houses of Congress that it was passed are conclusive of its due enactment.  A review of cases reveals the Court’s consistent adherence to the rule.  <b>The Court finds no reason to deviate from the salutary rule in this case where the irregularities alleged by the petitioners mostly involved the internal rules of Congress, e.g., creation of the 2<sup>nd </sup>or 3<sup>rd</sup> Bicameral Conference Committee by the House.  This Court is not the proper forum for the enforcement of these internal rules of Congress, whether House or Senate. Parliamentary rules are merely procedural and with their observance the courts have no concern. Whatever doubts there may be as to the formal validity of Rep. Act No. 9006 must be resolved in its favor.</b>  The Court reiterates its ruling in <i>Arroyo vs. De Venecia, viz.</i>: <blockquote> But the <b>cases, both here and abroad, in varying forms of expression, all deny to the courts the power to inquire into allegations that, in enacting a law, a House of Congress failed to comply with its own rules, in the absence of showing that there was a violation of a constitutional provision or the rights of private individuals.</b>  In <i>Osmeña v. Pendatun,</i> it was held: “At any rate, courts have declared that ‘the rules adopted by deliberative bodies are subject to revocation, modification or waiver at the pleasure of the body adopting them.’  <b>And it has been said that “Parliamentary rules are merely procedural, and with their observance, the courts have no concern.  They may be waived or disregarded by the legislative body.” Consequently, “mere failure to conform to parliamentary usage will not invalidate the action (taken by a deliberative body) when the requisite number of members have agreed to a particular measure.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote></blockquote> The foregoing declaration is exactly in point with the present cases, where petitioners allege irregularities committed by the conference committee in introducing changes or deleting provisions in the House and Senate bills.  Akin to the <i>Fariñas</i> case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  the present petitions also raise an issue regarding the actions taken by the conference committee on matters regarding Congress’ compliance with its own internal rules.  As stated earlier, one of the most basic and inherent power of the legislature is the power to formulate rules for its proceedings and the discipline of its members.  Congress is the best judge of how it should conduct its own business  expeditiously  and  in  the most  orderly manner.  It is also the  sole<br><br>concern of Congress to instill discipline among the members of its conference committee if it believes that said members violated any of its rules of proceedings.  Even the expanded jurisdiction of this Court cannot apply to questions regarding only the internal operation of Congress, thus, the Court is wont to deny a review of the internal proceedings of a co-equal branch of government.<br><br>Moreover, as far back as 1994 or more than ten years ago, in the case of <i>Tolentino vs. Secretary of Finance</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court already made the pronouncement that “<b>[i]f a change is desired in the practice [of the Bicameral Conference Committee] it must be sought in Congress since this question is not covered by any constitutional provision but is only an internal rule of each house.</b>” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  To date, Congress has not seen it fit to make such changes adverted to by the Court.  It seems, therefore, that Congress finds the practices of the bicameral conference committee to be very useful for purposes of prompt and efficient legislative action.<br><br>Nevertheless, just to put minds at ease that no blatant irregularities tainted the proceedings of the bicameral conference committees, the Court deems it necessary to dwell on the issue.  The Court observes that there was a necessity for a conference committee because a comparison of the provisions of House Bill Nos. 3555 and 3705 on one hand, and Senate Bill No. 1950 on the other, reveals that there were indeed disagreements.  As pointed out in the petitions, said disagreements were as follows:<br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><strong>House Bill No. 3555</strong></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><strong>House Bill No.3705</strong></div></td> <td width="31%"><div align="center"><strong>Senate Bill No. 1950</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"></div><br></td> <td><div align="center"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="5"><p align="center"><em>With regard to “Stand-By Authority” in favor of President</em></p> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="30%"><div align="justify">Provides for 12% VAT on every sale of goods or properties (amending Sec. 106 of NIRC); 12% VAT on importation of goods (amending Sec. 107 of NIRC); and 12% VAT on sale of services and use or lease of properties (amending Sec. 108 of NIRC)</div></td> <td width="5%"> <br></td> <td width="29%"><div align="justify">Provides for 12% VAT in general on sales of goods or properties and reduced rates for sale of certain locally manufactured goods and  petroleum products and raw materials to be used in the manufacture thereof (amending Sec. 106 of NIRC); 12% VAT on importation of goods and reduced rates for certain imported products including petroleum products (amending Sec. 107 of NIRC); and 12% VAT on sale of services and use or lease of properties and a reduced rate for certain services including power generation (amending Sec. 108 of NIRC)</div></td> <td width="5%"> <br></td> <td><div align="justify">Provides for a single rate of 10% VAT on sale of goods or properties (amending Sec. 106 of NIRC), 10% VAT on sale of services including sale of electricity by generation companies, transmission and distribution companies, and use or lease of properties (amending Sec. 108 of NIRC)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="5"><div align="center"><em>With regard to the “no pass-on” provision</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">No similar provision</div></td> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify">Provides that the VAT imposed on power generation and on the sale of petroleum products shall be absorbed by generation companies or sellers, respectively, and shall not be passed on to consumers</div></td> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify">Provides that the VAT imposed on sales of electricity by generation companies and services of transmission companies and distribution companies, as well as those of franchise grantees of electric utilities shall not apply to residential end-users.

The Bicameral Conference Committee acted on the disagreeing provisions by making the following changes: <ol> <li>With regard to the disagreement on the rate of VAT to be imposed, it would appear from the Conference Committee Report that the Bicameral Conference Committee tried to bridge the gap in the difference between the 10% VAT rate proposed by the Senate, and the various rates with 12% as the highest VAT rate proposed by the House, by striking a compromise whereby the present 10% VAT rate would be retained until certain conditions arise, i.e., the value-added tax collection as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) of the previous year exceeds 2 4/5%, or National Government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds 1½%,  when the President, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Finance shall raise the rate of VAT to 12% effective January 1, 2006.<br><br></li><li>With regard to the disagreement on whether only the VAT imposed on electricity generation, transmission and distribution companies should not be passed on to consumers or whether both the VAT imposed on electricity generation, transmission and distribution companies and the VAT imposed on sale of petroleum products may be passed on to consumers, the Bicameral Conference Committee chose to settle such disagreement by altogether deleting from its Report any <i>no pass-on</i> provision.<br><br></li><li>With regard to the disagreement on whether input tax credits should be limited or not, the Bicameral Conference Committee decided to adopt the position of the House by putting a limitation on the amount of input tax that may be credited against the output tax, although it crafted its own language as to the amount of the limitation on input tax credits and the manner of computing the same by providing thus: <blockquote> (A) Creditable Input Tax. – . . .<br><br>. . .<br><br><i>Provided,</i> The input tax on goods purchased or imported in a calendar month for use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation is allowed under this Code, shall be spread evenly over the month of acquisition and the fifty-nine (59) succeeding months if the aggregate acquisition cost for such goods, excluding the VAT component thereof, exceeds one million Pesos (P1,000,000.00): PROVIDED, however, that if the estimated useful life of the capital good is less than five (5) years, as used for depreciation purposes, then the input VAT shall be spread over such shorter period:  . . .<br><br>(B) Excess Output or Input Tax. – If at the end of any taxable quarter the output tax exceeds the input tax, the excess shall be paid by the VAT-registered person.  If the input tax exceeds the output tax, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding quarter or quarters:  PROVIDED that the input tax inclusive of input VAT carried over from the previous quarter that may be credited in every quarter shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of the output VAT: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT any input tax attributable to zero-rated sales by a VAT-registered person may at his option be refunded or credited against other internal revenue taxes,  . . . </blockquote> </li><li>With regard to the amendments to other provisions of the NIRC on corporate income tax, franchise, percentage and excise taxes, the conference committee decided to include such amendments and basically adopted the provisions found in Senate Bill No. 1950, with some changes as to the rate of the tax to be imposed. </li></ol> Under the provisions of both the Rules of the House of Representatives and Senate Rules, the Bicameral Conference Committee is mandated to settle the differences between the disagreeing provisions in the House bill and the Senate bill.  The term “settle” is synonymous to “reconcile” and “harmonize.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  To reconcile or harmonize disagreeing provisions, the Bicameral Conference Committee may then (a) adopt the specific provisions of either the House bill or Senate bill, (b) decide that neither provisions in the House bill or the provisions in the Senate bill would be carried into the final form of the bill, and/or (c) try to arrive at a compromise between the disagreeing provisions.<br><br>In the present case, the changes introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee on disagreeing provisions were meant only to reconcile and harmonize the disagreeing provisions for it did not inject any idea or intent that is wholly foreign to the subject embraced by the original provisions.<br><br>The so-called <i>stand-by authority</i> in favor of the President, whereby the rate of 10% VAT wanted by the Senate is retained until such time that certain conditions arise when the 12% VAT wanted by the House shall be imposed, appears to be a compromise to try to bridge the difference in the rate of VAT proposed by the two houses of Congress.  Nevertheless, such compromise is still totally within the subject of what rate of VAT should be imposed on taxpayers.<br><br>The <i>no pass-on</i> provision was deleted altogether.  In the transcripts of the proceedings of the Bicameral Conference Committee held on May 10, 2005, Sen. Ralph Recto, Chairman of the Senate Panel, explained the reason for deleting the no pass-on provision in this wise: <blockquote> . . . the thinking was just to keep the VAT law or the VAT bill simple.  And we were thinking that no sector should be a beneficiary of legislative grace, neither should any sector be discriminated on.  The VAT is an indirect tax.  <b>It is a pass on-tax</b>.  And let’s keep it plain and simple.  Let’s not confuse the bill and put a no pass-on provision.  Two-thirds of the world have a VAT system and in this two-thirds of the globe, I have yet to see a VAT with a no pass-though provision.  So, the thinking of the Senate is basically simple, let’s keep the VAT simple.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> Rep. Teodoro Locsin further made the manifestation that the <i>no pass-on</i> provision “never really enjoyed the support of either House.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>With regard to the amount of input tax to be credited against output tax, the Bicameral Conference Committee came to a compromise on the percentage rate of the limitation or cap on such input tax credit, but again, the change  introduced  by the Bicameral Conference Committee was totally within  the intent  of  both  houses  to  put  a  cap  on  input  tax  that  may  be redited against the output tax.  From the inception of the subject revenue bill in the House of Representatives, one of the major objectives was to “plug a glaring loophole in the tax policy and administration by creating vital restrictions on the claiming of input VAT tax credits . . .” and “[b]y introducing limitations on the claiming of tax credit, we are capping a major leakage that has placed our collection efforts at an apparent disadvantage.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As to the amendments to NIRC provisions on taxes other than the value-added tax proposed in Senate Bill No. 1950, since said provisions were among those referred to it, the conference committee had to act on the same and it basically adopted the version of the Senate.<br><br>Thus, all the changes or modifications made by the Bicameral Conference  Committee were  germane to subjects of the provisions  referred<br><br>to it for reconciliation.  Such being the case, the Court does not see any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the Bicameral Conference Committee.   In the earlier cases of <i>Philippine Judges Association vs. Prado</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and <i>Tolentino vs. Secretary of Finance,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  the  Court  recognized  the  long-standing  legislative  practice  of  giving  said  conference  committee  ample   latitude   for   compromising differences  between  the Senate and the House.  Thus, in the <i>Tolentino</i> case, it was held that: <blockquote> . . . it is within the power of a conference committee to include in its report an entirely new provision that is not found either in the House bill or in the Senate bill.  If the committee can propose an amendment consisting of one or two provisions, there is no reason why it cannot propose several provisions, collectively considered as an “amendment in the nature of a substitute,” so long as such amendment is germane to the subject of the bills before the committee.  After all, its report was not final but needed the approval of both houses of Congress to become valid as an act of the legislative department.  <b>The charge that in this case the Conference Committee acted as a third legislative chamber is thus without any basis.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> <i>B. R.A. No. 9337 Does Not Violate Article VI, <br>    Section 26(2) of the Constitution on the <br>    “No-Amendment Rule”</i><br><br>Article VI, Sec. 26 (2) of the Constitution, states: <blockquote> No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency. Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal. </blockquote> Petitioners’ argument that the practice where a bicameral conference committee is allowed to add or delete provisions in the House bill and the Senate bill after these had passed three readings is in effect a circumvention of the “no amendment rule” (Sec. 26 (2), Art. VI of the 1987 Constitution), fails to convince the Court to deviate from its ruling in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tolentino</span> case that: <blockquote> Nor is there any reason for requiring that the Committee’s Report in these cases must have undergone three readings in each of the two houses.  If that be the case, there would be no end to negotiation since each house may seek modification of the compromise bill.  . . .<br><br><b>Art. VI. § 26 (2) must, therefore, be construed as referring only to bills introduced for the first time in either house of Congress, not to the conference committee report.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> The Court reiterates here that <b>the “no-amendment rule” refers only to the procedure to be followed by each house of Congress with regard to bills initiated in each of said respective houses, before said bill is transmitted to the other house for its concurrence or amendment.</b>  Verily, to construe said provision in a way as to proscribe any further changes to a bill after one house has voted on it would lead to absurdity as this would mean that the other house of Congress would be deprived of its constitutional power to amend or introduce changes to said bill.  Thus, Art. VI, Sec. 26 (2) of the Constitution cannot be taken to mean that the introduction by the Bicameral Conference Committee of amendments and modifications to disagreeing provisions in bills that have been acted upon by both houses of Congress is prohibited.<br><br><i>C.

They aver that House Bill No. 3555 proposed amendments only regarding Sections 106, 107, 108, 110 and 114 of the NIRC, while House Bill No. 3705 proposed amendments only to Sections 106, 107,108, 109, 110 and 111 of the NIRC; thus, the other sections of the NIRC which the Senate amended but which amendments were not found in the House bills are not intended to be amended by the House of Representatives.  Hence, they argue that since the proposed amendments did not originate from the House, such amendments are a violation of Article VI, Section 24 of the Constitution.<br><br>The argument does not hold water.<br><br>Article VI, Section 24 of the Constitution reads: <blockquote> Sec. 24.  All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments. </blockquote> In the present cases, petitioners admit that it was indeed House Bill Nos. 3555 and 3705 that initiated the move for amending provisions of the NIRC dealing mainly with the value-added tax.  Upon transmittal of said House bills to the Senate, the Senate came out with Senate Bill No. 1950 proposing amendments not only to NIRC provisions on the value-added tax but also amendments to NIRC provisions on other kinds of taxes.  Is the introduction by the Senate of provisions not dealing directly with the value- added tax, which is the only kind of tax being amended in the House bills, still within the purview of the constitutional provision authorizing the Senate to propose or concur with amendments to a revenue bill that originated from the House?<br><br>The foregoing question had been squarely answered in the Tolentino case, wherein the Court held, thus: <blockquote> . . . To begin with, it is not the law – but the revenue bill – which is required by the Constitution to “originate exclusively” in the House of Representatives.  It is important to emphasize this, because a bill originating in the House may undergo such extensive changes in the Senate that the result may be a rewriting of the whole.  . . . At this point, what is important to note is that, as a result of the Senate action, a distinct bill may be produced.  <b>To insist that a revenue statute – and not only the bill which initiated the legislative process culminating in the enactment of the law – must substantially be the same as the House bill would be to deny the Senate’s power not only to “<i>concur with amendments</i>” but also to “<i>propose amendments</i>.”</b>  It would be to violate the coequality of legislative power of the two houses of Congress and in fact make the House superior to the Senate.<br><br>…<br><br>…<b>Given, then, the power of the Senate to propose amendments, the Senate can propose its own version even with respect to bills which are required by the Constitution to originate in the House.</b><br><br>. . .<br><br>Indeed, what the Constitution simply means is that the initiative for filing revenue, tariff or tax bills, bills authorizing an increase of the public debt, private bills and bills of local application must come from the House of Representatives on the theory that, elected as they are from the districts, <b>the members of the House can be expected to be more sensitive to the local needs and problems.  On the other hand, the senators, who are elected at large, are expected to approach the same problems from the national perspective.  Both views are thereby made to bear on the enactment of such laws</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> Since there is no question that the revenue bill exclusively originated in   the   House   of   Representatives,  the    Senate   was   acting   within   its constitutional power to introduce amendments to the House bill when it included provisions in Senate Bill No. 1950 amending corporate income taxes, percentage, excise and franchise taxes.  Verily, Article VI, Section 24 of the Constitution does not contain any prohibition or limitation on the extent of the amendments that may be introduced by the Senate to the House revenue bill.<br><br>Furthermore, the amendments introduced by the Senate to the NIRC provisions that had not been touched in the House bills are still in furtherance of the intent of the House in initiating the subject revenue bills.  The Explanatory Note of House Bill No. 1468, the very first House bill introduced on the floor, which was later substituted by House Bill No. 3555, stated: <blockquote> One of the challenges faced by the present administration is the urgent and daunting task of solving the country’s serious financial problems.  To do this, government expenditures must be strictly monitored and controlled and revenues must be significantly increased.  This may be easier said than done, but our fiscal authorities are still optimistic the government will be operating on a balanced budget by the year 2009.  In fact, several measures that will result to significant expenditure savings have been identified by the administration.  <b>It is supported with a credible package of revenue measures that include measures to improve tax administration and control the leakages in revenues from income taxes and the value-added tax (VAT)</b>.  (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> Rep. Eric D. Singson, in his sponsorship speech for House Bill No. 3555, declared that: <blockquote> In the budget message of our President in the year 2005, she reiterated that we all acknowledged that on top of our agenda must be the restoration of the health of our fiscal system.<br><br>In order to considerably lower the consolidated public sector deficit and eventually achieve a balanced budget by the year 2009, <b>we need to seize windows of opportunities which might seem poignant in the beginning, but in the long run prove effective and beneficial to the overall status of our economy.  One such opportunity is a review of existing tax rates, evaluating the relevance given our present conditions.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> Notably therefore, the main purpose of the bills emanating from the House of Representatives is to bring in sizeable revenues for the government to supplement our country’s serious financial problems, and improve tax administration and control of the leakages in revenues from income taxes and value-added taxes.  As these house bills were transmitted to the Senate, the latter, approaching the measures from the point of national perspective, can introduce amendments within the purposes of those bills. It can provide for ways that would soften the impact of the VAT measure on the consumer, i.e., by distributing the burden across all sectors instead of putting it entirely on the shoulders of the consumers.  The sponsorship speech of Sen. Ralph Recto on why the provisions on income tax on corporation were included is worth quoting: <blockquote> All in all, the proposal of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means will raise P64.3 billion in additional revenues annually even while by mitigating prices of power, services and petroleum products.<br><br>However, not all of this will be wrung out of VAT. In fact, only P48.7 billion amount is from the VAT on twelve goods and services. The rest of the tab – P10.5 billion- will be picked by corporations.<br><br>What we therefore prescribe is a burden sharing between corporate Philippines and the consumer. Why should the latter bear all the pain? Why should the fiscal salvation be only on the burden of the consumer?<br><br>The corporate world’s equity is in form of the increase in the corporate income tax from 32 to 35 percent, but up to 2008 only. This will raise P10.5 billion a year. After that, the rate will slide back, not to its old rate of 32 percent, but two notches lower, to 30 percent.<br><br>Clearly, we are telling those with the capacity to pay, corporations, to bear with this emergency provision that will be in effect for 1,200 days, while we put our fiscal house in order. This fiscal medicine will have an expiry date.<br><br>For their assistance, a reward of tax reduction awaits them. We intend to keep the length of their sacrifice brief. We would like to assure them that not because there is a light at the end of the tunnel, this government will keep on making the tunnel long.<br><br>The responsibility will not rest solely on the weary shoulders of the small man. Big business will be there to share the burden.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </blockquote> As the Court has said, the Senate can propose amendments and in fact, the amendments made on provisions in the tax on income of corporations are germane to the purpose of the house bills which is to raise revenues for the government.<br><br>Likewise, the Court finds the sections referring to other percentage and excise taxes germane to the reforms to the VAT system, as these sections would cushion the effects of VAT on consumers. Considering that certain goods and services which were subject to percentage tax and excise tax would no longer be VAT-exempt, the consumer would be burdened more as they would be paying the VAT in addition to these taxes. Thus, there is a need to amend these sections to soften the impact of VAT. Again, in his sponsorship speech, Sen. Recto said: <blockquote> However, for power plants that run on oil, we will reduce to zero the present excise tax on bunker fuel, to lessen the effect of a VAT on this product.<br><br>For electric utilities like Meralco, we will wipe out the franchise tax in exchange for a VAT.<br><br>And in the case of petroleum, while we will levy the VAT on oil products, so as not to destroy the VAT chain, we will however bring down the excise tax on socially sensitive products such as diesel, bunker, fuel and kerosene.<br><br>. . .<br><br>What do all these exercises point to? These are not contortions of giving to the left hand what was taken from the right. Rather, these sprang from our concern of softening the impact of VAT, so that the people can cushion the blow of higher prices they will have to pay as a result of VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </blockquote> The other sections amended by the Senate pertained to matters of tax administration which are necessary for the implementation of the changes in the VAT system.<br><br>To reiterate, the sections introduced by the Senate are germane to the subject matter and purposes of the house bills, which is to supplement our country’s fiscal deficit, among others. Thus, the Senate acted within its power to propose those amendments.<br><br> <div style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES</u></b><br><br><b>I. </b><br></div><br>Whether Sections 4, 5 and 6 of R.A.

They submit that the Secretary of Finance is not mandated to give a favorable recommendation and he may not even give his recommendation.  Moreover, they allege that no guiding standards are provided in the law on what basis and as to how he will make his recommendation.  They claim, nonetheless, that any recommendation of the Secretary of Finance can easily be brushed aside by the President since the former is a mere alter ego of the latter, such that, ultimately, it is the President who decides whether to impose the increased tax rate or not.<br><br>A brief discourse on the principle of non-delegation of powers is instructive.<br><br>The principle of separation of powers ordains that each of the three great branches of government has exclusive cognizance of and is supreme in matters  falling  within its  own constitutionally  allocated sphere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> A logical corollary to the doctrine of separation of powers is the principle of non-delegation of powers, as expressed in the Latin maxim: <i>potestas delegata non delegari potest</i> which means “what has been delegated, cannot be delegated.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This doctrine is based on the ethical principle that such as delegated power constitutes not only a right but a duty to be performed by the delegate through the instrumentality of his own judgment and not through the intervening mind of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>With respect to the Legislature, Section 1 of Article VI of the Constitution provides that “<i>the Legislative power shall be vested in the Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.</i>”  The powers which Congress is prohibited from delegating are those which are strictly, or inherently and exclusively, legislative.  Purely legislative power, which can never be delegated, has been described as the <b>authority to make a complete law – complete as to the time when it shall take effect and as to whom it shall be applicable – and to determine the expediency of its enactment.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Thus, the rule is that in order that a court may be justified in holding a statute unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative power, it must appear that the power involved is purely legislative in nature – that is, one appertaining exclusively to the legislative department.  It is the nature of the power, and not the liability of its use or the manner of its exercise, which determines the validity of its delegation.<br><br>Nonetheless, the general rule barring delegation of legislative powers is subject to the following recognized limitations or exceptions: <blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(1)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Delegation of tariff powers to the President under Section 28 (2) of Article VI of the Constitution;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Delegation of emergency powers to the President under Section 23 (2) of Article VI of the Constitution;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Delegation to the people at large;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(4)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Delegation to local governments; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(5)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Delegation to administrative bodies.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> In every case of permissible delegation, there must be a showing that the delegation itself is valid.

Laurel, expounded on the concept and extent of delegation of power in this wise: <blockquote> In testing whether a statute constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power or not, it is usual to inquire whether the statute was complete in all its terms and provisions when it left the hands of the legislature so that nothing was left to the judgment of any other appointee or delegate of the legislature.<br><br>. . .<br><br><b>‘The true distinction’, says Judge Ranney, ‘is between the delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring an authority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be done; to the latter no valid objection can be made.’</b><br><br>. . .<br><br>It is contended, however, that a legislative act may be made to the effect as law after it leaves the hands of the legislature.  It is true that laws may be made effective on certain contingencies, as by proclamation of the executive or the adoption by the people of a particular community. In Wayman vs. Southard, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the legislature may delegate a power not legislative which it may itself rightfully exercise. <b>The power to ascertain facts is such a power which may be delegated. There is nothing essentially legislative in ascertaining the existence of facts or conditions as the basis of the taking into effect of a law. That is a mental process common to all branches of the government.</b> Notwithstanding the apparent tendency, however, to relax the rule prohibiting delegation of legislative authority on account of the complexity arising from social and economic forces at work in this modern industrial age, the orthodox pronouncement of Judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional Limitations finds restatement in Prof. Willoughby's treatise on the Constitution of the United States in the following language — speaking of declaration of legislative power to administrative agencies: <b>The principle which permits the legislature to provide that the administrative agent may determine when the circumstances are such as require the application of a law is defended upon the ground that at the time this authority is granted, the rule of public policy, which is the essence of the legislative act, is determined by the legislature. In other words, the legislature, as it is its duty to do, determines that, under given circumstances, certain executive or administrative action is to be taken, and that, under other circumstances, different or no action at all is to be taken. What is thus left to the administrative official is not the legislative determination of what public policy demands, but simply the ascertainment of what the facts of the case require to be done according to the terms of the law by which he is governed.  The efficiency of an Act as a declaration of legislative will must, of course, come from Congress, but the ascertainment of the contingency upon which the Act shall take effect may be left to such agencies as it may designate.  The legislature, then, may provide that a law shall take effect upon the happening of future specified contingencies leaving to some other person or body the power to determine when the specified contingency has arisen.</b> (Emphasis supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </blockquote> In <i>Edu vs. Ericta,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court reiterated: <blockquote> What cannot be delegated is the authority under the Constitution to make laws and to alter and repeal them; the test is the completeness of the statute in all its terms and provisions when it leaves the hands of the legislature. To determine whether or not there is an undue delegation of legislative power, the inquiry must be directed to the scope and definiteness of the measure enacted. <b>The legislative does not abdicate its functions when it describes what job must be done, who is to do it, and what is the scope of his authority.</b> For a complex economy, that may be the only way in which the legislative process can go forward. <b><b>A distinction has rightfully been made between delegation of power to make the laws which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, which constitutionally may not be done, and delegation of authority or discretion as to its execution to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law, to which no valid objection can be made.</b>  The Constitution is thus not to be regarded as denying the legislature the necessary resources of flexibility and practicability.</b> (Emphasis supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </blockquote> Clearly, the legislature may delegate to executive officers or bodies the power to determine certain facts or conditions, or the happening of contingencies, on which the operation of a statute is, by its terms, made to depend, but the legislature must prescribe sufficient standards, policies or limitations on their authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  While the power to tax cannot be delegated to executive agencies, details as to the enforcement and administration of an exercise of such power may be left to them, including the power to determine the existence of facts on which its operation depends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The rationale for this is that the preliminary ascertainment of facts as basis for the enactment of legislation is not of itself a legislative function, but is simply ancillary to legislation.  Thus, the duty of correlating information and making recommendations is the kind of subsidiary activity which the legislature may perform through its members, or which it may delegate to others to perform.  Intelligent legislation on the complicated problems of modern society is impossible in the absence of accurate information on the part of the legislators, and any reasonable method of securing such information is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  The Constitution as a continuously operative charter of government does not require that Congress find for itself every fact upon which it desires to base legislative action or that it make for itself detailed determinations which it has declared to be prerequisite to application of legislative policy to particular facts and circumstances impossible for Congress itself properly to investigate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the challenged section of R.A. No. 9337 is the common <i>proviso</i> in Sections 4, 5 and 6 which reads as follows: <blockquote> That the President, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Finance, shall, effective January 1, 2006, raise the rate of value-added tax to twelve percent (12%), after any of the following conditions has been satisfied: <blockquote> (i) Value-added tax collection as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the previous year exceeds two and four-fifth percent (2 4/5%); or<br><br>(ii) National government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%). </blockquote></blockquote> The case before the Court is not a delegation of legislative power.  It is simply a delegation of ascertainment of facts upon which enforcement and administration of the increase rate under the law is contingent. The legislature has made the operation of the 12% rate effective January 1, 2006, contingent upon a specified fact or condition. It leaves the entire operation or non-operation of the 12% rate upon factual matters outside of the control of the executive.<br><br>No discretion would be exercised by the President.  Highlighting the absence of discretion is the fact that the word <i>shall</i> is used in the common <i>proviso</i>.  The use of the word <i>shall</i> connotes a mandatory order.  Its use in a statute denotes an imperative obligation and is inconsistent with the idea of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  Where the law is clear and unambiguous, it must be taken to mean exactly what it says, and courts have no choice but to see to it that the mandate is obeyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Thus, it is the ministerial duty of the President to immediately impose the 12% rate upon the existence of any of the conditions specified by Congress. This is a duty which cannot be evaded by the President. Inasmuch as the law specifically uses the word <i>shall</i>, the exercise of discretion by the President does not come into play.  It is a clear directive to impose the 12% VAT rate when the specified conditions are present. The time of taking into effect of the 12% VAT rate is based on the happening of a certain specified contingency, or upon the ascertainment of certain facts or conditions by a person or body other than the legislature itself.<br><br>The Court finds no merit to the contention of petitioners <i>ABAKADA GURO</i> Party List, et al. that the law effectively nullified the President’s power of control over the Secretary of Finance by mandating the fixing of the tax rate by the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Finance.  The  Court  cannot  also  subscribe   to  the  position  of  petitioners<br><br>Pimentel, <i>et al.</i> that the word <i>shall</i> should be interpreted to mean may in view of the phrase “upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Finance.”   Neither does the Court find persuasive the submission of petitioners Escudero, <i>et al.</i> that any recommendation by the Secretary of Finance can easily be brushed aside by the President since the former is a mere alter ego of the latter.<br><br>When one speaks of the Secretary of Finance as the alter ego of the President, it simply means that as head of the Department of Finance he is the assistant and agent of the Chief Executive. The multifarious executive and administrative functions of the Chief Executive are performed by and through the executive departments, and the acts of the secretaries of such departments, such as the Department of Finance, performed and promulgated in the regular course of business, are, unless disapproved or reprobated by the Chief Executive, presumptively the acts of the Chief Executive. The Secretary of Finance, as such, occupies a political position and holds office in an advisory capacity, and, in the language of Thomas Jefferson, "should be of the President's bosom confidence" and, in the language of Attorney-General Cushing, is “subject to the direction of the President."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the present case, in making his recommendation to the President on the existence of either of the two conditions, the Secretary of Finance is not acting as the alter ego of the President or even her subordinate.

He is acting as the agent of the legislative department, to determine and declare the event upon which its expressed will is to take effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  The Secretary of Finance becomes the means or tool by which legislative policy is determined and implemented, considering that he possesses all the facilities to gather data and information and has a much broader perspective to properly evaluate them.  His function is to gather and collate statistical data and other pertinent information and verify if any of the two conditions laid out by Congress is present.  His personality in such instance is in reality but a projection of that of Congress. Thus, being the agent of Congress and not of the President, the President cannot alter or modify or nullify, or set aside the findings of the Secretary of Finance and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.<br><br>Congress simply granted the Secretary of Finance the authority to ascertain the existence of a fact, namely, whether by December 31, 2005, the value-added tax collection as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the previous year exceeds two and four-fifth percent (24/5%) or the national government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds one and one-half percent (1½%).  If either of these two instances has occurred, the Secretary of Finance, by legislative mandate, must submit such information to the President. Then the 12% VAT rate must be imposed by the President effective January 1, 2006.  <b>There is no undue delegation of legislative power but only of the discretion as to the execution of a law.  This is constitutionally permissible.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  Congress does not abdicate its functions or unduly delegate power when it describes what job must be done, who must do it, and what is the scope of his authority; in our complex economy that is frequently the only way in which the legislative process can go forward.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>As to the argument of petitioners <i>ABAKADA GURO</i> Party List, <i>et al.</i> that delegating to the President the legislative power to tax is contrary to the principle of republicanism, the same deserves scant consideration.  Congress did not delegate the power to tax but the mere implementation of the law.  The intent and will to increase the VAT rate to 12% came from Congress and the task of the President is to simply execute the legislative policy.  That Congress chose to do so in such a manner is not within the province of the Court to inquire into, its task being to interpret the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The insinuation by petitioners Pimentel, et al. that the President has ample powers to cause, influence or create the conditions to bring about either or both the conditions precedent does not deserve any merit as this argument is highly speculative.  The Court does not rule on allegations which are manifestly conjectural, as these may not exist at all.  The Court deals with facts, not fancies; on realities, not appearances. When the Court acts on appearances instead of realities, justice and law will be short-lived.<br><br><i>B. The 12% Increase VAT Rate Does Not <br>    Impose an Unfair and Unnecessary <br>    Additional Tax Burden</i><br><br>Petitioners Pimentel, <i>et al.</i> argue that the 12% increase in the VAT rate imposes an unfair and additional tax burden on the people.  Petitioners also argue that the 12% increase, dependent on any of the 2 conditions set forth in the contested provisions, is ambiguous because it does not state if the VAT rate would be returned to the original 10% if the rates are no longer satisfied.  Petitioners also argue that such rate is unfair and unreasonable, as the people are unsure of the applicable VAT rate from year to year.<br><br>Under the common <i>provisos</i> of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of R.A. No. 9337, if any of the two conditions set forth therein are satisfied, the President shall increase the VAT rate to 12%.  The provisions of the law are clear.  It does not provide for a return to the 10% rate nor does it empower the President to so revert if, after the rate is increased to 12%, the VAT collection goes below the 24/5 of the GDP of the previous year or that the national government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year does not exceed 1½%.<br><br>Therefore, no statutory construction or interpretation is needed.  Neither can conditions or limitations be introduced where none is provided for.  Rewriting the law is a forbidden ground that only Congress may tread upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the absence of any provision providing for a return to the 10% rate, which in this case the Court finds none, petitioners’ argument is, at best, purely speculative. There is no basis for petitioners’ fear of a fluctuating VAT rate because the law itself does not provide that the rate should go back to 10% if the conditions provided in Sections 4, 5 and 6 are no longer present.  The rule is that where the provision of the law is clear and unambiguous, so that there is no occasion for the court's seeking the legislative intent, the law must be taken as it is, devoid of judicial addition or subtraction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also contend that the increase in the VAT rate, which was allegedly an incentive to the President to raise the VAT collection to at least 2 4/5 of the GDP of the previous year, should be based on fiscal adequacy.<br><br>Petitioners obviously overlooked that increase in VAT collection is not the only condition.  There is another condition, i.e., the national government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%).<br><br>Respondents explained the philosophy behind these alternative conditions: <blockquote><ol> <li>VAT/GDP Ratio &gt; 2.8%<br><br>The condition set for increasing VAT rate to 12% have economic or fiscal meaning.  If VAT/GDP is less than 2.8%, it means that government has weak or no capability of implementing the VAT or that VAT is not effective in the function of the tax collection.  Therefore, there is no value to increase it to 12% because such action will also be ineffectual.<br><br></li><li>Nat’l Gov’t Deficit/GDP &gt;1.5%<br><br>The condition set for increasing VAT when deficit/GDP is 1.5% or less means the fiscal condition of government has reached a relatively sound position or is towards the direction of a balanced budget position.  Therefore, there is no need to increase the VAT rate since the fiscal house is in a relatively healthy position.  Otherwise stated, if the ratio is more than 1.5%, there is indeed a need to increase the VAT rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote> That the first condition amounts to an incentive to the President to increase the VAT collection does not render it unconstitutional so long as there is a public purpose for which the law was passed, which in this case, is mainly to raise revenue.  In fact, <i>fiscal adequacy</i> dictated the need for a raise in revenue.<br><br>The principle of fiscal adequacy as a characteristic of a sound tax system was originally stated by Adam Smith in his <i>Canons of Taxation</i> (1776), as: <blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">IV.</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> It simply means that sources of revenues must be adequate to meet government expenditures and their variations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The dire need for revenue cannot be ignored.  Our country is in a quagmire of financial woe.  During the Bicameral Conference Committee hearing, then Finance Secretary Purisima bluntly depicted the country’s gloomy state of economic affairs, thus: <blockquote> First, let me explain the position that the Philippines finds itself in right now.  We are in a position where 90 percent of our revenue is used for debt service.  So, for every peso of revenue that we currently raise, 90 goes to debt service.  That’s interest plus amortization of our debt.  So clearly, this is not a sustainable situation.  That’s the first fact.<br><br>The second fact is that our debt to GDP level is way out of line compared to other peer countries that borrow money from that international financial markets.  Our debt to GDP is approximately equal to our GDP.  Again, that shows you that this is not a sustainable situation.<br><br>The third thing that I’d like to point out is the environment that we are presently operating in is not as benign as what it used to be the past five years.<br><br>What do I mean by that?<br><br>In the past five years, we’ve been lucky because we were operating in a period of basically global growth and low interest rates.  The past few months, we have seen an inching up, in fact, a rapid increase in the interest rates in the leading economies of the world.  And, therefore, our ability to borrow at reasonable prices is going to be challenged.  In fact, ultimately, the question is our ability to access the financial markets.<br><br>When the President made her speech in July last year, the environment was not as bad as it is now, at least based on the forecast of most financial institutions.  So, we were assuming that raising 80 billion would put us in a position where we can then convince them to improve our ability to borrow at lower rates.  But conditions have changed on us because the interest rates have gone up.  In fact, just within this room, we tried to access the market for a billion dollars because for this year alone, the Philippines will have to borrow 4 billion dollars.  Of that amount, we have borrowed 1.5 billion. We issued last January a 25-year bond at 9.7 percent cost.  We were trying to access last week and the market was not as favorable and up to now we have not accessed and we might pull back because the conditions are not very good.<br><br>So given this situation, we at the Department of Finance believe that we really need to front-end our deficit reduction.  Because it is deficit that is causing the increase of the debt and we are in what we call a debt spiral.  The more debt you have, the more deficit you have because interest and debt service eats and eats more of your revenue.  We need to get out of this debt spiral.  And the only way, I think, we can get out of this debt spiral is really have a front-end adjustment in our revenue base.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </blockquote> The image portrayed is chilling.  Congress passed the law hoping for rescue from an inevitable catastrophe.  Whether the law is indeed sufficient to answer the state’s economic dilemma is not for the Court to judge.  In the <i>Fariñas</i> case, the Court refused to consider the various arguments raised therein that dwelt on the wisdom of Section 14 of R.A. No. 9006 (The Fair Election Act), pronouncing that: <blockquote> . . . policy matters are not the concern of the Court.  Government policy is within the exclusive dominion of the political branches of the government.  It is not for this Court to look into the wisdom or propriety of legislative determination. Indeed, whether an enactment is wise or unwise, whether it is based on sound economic theory, whether it is the best means to achieve the desired results, whether, in short, the legislative discretion within its prescribed limits should be exercised in a particular manner are matters for the judgment of the legislature, and the serious conflict of opinions does not suffice to bring them within the range of judicial cognizance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </blockquote> In the same vein, the Court in this case will not dawdle on the purpose of Congress or the executive policy, given that it is not for the judiciary to "pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>Whether Section 8 of R.A.

No. 9337, amending Section 110(B) of the NIRC imposes a limitation on the amount of input tax that may be credited against the output tax.  It states, in part: “[<i>P</i>]<i>rovided</i>, that the input tax inclusive of the input VAT carried over from the previous quarter that may be credited in every quarter shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of the output VAT: …”<br><br><i>Input Tax</i> is defined under Section 110(A) of the NIRC, as amended, as the value-added tax due <i>from</i> or <i>paid</i> by a VAT-registered person on the importation of goods or local purchase of good and services, including lease or use of property, in the course of trade or business, from a VAT-registered person, and <i>Output Tax</i> is the value-added tax <i>due</i> on the sale or lease of taxable goods or properties or services by any person registered or required to register under the law.<br><br>Petitioners claim that the contested sections impose limitations on the amount of input tax that may be claimed.  In effect, a portion of the input tax that has already been paid cannot now be credited against the output tax.<br><br>Petitioners’ argument is not absolute.  It assumes that the input tax exceeds 70% of the output tax, and therefore, the input tax in excess of 70% remains uncredited.  However, to the extent that the input tax is less than 70% of the output tax, then 100% of such input tax is still creditable.<br><br>More importantly, the excess input tax, if any, is retained in a business’s books of accounts and remains creditable in the succeeding quarter/s.  This is explicitly allowed by Section 110(B), which provides that “if the input tax exceeds the output tax, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding quarter or quarters.”   In addition, Section 112(B) allows a VAT-registered person to apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund for any unused input taxes, to the extent that such input taxes have not been applied against the output taxes.  Such unused input tax may be used in payment of his other internal revenue taxes.<br><br>The non-application of the unutilized input tax in a given quarter is not <i>ad infinitum</i>, as petitioners exaggeratedly contend.  Their analysis of the effect of the 70% limitation is incomplete and one-sided.  It ends at the net effect that there will be unapplied/unutilized inputs VAT for a given quarter.   It does not proceed further to the fact that such unapplied/unutilized input tax may be credited in the subsequent periods as allowed by the carry-over provision of Section 110(B) or that it may later on be refunded through a tax credit certificate under Section 112(B).<br><br>Therefore, petitioners’ argument must be rejected.<br><br>On the other hand, it appears that petitioner Garcia failed to comprehend the operation of the 70% limitation on the input tax.  According to petitioner, the limitation on the creditable input tax in effect allows VAT-registered establishments to retain a portion of the taxes they collect, which violates the principle that tax collection and revenue should be for public purposes and expenditures<br><br>As earlier stated, the input tax is the tax paid by a person, passed on to him by the seller, when he buys goods.  Output tax meanwhile is the tax due to the person when he sells goods.  In computing the VAT payable, three possible scenarios may arise:<br><br>First, if at the end of a taxable quarter the output taxes charged by the seller are equal to the input taxes that he paid and passed on by the suppliers, then no payment is required;<br><br>Second, when the output taxes exceed the input taxes, the person shall be liable for the excess, which has to be paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and<br><br>Third, if the input taxes exceed the output taxes, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding quarter or quarters.

No. 9337 however, imposed a 70% limitation on the input tax.  Thus, a person can credit his input tax only up to the extent of 70% of the output tax.  In layman’s term, the value-added taxes that a person/taxpayer paid and passed on to him by a seller can only be credited up to 70% of the value-added taxes that is due to him on a taxable transaction.  There is no retention of any tax collection because the person/taxpayer has already previously paid the input tax to a seller, and the seller will subsequently remit such input tax to the BIR.  The party directly liable for the payment of the tax is the seller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>  What only needs to be done is for the person/taxpayer to apply or credit these input taxes, as evidenced by receipts, against his output taxes.<br><br>Petitioners Association of <i>Pilipinas</i> Shell Dealers, Inc., <i>et al</i>. also argue that the input tax partakes the nature of a property that may not be confiscated, appropriated, or limited without due process of law.<br><br>The input tax is not a property or a property right within the constitutional purview of the due process clause.  A VAT-registered person’s entitlement to the creditable input tax is a mere statutory privilege.<br><br>The distinction between statutory privileges and vested rights must be borne in mind for persons have no vested rights in statutory privileges.

No. 9337, amending Section 110(A) of the NIRC, which provides: <blockquote> SEC. 110.  Tax Credits. –<br><br>(A)  <i>Creditable Input Tax.</i> –  …<br><br><i>Provided,</i> That the input tax on goods purchased or imported in a calendar month for use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation is allowed under this Code, shall be spread evenly over the month of acquisition and the fifty-nine (59) succeeding months if the aggregate acquisition cost for such goods, excluding the VAT component thereof, exceeds One million pesos (P1,000,000.00):  <i>Provided,</i> however, That if the estimated useful life of the capital goods is less than five (5) years, as used for depreciation purposes, then the input VAT shall be spread over such a shorter period: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That in the case of purchase of services, lease or use of properties, the input tax shall be creditable to the purchaser, lessee or license upon payment of the compensation, rental, royalty or fee. </blockquote> The foregoing section imposes a 60-month period within which to amortize the creditable input tax on purchase or importation of capital goods with acquisition cost of P1 Million pesos, exclusive of the VAT component.  Such spread out only poses a delay in the crediting of the input tax.  Petitioners’ argument is without basis because the taxpayer is not permanently deprived of his privilege to credit the input tax.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that Congress admitted that the spread-out of the creditable input tax in this case amounts to a 4-year interest-free loan to the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>  In the same breath, Congress also justified its move by saying that the provision was designed to raise an annual revenue of 22.6 billion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  The legislature also dispelled the fear that the provision will fend off foreign investments, saying that foreign investors have other tax incentives provided by law, and citing the case of China, where despite a 17.5% non-creditable VAT, foreign investments were not deterred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>   Again, for whatever is the purpose of the 60-month amortization, this involves executive economic policy and legislative wisdom in which the Court cannot intervene.<br><br>With regard to the 5% creditable withholding tax imposed on payments made by the government for taxable transactions, Section 12 of R.A. No. 9337, which amended Section 114 of the NIRC, reads: <blockquote> SEC. 114.  Return and Payment of Value-added Tax. –<br><br>(C)  Withholding of Value-added Tax. – The Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof:  Provided, That the payment for lease or use of properties or property rights to nonresident owners shall be subject to ten percent (10%) withholding tax at the time of payment.  For purposes of this Section, the payor or person in control of the payment shall be considered as the withholding agent.<br><br>The value-added tax withheld under this Section shall be remitted within ten (10) days following the end of the month the withholding was made. </blockquote> Section 114(C) merely provides a method of collection, or as stated by respondents, a more simplified VAT withholding system.  The government in this case is constituted as a withholding agent with respect to their payments for goods and services.<br><br>Prior to its amendment, Section 114(C) provided for different rates of value-added taxes to be withheld -- 3% on gross payments for purchases of goods; 6% on gross payments for services supplied by contractors other than by public works contractors; 8.5% on gross payments for services supplied by public work contractors; or 10% on payment for the lease or use of properties or property rights to nonresident owners.  Under the present Section 114(C), these different rates, except for the 10% on lease or property rights payment to nonresidents, were deleted, and a uniform rate of 5% is applied.<br><br>The Court observes, however, that the law the used the word final.  In tax usage, <i>final</i>, as opposed to creditable, means full.  Thus, it is provided in Section 114(C): “<i>final</i> value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%).”<br><br>In Revenue Regulations No. 02-98, implementing R.A. No. 8424 (The Tax Reform Act of 1997), the concept of final withholding tax on income was explained, to wit: <blockquote> SECTION 2.57.  Withholding of Tax at Source<br><br>(A)  Final Withholding Tax. – Under the final withholding tax system the amount of income tax withheld by the withholding agent is constituted as <u><b>full and final payment</b></u> of the income tax due from the payee on the said income.  The liability for payment of the tax rests primarily on the payor as a withholding agent.  Thus, in case of his failure to withhold the tax or in case of underwithholding, the deficiency tax shall be collected from the payor/withholding agent. …<br><br>(B)  Creditable Withholding Tax. – Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are intended to equal or at least approximate the tax due of the payee on said income.  … Taxes withheld on income payments covered by the expanded withholding tax (referred to in Sec. 2.57.2 of these regulations) and compensation income (referred to in Sec. 2.78 also of these regulations) are creditable in nature. </blockquote> As applied to value-added tax, this means that taxable transactions with the government are subject to a 5% rate, which constitutes as full payment of the tax payable on the transaction.  This represents the net VAT payable of the seller.  The other 5% effectively accounts for the standard input VAT (deemed input VAT), in lieu of   the actual input VAT directly or attributable to the taxable transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The Court need not explore the rationale behind the provision.  It is clear that Congress intended to treat differently taxable transactions with the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  This is supported by the fact that under the old provision, the 5% tax withheld by the government remains creditable against the tax liability of the seller or contractor, to wit: <blockquote> SEC. 114.  Return and Payment of Value-added Tax. –<br><br>(C)  <b>Withholding of <u>Creditable</u> Value-added Tax.</b> – The Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods from sellers and services rendered by contractors which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold the value-added tax due at the rate of three percent (3%) of the gross payment for the purchase of goods and six percent (6%) on gross receipts for services rendered by contractors on every sale or installment payment which shall be <b><u>creditable against the value-added tax liability of the seller or contractor</u></b>:  Provided, however, That in the case of government public works contractors, the withholding rate shall be eight and one-half percent (8.5%):  Provided, further, That the payment for lease or use of properties or property rights to nonresident owners shall be subject to ten percent (10%) withholding tax at the time of payment.  For this purpose, the payor or person in control of the payment shall be considered as the withholding agent.<br><br>The valued-added tax withheld under this Section shall be remitted within ten (10) days following the end of the month the withholding was made. (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> As amended, the use of the word <i>final</i> and the deletion of the word <i>creditable</i> exhibits Congress’s intention to treat transactions with the government differently.  Since it has not been shown that the class subject to the 5% final withholding tax has been unreasonably narrowed, there is no reason to invalidate the provision.  Petitioners, as petroleum dealers, are not the only ones subjected to the 5% final withholding tax.  It applies to all those who deal with the government.<br><br>Moreover, the actual input tax is not totally lost or uncreditable, as petitioners believe.  Revenue Regulations No. 14-2005 or the Consolidated Value-Added Tax Regulations 2005 issued by the BIR, provides that should the actual input tax exceed 5% of gross payments, the excess may form part of the cost.  Equally, should the actual input tax be less than 5%, the difference is treated as income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also argue that by imposing a limitation on the creditable input tax, the government gets to tax a profit or value-added even if there is no profit or value-added.<br><br>Petitioners’ stance is purely hypothetical, argumentative, and again, one-sided.  The Court will not engage in a legal joust where premises are what ifs, arguments, theoretical and facts, uncertain.  Any disquisition by the Court on this point will only be, as Shakespeare describes life in <i>Macbeth</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”<br><br>What’s more, petitioners’ contention assumes the proposition that there is no profit or value-added.  It need not take an astute businessman to know that it is a matter of exception that a business will sell goods or services without profit or value-added.  It cannot be overstressed that a business is created precisely for profit.<br><br>The equal protection clause under the Constitution means that “no person or class of persons shall be deprived of the same protection of laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and in like circumstances.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The power of the State to make reasonable and natural classifications for the purposes of taxation has long been established.  Whether it relates to the subject of taxation, the kind of property, the rates to be levied, or the amounts to be raised, the methods of assessment, valuation and collection, the State’s power is entitled to presumption of validity.  As a rule, the judiciary will not interfere with such power absent a clear showing of unreasonableness, discrimination, or arbitrariness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Petitioners point out that the limitation on the creditable input tax if the entity has a high ratio of input tax, or invests in capital equipment, or has several transactions with the government, is not based on real and substantial differences to meet a valid classification.<br><br>The argument is pedantic, if not outright baseless.  The law does not make any classification in the subject of taxation, the kind of property, the rates to be levied or the amounts to be raised, the methods of assessment, valuation and collection.  Petitioners’ alleged distinctions are based on variables that bear different consequences. While the implementation of the law may yield varying end results depending on one’s profit margin and value-added, the Court cannot go beyond what the legislature has laid down and interfere with the affairs of business.<br><br>The equal protection clause does not require the universal application of the laws on all persons or things without distinction. This might in fact sometimes result in unequal protection. What the clause requires is equality among equals as determined according to a valid classification.

The proposed legislation seeks to amend the 70% limitation by increasing the same to 90%.  This, according to petitioners, supports their stance that the 70% limitation is arbitrary and confiscatory.  On this score, suffice it to say that these are still proposed legislations.  Until Congress amends the law, and absent any unequivocal basis for its unconstitutionality, the 70% limitation stays.<br><br><i>B.

The Congress shall evolve a progressive system of taxation. </blockquote> Uniformity in taxation means that all taxable articles or kinds of property of the same class shall be taxed at the same rate.  Different articles may be taxed at different amounts provided that the rate is uniform on the same class everywhere with all people at all times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In this case, the tax law is uniform as it provides a standard rate of 0% or 10% (or 12%) on all goods and services.  Sections 4, 5 and 6 of R.A. No. 9337, amending Sections 106, 107 and 108, respectively, of the NIRC, provide for a rate of 10% (or 12%) on sale of goods and properties, importation of goods, and sale of services and use or lease of properties.  These same sections also provide for a 0% rate on certain sales and transaction.<br><br>Neither does the law make any distinction as to the type of industry or trade that will bear the 70% limitation on the creditable input tax, 5-year amortization of input tax paid on purchase of capital goods or the 5% final withholding tax by the government.  It must be stressed that the rule of uniform taxation does not deprive Congress of the power to classify subjects of taxation, and only demands uniformity within the particular class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>R.A. No. 9337 is also equitable.  The law is equipped with a threshold margin.  The VAT rate of 0% or 10% (or 12%) does not apply to sales of goods or services with gross annual sales or receipts not exceeding P1,500,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>   Also, basic marine and agricultural food products in their original state are still not subject to the tax,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> thus ensuring that prices at the grassroots   level will remain accessible.  As was stated in <i>Kapatiran ng mga Naglilingkod sa Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas, Inc. vs. Tan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> <blockquote> The disputed sales tax is also equitable. It is imposed only on sales of goods or services by persons engaged in business with an aggregate gross annual sales exceeding P200,000.00. Small corner sari-sari stores are consequently exempt from its application. Likewise exempt from the tax are sales of farm and marine products, so that the costs of basic food and other necessities, spared as they are from the incidence of the VAT, are expected to be relatively lower and within the reach of the general public. </blockquote> It is admitted that R.A. No. 9337 puts a premium on businesses with low profit margins, and unduly favors those with high profit margins.  Congress was not oblivious to this. Thus, to equalize the weighty burden the law entails, the law, under Section 116, imposed a 3% percentage tax on VAT-exempt persons under Section 109(v),<i> i.e.,</i> transactions with gross annual sales and/or receipts not exceeding P1.5 Million.  This acts as a equalizer because in effect, bigger businesses that qualify for VAT coverage and VAT-exempt taxpayers stand on equal-footing.<br><br>Moreover, Congress provided mitigating measures to cushion the impact of the imposition of the tax on those previously exempt.  Excise taxes on petroleum products<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> and natural gas<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> were reduced.  Percentage tax on domestic carriers was removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>  Power producers are now exempt from paying franchise tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Aside from these, Congress also increased the income tax rates of corporations, in order to distribute the burden of taxation.   Domestic, foreign, and non-resident corporations are now subject to a 35% income tax rate, from a previous 32%.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>  Intercorporate dividends of non-resident foreign corporations are still subject to 15% final withholding tax but the tax credit allowed on the corporation’s domicile was increased to 20%.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>  The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) is not exempt from income taxes anymore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>  Even the sale by an artist of his works or services performed for the production of such works was not spared.<br><br>All these were designed to ease, as well as spread out, the burden of taxation, which would otherwise rest largely on the consumers.  It cannot therefore be gainsaid that R.A. No. 9337 is equitable.<br><br><i>C. Progressivity of Taxation</i><br><br>Lastly, petitioners contend that the limitation on the creditable input tax is anything but regressive.   It is the smaller business with higher input tax-output tax ratio that will suffer the consequences.<br><br>Progressive taxation is built on the principle of the taxpayer’s ability to pay.   This principle was also lifted from Adam Smith’s <i>Canons of Taxation</i>, and it states: <ol type="I"><blockquote> <li>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. </li></blockquote></ol> Taxation is progressive when its rate goes up depending on the resources of the person affected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>The VAT is an antithesis of progressive taxation.  By its very nature, it is regressive.  The principle of progressive taxation has no relation with the VAT system inasmuch as the VAT paid by the consumer or business for every goods bought or services enjoyed is the same regardless of income.  In other words, the VAT paid eats the same portion of an income, whether big or small.  The disparity lies in the income earned by a person or profit margin marked by a business, such that the higher the income or profit margin, the smaller the portion of the income or profit that is eaten by VAT.  <i>A converso</i>, the lower the income or profit margin, the bigger the part that the VAT eats away.  At the end of the day, it is really the lower income group or businesses with low-profit margins that is always hardest hit.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Constitution does not really prohibit the imposition of indirect taxes, like the VAT.  What it simply provides is that Congress shall "evolve a progressive system of taxation."  The Court stated in the <i>Tolentino case</i>, thus: <blockquote> The Constitution does not really prohibit the imposition of indirect taxes which, like the VAT, are regressive. What it simply provides is that Congress shall ‘evolve a progressive system of taxation.’ The constitutional provision has been interpreted to mean simply that ‘direct taxes are . . . to be preferred [and] as much as possible, indirect taxes should be minimized.’  (E. FERNANDO, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES 221 (Second ed. 1977)) Indeed, the mandate to Congress is not to prescribe, but to evolve, a progressive tax system. Otherwise, sales taxes, which perhaps are the oldest form of indirect taxes, would have been prohibited with the proclamation of Art. VIII, §17 (1) of the 1973 Constitution from which the present Art. VI, §28 (1) was taken. Sales taxes are also regressive.<br><br>Resort to indirect taxes should be minimized but not avoided entirely because it is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid them by imposing such taxes according to the taxpayers' ability to pay. In the case of the VAT, the law minimizes the regressive effects of this imposition by providing for zero rating of certain transactions (R.A. No. 7716, §3, amending §102 (b) of the NIRC), while granting exemptions to other transactions. (R.A. No. 7716, §4 amending §103 of the NIRC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> </blockquote> <div style="text-align: center;"><b>CONCLUSION</b><br></div><br>It has been said that taxes are the lifeblood of the government.  In this case, it is just an enema, a first-aid measure to resuscitate an economy in distress.  The Court is neither blind nor is it turning a deaf ear on the plight of the masses.  But it does not have the panacea for the malady that the law seeks to remedy.  As in other cases, the Court cannot strike down a law as unconstitutional simply because of its yokes. <blockquote> Let us not be overly influenced by the plea that for every wrong there is a remedy, and that the judiciary should stand ready to afford relief. There are undoubtedly many wrongs the judicature may not correct, for instance, those involving political questions.  . . .<br><br>Let us likewise disabuse our minds from the notion that the judiciary is the repository of remedies for all political or social ills; We should not forget that the Constitution has judiciously allocated the powers of government to three distinct and separate compartments; and that judicial interpretation has tended to the preservation of the independence of the three, and a zealous regard of the prerogatives of each, knowing full well that one is not the guardian of the others and that, for official wrong-doing, each may be brought to account, either by impeachment, trial or by the ballot box.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> </blockquote> The words of the Court in Vera vs. Avelino<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> holds true then, as it still holds true now.

Thus, I concur with the ponencia of my highly-esteemed colleague Mme. Justice Ma. Alicia Austria-Martinez except as regards its ruling on the issue of whether Republic Act No. 9337 violates Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution.<br><br>R.A. No. 9337 primarily aims to restructure the value-added tax (VAT) system by broadening its base and raising the rate so as to generate more revenues for the government that can assuage the economic predicament that our country is now facing.  This recently enacted law stemmed from three legislative bills: House Bill (HB) No. 3555, HB No. 3705, and Senate Bill (SB) 1950.  The first (HB No. 3555) called for the amendment of Sections 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, and 111 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) as amended; while the second (HB No. 3705) proposed amendments to Sections 106, 107, 108, 110, and 114 of the NIRC, as amended.  It is significant to note that all these Sections specifically deal with VAT.  And indubitably, these bills are revenue bills in that they are intended to levy taxes and raise funds for the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, SB No. 1950 introduced amendments to “Sections 27, 28, 34, 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 117, 118, 119, 125, 148, 236, 237, and 288” of the NIRC, as amended.  Among the provisions sought to be amended, only Sections 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, and 116 pertain to VAT.  And while Sections 236, 237, and 288 are administrative provisions pertaining to registration requirements and issuance of receipts commercial invoices, the proposed amendments thereto are related to VAT.  Hence, the proposed amendments to these Sections were validly taken cognizance of and properly considered by the Bicameral Conference Committee (BCC).<br><br>However, I am of the opinion that the inclusion into the law of the amendments proposed in SB No. 1950 to the following provisions (with modifications on the rates of taxes) is invalid.<br><br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="30%"><div align="center">Provision</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="70%"> <div align="center">Subject matter</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 27</td> <td>Rate of income tax on domestic corporations</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 28(A)(1)</td> <td>Rate of income tax on resident foreign corporation</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 28(B)(1)</td> <td>Rate of income tax on non-resident foreign corporation</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 28(B)(5-b)</td> <td>Rate of income tax on intra-corporate dividends received by non-resident foreign corporation</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 34(B)(1)</td> <td>Deductions from gross income</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 117 </td> <td>Percentage tax on domestic carriers  and keepers of garages</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 119</td> <td> Tax on franchises</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 148</td> <td>Excise tax on manufactured oils and other fuels</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Obviously, these provisions do not deal with VAT.  It must be noted that the House Bills initiated amendments to provisions pertaining to VAT only.   Doubtless, the Senate has the constitutional power to concur with the amendments to the VAT provisions introduced in the House Bills or even to propose its own version of VAT measure.  But that power does not extend to initiation of other tax measures, such as introducing amendments to provisions on corporate income taxes, percentage taxes, franchise taxes, and excise taxes like what the Senate did in these cases. It was beyond the ambit of the authority of the Senate to propose amendments to provisions not covered by the House Bills or not related to the subject matter of the House Bills, which is VAT.  To allow the Senate to do so would be tantamount to vesting in it the power to initiate revenue bills -- a power that exclusively pertains to the House of Representatives under Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution, which provides: <br><blockquote>Sec. 24.  All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.<br></blockquote>Moreover, Sections 121 (Percentage Tax on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries) and 151 (Excise Tax on Mineral Products) of the NIRC, as amended, have been included by the BCC in R.A. N0. 9337 even though they were not found in the Senate and House Bills.<br><br>In <i>Philippine Judges Association v. Prado</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Court described the function of a conference committee in this wise: “A conference committee may deal generally with the subject matter or it may be limited to resolving the precise differences between the two houses.  Even where the conference committee is not by rule limited in its jurisdiction, legislative custom<b> severely limits the freedom with which new subject matter can be inserted into the conference bill.”</b><br><br>The limitation on the power of a conference committee to insert new provisions was laid down in <i>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  There, the Court, while recognizing the power of a conference committee to include in its report an entirely new provision that is not found either in the House bill or in the Senate bill, held that the exercise of that power is subject to the condition that the said provision is <b>“germane to the subject of the House and Senate bills.”</b><br><br>As pointed out by the petitioners, Tolentino differs from the present cases in the sense that in that case the amendments introduced in the Senate bill were on the <b>same subject matter</b> treated in the House bill, which was VAT, and the new provision inserted by the conference committee had relation to that subject matter.  Specifically, HB No. 11197 called for the (1) amendment of Sections 99,100,102,103,104,105,106,107, 108, 110, 112,115, 116, 236,237, and 238 of the NIRC, as amended; and (2) repeal of Sections 113 and 114 of the NIRC, as amended.  SB No. 1630, on the other hand, proposed the (1) amendment of Sections 99,100,102,103,104,105,107, 108, 110, 112, 236, 237, and 238 of the NIRC, as amended; and (2) repeal of Sections 113, 114, and 116 of the NIRC, as amended.  In short, all the provisions sought to be changed in the Senate bill were covered in the House bill.   Although the new provisions inserted by the conference committee were not found in either the House or Senate bills, they were germane to the general subject of the bills.<br><br>In the present cases, the provisions inserted by the BCC, namely, Sections 121 (Percentage Tax on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries) and 151 (Excise Tax on Mineral Products) of the NIRC, as amended, are undoubtedly germane to SB No. 1950, which introduced amendments to the provisions on percentage and excise taxes -- but foreign to HB Nos. 3555 and 3705, which dealt with VAT only.  Since the proposed amendments in the Senate bill relating to percentage and excise taxes cannot themselves be sustained because they did not take their root from, or are not related to the subject of, HB Nos. 3705 and 3555, in violation of Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution, the new provisions inserted by the BCC on percentage and excise taxes would have no leg to stand on.<br><br>I understand very well that the amendments of the Senate and the BCC relating to corporate income, percentage, franchise, and excise taxes were designed to “soften the impact of VAT measure on the consumer, i.e., by distributing the burden across all sectors instead of putting it entirely on the shoulders of the consumers” and to alleviate the country’s financial problems by bringing more revenues for the government.  However, these commendable intentions do not justify a deviation from the Constitution, which mandates that the initiative for filing revenue bills should come from the House of Representatives, not from the Senate.  After all, these aims may still be realized by means of another bill that may later be initiated by the House of Representatives.<br><br>Therefore, I vote to declare R.A. No. 9337 as <b>constitutional</b> insofar as it amends provisions pertaining to VAT.  However, I vote to declare as unconstitutional Sections 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 thereof which, respectively, amend Sections 27, 28, 34, 117, 119, 121, 148, and 151 of the NIRC, as amended because these amendments deal with subject matters which were not touched or covered by the bills emanating from the House of Representatives, thereby violating Section 24 of Article VI of the Constitution.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Tolentino v.

Be that as it may, I wish to raise the following points, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><b>First. </b>Petitioners assail sections 4 to 6 of Republic Act No. 9337 as violative of the principle of non-delegation of legislative power. These sections authorize the President, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Finance, to raise the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 12% <b>effective January 1, 2006</b>, upon satisfaction of the following conditions:  <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> (i) Value-added tax collection as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the previous year exceeds two and four-fifth percent (2 4/5%); or<br><br>(ii) National government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%)<br></blockquote>The power of judicial review under Article VIII, section 5(2) of the 1987 Constitution is limited to the review of "<b>actual cases and controversies</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><b> </b>As rightly stressed by retired Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, this requirement gives the judiciary "the opportunity, denied to the legislature, of seeing the actual operation of the statute as it is applied to actual facts and thus enables it to reach sounder judgment" and "enhances public acceptance of its role in our system of government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It also assures that the judiciary does not intrude on areas committed to the other branches of government and is confined to its role as defined by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Apposite thereto is the doctrine of <b>ripeness</b> whose basic rationale is "to prevent the courts, through <b>premature adjudication</b>, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Central to the doctrine is the determination of "whether the case involves <b>uncertain or contingent future events </b>that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The ripeness requirement must be satisfied for <b>each challenged legal provision</b> and parts of a statute so that those which are "not <b>immediately involved </b>are not thereby thrown open for a judicial determination of constitutionality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>It is manifest that the constitutional challenge to sections 4 to 6 of R.A. No. 9337 cannot hurdle the requirement of ripeness.  <b>These sections give the President the power to raise the VAT rate to 12% on January 1, 2006 upon satisfaction of certain fact-based conditions.  </b>We are not endowed with the infallible gift of prophesy to know whether these conditions are certain to happen. The power to adjust the tax rate given to the President is futuristic and may or may not be exercised.  The Court is therefore beseeched to render a conjectural judgment based on hypothetical facts.  Such a supplication has to be rejected.<br><br><b>Second.</b>  With due respect, I submit that the most important constitutional issue posed by the petitions at bar relates to the <b>parameters of power of a Bicameral Conference Committee.  </b>Most of the issues in the petitions at bar arose because the Bicameral Conference Committee concerned exercised powers that went beyond reconciling the <b>differences</b> between Senate Bill No. 1950 and House Bill Nos. 3705 and 3555.  In <b>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><b> </b>I ventured the view that a Bicameral Conference Committee has <b>limited powers</b> and cannot be allowed to act as if it were a "<b>third house</b>" of Congress.  I further warned that unless its <b>roving powers </b>are reigned in, a Bicameral Conference Committee can wreck the lawmaking process which is a cornerstone of the democratic, republican regime established in our Constitution.  The passage of time fortifies my faith that there ought to be no legal u-turn on this preeminent principle.  I wish, therefore, to reiterate my reasons for this unbending view, <i>viz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><blockquote> Section 209, Rule XII of the Rules of the Senate provides:<br><blockquote> In the event that the Senate does not agree with the House of Representatives on the provision of any bill or joint resolution, <i>the differences shall be settled by a conference committee of both Houses </i>which shall meet within ten days after their composition.<br><br>Each Conference Committee Report shall contain a detailed and sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject measure, and shall be signed by the conferees.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The counterpart rule of  the House of Representatives is cast in near identical language. Section 85 of the Rules of the House of Representatives pertinently provides:<br><blockquote> <i>In the event that the House does not agree with the Senate on the amendments to any bill or joint resolution, the differences may be settled by a conference committee of both chambers.</i><br><br>x x x.   Each report shall contain a detailed, sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject measure. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Jefferson's Manual has been adopted as a supplement to our parliamentary rules and practice. Section 456 of Jefferson's Manual similarly confines the powers of a conference committee, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> The managers of a conference must confine themselves to the differences committed to them ... and may not include subjects not within the disagreements, even though germane to a question in issue.<br></blockquote>This rule of antiquity has been honed and honored in practice by the Congress of the United States. Thus, it is chronicled by Floyd Biddick, Parliamentarian Emeritus of the United States Senate, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> Committees of conference are appointed for the <i>sole purpose of compromising and adjusting the differing and conflicting opinions of the two Houses</i> and the committees of conference alone can grant  compromises and modify propositions of either Houses within the limits of the disagreement. Conferees are limited to the consideration of differences between the two Houses.<br><br><i>Congress shall not insert in their report matters not committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from the bill matters agreed to by both Houses</i>.  No matter on which there is nothing in either the Senate or House passed versions of a bill may be included in the conference report and actions to the contrary would subject the report to a point of order.  (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In fine, there is neither a sound nor a syllable in the Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives to support the thesis of the respondents that a bicameral conference committee is clothed with an <i>ex post </i>veto power.<br><br>But the thesis that a Bicameral Conference Committee can wield <i>ex post</i> veto power does not only contravene the rules of both the Senate and the House. It wages war against our settled ideals of representative democracy. For the inevitable, catastrophic effect of the thesis is to install a Bicameral Conference Committee as the Third Chamber of our Congress, <i>similarly </i>vested with the power to make laws but with the <i>dissimilarity </i>that its laws are not the subject of a free and full discussion of both Houses of Congress.  With such a vagrant power, a Bicameral Conference Committee acting as a Third Chamber will be a constitutional monstrosity.<br><br>It needs no omniscience to perceive that our Constitution did not provide for a Congress composed of three chambers. On the contrary, section 1, Article VI of the Constitution provides in clear and certain language: "The legislative power <i>shall </i>be vested in the Congress of the Philippines which <i>shall </i>consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives ..." Note that in vesting legislative power exclusively to the Senate and the House, the Constitution  used the word "shall."  Its command for a Congress of two houses is mandatory. It is not mandatory sometimes.<br><br>In vesting legislative power to the Senate, the Constitution means the Senate "... composed of twenty-four Senators xxx elected at large by the qualified voters of the Philippines ..."  Similarly, when the Constitution vested the legislative power to the House, it means the House "... composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members xxx who shall be elected from legislative districts xxx and those who xxx shall  be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations." The Constitution thus, did not vest on a Bicameral Conference Committee with an <i>ad hoc </i>membership the power to legislate for it exclusively vested legislative power to the Senate and the House as co-equal bodies.  To be sure, the Constitution does not mention the Bicameral Conference Committees of Congress. No constitutional status is accorded to them. They are not even statutory creations. They owe their existence from the internal rules of the two Houses of Congress. Yet, respondents peddle the disconcerting idea that they should be recognized as a Third Chamber of Congress and with <i>ex post </i>veto power at that.<br><br>The thesis that a Bicameral Conference Committee can exercise law making power with <i>ex post </i>veto power is freighted with mischief.  Law making is a power that can be used for good or for ill, hence, our Constitution carefully laid out a plan and a procedure for its exercise. Firstly, it vouchsafed that the power to make laws should be exercised by no other body except the Senate and the House.  It ought to be indubitable that what is contemplated is the Senate acting as a full Senate and the House acting as a full House. It is only when the Senate and the House act as whole bodies that they truly represent the people.  And it is only when they represent the people that they can legitimately pass laws.  Laws that are not enacted by the people's rightful representatives subvert the people's sovereignty. Bicameral Conference Committees, with their <i>ad hoc</i> character and limited membership, cannot pass laws for they do not represent the people. The Constitution does not allow the tyranny of the majority. Yet, the respondents will impose the worst kind of tyranny - the tyranny of the minority over the majority. Secondly, the Constitution delineated in deft strokes the steps to be followed in making laws.  The overriding purpose of these procedural rules is to assure that only bills that successfully survive the searching scrutiny of the proper committees of Congress and the full and unfettered deliberations of both Houses can become laws. For this reason, a bill has to undergo three (3) mandatory separate readings in each House. In the case at bench, the additions and deletions made by the Bicameral Conference Committee did not enjoy the enlightened studies of appropriate committees. It is meet to note that the complexities of modern day legislations have made our committee system a significant part of the legislative process.  Thomas Reed called the committee system as "the eye, the ear, the hand, and very often the brain of the house." President Woodrow Wilson of the United States once referred to the government  of the United States as "a government by the Chairmen of the Standing Committees of Congress ..."  Neither did these additions and deletions of the Bicameral Conference Committee pass through the coils of collective deliberation of the members of the two Houses acting separately. Due to this shortcircuiting of the constitutional procedure of making laws, confusion shrouds the enactment of R.A. No. 7716.  Who inserted the additions and deletions remains a mystery. Why they were inserted is a riddle. To use a Churchillian phrase, lawmaking should not be a riddle wrapped in an enigma. It cannot be, for Article II, section 28 of the Constitution mandates the State to adopt and implement a "policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest." The Constitution could not have contemplated a Congress of invisible and unaccountable John and Mary Does.  A law whose rationale is a riddle and whose authorship is obscure cannot bind the people.<br><br>All these notwithstanding, respondents resort to the legal cosmetology that these additions and deletions should govern the people as laws because the Bicameral Conference Committee Report was anyway submitted to and approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The submission may have some merit with respect to provisions agreed upon by the Committee in the process of reconciling conflicts between S.B. No. 1630 and H.B. No. 11197.  In these instances, the conflicting provisions had been previously screened by the proper committees, deliberated upon by both Houses and approved by them.  It is, however, a different matter with respect to additions and deletions which were entirely new and which were made not to reconcile inconsistencies between S.B. No. 1630 and H.B. No. 11197.  The members of the Bicameral Conference Committee did not have any authority to add new provisions or delete provisions already approved by both Houses as it was not necessary to discharge their limited task of reconciling differences in bills.  At that late stage of law making, the Conference Committee cannot add/delete provisions which can become laws without undergoing the study and deliberation of both chambers given to bills on 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> readings. Even the Senate and the House cannot enact a law which will not undergo these mandatory three (3) readings required by the Constitution.  If the Senate and the House cannot enact such a law, neither can the lesser Bicameral Conference Committee.<br><br>Moreover, the so-called choice given to the members of  both Houses to either approve or disapprove the said additions and deletions is more of an optical illusion. These additions and deletions are not submitted separately for approval.  They are tucked to the entire bill. The vote is on the bill as a package, <i>i.e., </i>together with the insertions and deletions.  And the vote is either "aye" or "nay," without any further debate and deliberation.  Quite often, legislators vote "yes" because they approve of the bill as a whole although they may object to its amendments by the Conference Committee. This lack of real choice is well observed by Robert Luce:<br><blockquote> Their power lies chiefly in the fact that reports of conference committees must be accepted without amendment or else rejected <i>in toto</i>.  The impulse is to get done with the matter and so the motion to accept has undue advantage, for some members are sure to prefer swallowing unpalatable provisions rather than prolong controversy. This is the more likely if the report comes in the rush of business toward the end of a session, when to seek further conference might result in the loss of the measure altogether. At any time in the session there is some risk of such a result following the rejection of a conference report, for it may not be possible to secure a second conference, or delay may give opposition to the main proposal chance to develop more strength.<br></blockquote>In a similar vein, Prof. Jack Davies commented that "conference reports are returned to assembly and Senate on a take-it or leave-it-basis, and the bodies are generally placed in the position that to leave-it is a practical impossibility."  Thus, he concludes that "conference committee action is the most undemocratic procedure in the legislative process."<br><br>The respondents also contend that the additions and deletions made by the Bicameral Conference Committee were in accord with legislative customs and usages. The argument does not persuade for it misappreciates the value of customs and usages in the hierarchy of sources of legislative rules of procedure. To be sure, every legislative assembly has the inherent right to promulgate its own internal rules.  In our jurisdiction, Article VI, section 16(3) of the Constitution provides that "Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings x x x."  But it is hornbook law that the sources of Rules of Procedure are many and hierarchical in character. Mason laid them down as follows:<br><blockquote> x x x <ol> <li>Rules of Procedure are derived from several sources. The principal sources are as follows:<br><br>a.      Constitutional rules.<br>b.     Statutory rules or charter provisions.<br>c.      Adopted rules.<br>d.     Judicial decisions.<br>e.      Adopted parliamentary authority.<br>f.      Parliamentary law.<br>g.      <i>Customs and usages.</i><br><br></li><li><i>The rules from the different sources take precedence in the order listed above </i>except that judicial decisions, since they are interpretations of rules from one of the other sources, take the same precedence as the source interpreted. Thus, for example, an interpretation of a constitutional provision takes precedence over a statute.<br><br></li><li><i>Whenever there is conflict between rules from these sources the rule from the source listed earlier prevails over the rule from the source listed later</i>.  Thus, where the Constitution requires three readings of bills, this provision controls over any provision of statute, adopted rules, adopted manual, or of parliamentary law, and a rule of parliamentary law controls over a local usage but must give way to any rule from a higher source of authority.  (Emphasis ours)<br></li></ol></blockquote>As discussed above, the unauthorized additions and deletions made by the Bicameral Conference Committee violated the procedure fixed by the Constitution in the making of laws.  It is reasonless for respondents therefore to justify these insertions as sanctioned by customs and usages.<br><br>Finally, respondents seek sanctuary in the conclusiveness of  an enrolled bill to bar any judicial inquiry on whether Congress observed our constitutional procedure in the passage of R.A. No. 7716.  The enrolled bill theory is a historical relic that should not continuously rule us from the fossilized past. It should be immediately emphasized that the enrolled bill theory originated in England where there is no written constitution and where Parliament is supreme.  In this jurisdiction, we have a written constitution and the legislature is a body of limited powers. Likewise, it must be pointed out that starting from the decade of the 40s, even American courts have veered away from the rigidity and unrealism of the conclusiveness of an enrolled bill.  Prof. Sutherland observed:<br><blockquote> x x x<br><br>Where the failure of constitutional compliance in the enactment of statutes is not discoverable from the face of the act itself but may be demonstrated by recourse to the legislative journals, debates, committee reports or papers of the governor, courts have used several conflicting theories with which to dispose of the issue.  They have held:  (1) that the enrolled bill is conclusive and like the sheriff's return cannot be attacked; (2) that the enrolled bill is <i>prima facie </i>correct and only in case the legislative journal shows affirmative contradiction of the constitutional requirement will the bill be held invalid; (3) that although the enrolled bill is <i>prima facie </i>correct, evidence from the journals, or other extrinsic sources is admissible to strike the bill down; (4)  that the legislative journal is conclusive and the enrolled bills is valid only if it accords with the recital in the journal and the constitutional procedure.<br></blockquote>Various jurisdictions have adopted these alternative approaches in view of strong dissent and dissatisfaction against the philosophical underpinnings of the conclusiveness of an enrolled bill. Prof. Sutherland further observed:<br><blockquote> x x x.  Numerous reasons have been given for this rule. Traditionally, an enrolled bill was "a record" and as such was not subject to attack at common law.  Likewise, the rule of conclusiveness was similar to the common law rule of the inviolability of the sheriff's return. Indeed, they had the same origin, that is, the sheriff was an officer of the king and likewise the parliamentary act was a regal act and no official might dispute the king's word. Transposed to our democratic system of government, courts held that as the legislature was an official branch of government the court must indulge every presumption that the legislative act was valid. The doctrine of separation of powers was advanced as a strong reason why the court should treat the acts of a co-ordinate branch of government with the same respect as it treats the action of its own officers; indeed, it was thought that it was entitled to even greater respect, else the court might be in the position of reviewing the work of a supposedly equal branch of government. When these arguments failed, as they frequently did, the doctrine of convenience was advanced, that is, that it was not only an undue burden upon the legislature to preserve its records to meet the attack of persons not affected by the procedure of enactment, but also that it unnecessarily complicated litigation and confused the trial of substantive issues.<br><br>Although many of these arguments are persuasive and are indeed the basis for the rule in many states today, they are not invulnerable to attack. The rule most relied on – the sheriff's return or sworn official rule – did not in civil litigation deprive the injured party of an action, for always he could sue the sheriff upon his official bond. Likewise, although collateral attack was not permitted, direct attack permitted raising the issue of fraud, and at a later date attack in equity was also available; and that the evidence of the sheriff was not of unusual weight was demonstrated by the fact that in an action against the sheriff no presumption of its authenticity prevailed.<br><br>The argument that the enrolled bill is a "record" and therefore unimpeachable is likewise misleading, for the correction of records is a matter of established judicial procedure.  Apparently, the justification is either the historical one that the king's word could not be questioned or the separation of powers principle that one branch of the government must treat as valid the acts of another.<br><br><i>Persuasive as these arguments are, the tendency today is to avoid reaching results by artificial presumptions and thus it would seem desirable to insist that the enrolled bill stand or fall on the basis of the relevant evidence which may be submitted for or against it.</i>  (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Thus, as far back as the 1940s, Prof. Sutherland confirmed that "x x x the tendency seems to be toward the abandonment of the conclusive presumption rule and the adoption of the third rule leaving only a <i>prima facie</i> presumption of validity which may be attacked by any authoritative source of information.<br></blockquote><b>Third.</b>   I respectfully submit that it is <b>only by strictly </b>following the contours of powers of a Bicameral Conference Committee, <b>as delineated by the rules </b>of the House and the Senate, that <b>we can prevent </b>said Committee from acting as a <b>"third" chamber </b>of Congress.  Under the clear rules of both the Senate and House, <b>its power can go no further </b>than settling <b>differences </b>in their bills or joint resolutions.  Sections 88 and 89, Rule XIV of the <b>Rules of the House of Representatives </b>provide as follows:<br><blockquote> Sec. 88.  <i>Conference Committee</i>. - In the event that the House does not agree with the Senate on the amendment to any bill or joint resolution, the differences may be settled by the conference committees of both chambers.<br><br>In resolving the differences with the Senate, the House panel shall, as much as possible, adhere to and support the House Bill. If the differences with the Senate are so substantial that they materially impair the House Bill, the panel shall report such fact to the House for the latter's appropriate action.<br><br>Sec. 89.  <i>Conference Committee Reports</i>. - . . . Each report shall contain a detailed, sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject measure.<br><br>. . .<br><br>The Chairman of the House panel may be interpellated on the Conference Committee Report prior to the voting thereon.  The House shall vote on the Conference Committee Report in the same manner and procedure as it votes a bill on third and final reading.<br></blockquote>Section 35, Rule XII of the <b>Rules of the Senate </b>states: <br><blockquote>Sec. 35.  In the event that the Senate does not agree with the House of Representatives on the provision of any bill or joint resolution, the differences shall be settled by a conference committee of both Houses which shall meet within ten (10) days after their composition.  The President shall designate the members of the Senate Panel in the conference committee with the approval of the Senate.<br><br>Each Conference Committee Report shall contain a detailed and sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in, or amendments to the subject measure, and shall be signed by a majority of the members of each House panel, voting separately.<br></blockquote>The <b>House rule</b> brightlines the following:  (1)  the power of the Conference Committee is <b>limited</b> . . . it is only to settle <b>differences </b>with the Senate; (2)  if the differences are <b>substantial, </b>the Committee must report to the House for the latter's appropriate action; and (3)  the Committee report has to be voted upon in the same manner and procedure as a bill on third and final reading. Similarly, the <b>Senate rule</b> underscores in crimson that (1) the power of the Committee is <b>limited </b>- - - to settle <b>differences </b>with the House; (2)  it can make changes or amendments <b>only </b>in the discharge of this limited power to settle differences with the House; and (3) the changes or amendments are merely <b>recommendatory </b>for they still have to be approved by the Senate.<br><br><b>Under both rules</b>, it is obvious that a Bicameral Conference Committee is a mere <b>agent</b> of the House or the Senate with limited powers.  <b>The House contingent in the Committee cannot, on its own, settle differences which are substantial in character.</b>  If it is confronted with substantial differences, it has to go back to the chamber that created it "<b>for the latter's appropriate action</b>." In other words, it must take the proper instructions from the chambers that created it.  <b>It cannot exercise its unbridled discretion.  </b>Where there is <b>no difference </b>between the bills, it cannot make any change.  Where the <b>difference is substantial</b>, it has to return to the chamber of its origin and ask for appropriate instructions.  It ought to be indubitable that <b>it cannot create a new law</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, that which has never been discussed in either chamber of Congress.  <b>Its parameters of power are not porous</b>, for they are hedged by the clear limitation that its <b>only power</b> is to settle differences in bills and joint resolutions of the two chambers of Congress.<br><br><b>Fourth.</b>  Prescinding from these premises, I respectfully submit that the following acts of the Bicameral Conference Committee constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and should be struck down as unconstitutional nullities, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><b>a. </b>Its <b>deletion </b>of the <b>pro poor</b> "no pass on provision" which is <b>common</b> in both Senate Bill No. 1950 and House Bill No. 3705.<br><br>Sec. 1 of House Bill No. 3705<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote> Section 106 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><br>SEC. 106.

As aforediscussed, the <b>only power </b>of a Bicameral Conference Committee is to reconcile disagreeing provisions in the bills or joint resolutions of the two houses of Congress.  The House and the Senate bills <b>both </b>prohibited the passing on to consumers of the VAT on <b>sales of electricity.  </b>The Bicameral Conference <b>Committee cannot override this unequivocal decision of the Senate and the House.  </b>Nor is it clear that there is a conflict between the House and Senate versions on the "no pass on provisions" of the VAT on <b>sales of petroleum products.  </b>The House version contained a "no pass on provision" but the Senate had none. <b>Elementary logic will tell us that while there may be a difference in the two versions, it does not necessarily mean that there is a disagreement or conflict between the Senate and the House.  </b>The silence of the Senate on the issue cannot be interpreted as an <b>outright opposition </b>to the House decision prohibiting the passing on of the VAT to the consumers on sales of petroleum products. Silence can even be conformity, albeit implicit in nature.  But granting for the nonce that there is conflict between the two versions, the conflict cannot escape the characterization as a <b>substantial </b>difference.  The <b>seismic consequence </b>of the deletion of the "no pass on provision" of the VAT on sales of petroleum products <b>on the ability of our consumers</b>, especially on the roofless and the shirtless of our society, <b>to survive </b>the onslaught of spiraling prices ought to be beyond quibble.  The rules require that the Bicameral Conference Committee should not, on its own, act on this substantial conflict.  It has to seek guidance from the chamber that created it.  It must receive proper instructions from its principal, for it is the law of nature that no spring can rise higher than its source.  The records of both the Senate and the House do not reveal that this step was taken by the members of the Bicameral Conference Committee.  They bypassed their principal and ran riot with the exercise of powers that the rules never bestowed on them.<br><br><b>b.  </b>Even more <b>constitutionally obnoxious </b>are the <b>added restrictions on local government's use of incremental revenue from the VAT </b>in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9337 <b>which were not present in the Senate or House Bills. </b>Section 21 of R.A. No. 9337 provides:<br><blockquote> Fifty percent of the local government unit's share from VAT shall be allocated and used exclusively for the following purposes:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Fifteen percent (15%) for public elementary and secondary education to finance the construction of buildings, purchases of school furniture and in-service teacher trainings;<br><br></li><li>Ten percent (10%) for health insurance premiums of enrolled indigents as a counterpart contribution of the local government to sustain the universal coverage of the national health insurance program;<br><br></li><li>Fifteen percent (15%) for environmental conservation to fully implement a comprehensive national reforestation program; and<br><br></li><li>Ten percent (10%) for agricultural modernization to finance the construction of farm-to-market roads and irrigation facilities.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Such allocations shall be segregated as separate trust funds by the national treasury and shall be over and above the annual appropriation for similar purposes.<br></blockquote>These amendments <b>did not harmonize conflicting provisions </b>between the constituent bills of R.A. No. 9337 but are <b>entirely new </b>and <b>extraneous concepts</b> which fall beyond the median thereof. They transgress the limits of the Bicameral Conference Committee's authority and must be struck down.<br><br>I cannot therefore subscribe to the thesis of the majority that "the changes introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee on disagreeing provisions were meant only to reconcile and harmonize the disagreeing provisions <b>for it did not inject any idea or intent that is wholly foreign to the subject embraced by the original provisions.</b>"<br><br><b>Fifth.</b>  The majority further defends the constitutionality of the above provisions by holding that "all the changes or modifications were <b>germane</b> to subjects of the provisions referred to it for reconciliation."<br><br>With due respect, it is high time to <b>re-examine</b> the test of germaneness proffered in <b>Tolentino</b>.<br><br>The test of germaneness is <b>overly broad </b>and is the <b>fountainhead </b>of mischief for it allows the Bicameral Conference Committee to change provisions in the bills of the House and the Senate when they are not even in disagreement.  Worse still, it enables the Committee to introduce amendments which are entirely new and have not previously passed through the coils of scrutiny of the members of both houses. The Constitution did not establish a Bicameral Conference Committee that can act as a <b>"third house" </b>of Congress with <b>super veto power </b>over bills passed by the Senate and the House. We cannot concede that <b>super veto power </b>without wrecking the delicate architecture of legislative power so carefully laid down in our Constitution.  The clear intent of our fundamental law is to install a lawmaking <b>structure</b> composed only of two houses whose members would <b>thoroughly debate </b>proposed legislations in representation of the will of their respective constituents.

This, therefore, is the simple question: In the performance of its function of reconciling conflicting provisions, has the Committee blatantly violated the Constitution?<br><br>My short answer is: No, except those relating to income taxes referred to in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9337.  Let me explain.<br><br><b><i><u>Adopting the House<br>Version in Part or</u></i><u> in Toto</u></b><br><br><i>First,</i> the BCC had the option of adopting the House bills either in part or <i>in toto</i>, endorsing them without changes.  Since these bills had passed the three-reading requirement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> under the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> it readily becomes apparent that no procedural impediment would arise.

In so doing, the question of origination arises.  Under the 1987 Constitution, all “revenue x x x bills x x x shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>If the revenue bill originates exclusively from the Senate, then obviously the origination provision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the Constitution would be violated.  If, however, it originates exclusively from the House and presumably passes the three-reading requirement there, then the question to contend with is whether the Senate amendments complied with the “germane” principle.<br><br>While in the Senate, the House version may, per <i>Tolentino</i>, undergo extensive changes, such that the Senate may rewrite not only portions of it but even all of it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  I believe that such rewriting is limited by the “germane” principle: although “relevant”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> or “related”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> to the general subject of taxation, the Senate version is not necessarily “germane” all the time.  The “germane” principle requires a legal -- not necessarily an economic<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or political -- interpretation.  There must be an “inherent logical connection.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  What may be germane in an <i>economic or political sense </i>is not necessarily germane in the <i>legal sense</i>.  Otherwise, any provision in the Senate version that is entirely new and extraneous, or that is remotely or even slightly connected, to the vast and perplexing subject of taxation, would always be germane.  Under this interpretation, the origination principle would surely be rendered inutile.<br><br>To repeat, in <i>Tolentino,</i> the Court said that the Senate may even write its own version, which in effect would be an amendment by substitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The Court went further by saying that “the Constitution does not prohibit the filing in the Senate of a substitute bill in anticipation of its receipt of the bill from the House, so long as action by the Senate as a body is withheld pending receipt of the House bill.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  After all, the initiative for filing a revenue bill must come from the House<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> on the theory that, elected as its members are from their respective districts, the House is more sensitive to local needs and problems.  By contrast, the Senate whose members are elected at large approaches the matter from a national perspective,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> with a broader and more circumspect outlook.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Even if I have some reservations on the foregoing sweeping pronouncements in <i>Tolentino</i>, I shall not comment any further, because the BCC, in reconciling conflicting provisions, also did not take the second option of ignoring the House bills completely and of adopting only the Senate version in part or <i>in toto</i>.  Instead, the BCC used or applied the third option as will be discussed below.<br><br><i><b><u>Compromising<br>by Consolidating</u></b></i><br><br>As a <i>third </i>option, the BCC may reach a compromise by consolidating both the Senate and the House versions.  It can adopt some parts and reject other parts of both bills, and craft new provisions or even a substitute bill.  I believe this option is viable, provided that there is no violation of the origination and germane principles, as well as the three-reading rule.

What was delegated was only the power to ascertain the facts in order to bring the law into operation.   In  fact, there was really no “delegation’  to speak of; there was merely a declaration of an <i>administrative</i>, not a <i>legislative</i>, function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> in that there was no undue delegation of <i>legislative</i> power in the increase from 10 percent to 12 percent of the VAT rate.  I respectfully disagree, however, with the statements therein that, <i>first,</i> the secretary of finance is “acting as the agent of the legislative department” or an “agent of Congress” in determining and declaring the event upon which its expressed will is to take effect; and, <i>second,</i> that the secretary’s personality “is in reality but a projection of that of Congress.”<br><br>The secretary of finance is not an alter ego of <i>Congress</i>, but of the <i>President</i>.  The mandate given by RA 9337 to the secretary is not equipollent to an authority to make laws.  In passing this law, Congress did not restrict or curtail the constitutional power of the President to retain control and supervision over the entire Executive Department.  The law should be construed to be merely asking the President, with a recommendation from the President’s alter ego in finance matters, to determine the factual bases for making the increase in VAT rate operative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  Indeed, as I have mentioned earlier, the fact-finding condition is a mere <i>administrative</i>, not <i>legislative</i>, function.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> states that Congress merely delegates the implementation of the law to the secretary of finance.  How then can the latter be its agent?  <i>Making a law</i> is different from <i>implementing it</i>.  While the <i>first </i>(the making of laws) may be delegated under certain conditions and only in specific instances provided under the Constitution, the <i>second </i>(the implementation of laws) may not be done by Congress.  After all, the legislature does not have the power to implement laws.  Therefore, congressional agency arises only in the <i>first</i>, not in the <i>second</i>.  The <i>first</i> is a legislative function; the<i> second</i>, an executive one.<br><br>Petitioners’ argument is that because the GDP does not account for the economic effects of so-called underground businesses, it is an inaccurate indicator of either economic growth or slowdown in transitional economies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Clearly, this matter is within the confines of lawmaking.  This Court is neither a substitute for the wisdom, or lack of it, in Congress,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> nor an arbiter of flaws within the latter’s internal rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  Policy matters lie within the domain of the political branches of government,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> outside the range of judicial cognizance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  “[T]he right to select the measure and objects of taxation devolves upon the Congress, and not upon the courts, and such selections are valid unless constitutional limitations are overstepped.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  Moreover, each house of Congress has the power and authority to determine the rules of its proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  The contention that this case is not ripe for determination because there is no violation yet of the Constitution regarding the exercise of the President’s standby authority has no basis.  The question raised is whether the BCC, in passing the law, committed grave abuse of discretion, not whether the provision in question had been violated.  Hence, this case is not premature and is, in fact, subject to judicial determination.<br><br><i><b><u>Amendments on Income Taxes.</u></b></i>  I respectfully submit that the amendments made by the BCC (that were culled from the Senate version) regarding income taxes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> are not legally germane to the subject matter of the House bills.  Revising the income tax rates on domestic, resident foreign and nonresident foreign corporations; increasing the tax credit against taxes due from nonresident foreign corporations on intercorporate dividends; and reducing the allowable deduction for interest expense are legally unrelated and not germane to the subject matter contained in the House bills; they violate the origination principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  The reasons are as follows:<br><br><i>One</i>, an income tax is a <i>direct tax</i> imposed on actual or presumed income --gross or net -- realized by a taxpayer during a given taxable year,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> while a VAT is an <i>indirect tax</i> not in the context of who is directly and legally liable for its payment, but in terms of its nature as “a tax on consumption.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  The <i>former</i> cannot be passed on to the consumer, but the <i>latter</i> can.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  It is too wide a stretch of the imagination to even relate one concept with the other.  In like manner, it is inconceivable how the provisions that increase corporate income taxes can be considered as <i>mitigating measures</i> for increasing the VAT and, as I will explain later, for effectively imposing a maximum of 3 percent tax on gross sales or revenues because of the 70 percent cap.  Even the argument that the corporate income tax rates will be reduced to 30 percent does not hold water.  This reduction will take effect only in 2009, not 2006 when the 12 percent VAT rate will have been implemented.<br><br><i>Two,</i> taxes on intercorporate dividends are <i>final</i>, but the input VAT is generally <i>creditable</i>.  Under a <i>final</i> withholding tax system, the amount of income tax that is withheld by a withholding agent is constituted as a full and final payment of the income tax due from the payee on said income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  The liability for the tax primarily rests upon the payor as a withholding agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  Under a <i>creditable</i> withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain payments are meant to approximate the tax that is due of the payee on said payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  The liability for the tax rests upon the payee who is mandated by law to still file a tax return, report the tax base, and pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>From this observation alone, it can already be seen that not only are dividends alien to the tax base upon which the VAT is imposed, but their respective methods of withholding are totally different.  VAT-registered persons may not always be nonresident foreign corporations that declare and pay dividends, while intercorporate dividends are certainly not goods or properties for sale, barter, exchange, lease or importation.  Certainly, input VAT credits are different from tax credits on dividends received by nonresident foreign corporations.<br><br><i>Three,</i> itemized deductions from gross income partake of the nature of a tax exemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  Interest -- which is among such deductions -- refers to the amount paid by a debtor to a creditor for the use or forbearance of money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  It is an expense item that is paid or incurred within a given taxable year on indebtedness in connection with a taxpayer’s trade, business or exercise of profession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  In order to reduce revenue losses, Congress enacted RA 8424<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> which reduces the amount of interest expense deductible by a taxpayer from gross income, equal to the applicable percentage of interest income subject to final tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  To assert that reducing the allowable deduction in interest expense is a matter that is legally related to the proposed VAT amendments is too far-fetched.  Interest expenses are not allowed as credits against output VAT.  Neither are VAT-registered persons always liable for interest.<br><br>Having argued on the unconstitutionality (non-germaneness) of the BCC insertions on income taxes, let me now proceed to the other provisions that were attacked by petitioners.<br><br><i><b><u>No Pass-on Provisions.</u></b></i>  I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the BCC did not exceed its authority when it deleted the no pass-on provisions found in the congressional bills.  Its authority to make amendments not only implies the power to make insertions, but also deletions, in order to resolve <i>conflicting</i> provisions.<br><br>The no pass-on provision in House Bill (HB) No. 3705 referred to the petroleum products subject to excise tax (and the raw materials used in the manufacture of such products), the sellers of petroleum products, and the generation companies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  The analogous provision in Senate Bill (SB) No. 1950 dealt with electricity, businesses other than generation companies, and services of franchise grantees of electric utilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  In contrast, there was a marked absence of the no pass-on provision in HB 3555.  Faced with such variances, the BCC had the option of retaining or modifying the no pass-on provisions and determining their extent, or of deleting them altogether.  In opting for deletion to resolve the variances, it was merely acting within its discretion.  No grave abuse may be imputed to the BCC.<br><br><i><u><b>The 70 Percent Cap on Input Tax and the 5 Percent Final Withholding VAT.</b></u></i>  Deciding on the 70 percent cap and the 5 percent final withholding VAT in the consolidated bill is also within the power of the BCC.  While HB 3555 included limits of 5 percent and 11 percent on input tax,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> SB 1950 proposed an even spread over 60 months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>  The decision to put a cap and fix its rate, so as to harmonize or to find a compromise in settling the apparent differences in these versions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> was within the sound discretion of the BCC.<br><br>In like manner, HB 3555 contained provisions on the withholding of creditable VAT at the rates of 5 percent, 8 percent, 10.5 percent, and 12 percent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>  HB 3705 had no such equivalent amendment, and SB 1950 pegged the rates at only 5 percent and 10 percent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  I believe that the decision to impose a final (not creditable) VAT and to fix the rates at 5 percent and 10 percent, so as to harmonize the apparent differences in all three versions, was also within the sound discretion of the BCC.<br><br>Indeed, the tax credit method under our VAT system is not only practical, but also principally used in almost all taxing jurisdictions.  This does not mean, however, that in the eyes of Congress through the BCC, our country can neither deviate from this method nor modify its application to suit our fiscal requirements.  The VAT is <i>usually</i> collected through the tax credit method (and in the past, even through the cost deduction method or a mixture of these two methods),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> but there is no hard and fast rule that 100 percent of the input taxes will always be allowed as a tax credit.<br><br>In fact, it was Maurice Lauré, a French engineer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> who invented the VAT.  In 1954, he had the idea of imposing an indirect tax on consumption, called <i>taxe sur la valeur ajoutée</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> which was quickly adopted by the <i>Direction Générale des Impost</i>, the new French tax authority of which he became joint director.  Consequently, taxpayers at all levels in the production process, rather than retailers or tax authorities, were forced to administer and account for the tax themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Since the unutilized input VAT can be carried over to succeeding quarters, there is no undue deprivation of property.  Alternatively, it can be passed on to the consumers;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> there is no law prohibiting that.  Merely speculative and unproven, therefore, is the contention that the law is arbitrary and oppressive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>  Laws that impose taxes are necessarily burdensome, compulsory, and involuntary.<br><br>The <i>deferred input tax</i> account -- which accumulates the unutilized input VAT -- remains an asset in the accounting records of a business.

The Court cannot step beyond the confines of its constitutional power, if there is absolutely no clear showing of grave abuse of discretion in the enactment of the law.<br><br>That the unutilized input VAT would be rendered useless is merely speculative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>  Although it is recorded as a deferred asset in the books of a company, it remains to be a mere privilege.  It may be written off or expensed outright; it may also be denied as a tax credit.<br><br>There is no vested right in a <i>deferred input tax</i> account; it is a mere statutory privilege.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  The State may modify or withdraw such privilege, which is merely an asset granted by operation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>  Moreover, there is no vested right in generally accepted accounting principles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>  These refer to accounting concepts, measurement techniques, and standards of presentation in a company’s financial statements, and are not rooted in laws of nature, as are the laws of physical science, for these are merely developed and continually modified by local and international regulatory accounting bodies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  To state otherwise and recognize such asset account as a vested right is to limit the taxing power of the State.  Unlimited, plenary, comprehensive and supreme, this power cannot be unduly restricted by mere creations of the State.<br><br>That the unutilized input VAT would also have an unequal effect on businesses --some with low, others with high, input-output ratio -- is not a legal ground for invalidating the law.  Profit margins are a variable of sound business judgment, not of legal doctrine.  The law applies equally to all businesses; it is up to each of them to determine the best formula for selling their goods or services in the face of stiffer competition.  There is, thus, no violation of the equal protection clause.  If the implementation of the 70 percent cap would cause an <i>ad infinitum </i>deferment of input taxes or an unequal effect upon different types of businesses with varying profit margins and capital requirements, then the remedy would be an amendment of the law -- not an unwarranted and outright declaration of unconstitutionality.<br><br>The matter of business establishments shouldering 30 percent of output tax and remitting the amount, as computed, to the government is in effect imposing a tax that is equivalent to a maximum of 3 percent of gross sales or revenues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>  This imposition is arguably another tax on gross -- not net -- income and thus a deviation from the concept of VAT as a tax on consumption; it also assumes that sales or revenues are on cash basis or, if on credit, given credit terms shorter than a quarter of a year.  However, such additional imposition and assumption are also arguably within the power of Congress to make.  The State may in fact choose to impose an additional 3 percent tax on gross income, in lieu of the 70 percent cap, and thus subject the income of businesses to two types of taxes -- one on gross, the other on net.  These impositions may constitute double taxation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> which is not constitutionally proscribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Besides, prior to the amendments introduced by the BCC, already extant in the Tax Code was a 3 percent <i>percentage tax</i> on the gross quarterly sales or receipts of persons who were not VAT-registered, and whose sales or receipts were exempt from VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>  This is another type of tax imposed by the Tax Code, in addition to the tax on their respective incomes.  No question as to its validity was raised before; none is being brought now.  More important, there is a presumption in favor of constitutionality,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> “rooted in the doctrine of separation of powers which enjoins upon the three coordinate departments of the Government a becoming courtesy for each other’s acts.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>As to the argument that Section 8 of RA 9337 contravenes Section 1 of Article III and Section 20 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution, I respectfully disagree.<br><br><i>One,</i> petitioners have not been denied due process or, as I have illustrated earlier, equal protection.  In the exercise of its inherent power to tax, the State validly interferes with the right to property of persons, natural or artificial.  Those similarly situated are affected in the same way and treated alike, “both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>RA 9337 was enacted precisely to achieve the objective of raising revenues to defray the necessary expenses of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>  The means that this law employs are reasonably related to the accomplishment of such objective, and not unduly oppressive.  The reduction of tax credits is a question of economic policy, not of legal perlustration.  Its determination is vested in Congress, not in this Court.  Since the purpose of the law is to raise revenues, it cannot be denied that the means employed is reasonably related to the achievement of that purpose.  Moreover, the proper congressional procedure for its enactment was followed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> neither public notice nor public hearings were denied.<br><br><i>Two,</i> private enterprises are not discouraged.  Tax burdens are never delightful, but with the imposition of the 70 percent cap, there will be an assurance of a steady cash flow to the government, which can be translated to the production of improved goods, rendition of better services, and construction of better facilities for the people, including all private enterprises.  Perhaps, Congress deems it best to make our economy depend more on businesses that are easier to monitor, so there will be a more efficient collection of taxes.  Whatever is expected of the outcome of the law, or its wisdom, should be the sole responsibility of the representatives chosen by the electorate.<br><br>The profit margin <i>rates </i>of various industries generally do not change.  However, the profit margin <i>figures</i> do, because these are obviously monetary variables that affect business, along with the level of competition, the quality of goods and services offered, and the cost of their production.  And there will inevitably be a conscious desire on the part of those who engage in business and those who consume their output to adapt or adjust accordingly to any congressional modification of the VAT system.<br><br>In addition, it is contended that the VAT should be proportional in nature.  I submit that this proportionality pertains to the <span style="font-style: italic;">rate</span> imposable, not the <i>credit</i> allowable.  Private enterprises are subjected to a proportional VAT rate, but VAT credits need not be.  The VAT is, after all, a human concept that is neither immutable nor invariable.  In fact, it has changed after it was adopted as a system of indirect taxation by other countries.  Again unlike the laws of physical science, the VAT system can always be modified to suit modern fiscal demands.  The State, through the Legislative Department, may even choose to do away with it and revert to our previous system of turnover taxes, sales taxes and compensating taxes, in which credits may be disallowed altogether.<br><br>Not expensed, but amortized over its useful life, is capital equipment, which is purchased or treated as capital leases by private enterprises.  Aimed at achieving the twin objectives of profitability and solvency, such purchase or lease is a matter of prudence in business decision-making.<br><br>Hence, business judgments, sales volume, and their effect on competition are for businesses to determine and for Congress to regulate -- not for this Court to interfere with, absent a clear showing that constitutional provisions have been violated.  Tax collection and administrative feasibility are for the executive branch to focus on, again not for this Court to dwell upon.<br><br>The Transcript of the Oral Arguments on July 14, 2005 clearly point out in a long line of relevant questioning that, absent a violation of constitutional provisions, the Court cannot interfere with the 70 percent cap, the 5 percent final withholding tax, and the 60-month amortization, there being other extra-judicial remedies available to petitioners, thus:<br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="30%">“Atty.

This fact is evident, considering that the proposed changes in the VAT law will have inevitable implications and repercussions on such taxes, as well as on the procedural requirements and the disposition of incremental revenues, in the Tax Code.  Either <i>mitigating measures</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> have to be put in place or <i>increased rates</i> imposed, in order to achieve the purpose of the law, cushion the impact of increased taxation, and still maintain the equitability desired of any other revenue law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>  Directly related to the proposed VAT changes, these amendments are expected also to have a salutary effect on the national economy.<br><br>The no-amendment rule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> in the Constitution was not violated by the BCC, because no completely new provision was inserted in the approved bill.  The amendments may be unpopular or even work hardship upon everyone (this writer included).  If so, the remedy cannot be prescribed by this Court, but by Congress.<br><br><b><i><u>Rejecting</u></i><u> Non-Conflicting<br><i>Provisions</i></u></b><br><br><i>Fourth,</i> the BCC may choose neither to adopt nor to consolidate the versions presented to it by both houses of Congress, but instead to reject <i>non-conflicting</i> provisions in those versions.  In other words, despite the lack of conflict in them, such provisions are still eliminated entirely from the consolidated bill.  There may be a constitutional problem here.<br><br>The no pass-on provisions in the congressional bills are the only item raised by petitioners concerning deletion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>  As I have already mentioned earlier, these provisions were in conflict.  Thus, the BCC exercised its prerogative to remove them.  In fact, congressional rules give the BCC the power to reconcile disagreeing provisions, and in the process of reconciliation, to delete them.  <i>No other non-conflicting provision was deleted.</i><br><br>At this point, and after the extensive discussion above, it can readily be seen no <i>non-conflicting</i> provisions of the E-VAT bills were rejected indiscriminately by the BCC.<br><br><u><i><b>Approving and Inserting<br>Completely New Provisions</b></i></u><br><br><i>Fifth,</i> the BCC had the option of inserting completely new provisions not found in any of the provisions of the bills of either house of Congress, or make and endorse an entirely new bill as a substitute.  Taking this option may be a blatant violation of the Constitution, for not only will the surreptitious insertion or unwarranted creation contravene the “origination” principle; it may likewise desecrate the three-reading requirement and the no-amendment rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Fortunately, however, the BCC did not approve or insert completely new provisions.  Thus, no violation of the Constitution was committed in this regard.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i><u><b>Summary</b></u></i><br></div><br>The enrolled bill doctrine is said to be conclusive not only as to the provisions of a law, but also to its due enactment.  It is not absolute, however, and must yield to mandatory provisions of the 1987 Constitution.  Specifically, this Court has the duty of striking down provisions of a law that in their enactment violate conditions, restrictions or limitations imposed by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>  The Bicameral Conference Committee (BCC) is a mere creation of Congress.  Hence, the BCC may resolve differences only in conflicting provisions of congressional bills that are referred to it; and it may do so only on the condition that such resolution does not violate the origination, the three-reading, and the no-amendment rules of the Constitution.<br><br>In crafting RA 9337, the BCC opted to reconcile the conflicting provisions of the Senate and House bills, particularly those on the 70 percent cap on input tax; the 5 percent final withholding tax; percentage taxes on domestic carriers, keepers of garages and international carriers; franchise taxes; amusement taxes; excise taxes on manufactured oils and other fuels; registration requirements; issuance of receipts or sales or commercial invoices; and disposition of incremental revenues.  To my mind, these changes do not violate the origination or the germaneness principles.<br><br>Neither is there undue delegation of legislative power in the standby authority given by Congress to the President.  The law is complete, and the standards are fixed.  While I concur with the <i>ponencia’s</i> view that the President was given merely the power to ascertain the facts to bring the law into operation -- clearly an administrative, not a legislative, function -- I stress that the finance secretary remains the Chief Executive’s alter ego, not an agent of Congress.<br><br>The BCC exercised its prerogative to delete the no pass-on provisions, because these were in conflict.  I believe, however, that it blatantly violated the origination and the germaneness principles when it inserted provisions not found in the House versions of the E-VAT Law: (1) increasing the tax rates on domestic, resident foreign and nonresident foreign corporations; (2) increasing the tax credit against taxes due from nonresident foreign corporations on intercorporate dividends; and (3) reducing the allowable deduction for interest expense.  Hence, I find these insertions unconstitutional.<br><br>Some have criticized the E-VAT Law as oppressive to our already suffering people.  On the other hand, respondents have justified it by comparing it to bitter medicine that patients must endure to be healed eventually of their maladies.  The advantages and disadvantages of the E-VAT Law, as well as its long-term effects on the economy, are beyond the reach of judicial review.  The economic repercussions of the statute are policy in nature and are beyond the power of the courts to pass upon.<br><br>I have combed through the specific points raised in the Petitions.  Other than the three items on income taxes that I respectfully submit are unconstitutional, I cannot otherwise attribute grave abuse of discretion to the BCC, or Congress for that matter, for passing the law. <br><blockquote>“[T]he Court -- as a rule -- is deferential to the actions taken by the other branches of government that have primary responsibility for the economic development of our country.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>  Thus, in upholding the Philippine ratification of the treaty establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), <i>Tañada v. Angara</i> held that “this Court never forgets that the Senate, whose act is under review, is one of two sovereign houses of Congress and is thus entitled to great respect in its actions.  It is itself a constitutional body, independent and coordinate, and thus its actions are presumed regular and done in good faith.  Unless convincing proof and persuasive arguments are presented to overthrow such presumption, this Court will resolve every doubt in its favor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>  As pointed our in <span style="font-style: italic;">Cawaling Jr. v.

Its Parliament has the power to change or abolish any written or unwritten element of the Constitution.  There is neither separation of powers nor formal checks and balances.  Every bill drafted has to be approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, before it receives the Royal Assent and becomes an Act of Parliament.  The House of Lords is the second chamber that complements the work of the Commons, whose members are elected to represent their constituents.  The first is the House of Commons that alone may start bills to raise taxes or authorize expenditures.  Each bill goes through several stages in each House.  The first stage, called the first reading, is a mere formality.  The second -- the second reading -- is when general principles of the bill are debated upon.  At the second reading, the House may vote to reject the bill.  Once the House considers the bill, the third reading follows.  In the House of Commons, no further amendments may be made, and the passage of the motion amounts to passage of the whole bill.  The House of Lords, however, may not amend a bill so as to insert a provision relating to taxation.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom; http:// www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/uk00000_.html; www.parliament.uk; and http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/British+Parliament (Last visited August 4, 2005, 11:30am PST).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>See</i> Dissenting Opinion of Puno,<span style="font-style: italic;"> J.</span> in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tolentino v.

However, the <i>ponencia</i> construed the term “settle” as synonymous to “reconcile” and “harmonize,” and as such, the Bicameral Conference Committee may either <b>(a)</b> adopt the specific provisions of either the House bill or Senate bill, <b>(b)</b> decide that neither provisions in the House bill or the provisions in the Senate bill would be carried into the final form of the bill, and/or <b>(c) try to arrive at a compromise between the disagreeing provisions.</b><br><br>I beg to differ on the third proposition.<br><br>Indeed, Section 16(3), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution explicitly allows each House to determine the rules of its proceedings.  However, the rules must not contravene constitutional provisions.  The rule-making power of Congress should take its bearings from the Constitution.   If in the exercise of this rule-making power, Congress failed to set parameters in the functions of the committee and allowed the latter unbridled authority to perform acts which Congress itself is prohibited, like the passage of a law without undergoing the requisite three-reading and the so-called no-amendment rule, then the same amount to grave abuse of discretion which this Court is empowered to correct under its expanded certiorari jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the doctrine of separation of powers, therefore, it is the duty of the Court to declare as void a legislative enactment, <b>either from want of constitutional power to enact or because the constitutional forms or conditions have not been observed.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  When the Court declares as unconstitutional a law or a specific provision thereof because procedural requirements for its passage were not complied, the Court is by no means asserting its ascendancy over the Legislature, but simply affirming the supremacy of the Constitution as repository of the sovereign will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  The judicial branch must ensure that constitutional norms for the exercise of powers vested upon the two other branches are properly observed.  This is the very essence of judicial authority conferred upon the Court under Section 1, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>The Rules of the House of Representatives and the Rules of the Senate provide that in the event there is disagreement between the provisions of the House and Senate bills, the differences shall be settled by a bicameral conference committee.<br><br>By this, I fully subscribe to the theory advanced in the Dissenting Opinion of Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. in <i>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> that the authority of the bicameral conference committee was limited to the reconciliation of disagreeing provisions or the resolution of differences or inconsistencies.  Thus, it could only either <b>(a) restore, wholly or partly, the specific provisions of the House bill amended by the Senate bill, (b) sustain, wholly or partly, the Senate’s amendments, or (c) by way of a compromise, to agree that neither provisions in the House bill amended by the Senate nor the latter’s amendments thereto be carried into the final form of the former.</b><br><br>Otherwise stated, the Bicameral Conference Committee is authorized only to adopt either the version of the House bill or the Senate bill, or adopt neither.  It cannot, as the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> proposed, “try to arrive at a compromise”, such as introducing provisions not included in either the House or Senate bill, as it would allow a mere ad hoc committee to substitute the will of the entire Congress and without undergoing the requisite three-reading, which are both constitutionally proscribed.  To allow the committee unbridled discretion to overturn the collective will of the whole Congress defies logic considering that the bills are passed presumably after study, deliberation and debate in both houses.  A lesser body like the Bicameral Conference Committee should not be allowed to substitute its judgment for that of the entire Congress, whose will is expressed collectively through the passed bills.<br><br>When the Bicameral Conference Committee goes beyond its limited function by substituting its own judgment for that of either of the two houses, it violates the internal rules of Congress and contravenes material restrictions imposed by the Constitution, particularly on the passage of law.  While concededly, the internal rules of both Houses do not explicitly limit the Bicameral Conference Committee to a consideration only of conflicting provisions, it is understood that the provisions of the Constitution should be read into these rules as imposing limits on what the committee can or cannot do.  As such, it cannot perform its delegated function in violation of the three-reading requirement and the no-amendment rule.<br><br>Section 26(2) of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution provides that: <blockquote> (2) No bill shall be passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency.  Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment hereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal. </blockquote> Thus, before a bill becomes a law, it must pass three readings.  Hence, the <i>ponencia’s</i> submission that despite its limited authority, the Bicameral Conference Committee could “compromise the disagreeing provisions” by substituting it with its own version – clearly violate the three-reading requirement, as the committee’s version would no longer undergo the same since it would be immediately put into vote by the respective houses.  In effect, it is not a bill that was passed by the entire Congress but by the members of the ad hoc committee only, which of course is constitutionally infirm.<br><br>I disagree that the no-amendment rule referred only to “the procedure to be followed by each house of Congress with regard to bills initiated in each of said respective houses” because it would relegate the no-amendment rule to a mere rule of procedure.  To my mind, the no-amendment rule should be construed as prohibiting the Bicameral Conference Committee from introducing amendments and modifications to non-disagreeing provisions of the House and Senate bills.  In sum, the committee could only either adopt the version of the House bill or the Senate bill, or adopt neither.  As Justice Reynato S. Puno said in his Dissenting Opinion in <i>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> there is absolutely no legal warrant for the bold submission that a Bicameral Conference Committee possesses the power to add/delete provisions in bills already approved on third reading by both Houses or an ex post veto power.<br><br>In view thereof, it is my submission that the amendments introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee which are not found either in the House or Senate versions of the VAT reform bills, but are inserted merely by the Bicameral Conference Committee and thereafter included in Republic Act No. 9337, should be declared unconstitutional.  The insertions and deletions made do not merely settle conflicting provisions but materially altered the bill, thus giving rise to the instant petitions.<br><br>I, therefore, join the concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Reynato S. Puno.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 8<sup>th</sup> Ed., Vol. I, p. 332.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Angara v.

Composed of the people’s representatives,   it   is   “closer to the pulse of the people and… are therefore in a better position to determine both the extent of the legal burden the people are capable of bearing and the benefits they need.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>   Also, this set-up provides security against the abuse of power.   As  Chief Justice Marshall said:   “In imposing a tax, the legislature acts upon its constituents.   The power may be abused; but the interest, wisdom, and justice of the representative body, and its relations with its constituents, furnish a sufficient security.”<br><br>Consequently, Section 24, Article VI of our Constitution enshrined the principle of “<i>no taxation without representation</i>” by providing that    “all… revenue bills… shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.”  This provision generally confines the power of taxation to the Legislature.<br><br>R.A. No. 9337, in granting to the President the <i style="font-weight: bold;">stand-by authority</i> to increase the VAT rate from 10% to 12%, the Legislature abdicated its power by delegating it to the President. This is constitutionally impermissible. The Legislature may not escape its duties and responsibilities by delegating its power to any other body or authority.   Any attempt to abdicate the power is unconstitutional and void, on the principle that <span style="font-style: italic;">potestas delegata non delegare potest</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  As Judge Cooley enunciated:<br><blockquote> "One of the settled maxims in constitutional law is, that the power conferred upon the legislature to make laws cannot be delegated by that department to any other body or authority. <b>Where the sovereign power of the state has located the authority, there it must remain; and by the constitutional agency alone the laws must be made until the Constitution itself is changed. </b>The power to whose judgment, wisdom, and patriotism this high prerogative has been entrusted cannot relieve itself of the responsibility by choosing other agencies upon which the power shall be devolved, nor can it substitute the judgment, wisdom, and patriotism of any other body for those to which alone the people have seen fit to confide this sovereign trust."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Of course, the rule which forbids the delegation of the power of taxation is not absolute and inflexible.   It admits of exceptions.  Retired Justice Jose C. Vitug enumerated such exceptions, to wit: <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span> delegations to local governments (to be exercised by the local legislative bodies thereof) or political subdivisions; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2)</span> delegations allowed by the Constitution; and <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span> delegations relating merely to administrative implementation that may call for some degree of discretionary powers under a set of sufficient standards expressed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Patently, the act of the Legislature in delegating its power to tax does not fall under any of the exceptions.<br><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">First,</i> it does not involve a delegation of taxing power to the local government.   It is a delegation to the President.<br><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">Second,</i> it is not allowed by the Constitution.  Section 28 (2), Article VI of the Constitution enumerates the charges or duties, the rates of which may be fixed by the President pursuant to a law passed by Congress,       thus: <blockquote> The Congress may, by law, <b>authorize the President to fix within specified limits</b>, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, <b>tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage</b> and <b>wharfage dues</b>, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government. </blockquote> Noteworthy is the absence of <b>tax rates or VAT rates</b> in the enumeration.  If the intention of the Framers of the Constitution is to permit the delegation of the power to fix <b>tax rates or VAT rates</b> to the President,  such  could  have  been  easily  achieved  by  the  mere inclusion  of  the  term  “<b>tax rates</b>”  or  “<b>VAT rates</b>”  in  the  enumeration.  It is a dictum in statutory construction that <b>what is expressed puts an end to what is implied</b>.   <i>Expressium facit cessare tacitum</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>   This is a derivative of the more familiar maxim <b>express mention is implied exclusion</b> or  <i>expressio  unius  est  exclusio  alterius</i>.   Considering that Section 28 (2), Article VI expressly speaks only of “tariff rates,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  import<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and export quotas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  tonnage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and wharfage dues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and other duties and imposts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>” by no stretch of imagination can this enumeration be extended to include the VAT.<br><br>And <i><b>third,</b></i> it does not relate merely to the administrative implementation of R.A. No. 9337.<br><br>In testing whether a statute constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power or not, it is usual to inquire whether the statute was complete in all its terms and provisions when it left the hands of the Legislature so that nothing was left to the judgment of any other appointee or delegate of the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the President is the delegate of the Legislature, endowed with the power to raise the VAT rate from 10 % to 12% if any of the following conditions, to reiterate, has been satisfied: <b>(i)</b> value-added tax collection as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) of the previous year exceeds two and four-fifths percent (2 4/5%) or <b>(ii)</b> National Government deficit as a percentage of GDP of the previous year exceeds one and one-half percent (1 ½%).<br><br>At first glance, the two conditions may appear to be definite standards sufficient to guide the President.  However, to my mind, they are ineffectual and malleable as they give the President ample opportunity to exercise her <b><i>authority</i></b> in arbitrary and discretionary fashion.<br><br>The two conditions set forth by law would have been sufficient had it not been for the fact that the President, being at the helm of the entire officialdom, has more than enough power of control to bring about the existence of such conditions.   Obviously, R.A. No. 9337 allows the President to determine for herself whether the VAT rate shall be increased or not at all.   The fulfillment of the conditions is entirely placed in her hands.   If she wishes to increase the VAT rate, all she has to do is to strictly enforce the VAT collection so as to exceed the 2 4/5% ceiling.    The same holds true with the national government deficit.   She will just limit government expenses so as not to exceed the 1 ½% ceiling.    On the other hand, if she does not wish to increase the VAT rate, she may discourage the Secretary of Finance from making the recommendation.<br><br>That the President’s exercise of an authority is practically within her control is tantamount to giving no conditions at all.   I believe this amounts to a virtual surrender of legislative power to her.   It must be stressed that the validity of a law is not tested by what has been done but by <b>what may be done under its provisions</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>II </i></b><br><b><i>Violation of Due Process</i></b><br></div><br>The constitutional safeguard of due process is briefly worded in Section 1, Article III of the Constitution which states that, “no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Substantive due process requires the intrinsic validity of the law in interfering with the rights of the person to his property.  The inquiry in this regard is not whether or not the law is being enforced in accordance with the prescribed manner but <b>whether or not, to begin with, it is a proper exercise of legislative power.</b><br><br>To be so, the law must have a <b>valid governmental objective</b>, i.e., the interest of the public as distinguished from those of a particular class, requires the intervention of the State.   This objective must be pursued in a lawful manner, or in other words, the means employed must be reasonably related to the accomplishment of the purpose and <b>not unduly oppressive</b>.<br><br>There is no doubt that R.A. No. 9337 was enacted pursuant to a valid governmental objective, i.e. to raise revenues for the government. However, with respect to the means employed to accomplish such objective,  I am convinced that R.A. No. 9337, particularly Sections 4, 5 and 6 thereof, are arbitrary and unduly oppressive.<br><br>A reading of the Senate deliberation reveals that the first condition constitutes a reward to the President for her effective collection of VAT.

Indeed, why should she be rewarded for performing a duty reposed upon her by law?<br><br>The rationale stated by Senator Recto is flawed.  One of the principles of sound taxation is fiscal adequacy.  The proceeds of tax revenue should coincide with, and approximate the needs of, government expenditures.   <b>Neither an <i>excess</i> nor a <i>deficiency</i> of revenue <i>vis-à-vis</i> the needs of government would be in keeping with the principle</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Equating the grant of <b><i>authority</i></b> to the President to increase the VAT rate with the grant of additional allowance to a studious son is highly inappropriate.   Our Senators must have forgotten that for every increase of taxes, the burden always redounds to the people.  Unlike the additional allowance given to a studious son that comes from the pocket of the granting parent alone, the increase in the VAT rate would be shouldered by the masses.   Indeed, mandating them to pay the increased rate as an award to the President is arbitrary and unduly oppressive.  Taxation is not a power to be exercised at one’s whim.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i><b>III </b></i><br><i><b>Exclusive  Origination from the </b></i><br><i><b>House of Representatives</b></i><br></div><br>Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution provides: <blockquote> <b>SEC. 24.</b> All appropriations, <b>revenue</b> or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall <b>originate exclusively</b> in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments. </blockquote> In <i>Tolentino vs. Secretary of Finance</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court expounded on the foregoing provision by holding that: <blockquote> “x x x To begin with, it is not the law – but the revenue bill – which is required by the Constitution to ‘originate exclusively in the House of Representatives. It is important to emphasize this, because a bill originating the in the House may undergo such extensive changes in the Senate that the result may be a rewriting of the whole x x x.  At this point, what is important to note is that, as a result of the Senate action, a distinct bill may be produced. To insist that a revenue statute  -- and not only the bill which initiated the legislative process culminating in the enactment of the law – must substantially be the same as the House Bill would be to deny the Senate’s power not only to ‘concur with amendments: but also to ‘propose amendments.’ It would be to violate the co-equality of the legislative power of the two houses of Congress and in fact, make the House superior to the Senate.” </blockquote> The case at bar gives us an opportunity to take a second hard look at the efficacy of the foregoing jurisprudence.<br><br>Section 25, Article VI is a verbatim re-enactment of Section 18, Article VI of the 1935 Constitution.   The latter provision was modeled from Section 7 (1), Article I of the United States Constitution, which states: <blockquote> “All bills for raising revenue shall <b>originate</b> in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may <b>propose or concur with amendments</b>, as on other bills.” </blockquote> The American people, in entrusting what James Madison termed “the power of the purse” to their elected representatives, drew inspiration from the British practice and experience with the House of Commons.  As one commentator puts it: <blockquote> “They knew the inestimable value of the House of Commons, as a component branch of the British parliament; and they believed that it had at all times furnished the best security against the oppression of the crown and the aristocracy. <b>While the power of taxation, of revenue, and of supplies remained in the hands of a popular branch, it was difficult for usurpation to exist for any length of time without check, and prerogative must yield of that necessity which controlled at once the sword and the purse.</b>” </blockquote> But while the fundamental principle underlying the vesting of the power to propose revenue bills solely in the House of Representatives is present in both the Philippines and US Constitutions, stress must be laid on the differences between the two quoted provisions.    For one, the word “<b>exclusively</b>” appearing in Section 24, Article VI of our Constitution is nowhere to be found in Section 7 (1), Article I of the US Constitution.    For another, the phrase “<b>as on other bills</b>,” present in the same provision of the US Constitution, is not written in our Constitution.<br><br>The adverb “exclusively” means “in an exclusive manner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The term “exclusive” is defined as “excluding or having power to exclude; limiting to or limited to; single, sole, undivided, whole.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>   In one case, this Court define the term “exclusive”  as   “possessed to the exclusion of others; appertaining to the subject alone, not including, admitting, or pertaining to another or others.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As for the term “<b>originate</b>,” its meaning are “<b>to cause the beginning of; to give rise to; to initiate; to start on a course or journey; to take or have origin; to be deprived; arise; begin or start.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>With the foregoing definitions in mind, it can be reasonably concluded that when Section 24, Article VI provides that revenue bills shall <b>originate exclusively</b> from the House of Representatives, what the Constitution mandates is that any revenue statute must <b>begin or start solely</b> and only in the House.

As a corollary, whether it may validly delete provisions uniformly contained in the respective bills of the Senate and the House of Representatives.<br><br>In <i>Tolentino</i>, the Court declared as valid amendments introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee even if these were not contained in the Senate and House bills.  The majority opinion therein held: <blockquote> As to the possibility of an entirely new bill emerging out of a Conference Committee, it has been explained: <blockquote> Under congressional rules of procedures, conference committees are not expected to make any material change in the measure at issue, either by deleting provisions to which both houses have already agreed or by inserting new provisions.  But this is a difficult provision to enforce.  Note the problem when one house amends a proposal originating in either house by striking out everything following the enacting clause and substituting provisions which make it an entirely new bill.  The versions are now altogether different, permitting a conference committee to draft essentially a new bill … </blockquote> The result is a third version, which is considered an “amendment in the nature of a substitute,” the only requirement for which being that the third version be germane to the subject of the House and Senate bills.<br><br>Indeed, this Court recently held that it is within the power of a conference committee to include in its report an entirely new provision that is not found either in the House bill or in the Senate Bill.  If the committee can propose an amendment consisting of one or two provisions, collectively considered as an “amendment in the nature of a substitute,” so long as such an amendment is germane to the subject of the bills before the committee.  After all, its report was not final but needed the approval of both houses of Congress to become valid as an act of the legislative department.  The charge that in this case the Conference Committee acted a third legislative chamber is thus without any basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </blockquote> The majority opinion in <i>Tolentino</i> relied mainly on the practice of the United States legislature in making the foregoing disquisition.  It was held, in effect, that following the US Congress’ practice where a conference committee is permitted to draft a bill that is entirely different from the bills of either the House of Representatives or Senate, the Bicameral Conference Committee is similarly empowered to make amendments not found in either the House or Senate bills.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> upholds the acts of the Bicameral Conference Committee with respect to R.A.

According to a noted constitutional law professor, the absence of the “three-reading” requirement as well as similar legislative-procedure rules from the US Federal Constitution is a “cause for regret.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In this connection, it is interesting to note that the conference committee system in the US Congress has been described in this wise: <blockquote> <i>Conference Committees</i><br><br>Another main mechanism of joint House and Senate action is the conference committee. Inherited from the English Constitution, the conference committee system is an evolutionary product whose principal threads were woven on the loom of congressional practice into a unified pattern by the middle of the nineteenth century. “By 1852,” writes Ada McCown, historian of the origin and development of the conference committee, “the customs of presenting identical reports from the committees of conference in both houses, of granting high privilege to these conference reports, of voting upon the conference report as a whole and permitting no amendment of it, of keeping secret the discussions carried on in the meetings of the conference committee, had become established in American parliamentary practice.”<br><br>Conference committees are composed of Senators and Representatives, usually three each, appointed by the presiding officers of both houses, for the purpose of adjusting differences between bills they have passed.  This device has been extensively used by every Congress since 1789. Of the 1157 laws enacted by the 78th Congress, for example, 107 went through conference and, of these, 36 were appropriation bills on which the House had disagreed to Senate amendments.  In practice, most important legislation goes through the conference closet and is there revised, sometimes beyond recognition, by the all-powerful conferees or managers, as they are styled.  A large body of law and practice has been built up over the years governing conference procedure and reports.<br><br><u>Suffice it to say here that serious evils have marked the development of the conference committee system.</u>  In the first place, it is highly prodigal of members’ time.  McConachie calculated that the average time consumed in conference was 33 days per bill.  Bills are sent to conference without reading the amendments of the other chamber.  <u>Despite rules to the contrary, conferees do not confine themselves to matters in dispute, but often initiate entirely new legislation and even strike out identical provisions previously approved by both houses</u>. This happened during the 78<sup>th</sup> Congress, for instance, when an important amendment to the surplus property bill, which had been approved by both houses, was deleted in conference.<br><br>Conference committees, moreover, suffer like other committees from the seniority rule. The senior members of the committees concerned, who are customarily appointed as managers on the part of the House and Senate, are not always the best informed on the questions at issue, nor do they always reflect the majority sentiment of their houses.  <u>Furthermore, conference reports must be accepted or rejected in <span style="font-style: italic;">toto</span> without amendment and they are often so complex and obscure that they are voted upon without knowledge of their contents.  What happens in practice is that Congress surrenders its legislative function to irresponsible committees of conference.  The standing rules against including new and extraneous matter in conference reports have been gradually whittled away in recent years by the decisions of presiding officers.  Senate riders attached to appropriation bills enable conference committees to legislate and the House usually accepts them rather than withhold supply, thus putting it, as Senator Hoar once declared, under a degrading duress.</u><br><br><u>It is also alleged that under this secret system lobbyist are able to kill legislation they dislike and that “jokers” designed to defeat the will of Congress can be inserted without detection.  Senator George W. Norris once characterized the conference committee as a third house of Congress. “The members of this ‘house,’ he said, “are not elected by the people. The people have no voice as to who these members shall be ... This conference committee is many times, in very important matters of legislation, the most important branch of our legislature.</u>  There is no record kept of the workings of the conference committee.  Its work is performed, in the main, in secret. <u>No constituent has any definite knowledge as to how members of this conference committee vote, and there is no record to prove the attitude of any member of the conference committee ... As a practical proposition we have legislation, then, not by the voice of the members of the Senate, not by the members of the House of Representatives, but we have legislation by the voice of five or six men.  And for practical purposes, in most cases, it is impossible to defeat the legislation proposed by this conference committee. Every experienced legislator knows that it is the hardest thing in the world to defeat a conference report.</u>”<br><br>Despite these admitted evils, impartial students of the conference committee system defend it on net balance as an essential part of the legislative process.  Some mechanism for reconciling differences under bicameral system is obviously indispensable. The remedy for the defects of the device is not to abolish it, but to keep it under congressional control. This can be done by enforcing the rules which prohibit the inclusion in conference reports of matter not committed to them by either house and forbid the deletion of items approved by both bodies; by permitting conference managers to report necessary new matter separately and the houses to consider it apart from the conference report; by fixing a deadline toward the close of a session after which no bills could be sent to conference, so as to eliminate congestion at the end of the session – a suggestion made by the elder Senator La Follete in 1919; by holding conferences in sessions open to the public, letting conference reports lie over longer, and printing them in bill form (with conference changes in italics) so as to allow members more time to examine them and discover “jokers.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote> The “three-reading” and “no-amendment” rules, absent in the US Federal Constitution, but expressly mandated by Article VI, Section 26(2) of our Constitution are mechanisms instituted to remedy the “evils” inherent in a bicameral system of legislature, including the conference committee system.<br><br>Sadly, the <i>ponencia’s</i> refusal to apply Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution on the Bicameral Conference Committee and the amendments it introduced to R.A. No. 9337 has “effectively dismantled” the “three-reading rule” and “no-amendment rule.”  As posited by Fr. Joaquin Bernas, a member of the Constitutional Commission: <blockquote> In a bicameral system, bills are independently processed by both House of Congress.  It is not unusual that the final version approved by one House differs from what has been approved by the other.  The “conference committee,” consisting of members nominated from both Houses, is an extra-constitutional creation of Congress whose function is to propose to Congress ways of reconciling conflicting provisions found in the Senate version and in the House version of a bill.  It performs a necessary function in a bicameral system. However, since conference committees have merely delegated authority from Congress, they should not perform functions that Congress itself may not do.  Moreover, their proposals need confirmation by both Houses of Congress.<br><br>In <i>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</i>, the Court had the opportunity to delve into the limits of what conference committees may do. The petitioners contended that the consolidation of the House and Senate bills made by the conference committee contained provisions which neither the Senate bill nor the House bill had. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Romero laid out in great detail the provisions that had been inserted by the conference committee.  These provisions, according to the petitioners had been introduced “surreptitiously” during a closed door meeting of the committee.<br><br>The Court’s answer to this was that in United States practice conference committees could be held in executive sessions and amendments germane to the purpose of the bill could be introduced even if these were not in either original bill.  But the Court did not bother to check whether perhaps the American practice was based on a constitutional text different from that of the Philippine Constitution.<br><br>There are as a matter of fact significant differences in the degree of freedom American and Philippine legislators have.  The only rule that binds the Federal Congress is that it may formulate its own rules of procedure.  For this reason, the Federal Congress is master of its own procedures.  It is different with the Philippine Congress.  Our Congress indeed is also authorized to formulate its own rules of procedure – but within limits not found in American law.  For instance, there is the “three readings on separate days” rule.  Another important rule is that no amendments may be introduced by either house during third reading. These limitations were introduced by the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions and confirmed by the 1987 Constitution as a defense against the inventiveness of the stealthy and surreptitious.  These, however, were disregarded by the Court in <i>Tolentino</i> in favor of contrary American practice.<br><br>This is not to say that conference committees should not be allowed.  But an effort should be made to lay out the scope of what conference committees may do according to the requirements and the reasons of the Philippine Constitution and not according to the practice of the American Congress.  For instance, if the two Houses are not allowed to introduce and debate amendments on third reading, can they circumvent this rule by coursing new provisions through the instrumentality of a conference committee created by Congress and meeting in secret? The effect of the Court’s uncritical embrace of the practice of the American Congress and its conference committees is to dismantle the no-amendment rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote> The task at hand for the Court, but which the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> eschews, is to circumscribe the powers of the Bicameral Conference Committee in light of the “three-reading” and “no-amendment” rules in Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution.<br><br><i>The Bicameral Conference Committee, in <br>deleting the “no pass on provision” contained in <br>Senate Bill No. 1950 and House Bill No. 3705, <br>violated Article VI , Section 26(2) of the Constitution</i><br><br>Pertinently, in his dissenting opinion in <i>Tolentino</i>, Justice Davide (now Chief Justice) opined that the duty of the Bicameral Conference Committee was limited to the reconciliation of disagreeing provisions or the resolution of differences or inconsistencies.  This proposition still applies as can be gleaned from the following text of Sections 88 and 89, Rule XIV of the Rules of the House of Representatives: <blockquote> Sec. 88. <i>Conference Committee.</i> – In the event that the House does not agree with the Senate on the amendments to any bill or joint resolution, the differences may be settled by the conference committees of both chambers.<br><br>In resolving the differences with the Senate, the House panel shall, as much as possible, adhere to and support the House Bill.  If the differences with the Senate are so substantial that they materially impair the House Bill, the panel shall report such fact to the House for the latter’s appropriate action.<br><br>Sec. 89. <i>Conference Committee Reports.</i> -…Each report shall contain a detailed, sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject measure.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">…<br></div><br>The Chairman of the House panel may be interpellated on the Conference Committee Report prior to the voting thereon.  The House shall vote on the Conference Committee report in the same manner and procedure as it votes on a bill on third and final reading. </blockquote> and Rule XII, Section 35 of the Rules of the Senate: <blockquote> Sec. 35.  In the event that the Senate does not agree with the House of Representatives on the provision of any bill or joint resolution, the differences shall be settled by a conference committee of both Houses which shall meet within ten (10) days after their composition.  The President shall designate the members of the Senate Panel in the conference committee with the approval of the Senate.<br><br>Each Conference Committee Report shall contain a detailed and sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in, or amendments to the subject measure, and shall be signed by a majority of the members of each House panel, voting separately. </blockquote> Justice Davide further explained that under its limited authority, the Bicameral Conference Committee could only (a) restore, wholly or partly, the specific provisions of the House Bill amended by the Senate Bill; (b) sustain, wholly or partly, the Senate’s amendments, or (c) by way of compromise, to agree that neither provisions in the House Bill amended by the Senate nor the latter’s amendments thereto be carried into the final form of the former.  Justice Romero, who also dissented in <i>Tolentino</i>, added that the conference committee is not authorized to initiate or propose completely new matters although under certain legislative rules like the <i>Jefferson’s Manual</i>, a conference committee may introduce <span style="font-style: italic;">germane</span> matters in a particular bill.  However, such matters should be circumscribed by the committee’s sole authority and function to reconcile differences.<br><br>In the case of R.A. No. 9337, the Bicameral Conference Committee made an “amendment by deletion” with respect to the “no pass on provision” contained in both House Bill (HB) No. 3705 and Senate Bill (SB) No. 1950.  HB 3705 proposed to amend Sections 106 and 108 of the NIRC by expressly stating therein that sellers of petroleum products and power generation companies selling electricity are prohibited from passing on the VAT to the consumers.  SB 1950 proposed to amend Section 108 by likewise prohibiting power generation companies from passing on the VAT to the consumers.  However, these “no pass on provisions” were altogether deleted by the Bicameral Conference Committee.  At the least, since there was no disagreement between HB 3705 and SB 1950 with respect to the “no pass on provision” on the sale of electricity, the Bicameral Conference Committee acted beyond the scope of its authority in deleting the pertinent proviso.<br><br>At this point, it is well to recall the rationale for the “no-amendment rule” and the “three-reading rule” in Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution.  The proscription on amendments upon the last reading is intended to subject all bills and their amendments to intensive deliberation by the legislators and the ample ventilation of issues to afford the public an opportunity to express their opinions or objections thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Analogously, it is said that the “three-reading rule” operates “as a self-binding mechanism that allows the legislature to guard against the consequences of its own future passions, myopia, or herd behavior. By requiring that bills be read and debated on successive days, legislature may anticipate and forestall future occasions on which it will be seized by deliberative pathologies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  As Jeremy Bentham, a noted political analyst, put it: “[t]he more susceptible a people are of excitement and being led astray, so much the more ought they to place themselves under the protection of forms which impose the necessity of reflection, and prevent surprises.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Reports of the Bicameral Conference Committee, especially in cases where substantial amendments, or in this case deletions, have been made to the respective bills of either house of Congress, ought to undergo the “three-reading” requirement in order to give effect to the letter and spirit of Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution.<br><br>The Bicameral Conference Committee Report that eventually became R.A. No. 9337, in fact, bolsters the argument for the strict compliance by Congress of the legislative procedure prescribed by the Constitution.  As can be gleaned from the said Report, of the 9 Senators-Conferees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> only 5 Senators<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> unqualifiedly approved it.  Senator Joker P. Arroyo expressed his qualified dissent while Senators Sergio R. Osmeña III and Juan Ponce Enrile approved it with reservations.  On the other hand, of the twenty-eight (28) Members of the House of Representatives-Conferees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> fourteen (14)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> approved the same with reservations while three<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> voted no.  All the reservations expressed by the conferees relate to the deletion of the “no pass on provision.”  Only eleven (11) unqualifiedly approved it.  In other words, even among themselves, the conferees were not unanimous on their Report.  Nonetheless, Congress approved it without even thoroughly discussing the reservations or qualifications expressed by the conferees therein.<br><br>This “take it or leave it” stance vis-à-vis conference committee reports opens the possibility of amendments, which are substantial and not even germane to the original bills of either house, being introduced by the conference committees and voted upon by the legislators without knowledge of their contents.  This practice cannot be countenanced as it patently runs afoul of the essence of Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution.  Worse, it is tantamount to Congress surrendering its legislative functions to the conference committees.<br><br><i>Ratification by Congress did not cure the <br>unconstitutional act of the Bicameral Conference <br>Committee of deleting the “no pass on provision”</i><br><br>That both the Senate and the House of Representatives approved the Bicameral Conference Committee Report which deleted the “no pass on provision” did not cure the unconstitutional act of the said committee.  As succinctly put by Chief Justice Davide in his dissent in Tolentino, “[t]his doctrine of ratification may apply to minor procedural flaws or tolerable breaches of the parameters of the bicameral conference committee’s limited powers but never to violations of the Constitution. Congress is not above the Constitution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><i>Enrolled Bill Doctrine is not applicable where, as in <br>this case, there is grave violation of the Constitution</i><br><br>As expected, the ponencia invokes the enrolled bill doctrine to buttress its refusal to pass upon the validity of the assailed acts of the Bicameral Conference Committee.  Under the “enrolled bill doctrine,” the signing of a bill by the Speaker of the House and the Senate President and the certification of the Secretaries of both houses of Congress that it was passed are conclusive of its due enactment.  In addition to <i>Tolentino</i>, the <i>ponencia </i>cites <i>Fariñas v. Executive Secretary</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> where the Court declined to go behind the enrolled bill vis-à-vis the allegations of the petitioners therein that irregularities attended the passage of Republic Act No. 9006, otherwise known as the Fair Election Act.<br><br>Reliance by the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> on <span style="font-style: italic;">Fariñas</span> is quite misplaced.  The Court’s adherence to the enrolled bill doctrine in the said case was justified for the following reasons: <blockquote> <u>The Court finds no reason to deviate from the salutary in this case where the irregularities alleged by the petitioners mostly involved the internal rules of Congress, whether House or Senate.  Parliamentary rules are merely procedural and with their observance the courts have no concern.</u>  Whatever doubts there may be as to the formal validity of Rep. Act No. 9006 must be resolved in its favor.  The Court reiterates its ruling in <i>Arroyo v. De Venecia, viz.:</i> <blockquote> <u>But the cases, both here and abroad, in varying forms of expression, all deny to the courts the power to inquire into the allegations that, in enacting a law, a House of Congress failed to comply with its own rules, in the absence of showing that there was a violation of a constitutional provision</u> or the rights of private individuals. In <i>Osmeña v. Pendatun</i>, it was held: “At any rate, courts have declared that ‘the rules adopted by deliberative bodies are subject to revocation, modification or waiver at the pleasure of the body adopting them.’  And it has been said that ‘Parliamentary rules are merely procedural, and with their observance, the courts have no concern.  They may be waived or disregarded by the legislative body.’ Consequently, ‘mere failure to conform to parliamentary usage will not invalidate the action (taken by a deliberative body) when the requisite number of members have agreed to a particular measure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </blockquote></blockquote> Thus, in <i>Fariñas</i>, the Court’s refusal to go behind the enrolled bill was based on the fact that the alleged irregularities that attended the passage of R.A. No. 9006 merely involved the internal rules of both houses of Congress.  The procedural irregularities allegedly committed by the conference committee therein did not amount to a violation of a provision of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In contrast, the act of the Bicameral Conference Committee of deleting the “no pass on provision” of SB 1950 and HB 3705 infringe Article VI, Section 26(2) of the Constitution.  The violation of this constitutional provision warrants the exercise by the Court of its constitutionally-ordained power to strike down any act of a branch or instrumentality of government or any of its officials done with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I join the concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Reynato S.

But increasing the tax effort through the E-VAT, to the extent needed to reduce the national deficit to 1 ½% or less, will trigger the happening of condition (i) under the law.  Thus, the happening of condition (i) or condition (ii) is in reality certain and unavoidable, as of January 1, 2006.<br><br>This becomes all the more clear when we consider the figures provided during the oral arguments.<br><br>The Gross Domestic Product for 2005 is estimated at P5.3 Trillion pesos.<br><br>The tax effort of the present VAT is now at 1.5%.<br><br>The national budgetary deficit against the GDP is now at 3%.<br><br>So to reduce the deficit to 1.5% from 3%, one has to increase the tax effort from VAT, now at 1.5%, to at least 3%, thereby exceeding the 2 4/5 percent ceiling in condition (i), making condition (i) happen.<br><br>If, on the other hand, this is not done, then condition (ii) happens – the budget deficit remains over 1.5%.<br><br>What is the result of this?  <u>The result is that in reality, the law does not impose any condition,</u> or <u>the rate increase thereunder</u>, from 10% to 12%, effective January 1, 2006, <u>is unconditional</u>.  For a condition is an event that may or may not happen, or one whose occurrence is uncertain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Now while condition (i) is indeed uncertain and condition (ii) is likewise uncertain, <u>the combination of both makes the occurrence of one of them certain.</u><br><br>Accordingly, there is here no abdication by Congress of its power to fix the rate of the tax since the rate increase provided under the law,  from  10%  to  12%,  is definite and certain to occur, effective January 1, 2006.  All that the President will do is state which of the two conditions occurred and thereupon implement the rate increase.<br><br>At first glance, therefore, it would appear that the decision to increase the rate is to be made by the President, or that the increase is still uncertain, as it is subject to the happening of any of two conditions.<br><br>Nevertheless, the contrary is true and thus it would be best in these difficult and critical times to let our people know precisely what burdens they are being asked to bear as the necessary means to recover from a crisis that calls for a heroic sacrifice by all.<br><br>It is for this reason that the Court required respondents to submit a copy of the rules to implement the E-VAT, particularly as to the impact of the tax on prices of affected commodities, specially oil and electricity.  For the onset of the law last July 1, 2005 was confusing, resulting in across-the-board increases of 10% in the prices of commodities.  This is not supposed to be the effect of the law, as was made clear during the oral arguments, because the law also contains provisions that mitigate the impact of the E-VAT through reduction of other kinds of taxes and duties, and other similar measures, specially as to goods that go into the supply chain of the affected products.  A proper implementation of the E-VAT, therefore, should cause only the appropriate incremental increase in prices, reflecting the net incremental effect of the tax, which is not necessarily 10%, but possibly less, depending on the products involved.<br><br>The introduction of the mitigating or cushioning measures through the Senate or through the Bicameral Conference Committee, is also being questioned by petitioners as unconstitutional for violating the rule against amendments after third reading and the rule that tax measures must originate exclusively in the House of Representatives (Art. VI, Secs. 24 and 26 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>, Constitution).  For my part, I would rather give the necessary leeway to Congress, as long as the changes are germane to the bill being changed, the bill which<br><br>originated from the House of Representatives, and these are so, since these were precisely the mitigating measures that go hand-on-hand with the E-VAT, and are, therefore, essential -- and hopefully sufficient -- means to enable our people to bear the sacrifices they are being asked to make.  Such an approach is in accordance with the Enrolled Bill Doctrine that is the prevailing rule in this jurisdiction.  (Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance, 249 SCRA 628 [1994]).  The exceptions I find are the provisions on corporate income taxes, which are not germane to the E-VAT law, and are not found in the Senate and House bills.<br><br>I thus agree with Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. in his separate opinion that the following are not germane to the E-VAT legislation:<br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="30%">Amended TAX<br>CODE Provision<br><br></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="70%"><br>Subject Matter<br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 27</td> <td>Rate of income tax on domestic corporations<br><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 28(A)(1)</td> <td><div align="justify">Rate of income tax on resident foreign corporations<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 28(B)(1)</td> <td><div align="justify">Rate of income tax on non-resident foreign corporations<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 28(B)(5-b)</td> <td><div align="justify">Rate of income tax on intercorporate dividends received by non-resident foreign corporations<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Section 34(B)(1) </td> <td><div align="justify">Deduction from gross income</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Similarly, I agree with Justice Artemio V.

That pronouncement was made in light of Section 28(2) Article VI, which allows Congress to delegate to the President through law the power to impose tariffs and imposts, subject to limitations and restrictions as may be ordained by Congress. In the case of taxes, no such constitutional authorization exists, and the discretion to ascertain the rates, subjects, and conditions of taxation may not be delegated away by Congress.<br><br>However, as the majority correctly points out, the power to ascertain the facts or conditions as the basis of the taking into effect of a law may be delegated by Congress,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  and that the details as to the enforcement and administration of an exercise of taxing power may be delegated to executive agencies, including the power to determine the existence of facts on which its operation depends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Proceeding from these principles, Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the E-VAT Law warrant examination. The provisions read: <blockquote> SEC. 4.  Sec. 106 of the same Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: <blockquote> SEC. 106.

It is Congress, and not the President, which is authorized to raise the rate of VAT from 10% to 12%, no matter the circumstance. Yet a closer analysis of the proviso reveals that this is not exactly the operative effect of the law. The qualifier “shall” denotes a mandatory, rather than discretionary function on the part of the President to raise the rate of VAT to 12% upon the existence of any of the two listed conditions.<br><br>Since the President is not given any discretion in refusing to raise the VAT rate to 12%, there is clearly no delegation of the legislative power to tax by Congress to the executive branch. The use of the word “shall” obviates any logical construction that would allow the President leeway in not raising the tax rate. More so, it is accepted that the principle of constitutional construction that every presumption should be indulged in favor of constitutionality and the court in considering the validity of the 'statute in question should give it such reasonable construction as can be reached to bring it within the fundamental law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> While all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor, of the constitutionality of a statute,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> it should necessarily follow that the construction upheld should be one that is not itself noxious to the Constitution.<br><br>Congress should be taken to task for imperfect draftsmanship at least. Much trouble would have been avoided had the provisos instead read: “that effective January 1, 2006, the rate of value-added tax shall be raised to twelve percent (12%), after any of the following conditions has been satisfied xxx.” This, after all is the operative effect of the provision as it stands. In relation to the operation of the tax increase, the denominated role of the President and the Secretary of Finance may be regarded as a superfluity, as their <i>imprimatur</i> as a precondition to the increase of the VAT rate must have no bearing.<br><br>Nonetheless, I cannot ignore the fact that both the President and the Secretary of Finance have designated roles in the implementation of the tax increase. Considering that it is Congress, and not these officials, which properly have imposed the increase in the VAT rate, how should these roles be construed?<br><br>The enactment of a law should be distinguished from its implementation. Even if it is Congress which exercises the plenary power of taxation, it is not the body that administers the implementation of the tax. Under Section 2 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), the assessment and collection of all national internal revenue taxes, and the enforcement of all forefeitures, penalties and fines connected therewith had been previously delegated to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, under the supervision and control of the Department of Finance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as intimated earlier, Congress may delegate to other components of the government the power to ascertain the facts or conditions as the basis of the taking into effect of a law. It follows that ascertainment of the existence of the two conditions precedent for the increase as stated in the law could very well be delegated to the President or the Secretary of Finance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the apprehensions arise that the process of ascertainment of the listed conditions delegated to the Secretary of Finance and the President effectively vest discretionary authority to raise the VAT rate on the President, through the subterfuges that may be employed to delay the determination, or even to manipulate the factual premises. Assuming arguendo that these feared abuses may arise, I think it possible to seek judicial enforcement of the increased VAT rate, even without the participation or consent of the President or Secretary of Finance, upon indubitable showing that any of the two listed conditions do exist. After all, the Court is ruling that the increase in the VAT rate is mandatory and beyond the discretion of the President to impose or delay.<br><br>The majority states that in making the recommendation to the President on the existence of either of the two conditions, the Secretary of Finance is acting as the agent of the legislative branch, to determine and declare the event upon which its expressed will is to take effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> This recognition of agency must be qualified. I do not doubt the ability of Congress to delegate to the Secretary of Finance administrative functions in the implementation of tax laws, as it does under Section 2 of the NIRC. Yet it would be impermissible for Congress to delegate to the Secretary of Finance the plenary function of enacting a tax law. As stated earlier, the situation stands different from that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Southern Cross</span> wherein the Constitution itself authorizes the delegation by Congress through a law to the President of the discretion to impose tariff measures, subject to restrictions and limitations provided in the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Herein, Congress cannot delegate to either the President or the Secretary of Finance the discretion to raise the tax, as such power belongs exclusively to the legislative branch.<br><br>Perhaps the term “agency” is not most suitable in describing the delegation exercised by Congress in this case, for agency implies that the agent takes on attributes of the principal by reason of representative capacity. In this case, whatever “agency” that can be appreciated would be of severely limited capacity, encompassing as it only could the administration, not enactment, of the tax measure.<br><br>I do not doubt the impression left by the provisions that it is the President, and not Congress, which is authorized to raise the VAT rate. On paper at least, these imperfect provisions could be multiple sources of mischief. On the political front, whatever blame or scorn that may be attended with the increase of the VAT rate would fall on the President, and not on Congress which actually increased the tax rate. On the legal front, a President averse to increasing the VAT rate despite the existence of the two listed conditions may take refuge in the infelicities of the provision, and refuse to do so on the ground that the law, as written, implies some form of discretion on the part of the President who was, after all, “authorized” to increase the tax rate. It is critical for the Court to disabuse this notion right now.<br><br><i>The Continued Viability of <br>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</i><br><br>One of the more crucial issues now before us, one that has seriously divided the Court, pertains to the ability of the Bicameral Conference Committee to introduce amendments to the final bill which were not contained in the House bill from which the E-VAT Law originated. Most of the points addressed by the petitioners have been settled in our ruling in <i>Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> yet a revisit of that precedent is urged upon this Court. On this score, I offer my qualified concurrence with the ponencia.<br><br>Two key provisions of the Constitution come into play: Sections 24 and 26(2), Article VI of the Constitution. They read: <blockquote> Section 24: All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.<br><br>Section 26(2): No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency. Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal. </blockquote> Section 24 is also known as the origination clause, which derives origin from British practice. From the assertion that the power to tax the public at large must reside in the representatives of the people, the principle evolved that money bills must originate in the House of Commons and may not be amended by the House of Lords.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The principle was adopted across the shores in the United States, and was famously described by James Madison in <i>The Federalist Papers</i> as follows: <blockquote> This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the most compleat and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </blockquote> There is an eminent difference from the British system from which the principle emerged, and from our own polity. To this day, only members of the British House of Commons are directly elected by the people, with the members of the House of Lords deriving their seats from hereditary peerage. Even in the United States, members of the Senate were not directly elected by the people, but chosen by state legislatures, until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Hence, the rule assured the British and American people that tax legislation arises with the consent of the sovereign people, through their directly elected representatives. In our country though, both members of the House and Senate are directly elected by the people, hence the vitality of the original conception of the rule has somewhat lost luster.<br><br>Still, the origination clause deserves obeisance in this jurisdiction, simply because it is provided in the Constitution. At the same time, its proper interpretation is settled precedent, as enunciated in <i>Tolentino</i>: <blockquote> To begin with, it is not the law — but the revenue bill — which is required by the Constitution to "originate exclusively" in the House of Representatives. It is important to emphasize this, because a bill originating in the House may undergo such extensive changes in the Senate that the result may be a rewriting of the whole. The possibility of a third version by the conference committee will be discussed later. At this point, what is important to note is that, as a result of the Senate action, a distinct bill may be produced. To insist that a revenue statute — and not only the bill which initiated the legislative process culminating in the enactment of the law — must substantially be the same as the House bill would be to deny the Senate's power not only to "concur with amendments" but also to " propose amendments." It would be to violate the coequality of legislative power of the two houses of Congress and in fact make the House superior to the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </blockquote> The vested power of the Senate to “ propose or concur with amendments” necessarily implies the ability to adduce transformations from the original House bill into the final law. Since the House and Senate sit separately in sessions, the only opportunity for the Senate to introduce its amendments would be in the Bicameral Conference Committee, which emerges only after both the House and the Senate have approved their respective bills.<br><br>In the present petitions, <i>Tolentino</i> comes under fire on two fronts. The first controversy arises from the adoption in <i>Tolentino</i> of American legislative practices relating to bicameral committees despite the difference in constitutional frameworks, particularly the limitation under Section 26(2), Article VI which does not exist in the American Constitution.<br><br>The majority points out that the “no amendment rule” refers only to the procedure to be followed by each house of Congress with regard to bills initiated in the house concerned, before said bills are transmitted to the other house for its concurrence or amendment. I agree with this statement. Clearly, the procedure under Section 26(2), Article VI only relates to the passage of a bill before the House and Senate, and not the process undertaken afterwards in the Bicameral Conference Committee.<br><br>Indeed, Sections 26 and 27 of Article VI, which detail the procedure how a bill becomes a law, are silent as to what occurs between the passage by both houses of their respective bills,  and  the  presentation  to  the  President  of “every bill passed by the Congress”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Evidently, “Congress” means both Houses, such that a bill approved by the Senate but not by the House is not presented to the President for approval. There is obviously a need for joint concurrence by the House and Senate of a bill before it is transmitted to the President, but the Constitution does not provide how such concurrence is acquired. This lacuna has to be filled, otherwise no bill may be transmitted to the President.<br><br>Even if the Bicameral Conference Committee is not a constitutionally organized body, it has existed as the necessary conclave for both chambers of Congress to reconcile their respective versions of a prospective law. The members of the Bicameral Conference Committee may possess in them the capacity to represent their particular chamber, yet the collective is neither the House nor the Senate. Hence, the procedure contained in Section 26(2), Article VI cannot apply to the Bicameral Conference Committee.<br><br>Tellingly, the version approved by the Bicameral Conference Committee still undergoes deliberation and approval by both Houses. Only one vote is taken to approve the reconciled bill, just as only one vote is taken in order to approve the original bill. Certainly, it could not be contended that this final version surreptitiously evades approval of either the House or Senate.<br><br>The second front concerns the scope and limitations of the Bicameral Conference Committee to amend, delete, or otherwise modify the bills as approved by the House and the Senate.<br><br><i>Tolentino</i> adduced the principle, adopted from American practice, that the version as approved by the Bicameral Conference Committee need only be germane to the subject of the House and Senate bills in order to be valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The majority, in applying the test of germaneness, upholds the contested provisions of the E-VAT Law. Even the members of the Court who prepared to strike down provisions of the law applying germaneness nonetheless accept the basic premise that such test is controlling.<br><br>I agree that any amendment made by the Bicameral Conference Committee that is not germane to the subject matter of the House or Senate Bills is not valid. It is the only valid ground by which an amendment introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee may be judicially stricken.<br><br>The germaneness standard which should guide Congress or the Bicameral Conference Committee should be appreciated in its <b>normal but total sense</b>.  In that regard, my views contrast with that of Justice Panganiban, who asserts that provisions that are not “legally germane” should be stricken down.  <b>The legal notion of germaneness is just but one component, along with other factors such as economics and politics, which guides the Bicameral Conference Committee, or the legislature for that matter, in the enactment of laws.</b> After all, factors such as economics or politics are expected to cast a pervasive influence on the legislative process in the first place, and it is essential as well to allow such “non-legal” elements to be considered in ascertaining whether Congress has complied with the criteria of germaneness.<br><br><b>Congress is a political body, and its rationale for legislating may be guided by factors other than established legal standards. I deem it unduly restrictive on the plenary powers of Congress to legislate, to coerce the body to adhere to judge-made standards, such as a standard of “legal germaneness”. The Constitution is the only legal standard that Congress is required to abide by in its enactment of laws.</b><br><br>Following these views, I cannot agree with the position maintained by the Chief Justice, Justices Panganiban and Azcuna that the provisions of the law that do not pertain to VAT should be stricken as unconstitutional. These would include, for example, the provisions raising corporate income taxes. The Bicameral Conference Committee, in evaluating the proposed amendments, necessarily takes into account not just the provisions relating to the VAT, but the entire revenue generating mechanism in place. If, for example, amendments to non-VAT related provisions of the NIRC were intended to offset the expanded coverage for the VAT, then such amendments are germane to the purpose of the House and Senate Bills.<br><br>Moreover, it would be myopic to consider that the subject matter of the House Bill is solely the VAT system, rather than the generation of revenue. The majority  has sufficiently demonstrated that the legislative intent behind the bills that led to the E-VAT Law was the generation of revenue to counter the country’s dire fiscal situation.<br><br>The mere fact that the law is popularly known as the E-VAT Law, or that most of its provisions pertain to the VAT, or indirect taxes, does not mean that any and all amendments which are introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee must pertain to the VAT system.

We do not concur with this contention. <b>As a policy, this Court has adopted a liberal construction of the one title - one subject rule. We have consistently ruled that the title need not mirror, fully index or catalogue all contents and minute details of a law. A law having a single general subject indicated in the title may contain any number of provisions, no matter how diverse they may be, so long as they are not inconsistent with or foreign to the general subject, and may be considered in furtherance of such subject by providing for the method and means of carrying out the general subject.</b> We hold that section 5(b) providing for tariff differential is germane to the subject of R.A. No. 8180 which is the deregulation of the downstream oil industry. The section is supposed to sway prospective investors to put up refineries in our country and make them rely less on imported petroleum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </blockquote> I submit that if the amendments are attuned to the goal of revenue generation, the stated purpose of the original House Bills, then the test of germaneness is satisfied. It might seem that the goal of revenue generation, which is stated in virtually all tax or tariff bills, is so encompassing in scope as to justify the inclusion by the Bicameral Conference Committee of just about any revenue generation measure. This may be so, but it does not mean that the test of germaneness would be rendered inutile when it comes to revenue laws.<br><br>I do believe that the test of germaneness was violated by the E-VAT Law in one regard. Section 21 of the law, which was not contained in either the House or Senate Bills, imposes restrictions on the use by local government units of their incremental revenue from the VAT. These restrictions are alien to the principal purposes of  revenue generation, or the purposes of restructuring the VAT system. I could not see how the provision, which relates to budgetary allocations, is germane to the E-VAT Law. Since it was introduced only in the Bicameral Conference Committee, the test of germaneness is essential, and the provision does not pass muster. I join Justice Puno and the Chief Justice in voting to declare Section 21 as unconstitutional.<br><br>I also offer this brief comment regarding the deletion of the so-called “no pass on” provisions, which several of my colleagues deem unconstitutional. Both the House and Senate Bills contained these provisions that would prohibit the seller/producer from passing on the cost of the VAT payments to the consumers. However, an examination of the said bills reveal that the “no pass on” provisions in the House Bill affects a different subject of taxation from that of the Senate Bill. In the House Bill No. 3705, the taxpayers who are prohibited from passing on the VAT payments are the sellers of petroleum products and electricity/power generation companies. In Senate Bill No. 1950, no prohibition was adopted as to sellers of petroleum products, but enjoined therein are electricity/power generation companies but also transmission and distribution companies.<br><br>I consider such deletions as valid, for the same reason that I deem the amendments valid. The deletion of the two disparate “no pass on” provisions which were approved by the House in one instance, and only by the Senate in the other, remains in the sphere of compromise that ultimately guides the approval of the final version. Again, I point out that even while the two provisions may have been originally approved by the House and Senate respectively, their subsequent deletion by the Bicameral Conference Committee is still subject to approval by both chambers of Congress when the final version is submitted for deliberation and voting.<br><br>Moreover, the fact that the nature of the “no pass on” provisions adopted by the House essentially differs from that of the Senate necessarily required the corrective relief from the Bicameral Conference Committee. The Committee could have either insisted on the House version, the Senate version, or both versions, and it is not difficult to divine that any of these steps would have obtained easy approval. Hence, the deletion altogether of the “no pass on” provisions existed as a tangible solution to the possible impasse, and the Committee should be accorded leeway to implement such a compromise, especially considering that the deletion would have remained germane to the law, and would not be constitutionally prohibited since the prohibition on amendments under Section 26(2), Article VI does not apply to the Committee.<br><br>An outright declaration that the deletion of the two elementally different “no-pass on” provisions is unconstitutional, is of dubious efficacy in this case. Had such pronouncement gained endorsement of a majority of the Court, it could not result in the <i>ipso facto</i> restoration of the provision, the omission of which was ultimately approved in both the House and Senate. Moreover, since the House version of the “no pass on” is quite different from that of the Senate, there would be a question as to whether the  House version, the Senate version, or both versions would be reinstated. And of course, if it were the Court which would be called upon to choose, such would be way beyond the bounds of judicial power.<br><br>Indeed, to intimate that the Court may require Congress to reinstate a provision that failed to meet legislative approval would result in a blatant violation of the principle of separation of powers, with the Court effectively dictating to Congress the content of its legislation. The Court cannot simply decree to Congress what laws or provisions to enact, but is limited to reviewing those enactments which are actually ratified by the legislature.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>My earlier views, as are the submissions I am about to offer, are rooted in nothing more than constitutional interpretation. Perhaps my preceding discussion may lead to an impression that I whole-heartedly welcome the passage of the E-VAT Law. Yet whatever relief I may have over the enactment of a law designed to relieve our country’s financial woes are sadly obviated with the realization that a key amendment introduced in the law is not only unconstitutional, but of fatal consequences. The clarion call of judicial review is most critical when it stands as the sole barrier against the deprivation of life, liberty and property without due process of law. It becomes even more impelling now as we are faced with provisions of the E-VAT Law which, though in bland disguise, would operate as the most destructive of tax measures enacted  in generations.<br><br><i>Tax Statutes and the Due Process Clause</i><br><br>It is the duty of the courts to nullify laws that contravene the due process clause of the Bill of Rights. This task is at the heart not only of judicial review, but of the democratic system, for the fundamental guarantees in the Bill of Rights become merely hortatory if their judicial enforcement is unavailing. Even if the void law in question is a tax statute, or one that encompasses national economic policy, the courts should not shirk from striking it down notwithstanding any notion of deference to the executive or legislative branch on questions of policy. Neither Congress nor the President has the right to enact or enforce unconstitutional laws.<br><br>The Bill of Rights is by no means the only constitutional yardstick by which the validity of a tax law can be measured. Nonetheless, it stands as the most unyielding of constitutional standards, given its position of primacy in the fundamental law way above the articles on governmental power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> If the question lodged, for example, hinges on the proper exercise of legislative powers in the enactment of the tax law, leeway can be appreciated in favor of affirming the legislature’s inherent power to levy taxes. On the other hand, no quarter can be ceded, no concession yielded, on the people’s fundamental rights as enshrined in the Bill of Rights, even if the sacrifice is ostensibly made “in the national interest.” It is my understanding that “the national interests,” however comported, always subsumes in the first place recognition and enforcement of the Bill of Rights, which manifests where we stand as a democratic society.<br><br>The constitutional safeguard of due process is embodied in the fiat “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The purpose of the guaranty is to prevent governmental encroachment against the life, liberty and property of individuals; to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of the government, unrestrained by the established principles of private rights and distributive justice; to protect property from confiscation by legislative enactments, from seizure, forfeiture, and destruction without a trial and conviction by the ordinary mode of judicial procedure; and to secure to all persons equal and impartial justice and the benefit of the general law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In <i>Magnano Co. v. Hamilton</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the due process clause may be utilized to strike down a taxation statute, “if the act be so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it does not involve an exertion of the taxing power, but constitutes, in substance and effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden power, as, for example, the confiscation of property.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Locally, Sison v. Ancheta<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> has long provided sanctuary for persons assailing the constitutionality of taxing statutes. The oft-quoted pronouncement of Justice Fernando follows: <blockquote><ol start="2"> <li>The power to tax moreover, to borrow from Justice Malcolm, "is an attribute of sovereignty. It is the strongest of all the powers of government." <b>It is, of course, to be admitted that for all its plenitude, the power to tax is not unconfined. There are restrictions. The Constitution sets forth such limits. Adversely affecting as it does property rights, both the due process and equal protection clauses may properly be invoked, as petitioner does, to invalidate in appropriate cases a revenue measure.</b> If it were otherwise, there would be truth to the 1803 dictum of Chief Justice Marshall that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." In a separate opinion in Graves v. New York, Justice Frankfurter, after referring to it as an "unfortunate remark," characterized it as "a flourish of rhetoric [attributable to] the intellectual fashion of the times [allowing] a free use of absolutes." This is merely to emphasize that it is not and there cannot be such a constitutional mandate. Justice Frankfurter could rightfully conclude: "The web of unreality spun from Marshall's famous dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes's pen: 'The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.'" So it is in the Philippines.<br><br></li><li>This Court then is left with no choice. <b>The Constitution as the fundamental law overrides any legislative or executive act that runs counter to it. In any case therefore where it can be demonstrated that the challenged statutory provision — as petitioner here alleges — fails to abide by its command, then this Court must so declared and adjudge it null.</b> The inquiry thus is centered on the question of whether the imposition of a higher tax rate on taxable net income derived from business or profession than on compensation is constitutionally infirm.<br><br></li><li>The difficulty confronting petitioner is thus apparent. He alleges arbitrariness. A mere allegation, as here, does not suffice. There must be a factual foundation of such unconstitutional taint. Considering that petitioner here would condemn such a provision as void on its face, he has not made out a case. This is merely to adhere to the authoritative doctrine that where the due process and equal protection clauses are invoked, considering that they are not fixed rules but rather broad standards, there is a need for proof of such persuasive character as would lead to such a conclusion. Absent such a showing, the presumption of validity must prevail.<br><br></li><li><b>It is undoubted that the due process clause may be invoked where a taxing statute is so arbitrary that it finds no support in the Constitution. An obvious example is where it can be shown to amount to the confiscation of property. That would be a clear abuse of power. It then becomes the duty of this Court to say that such an arbitrary act amounted to the exercise of an authority not conferred. That properly calls for the application of the Holmes dictum. It has also been held that where the assailed tax measure is beyond the jurisdiction of the state, or is not for a public purpose, or, in case of a retroactive statute is so harsh and unreasonable, it is subject to attack on due process grounds.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote> <i>Sison</i> pronounces more concretely how a tax statute may contravene the due process clause. Arbitrariness, confiscation, overstepping the state’s jurisdiction, and lack of a public purpose are all grounds for nullity encompassed under the due process invocation.<br><br>Yet even these more particular standards as enunciated in <i>Sison</i> are quite exacting, and difficult to reach. Even the constitutional challenge posed in <i>Sison</i> failed to pass muster. The <i>ponencia</i> cites <i>Sison</i> in asserting that due process and equal protection are broad standards which need proof of such persuasive character to lead to such a conclusion.<br><br>It is difficult though to put into quantifiable terms how onerous a taxation statute must be before it contravenes the due process clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> After all, the inherent nature of taxation is to cause pain and injury to the taxpayer, albeit for the greater good of society. Perhaps whatever collective notion there may be of what constitutes an arbitrary, confiscatory, and unreasonable tax might draw more from the fairy tale/legend traditions of absolute monarchs and the oppressed peasants they tax. Indeed, it is easier to jump to the conclusion that a tax is oppressive and unfair if it is imposed by a tyrant or an authoritarian state.<br><br>But could an arbitrary, confiscatory or unreasonable tax actually be enacted by a democratic state such as ours? Of course it could, but these would exist in more palatable guises. In a democratic society wherein statutes are enacted by a representative legislature only after debate and deliberation, tax statutes will most likely, on their face, seem fair and even-handed. After all, if Congress passes a tax law that on facial examination is obviously harsh and unfair, it faces the wrath of the voting public, to say nothing of the media.<br><br>In testing the validity of a tax statute as against the due process clause, I think that the Court should go beyond a facial examination of the statute, and seek to understand how exactly it would operate. The express terms of a statute, especially tax laws, are usually inadequate in spelling out the practical effects of its implementation.  The devil is usually in the details.<br><br>Admittedly, the degree of difficulty involved of judicial review of tax laws has increased with the growing complexities of business, economic and accounting practices. These are sciences which laymen are not normally equipped by their general education to fully grasp, hence the possible insecurity on their part when confronted with such questions on these fields.<br><br>However, we should not cede ground to those transgressions of the people’s fundamental rights simply because the mechanism employed to violate constitutional guarantees is steeped in disciplines not normally associated with the legal profession. Venality cannot be allowed to triumph simply due to its sophistication. This petition imputes in the E-VAT Law unconstitutional oppression of the fatal variety, but in order to comprehend exactly how and why that is so, one has to delve into the complex milieu of the VAT system. The party alleging the law’s unconstitutionality of course has the burden to demonstrate the violations in understandable terms, but if such proof is presented, the Court’s duty is to engage accordingly.<br><br><i>The Viability of the Clear and Present <br>Danger Doctrine as Counterweight <br>To the Shibboleths of Speculation <br>and Wisdom</i><br><br>I do not see as an impediment to the annulment of a tax law the fact that it has yet to be implemented, or the fear that doing so constitutes an undue attack on the wisdom, rather than the legality of a statute. However, my position in this petition has been challenged on those grounds, and I see it fit to refute these preemptive allegations before delving into the operative aspect of the E-VAT Law.<br><br><b>If there is cause to characterize my arguments as speculative, it is only because the E-VAT Law has yet to be implemented.</b> No person as of yet can claim to have sustained actual injury by reason of the implementation of the assailed provisions in G.R. No. 168461. Yet this should not mean that the Court is impotent from declaring a provision of law as violative of the due process clause if it is clear that its implementation will cause the illegal deprivation  of life, liberty or property without due process of law. This is especially so if, as in this case, the injury is of mathematical certainty, and the extent of the loss quantifiable through easy reference to the most basic of business practices.<br><br><b>These arguments are conjectural for the same reason that the bare statement “firing a gunshot into the head will cause a fatal wound” would be conjectural.</b> Some people are lucky enough to survive gunshot wounds to the head, while many others are not. Yet just because the fear of mortality would be merely speculative, it does not mean that there should be less compulsion to avoid a situation of getting shot in the head.<br><br>Indeed, the Court has long responded to strike down prospective actions, even if the injury has not yet even occurred. <b>One of the most significant legal principles of the last century, the “clear and present danger” doctrine in free speech cases, in fact emanates from the prospectivity, and not the actuality of danger.</b> The Court has not been hesitant to nullify acts which might cause injury, owing to the presence of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil which the State has the right to prevent. It has even extended the “clear and present danger rule”  beyond  the  confines  of  freedom  of expression to the realm of freedom of religion, as noted by Justice Puno in his <i>ponencia</i> in <i>Estrada v. Escritor.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Justice Teodoro Padilla goes further in his concurring opinion in Basco v. PAGCOR, and asserts that the clear and present danger test squarely applies to the due process clause: “<b>The courts, as the decision states, cannot inquire into the wisdom, morality or expediency of policies adopted by the political departments of government in areas which fall within their authority, except only when such policies pose a clear and present danger to the life, liberty or property of the individual.”<br><br>I see no reason why the clear and present danger test cannot apply in this case, or any case wherein a taxing statute poses a clear and present danger to the life, liberty or property of the individual. The application of this standard frees the Court from inutility in the face of patently unconstitutional tax laws that have been enacted but are yet to be fully operational.</b><br><br>If for example, Congress deems it wise to impose the most draconian of tax measures â”€ such as trebling the income taxes of all persons over 40, raising the gross sales tax rate to 50%, or penalizing delinquent taxpayers with 50 lashes of the whip â”€ there certainly would be a massive public outcry, and an expectation that the Court would immediately nullify the offensive measures even before they are actually imposed. Applying the clear and present danger test, the Court is empowered to strike down the noxious measures even before they are implemented. Yet with this “bar on speculativeness” as argued by the majority, the Court could easily refuse to pay heed to the prayers for injunctive relief, and instead demand that the taxing subjects must first suffer before the Court can act.<br><br>In the same vein, the claim that my arguments strike at the wisdom, rather than the constitutionality of the law are misplaced. Concededly, the assailed provisions of the E-VAT law are basically unwise. But any provision of law that directly contradicts the Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights, are similarly unwise, as they run inconsistent with the fundamental law of the land, the enunciated state policies and the elemental guarantees assured by the State to its people. <b>Not every unwise law is unconstitutional, but every unconstitutional law is unwise, for an unconstitutional law contravenes a primordial principle or guarantee on which our polity is founded.</b><br><br>If it can be shown that the E-VAT Law violates these provisions of the Constitution, especially the due process clause, then the Court should accordingly act and nullify. Such is the essence of judicial review, which stands as the sole barrier to  the implementation of an unconstitutional law.<br><br>The <i>Separate Opinion</i> of Justice Panganiban notes that “[t]he Court cannot step beyond the confines of its constitutional power, if there is absolutely no clear showing of grave abuse of discretion in the enactment of the law”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>. This, I feel, is an unduly narrow view of judicial review, implying that such merely encompasses the procedural aspect by which a law is enacted. If the policy of the law, and/or the means by which such policy is implemented run counter to the Constitution, then the Court is empowered to strike down the law, even if the legislative and executive branches act within their discretion in legislating and signing the law.<br><br>It is also asserted that if the implementation of the 70% cap imposes an unequal effect on different types of businesses with varying profit margins and capital requirements, then the remedy would be an amendment of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Of course, the remedy of legislative amendment applies to even the most unconstitutional of laws. But if our society can take cold comfort in the ability of the legislature to amend its enactments as the defense against unconstitutional laws, what remains then as the function of judicial review? This legislative capacity to amend unconstitutional laws runs concurrently with the judicial capacity to strike down unconstitutional laws. In fact, the long-standing tradition has been reliance on the judicial branch, and not the legislative branch, for salvation from unconstitutional laws.<br><br>I do recognize that the Separate Opinion of Justice Panganiban ultimately proceeds from the premise that the assailed provisions of the E-VAT Law may be merely unwise, but not unconstitutional. Hence, its preference to rely on Congress to amend the offending provisions rather than judicial nullification. But I maintain that the assailed provisions of the E-VAT Law violate the due process clause of the Constitution and must be stricken down.<br><br><i>The Nature of VAT</i><br><br>To understand why Sections 8 and 12 of the E-VAT law contravenes the due process clause, it is essential to understand the nature of the value-added tax itself. Filipino consumers may comprehend VAT at its elemental form, having been accustomed for several years now in paying an extra 10% of the listed selling price for a wide class of consumer goods. From the perspective of the end consumer, such as the patron who purchases a meal from a fastfood restaurant, VAT is simply a tax on transactions involving the sale of goods. The tax is shouldered by the buyer, and is based on a percentage of the purchase price. Since an excise or percentage tax shares the same characteristics, there could be some confusion as between such taxes and the VAT.<br><br>However, VAT is distinguishable from the standard excise or percentage taxes in that it is imposable not only on the final transaction involving the end user, but on previous stages as well so long as there was a sale involved. Thus, VAT does not simply pertain to the extra percentage paid by the buyer of a fast-food meal, but also that paid by restaurant itself to its suppliers of raw food products. This multi-stage system is more acclimated to the vagaries of the modern industrial climate, which has long surpassed the stage when there was only one level of transfer between the farmer who harvests the crop and the person who eats the crop. Indeed, from the extraction or production of the raw material to its final consumption by a user, several transactions or sales materialize. The VAT system assures that the government shall reap income for every transaction that is had, and not just on the final sale or transfer.<br><br>The European Union, which has long required its member states to apply the VAT system, provided the following definition of the tax which I deem clear and comprehensive: <blockquote> The principle of the common system of value added tax involves the application to goods and services of a general tax on consumption <b>exactly proportional to the price of the goods and services, whatever the number of transactions that take place in the production and distribution process</b> before the stage at which tax is charged.<br><br>On each transaction, value added tax, calculated on the price of the goods or services at the rate applicable to such goods or services, <b>shall be chargeable after deduction of the amount of value added tax borne directly by the various cost components.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </blockquote> The above definition alludes to a key characteristic of the VAT system, that the imposable tax remains proportional to the price of goods and services no matter the number of transactions that takes place.<br><br>There is another key characteristic of the VAT â”€ that no matter how many the taxable transactions that precede the final purchase or sale, it is the end-user, or the consumer, that ultimately shoulders the tax. Despite its name, VAT is generally not intended to be a tax on value added, but rather as a tax on consumption. Hence, there is a mechanism in the VAT system that enables firms to offset the tax they have paid on their own purchases of goods and services against the tax they charge on their sales of goods and services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Section 105 of the NIRC assures that ”the amount of tax may be shifted or passed on to the buyer, transferee or lessee of the goods, properties or services.” The assailed provisions of the E-VAT law strike at the heart of this accepted principle.<br><br>And there is one final basic element of the VAT system integral to this disquisition: the mode by which the tax is remitted to the government. In simple theory, the VAT payable can be remitted to the government immediately upon the occurrence of the transaction, but such a demand proves excessively unwieldy. The number of VAT covered transactions a modern enterprise may contract in a single day, plus the recognized principle that it is the final end user who ultimately shoulders the tax; render the remittance of the tax on a per transaction basis impossible.<br><br>Thus, the VAT is delivered by the purchaser not directly to the government but to the seller, who then collates the VAT received and remits it to the government every quarter. The process may seem simple if cast in this manner, but there is a wrinkle, due to the offsetting mechanism designed to ultimately make the end consumer bear the cost of the VAT.<br><br><i>The Concepts of Input and <br>Output VAT</i><br><br>This mechanism is employed through the introduction of two concepts, the input tax and the output tax. Section 110(A) of the National Internal Revenue Code defines the input tax as the VAT due from or paid by a VAT-registered person on the importation of goods or local purchase of goods and services in the course of trade or business, from a VAT registered person.<br><br>Let us put this in operational terms. A VAT registered person, engaged in an enterprise, necessarily purchases goods such as raw materials and machinery in order to produce consumer goods. The purchase of such raw materials and machineries is subject to VAT, hence the enterprise pays an additional 10% of the purchase price to the supplier as VAT. This extra amount paid by the enterprise constitutes its input VAT. The enterprise likewise pays input VAT when it purchases services covered by the tax, or rentals of property.<br><br>Since VAT is a final tax that is supposed to be ultimately shouldered by the end consumer, the VAT system allows for a mechanism by which the business is able to recover the input VAT that it paid. This comes into play when the business, having transformed the raw materials into consumer goods, sells these goods to the public. As widely known, the consumer pays to the business an additional amount of 10% of the purchase price as VAT. As to the business, this VAT payments it collects from the consumer represents output VAT, which is formally described under Section 110(A) of the NIRC as “the value-added tax due on the sale or lease of taxable goods or properties or services by” by any VAT-registered person.<br><br>The output VAT collected by the business from the consumers accumulates, until the end of every quarter, when the enterprise is obliged to remit the collected output VAT to the government. This is where the crediting mechanism comes into play. Since the business is entitled to recover the prepaid input VAT, it does so in every quarter by applying the amount of prepaid input VAT against the collected output VAT which is to be remitted. If the output VAT collected exceeds the prepaid input VAT, then the amount of input VAT is deducted from the output VAT, and it is entitled to remit only the remainder as output VAT to the government. To illustrate, if Business X collects P1,000,000.00 as output VAT and incurs P500,000.00 as input VAT, the P500,000.00 is deducted from the P1,000,000.00 output VAT, and X is required to remit only P500,000.00 of the output VAT it collected from customers.<br><br>On the other hand, if the input VAT prepaid exceeds the output VAT collected, then the business need not remit any amount as output VAT for the quarter. Moreover, the difference between the input VAT and the output VAT may be credited as input VAT by the business in the succeeding quarter. Thus, if in the First Quarter of a year, Business X prepays P1,000,000.00 as input VAT, and collects only P500,000.00 as output VAT, it need not remit any amount of output VAT to the government. Moreover, in the Second Quarter, Business X can credit the remaining P500,000.00 as part of its input VAT for that quarter. Hence, if in the Second Quarter, X actually prepays P400,000.00 as input VAT, and collects P500,000.00 as output VAT, it may add the P500,000.00 input VAT from the previous quarter to the P400,000.00 prepaid in the current quarter, bringing the total input VAT it could claim to P900,000.00. Since the input VAT of P900,000.00 now exceeds the output VAT collected of P500,000, then X need not remit any output VAT as well to the government for the Second Quarter.<br><br>However, reality is far bleaker than that befaced by Business X. The VAT collected and remitted is not the most relevant statistic evaluated by the business. The figure of primary concern of the enterprise would be the profit margin, which is simply the excess of revenue less expenditures. Revenue is derived from the gross sales of the business. Expenditures encompass all expenses incurred by the business including overhead expenses, wages and purchases of capital goods. Crucially, expenditures would include the input VAT prepaid by the business on its capital expenditures.<br><br>Since a significant amount of the capital outlay incurred by a business is subjected to the prepayment of input taxes, the necessity of recovering these losses through the output VAT collected becomes more impelling. These output taxes are obviously proportional to the volume of gross sales  the higher the gross sales â”€ the higher the output VAT collected. <b>The output taxes collected on sales answer for not only those input taxes paid on the purchase of the raw materials, but also for the input taxes paid on the multifarious overhead expenses covered by VAT.</b> The burden carried by the sales volume on the stability, if not survival of the business thus just became more crucial. The maintenance of the proper equilibrium is not an easy matter. Increasing the selling price of the goods sold does not necessarily increase the gross sales, as it could have the counter-effect of repelling the consumer and diminishing the number of goods sold. At the same time, keeping the selling price low may increase the volume of goods sold, but not necessarily the amount of gross sales.<br><br>Profit is a chancy matter, and in cases of small to medium enterprises, usually small if any. It is quite common for retail and distribution enterprises to incur profits of less than 1% of their gross revenues. Low profitability is not an automatic badge of poor business skills, but a reality dictated by the laws of the marketplace. The probability of profit is lower than that of capital expenditures, and ultimately, many business establishments end up with a higher input tax than output tax in a given quarter. This would be especially true for small to medium enterprises who do not reap sufficient profits from its business in the first place, and for those firms that opt to also invest in capital expenses in addition to the overhead. Whatever miniscule profit margins that can be obtained usually spell the difference between life and death of the business.<br><br>The possibility of profit is further diminished by the fact that businesses have to shoulder the input VAT in the purchase of their capital expenses. <b>Yet the erstwhile VAT system was not tainted by the label of oppressiveness and neither did it bear the confiscatory mode. This was because of the immediate relief afforded from the input taxes paid by the crediting system. In theory, VAT is not supposed to affect the profit margin. If such margin is affected, it is only because of the prepayment of the input taxes, and this should be remedied by the immediate recovery through the crediting system of the settled input taxes.<br><br>The new E-VAT law changes all that, and puts in jeopardy the survival of small to medium enterprises.</b><br><br><i>The Effects of the 70% Cap on Creditable Input VAT</i><br><br>The first radical shift introduced by the E-VAT law to the creditable input system â”€ the 70% cap on the creditable input tax that may be carried over into the next quarter â”€ is provided in Section 8 of the law, which amends Section 110(A) of the NIRC, among others. Section 110(A) as amended would now read: <blockquote> Sec. 110. Tax Credits. – <br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr align="justify" valign="top"> <td style="text-align: center;" width="10%">(B)</td> <td width="90%"><span style="font-style: italic;">Excess Output or Input Tax.</span> – If at the end of any taxable quarter the output tax exceeds the input tax, the excess shall be paid by the VAT-registered person.

(emphasis supplied)</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> All hope for entrepreneurial stability is dashed with the imposition of the 70% cap. Under the E-VAT Law, the business, regardless of stability or financial capability, is obliged to remit to the government every quarter at least 30% of the output VAT collected from customers, or roughly 3% of the amount of gross sales. Thus, if a quarterly gross sales of Y Business totaled P1,000,000, and Y is prudent enough to keep its capital expenses down to P980,000, it would then appear on paper that Y incurred a profit of P20,000. However, with the 70% cap, Y would be obliged to remit to the government P30,000, thus wiping out the profit margin for the quarter. Y would be entitled to credit the excess input VAT it prepaid for the next quarter, but the continuous operation of the 70% cap obviates whatever benefits this may give, and cause the accumulation of the unutilized creditable input VAT which should be returned to the business.<br><br>The difference is even more dramatic if seen how the unutilized creditable input VAT accumulates over a one year period. To illustrate, Business Y prepays the following amounts of input VAT over a one-year period: P100,000.00 - First Quarter; P100,000.00 – 2nd Quarter; P34,000.00 – 3rd Quarter; and P50,000.00 – 4th Quarter. On the other hand, Y collects the following amounts of output VAT from consumers: P60,000.00 - First Quarter; P60,000.00 – 2nd Quarter; P100,000.00 – 3rd Quarter; and P50,000.00 – 4th Quarter. Applying the 70% cap, which would limit the amount of the declarable input VAT to 70% in a quarter, the following results obtain, as presented in tabular form: <br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%">Particulars</td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">1<sup>st</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">2<sup>nd</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">3<sup>rd</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">4<sup>th</sup> Quarter</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Output VAT</td> <td><div align="right">60,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">60,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">100,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">50,000</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Input VAT (<em>Actual</em>) + Carry Over </td> <td style="text-align: right;">100,000</td> <td><div align="right">100,000<br> [input] <br>+58,000<br> [excess creditable]<br> <br> 158,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">34,000<br> [input]<br> +116,000<br> [excess creditable]<br> <br>150,000</div></td> <td> <div align="right">  50,000<br> [input]<br> +80,000<br> [excess creditable]<br><br>130,000</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><em>Declarable</em> Input VAT (70% of output VAT)</td> <td><div align="right">(60,000x70%)<br><br> 42,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(60,000x70%)<br><br> 42,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(100,000x70%)<br><br> 70,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(50,000x70%)<br><br> 35,000</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Lower of actual and 70% cap – allowable <br>VAT Payable </td> <td><div align="right">(60,000 -42,000)<br><br><br><br> 18,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(60,000 -42,000)<br><br><br><br> 18,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(100,000-<br>70,000)<br><br><br><br>30,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(50,000- 35,000)<br><br><br><br> 15,000</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><em>Creditable</em><br> Input VAT </td> <td><div align="right">(100,000 – 42,000)<br> 58,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(158,000 – 42,000)<br> 116,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(150,000-<br> 70,000)<br> 80,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">(130,000- 35,000)<br> 95,000</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>This stands in contrast to same business VAT accountability under the present system, using the same variables of output VAT and input VAT. The need to distinguish a declarable input VAT is obviated with the elimination of the 70% cap. <br><blockquote> <table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%">Particulars    </td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">1<sup>st</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">2<sup>nd</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">3<sup>rd</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="right">4<sup>th</sup> Quarter</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Output VAT</td> <td><div align="right">60,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">60,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">100,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">50,000</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Input VAT (Actual) + Carry Over</td> <td><div align="right"><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>100,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">100,000<br>[input]<br> +40,000<br> [excess creditable]<br> <br>140,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">34,000<br> [input]<br> +80,000<br> [excess creditable]<br> <br>114,000</div></td> <td><div align="right">50,000<br> [input]<br> + 14,000<br> (excess<br> creditable)<br> <br>50,000</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>VAT Payable    </td> <td><div align="right">0</div></td> <td><div align="right">0</div></td> <td><div align="right">0</div></td> <td><div align="right">0</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Creditable<br>Input VAT    </td> <td><div align="right"><br>40,000</div></td> <td><div align="right"><br>80,000</div></td> <td><div align="right"><br>14,000</div></td> <td><div align="right"><br>14,000</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The difference is dramatic, as is the impact on the business’s profit margin and available cash on hand. Under normal conditions, small to medium enterprises are already encumbered with the likelihood of obtaining only a minimal profit margin. Without the 70% cap, those businesses would nonetheless be able to expect an immediate return on its input taxes earlier advanced, taxes which under the VAT system it is not supposed to shoulder in the first place. However, with the 70% cap in place, the unutilized input taxes would continue to accumulate, and the enterprise precluded from immediate recovery thereof.<b> The inability to utilize these input taxes, which could spell the difference between profit and loss, solvency and insolvency, will eventually impair, if not kill off the enterprise.</b><br><br>The majority fails to consider one of the most important concepts in finance, time value for money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Simply put, the value of one peso is worth more today than in 2006. Money that you hold today is worth more because you can invest it and earn interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> By reason of the 70% cap, the amount of input VAT credit that remains unutilized would continue accumulate for months and years. The longer the amount remains unutilized, the higher the degree of its depreciation in value, in accordance with the concept of time value of money. Even assuming that the business eventually recovers the input VAT credit, the sum recovered would have decreased in practical value.<br><br><b>It would be sad, but fair, if a business ceases because of its inability to compete with other businesses. It would be utter malevolence to condemn an enterprise to death solely through the employment of a deceptive accounting wizardry. For the raison d’etre of this 70% cap is to make it appear on paper that the government is more solvent than it actually is.</b> Conceding for the nonce, there is a temporary advantage gained by the government by this 70% cap, as the steady remittance by businesses of the 30% output VAT would assure a cash flow. Such collection may only momentarily resolve an endemic problem in our local tax system, the problem of collection itself.<br><br>If the 70% cap was designed in order to enhance revenue collection, then I submit that the means employed stand beyond reason. If sheer will proves insufficient in assuring that the State all taxes due it, there should be allowable discretion for the government to formulate creative means to enhance collection. But to do so by depriving low profit enterprises of whatever meager income earned and consequently assuring the death of these industries goes beyond any valid State purpose.<br><br>Only stable businesses with substantial cash flows, or extraordinarily successful enterprises will be able to remain in operation should the 70% cap be retained. The effect of the 70% cap is to effectively impose a tax amounting to 3% of gross revenue. The amount may seem insignificant to those without working knowledge of the ways of business, but anybody who is actually familiar with business would be well aware the profit margins of the retailing and distribution sectors typically amount to less than 1% of the gross revenues. A taxpayer has to earn a margin of at least 3% on gross revenue in order to recoup the losses sustained due to the 70% cap. But as stated earlier, profits are chancy, and the entrepreneur does not have full control of the conditions that lead to profit.<br><br>Even more galling is the fact that the 70% cap, oppressive as it already is to the business establishment, even limits the options of the business to recover the unutilized input VAT credit. During the deliberations, the argument was raised that the problem presented by the 70% cap was a business problem, which can only be solved by business. Yet there is only one viable option for the enterprise to resolve the problem, and that is to increase the selling price of goods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It would be incorrect to assume that increase the volume of the goods sold could solve the problem, since for items with the same purchasing cost, the effect of the 70% cap remains constant regardless of an increase in volume.<br><br>But the additional burden is not limited to the increase of prices by the retailer to the end consumer. Since VAT is a transaction tax, every level of distribution becomes subject not only to the VAT, but also to the 70% cap. The problem increases due to a cascading effect as the number of distribution levels increases since it will result in the collection of an effective 3% percentage tax at every distribution level.<br><br>In analyzing the effects of the 70% cap, and appreciating how it violates the due process clause, we should not focus solely on the end consumers. Undoubtedly, consumers will face hardships due to the increased prices, but their threshold of physical survival, as individual people, is significantly less than that of enterprises. Somehow, I do not think the new E-VAT would generally deprive consumers of the bare necessities such as food, water, shelter and clothing. There may be significant deprivation of comfort as a result, but not of life.<br><br>The same does not hold true for businesses. The standard of “deprivation of life” of juridical persons employs different variables than that of natural persons. What food and water may be for persons, profit is for an enterprise  the bare necessity for survival. For businesses, the implementation of the same law, with the 70% cap and 60-month amortization period, would mean the deprivation of profit, which is the determinative necessity for the survival of a business.<br><br>It is easy to admonish both the consumer and the enterprise to cut back on expenditures to survive the new E-VAT Law. However, this can be realistically expected only of the consumer. The small/medium enterprise cannot just cut back easily on expenditures in order to survive the implementation of the E-VAT Law. For such businesses, expenditures do not normally contemplate unnecessary expenses such as executive perks which can be dispensed with without injury to the enterprises. These expenditures pertain to expenses necessary for the survival of the enterprise, such as wages, overhead and purchase of raw materials. Those three basic items of expenditure cannot simply be reduced, as to do so with impair the ability of the business to operate on a daily basis.<br><br>And reduction of expenditures is not the exclusive antidote to these impositions under the E-VAT Law, as there must also be a corresponding increase in the amount of gross sales. To do so though, would require an increase in the selling price, dampening consumer enthusiasm, and further impairing the ability of the enterprise to recover from the E-VAT Law. This is your basic Catch-22<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> situation — no matter which means the enterprise employs to recover from the E-VAT Law, it will still go down in flames.<br><br>Section 8 of the E-VAT law, while ostensibly even-handed in application, fails to appreciate valid substantial distinctions between large scale enterprises and small and medium enterprises. The latter group, owing to the limited capability for capital investment, subsists on modest profit margins, whereas the former expects, by reason of its substantial capital investments, a high margin. <b>In essentially prohibiting the recovery of small profit margins, the E-VAT law effectively sends the message that only high margin businesses are welcome to do business in the Philippines. It stifles any entrepreneurial ambitions of Filipinos unfortunate enough to have been born poor yet seek a better life by sacrificing all to start a small business.</b><br><br>Among the enunciated State policies in the Constitution, as stated in Section 20, Article II, is that “the State recognizes the indispensable role of the private sector, encourages private enterprise, and provides incentives to needed investments.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The provision, as with other declared State policies in the Constitution, have sufficient import and consequence such that in assessing the constitutionality of the governmental action, these  provisions should be considered and weighed as against the rationale for the assailed State action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The incompatibility of the 70% cap with this provision is patent.<br><br>Pilipinas Shell Dealers, on whom the burden to establish the violation of due process and equal protection lies, offers the following chart of the income statement of a typical petroleum dealer:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> <b>QUARTERLY PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENT</b><br><b>DEALER “A” </b><br></div><b><br> </b> <table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="center"> <td width="34%"> <br></td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="22%">Price</td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="22%">VAT (without 70% cap)</td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="22%">VAT<br> (with <br>70% cap)</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Sales/Output<br>    </td> <td style="text-align: center;">32,748,534</td> <td style="text-align: center;">3,274,853.40</td> <td style="text-align: center;">3,274,853.40</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Cost of Sales</td> <td style="text-align: center;">31,834,717</td> <td style="text-align: center;">3,183,471.70</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Gross Margin</td> <td style="text-align: center;">     913,817</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Operating Expenses Non-vatable items<br>Vatable Items</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br>     536,249<br>     317,584</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br> <br>     31,758.40</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Total Cost</td> <td style="text-align: center;">     853,833</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Net Profit</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>       59,984</strong></td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Total Input Tax</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;">3,215,230.10</td> <td style="text-align: center;">2,292,397.38</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>VAT Payable</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> <td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">      59,623.30</td> <td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">    982,456.02</td> </tr> <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF" valign="top"> <td colspan="3">Unutilized Input VAT </td> <td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">    922,832.72</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><b>*computed by multiplying output VAT by 70% [3,274,853.40 x 70% = 2,292.397.38]</b><br></blockquote>The presentation of the Pilipinas Shell Dealers more or less jibes with my own observations on the impact of the 70% cap.

It is a burden designed, either through sheer heedlessness or cruel calculation, to kill off the small and medium enterprises that are the soul, if not the heart, of our  economy. It is not merely an undue taking of property, but constitutes an unjustified taking of life as well.<br><br>And what legitimate, germane purposes does this lethal 70% cap serve? It certainly does not increase the government’s revenue since the unutilized creditable input VAT should be entered in the government books as a debt payable as it is supposed to be eventually repaid to the taxpayer, and so on the contrary it increases the government’s debts. I do see that the 70% cap temporarily allows the government to brag to the world of an increased cash flow. But this situation would be akin to the provincial man who borrows from everybody in the barrio in order to show off money and maintain the pretense of prosperity to visiting city relatives. The illusion of wealth is hardly a legitimate state purpose, especially if projected at the expense of the very business life of the country.</b><br><br>The majority, in an effort to belittle these concerns, points out that that the excess input tax remains creditable in succeeding quarters. However, as seen in the above illustration, the actual application of the excess input tax will always be limited by the amount of output taxes collected in a quarter, as a result of the 70% cap. Thus, it is entirely possible that a VAT-registered person, through the accumulation of unutilized input taxes, would have in a quarter an express creditable input tax of P50,000,000, but would be allowed to actually credit only P70,000 if the output tax collected for that quarter were only P100,000.<br><br>The burden of the VAT may fall at first to the immediate buyers, but it is supposed to be eventually shifted to the end-consumer. The 70% cap effectively prevents this from happening, as it limits the ability of the business to recover the prepaid input taxes. This is unconscionable,  since  in  the  first  place, these intervening players — the manufacturers, producers, traders, retailers — are not even supposed to sustain the losses incurred by reason of the prepayment of the input taxes. Worse, they would be obliged every quarter to pay to the government from out of their own pockets the equivalent of 30% of the output taxes, no matter their own particular financial condition. Worst, this twin yoke on the taxpayer of having to sustain a debit equivalent to 30% of output taxes, and having to await forever in order to recover the prepaid taxes would impair the cash flow and prove fatal for a shocking number of businesses which, as they now stand, have to make do with a minimum profit that stands to be wiped out with the introduction of the 70% cap.<br><br>Nonetheless, the majority notes that the excess creditable input tax may be the subject of a tax credit certificate, which then could be used in payment of internal revenue taxes, or a refund to the extent that such input taxes have not been applied against output taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <b>What the majority fails to mention is that under Section 10 of the E-VAT Law, which amends Section 112 of the NIRC, such credit or refund may not be done while the enterprise remains operational:</b> <blockquote> SEC. 10.  Section 112 of the same Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: <blockquote> SEC. 112.  Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax.—<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>“(B) <i>Cancellation of VAT Registration.</i>— <b>A person whose registration has been cancelled due to retirement from or cessation of business or due to changes or cessation of status under Section 106(C) of this Code may, within two (2) years from the date of cancellation, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate for any unused input tax which may be used in payment of his other internal revenue taxes.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx </div></blockquote></blockquote> This stands in marked contrast to Section 112(B) of the NIRC as it read prior to this amendment. Under the previous rule, a VAT-registered person was entitled to apply for the tax credit certificate or refund paid on capital goods even while it remained in operation: <blockquote> SEC. 112. <i> Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax.</i>—<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>“(B) <i>Capital Goods </i>.— A VAT-registered person may apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of input taxes paid on capital goods imported or locally purchased, to the extent that such input taxes have not been applied against output taxes. The application may be made only within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the importation or purchase was made. </blockquote> This provision, which could have provided foreseeable and useful relief to the VAT-registered person, was deleted under the new E-VAT Law. At present, the refund or tax credit certificate may only be issued upon two instances: on zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, and upon cancellation of VAT registration due to retirement from or cessation of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <b>This is the cruelest cut of all. Only after the business ceases to be may the State be compelled to repay the entire amount of the unutilized input tax. It is like a macabre form of sweepstakes wherein the winner is to be paid his fortune only when he is already dead. <i>Aanhin pa ang damo kung patay na ang kabayo.</i></b><br><br>Moreover, the inability to immediately credit or otherwise recover the unutilized input VAT could cause such prepaid amount to actually be recognized in the accounting books as a loss. Under international accounting practices, the unutilized input VAT due to the 70% cap would not even be recognized as a deferred asset. The same would not hold true if the 70% cap were eliminated. Under the International Accounting Standards<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>, the unutilized input VAT credit is recognized as an asset “to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utili[z]ed”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, if the immediate accreditation of the input VAT credit can be obtained, as it would without the 70% cap, the asset could be recognized.<br><br>However, the same Standards hold that “[t]o the extent that it is not probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised, the deferred tax asset is not recogni[z]ed”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> As demonstrated, the continuous operation of the 70% cap precludes the recovery of input VAT prepaid months or years prior. Moreover, the inability to claim a refund or tax credit certificate until after the business has already ceased virtually renders it improbable for the input VAT to be recovered. As such, under the International Accounting Standards, it is with all likelihood that the prepaid input VAT, ostensibly creditable, would actually be reflected as a loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> What heretofore was recognized as an asset would now, with the imposition of the 70% cap, be now considered as a loss, enhancing the view that the 70% cap is ultimately confiscatory in nature.<br><br>This leads to my next point. The majority asserts that the input tax is not a property or property right within the purview of the due process clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> I respectfully but strongly disagree.<br><br>Tellingly, the BIR itself has recognized that unutilized input VAT is one of those assets, corporate attributes or property rights that, in the event of a merger, are transferred to the surviving corporation by operation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Assets would fall under the purview of property under the due process clause, and if the taxing arm of the State recognizes that such property belongs to the taxpayer and not to the State, then due respect should be given to such expert opinion.<br><br>Even under the International Accounting Standards I adverted to above, the unutilized input VAT credit may be recognized as an asset “to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utili[z]ed”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> If not probable, it would be recognized as a loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Since these international standards, duly recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission as controlling in this jurisdiction, attribute tangible gain or loss to the VAT credit, it necessarily follows that there is proprietary value attached to such gain or loss.<br><br>Moreover, the prepaid input tax represents unutilized profit, which can only be utilized if it is refunded or credited to output taxes. To assert that the input VAT is merely a privilege is to correspondingly claim that the business profit is similarly a mere privilege. The Constitution itself recognizes the right to profit by private enterprises.  As I stated earlier, one of the enunciated State policies under the Constitution is the recognition of the indispensable role of the private sector, the encouragement of private enterprise, and the provision of incentives to needed investments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Moreover, <b>the Constitution also requires the State to recognize the right of enterprises to reasonable returns on investments, and to expansion and growth.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This, I believe, encompasses profit.<br><br><i>60-Month Amortization Period</i><br><br>Another portion of Section 8 of the E-VAT Law is unconstitutional, essentially for the same reasons as above. The relevant portion reads: <blockquote> SEC. 8. Section 110 of the same Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: <blockquote> "SEC. 110. Tax Credits. –<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(A) <i>Creditable Input Tax.</i> –<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">. . . .<br></div><br><b><i>Provided,</i> That the input tax on goods purchased or imported in a calendar month for use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation is allowed under this Code, shall be spread evenly over the month of acquisition and the fifty-nine (59) succeeding months if the aggregate acquisition cost for such goods, excluding the VAT component thereof, exceeds One million pesos (P1,000,000)</b>: <i>Provided, however,</i> That if the estimated useful life of the capital good is less than five (5) years, as used for depreciation purposes, then the input VAT shall be spread over such a shorter period: <i>Provided, finally,</i> that in the case of purchase of services, lease or use of properties, the input tax shall be creditable to the purchaser, lessee or licensee upon payment of the compensation, rental, royalty or fee. </blockquote></blockquote> Again, this provision unreasonably severely limits the ability of an enterprise to recover its prepaid input VAT. On its face, it might appear injurious primarily to high margin enterprises, whose purchase of capital goods in a given quarter would routinely exceed P1,000,000.00. The amortization over a five-year period of the input VAT on these capital goods would definitely eat up into their profit margin. But it is still possible for such big businesses to survive despite this new restriction, and their financial pain alone may not be sufficient to cause the invalidity of a taxing statute.<br><br><b>However, this amortization plan will prove especially fatal to start-ups and other new businesses, which need to purchase capital goods in order to start up their new businesses.</b> It is a known fact in the financial community that a majority of businesses start earning profit only after the second or third year, and many enterprises do not even get to survive that long. The first few years of a business are the most crucial to its survival, and any financial benefits it can obtain in those years, no matter how miniscule, may spell the difference between life and death. For such emerging businesses, it is already difficult under the present system to recover the prepaid input VAT from the output VAT collected from customers because initial sales volumes are usually low. With this further limitation, diminishing as it does any opportunity to have a sustainable cash flow, the ability of new businesses to survive the first three years becomes even more endangered.<br><br>Even existing small to medium enterprises are imperiled by this 60 month amortization restriction, especially considering the application of the 70% cap. The additional purchase of capital goods bears as a means of adding value to the consumer good, as a means to justify the increased selling price. However, the purchase of capital goods in excess of P1,000,000.00 would impose another burden on the small to medium enterprise by further restricting their ability to immediately recover the entire prepaid input VAT (which would exceed at least P100,000.00), as they would be compelled to wait for at least five years before they can do so. Another hurdle is imposed for such small to medium enterprise to obtain the profit margin critical to survival.<b> For some lucky enterprises who may be able to survive the injury brought about by the 70% cap, this 60 month amortization period might instead provide the mortal head wound.</b><br><br>Moreover, the increased administrative burden on the taxpayer should not be discounted, considering this Court’s previous recognition of the aims of the VAT system to “rationalize the system of taxes on goods and services, [and] simplify tax administration”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> With the amortization requirement, the taxpayer would be forced to segregate assets into several classes and strictly monitor the useful life of assets so that proper classification can be made. The administrative requirements of the taxpayer in order to monitor the input VAT from the purchase of capital assets thus has exponentially increased.<br><br><i>5% Withholding VAT on Sales</i><br><br>Pilipinas Shell Dealers argue that Section 12 of the E-VAT law, which amends Section 114(C) of the NIRC, is also unconstitutional. <b>The provision is supremely unwise, oppressive and confiscatory in nature, and ruinous to private enterprise and even State development.</b> The provision reads: <blockquote> SEC. 12. Section 114 of the same Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: <blockquote> "SEC. 114.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Return and Payment of Value-Added Tax.</span> –<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>“(C) <i>Withholding of Value-added Tax.</i> – The Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or –controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof: <i>Provided,</i> That the payment for lease or use of properties or property rights to nonresident owners shall be subject to ten percent (10%) withholding tax at the time of payment. For purposes of this Section, the payor or person in control of the payment shall be considered as the withholding payment. xxx </blockquote></blockquote> The principle that the Government and its subsidiaries may deduct and withhold a final value-added tax on its purchase of goods and services is not new, as the NIRC had allowed such deduction and withholding at the rate of 3% of the gross payment for the purchase of goods, and 6% of the gross receipts for services. <b>However, the NIRC had also provided that this tax withheld would also be creditable against the VAT liability of the seller or contractor, a mechanism that was deleted by the E-VAT law. The deletion of this credit apparatus effectively compels the private enterprise transacting with the government to shoulder the output VAT that should have been paid by the government in excess of 5% of the gross selling price, and at the same time unduly burdens the private enterprise by precluding it from  applying any creditable input VAT on the same transaction.</b><br><br>Notably, the removal of the credit mechanism runs contrary to the essence of the VAT system, which characteristically allows the crediting of input taxes against output taxes. <b>Without such crediting mechanism, which allows the shifting of the VAT to only the final end user, the tax becomes a straightforward tax on business or income. The effect on the enterprise doing business with the government would be that two taxes would be imposed on the income by the business derived on such transaction: the regular personal or corporate income tax on such income, and this final withholding tax of 5%.</b><br><br>Granted that Congress is not bound to adopt with strict conformity the VAT system, and that it has to power to impose new taxes on business income, this amendment to Section 114(C) of the NIRC still remains unconstitutional. <b>It unfairly discriminates against entities which contract with the government by imposing an additional tax on the income derived from such transactions. The end result of such discrimination is double taxation on income that is both oppressive and confiscatory.</b><br><br><b>It is a legitimate purpose of a tax law to devise a manner by which the government could save money on its own transactions, but it is another matter if a private enterprise is punished for doing business with the government.</b> The erstwhile NIRC worked towards such advantage, by allowing the government to reduce its cash outlay on purchases of goods and services by withholding the payment of a percentage thereof. While the new E-VAT law retains this benefit to the government, at the same time it burdens the private enterprise with an additional tax by refusing to allow the crediting of this tax withheld to the business’s input VAT.<br><br>This imposition would be grossly unfair for private entities that transact with the government, especially on a regular basis. It might be argued that the provision, even if concededly unwise, nonetheless fails to meet the standard of unconstitutionality, as it affects only those persons or establishments that choose to do business with the government. However, it is an acknowledged fact that the government and its subsidiaries rely on contracts with private enterprises in order to be able to carry out innumerable functions of the State. <b>This provision effectively discourages private enterprises to do business with the State, as it would impose on the business a higher rate of tax if it were to transact with the State, as compared to transactions with other private entities.</b><br><br>Established industries with track records of quality performance could very well be dissuaded from doing further business with government entities as the higher tax rate would make no economic sense. Only those enterprises which really need the money, such as those with substandard track records that have affected their viability in the marketplace, would bother seeking out government contracts. The corresponding sacrifice in quality would eventually prove detrimental to the State. Our society can ill afford shoddy infrastructures such as roads, bridges and buildings that would unnecessarily pose danger to the public at large simply because the government wanted to skimp on expenses.<br><br><b>The provision squarely contradicts Section 20, Article II of the Constitution as it vacuously discourages private enterprise, and provides disincentives to needed investments such as those expected by the State from private businesses.</b> Whatever advantages may be gained by the temporary increase in the government coffers would be overturned by the disadvantages of having a reduced pool of private enterprises willing to do business with the government. Moreover, since government contracts with private enterprises will still remain a necessary fact of life, the amendment to Section 114(C) of the NIRC introduced by the E-VAT Law.<br><br>Double taxation means taxing for the same tax period the same thing or activity twice, when it should be taxed but once, for the same purpose and with the same kind of character of tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Double taxation is not expressly forbidden in our constitution, but the Court has recognized it as obnoxious “where the taxpayer is taxed twice for the benefit of the same governmental entity or by the same jurisdiction for the same purpose.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Certainly, both the 5% final tax withheld and the general corporate income tax are both paid for the benefit of the national government, and for the same incidence of taxation, the sale/lease of goods and services to the government.<br><br>The Court, in <i>Re: Request of Atty. Bernardo Zialcita</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> had cause to make the following observation I submit apropos to the case at bar, on double taxation in a case involving the attempt of the BIR to tax the commuted accumulated leave credits of a government lawyer upon his retirement: <blockquote> Section 284 of the Revised Administrative Code grants to a government employee 15 days vacation leave and 15 days sick leave for every year of service. Hence, even if the government employee absents himself and exhausts his leave credits, he is still deemed to have worked and to have rendered services. <b>His leave benefits are already imputed in, and form part of, his salary which in turn is subject to withholding tax on income. He is taxed on the entirety of his salaries without any deductions for any leaves not utilized. It follows then that the money values corresponding to these leave benefits both the used and unused have already been taxed during the year that they were earned. To tax them again when the retiring employee receives their money value as a form of government concern and appreciation plainly constitutes an attempt to tax the employee a second time. This is tantamount to double taxation.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </blockquote> <i>Conclusions</i><br><br>The VAT system, in itself, is intelligently designed, and stands as a fair means to raise revenue. It has been adopted worldwide by countries hoping to employ an efficient means of taxation. The concerns I have raised do not detract from my general approval of the VAT system.<br><br>I do lament though that our government’s wholehearted adoption of the VAT system is endemic of what I deem a flaw in our national tax policy in the last few decades. The power of taxation, inherent in the State and ever so powerful, has been generally employed by our financial planners for a solitary purpose: the raising of revenue. Revenue generation is a legitimate purpose of taxation, but standing alone, it is a woefully unsophisticated design. Intelligent tax policy should extend beyond the singular-minded goal of raising State funds â”€ the old-time philosophy behind the taxing schemes of war-mongering monarchs and totalitarian states â”€ and should sincerely explore the concept of taxation as a means of providing genuine incentives to private enterprise to spur economic growth; of promoting egalitarian social justice that would allow everyone to their fair share of the nation’s wealth.<br><br>Instead, we are condemned by a national policy driven by the monomania for State revenue. It may be beyond my oath as a Justice to compel the government to adopt an economic policy in consonance with my personal views, but I offer these observations since they lie at the very heart of the noxiousness of the assailed provisions of the E-VAT law. The 70% cap, the 60-month amortization period and the 5% withholding tax on government transactions were selfishly designed to increase government revenue at the expense of the survival of local industries.<br><br>I am not insensitive to the concerns raised by the respondents as to the dire consequences to the economy should the E-VAT law be struck down. I am aware that the granting of the petition in G.R. No. 168461 will negatively affect the cash flow of the government. If that were the only relevant concern at stake, I would have no problems denying the petition.  <b>Unfortunately, under the device employed in the E-VAT law, the price to be paid for a more sustainable liquidity of the government’s finances will be the death of local business, and correspondingly, the demise of our society. It is a measure just as draconian as the standard issue taxes of medieval tyrants.</b><br><br>I am not normally inclined towards the language of the overwrought, yet if the sky were indeed truly falling, how else could that fact be communicated. The E-VAT Law is of multiple fatal consequences. How are we to survive as a nation without the bulwark of private industries? Perhaps the larger scale, established businesses may ultimately remain standing, but they will be unable to sustain the void left by the demise of small to medium enterprises. Or worse, domestic industry would be left in the absolute control of monopolies, combines or cartels, whether dominated by foreigners or local oligarchs. The destruction of subsisting industries would be bad enough, the destruction of opportunity and the entrepreneurial spirit would be even more grievous and tragic, as it would mark as well the end of hope. Taxes may be the lifeblood of the state, but never at the expense of the life of its subjects.<br><br>Accordingly, I VOTE to: <br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">1)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">DENY the Petitions in G.R.

Rep. Act No. 9337, which amended certain provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by essentially increasing the tax rates and expanding the coverage of the Value-Added Tax (VAT).  Undoubtedly, during these financially difficult times, more taxes would be additionally burdensome to the citizenry.  However, like a bitter pill, all Filipino citizens must bear the burden of these new taxes so as to raise the much-needed revenue for the ailing Philippine economy.  Taxation is the indispensable and inevitable price for a civilized society, and without taxes, the government would be paralyzed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Without the tax reforms introduced by Rep. Act No. 9337, the then Secretary of the Department of Finance, Cesar V. Purisima, assessed that “all economic scenarios point to the National Government’s inability to sustain its precarious fiscal position, resulting in severe erosion of investor confidence and economic stagnation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Finding Rep. Act No. 9337 as not unconstitutional, both in its procedural enactment and in its substance, I hereby concur in full in the foregoing majority opinion, penned by my esteemed colleague, Justice Ma. Alicia Austria-Martinez.<br><br>According to petitioners, the enactment of Rep. Act No. 9337 by Congress was riddled with irregularities and violations of the Constitution.  In particular, they alleged that: (1) The Bicameral Conference Committee exceeded its authority to merely settle or reconcile the differences among House Bills No. 3555 and 3705 and Senate Bill No. 1950, by including in Rep. Act No. 9337 provisions not found in any of the said bills, or deleting from Rep. Act No. 9337 or amending provisions therein even though they were not in conflict with the provisions of the other bills; (2) The amendments introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee violated Article VI, Section 26(2), of the Constitution which forbids the amendment of a bill after it had passed third reading; and (3) Rep. Act No. 9337 contravened Article VI, Section 24, of the Constitution which prescribes that revenue bills should originate exclusively from the House of Representatives.<br><br>Invoking the expanded power of judicial review granted to it by the Constitution of 1987, petitioners are calling upon this Court to look into the enactment of Rep. Act No. 9337 by Congress and, consequently, to review the applicability of the enrolled bill doctrine in this jurisdiction.  Under the said doctrine, the enrolled bill, as signed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate President, and certified by the Secretaries of both Houses of Congress, shall be conclusive proof of its due enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioners’ arguments failed to convince me of the wisdom of abandoning the enrolled bill doctrine.  I believe that it is more prudent for this Court to remain conservative and to continue its adherence to the enrolled bill doctrine, for to abandon the said doctrine would be to open a Pandora’s Box, giving rise to a situation more fraught with evil and mischief.  Statutes enacted by Congress may not attain finality or conclusiveness unless declared so by this Court.   This would undermine the authority of our statutes because despite having been signed and certified by the designated officers of Congress, their validity would still be in doubt and their implementation would be greatly hampered by allegations of irregularities in their passage by the Legislature.  Such an uncertainty in the statutes would indubitably result in confusion and disorder.  In all probability, it is the contemplation of such a scenario that led an American judge to proclaim, thus – <blockquote> . . . Better, far better, that a provision should occasionally find its way into the statute through mistake, or even fraud, than, that every Act, state and national, should at any and all times be liable to put in issue and impeached by the journals, loose papers of the Legislature, and parol evidence.  Such a state of uncertainty in the statute laws of the land would lead to mischiefs absolutely intolerable. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote> Moreover, this Court must attribute good faith and accord utmost respect to the acts of a co-equal branch of government.  While it is true that its jurisdiction has been expanded by the Constitution, the exercise thereof should not violate the basic principle of separation of powers.  The expanded jurisdiction does not contemplate judicial supremacy over the other branches of government.  Thus, in resolving the procedural issues raised by the petitioners, this Court should limit itself to a determination of compliance with, or conversely, the violation of a specified procedure in the Constitution for the passage of laws by Congress, and not of a mere internal rule of proceedings of its Houses.<br><br>It bears emphasis that most of the irregularities in the enactment of Rep. Act No. 9337 concern the amendments introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee.  The Constitution is silent on such a committee, it neither prescribes the creation thereof nor does it prohibit it.  The creation of the Bicameral Conference Committee is authorized by the Rules of both Houses of Congress.  That the Rules of both Houses of Congress provide for the creation of a Bicameral Conference Committee is within the prerogative of each House under the Constitution to determine its own rules of proceedings.<br><br>The Bicameral Conference Committee is a creation of necessity and practicality considering that our Congress is composed of two Houses, and it is highly improbable that their respective bills on the same subject matter shall always be in accord and consistent with each other.  Instead of all their members, only the appointed representatives of both Houses shall meet to reconcile or settle the differences in their bills.  The resulting bill from their meetings, embodied in the Bicameral Conference Report, shall be subject to approval and ratification by both Houses, voting separately.<br><br>It does perplex me that members of both Houses would again ask the Court to define and limit the powers of the Bicameral Conference Committee when such committee is of their own creation.  In a number of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> this Court already made a determination of the extent of the powers of the Bicameral Conference Committee after taking into account the existing Rules of both Houses of Congress.  In gist, the power of the Bicameral Conference Committee to reconcile or settle the differences in the two Houses’ respective bills is not limited to the conflicting provisions of the bills; but may include matters not found in the original bills but germane to the purpose thereof.  If both Houses viewed the pronouncement made by this Court in such cases as extreme or beyond what they intended, they had the power to amend their respective Rules to clarify or limit even further the scope of the authority which they grant to the Bicameral Conference Committee.  Petitioners’ grievance that, unfortunately, they cannot bring about such an amendment of the Rules on the Bicameral Conference Committee because they are members of the minority, deserves scant consideration.  That the majority of the members of both Houses refuses to amend the Rules on the Bicameral Conference Committee is an indication that it is still satisfied therewith.  At any rate, this is how democracy works – the will of the majority shall be controlling.<br><br>Worth reiterating herein is the concluding paragraph in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arroyo v. De Venecia</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which reads – <blockquote> It would be unwarranted invasion of the prerogative of a coequal department for this Court either to set aside a legislative action as void because the Court thinks the house has disregarded its own rules of procedure, or to allow those defeated in the political arena to seek a rematch in the judicial forum when petitioners can find remedy in that department.  The Court has not been invested with a roving commission to inquire into complaints, real or imagined, of legislative skullduggery.  It would be acting in excess of its power and would itself be guilty of grave abuse of its discretion were it to do so. . . . </blockquote> Present jurisprudence allows the Bicameral Conference Committee to amend, add, and delete provisions of the Bill under consideration, even in the absence of conflict thereon between the Senate and House versions, but only so far as said provisions are germane to the purpose of the Bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Now, there is a question as to whether the Bicameral Conference Committee, which produced Rep. Act No. 9337, exceeded its authority when it included therein amendments of provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 not related to VAT.<br><br>Although House Bills No. 3555 and 3705 were limited to the amendments of the provisions on VAT of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, Senate Bill No. 1950 had a much wider scope and included amendments of other provisions of the said Code, such as those on income, percentage, and excise taxes.  It should be borne in mind that the very purpose of these three Bills and, subsequently, of Rep. Act No. 9337, was to raise additional revenues for the government to address the dire economic situation of the country.  The National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as its title suggests, is the single Code that governs all our national internal revenue taxes.  While it does cover different taxes, all of them are imposed and collected by the national government to raise revenues.  If we have one Code for all our national internal revenue taxes, then there is no reason why we cannot have a single statute amending provisions thereof even if they involve different taxes under separate titles.  I hereby submit that the amendments introduced by the Bicameral Conference Committee to non-VAT provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 are not unconstitutional for they are germane to the purpose of House Bills No. 3555 and 3705 and Senate Bill No. 1950, which is to raise national revenues.<br><br>Furthermore, the procedural issues raised by the petitioners were already addressed and resolved by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tolentino v. Executive Secretary</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  Since petitioners failed to proffer novel factual or legal argument in support of their positions that were not previously considered by this Court in the same case, then I am not compelled to depart from the conclusions made therein.<br><br>The majority opinion has already thoroughly discussed each of the substantial issues raised by the petitioners.    I would just wish to discuss additional matters pertaining to the petition of the petroleum dealers in G.R. No. 168461.<br><br>They claim that the provision of Rep. Act No. 9337 limiting their input VAT credit to only 70% of their output VAT deprives them of their property without due process of law.  They argue further that such 70% cap violates the equal protection and uniformity of taxation clauses under Article III, Section 1, and Article VI, Section 28(1), respectively, of the Constitution, because it will unduly prejudice taxpayers who have high input VAT and who, because of the cap, cannot fully utilize their input VAT as credit.<br><br>I cannot sustain the petroleum dealers’ position for the following reasons –<br><br><i>First,</i> I adhere to the view that the input VAT is not a property to which the taxpayer has vested rights.  Input VAT consists of the VAT a VAT-registered person had paid on his purchases or importation of goods, properties, and services from a VAT-registered supplier; more simply, it is <u><b>VAT paid</b></u>.  It is not, as averred by petitioner petroleum dealers, a property that the taxpayer acquired for valuable consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  A VAT-registered person incurs input VAT because he complied with the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, which imposed the VAT and made the payment thereof mandatory; and not because he paid for it or purchased it for a price.<br><br>Generally, when one pays taxes to the government, he cannot expect any direct and concrete benefit to himself for such payment.  The benefit of payment of taxes shall redound to the society as a whole.  However, by virtue of Section 110(A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, prior to its amendment by Rep. Act No. 9337, a VAT-registered person is allowed, subject to certain substantiation requirements, to credit his input VAT against his output VAT.<br><br>Output VAT is the VAT imposed by the VAT-registered person on his own sales of goods, properties, and services or the VAT he passes on to his buyers.  Hence, the VAT-registered person selling the goods, properties, and services does not pay for the output VAT; said output VAT is paid for by his consumers and he only collects and remits the same to the government.<br><br>The crediting of the input VAT against the output VAT is a statutory privilege, granted by Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.  It gives the VAT-registered person the opportunity to recover the input VAT he had paid, so that, in effect, the input VAT does not constitute an additional cost for him.  While it is true that input VAT credits are reported as assets in a VAT-registered person’s financial statements and books of account, this accounting treatment is still based on the statutory provision recognizing the input VAT as a credit.  Without Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, then the accounting treatment of any input VAT will also change and may no longer be booked outright as an asset.  Since the privilege of an input VAT credit is granted by law, then an amendment of such law may limit the exercise of or may totally withdraw the privilege.<br><br>The amendment of Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 by Rep. Act No. 9337, which imposed the 70% cap on input VAT credits, is a legitimate exercise by Congress of its law-making power.  To say that Congress may not trifle with Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 would be to violate a basic precept of constitutional law – that no law is irrepealable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  There can be no vested right to the continued existence of a statute, which precludes its change or repeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It bears to emphasize that Rep. Act No. 9337 does not totally remove the privilege of crediting the input VAT against the output VAT.  It merely limits the amount of input VAT one may credit against his output VAT per quarter to an amount equivalent to 70% of the output VAT.  What is more, any input VAT in excess of the 70% cap may be carried-over to the next quarter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  It is certainly a departure from the VAT crediting system under Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, but it is an innovation that Congress may very well introduce, because – <blockquote> VAT will continue to evolve from its pioneering original structure.  Dynamically, it will be subjected to reforms that will make it conform to many factors, among which are: the changing requirements of government revenue; the social, economic and political vicissitudes of the times; and the conflicting interests in our society.  In the course of its evolution, it will be injected with some oddities and inevitably transformed into a structure which its revisionists believe will be an improvement overtime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote> <i>Second, </i>assuming for the sake of argument, that the input VAT credit is indeed a property, the petroleum dealers’ right thereto has not vested.  A right is deemed vested and subject to constitutional protection when – <blockquote> “. . . [T]he right to enjoyment, present or prospective, has become the property of some particular person or persons as a present interest.  The right must be absolute, complete, and unconditional, independent of a contingency, and a mere expectancy of future benefit, or a contingent interest in property founded on anticipated continuance of existing laws, does not constitute a vested right.  So, inchoate rights which have not been acted on are not vested.” (16 C. J. S. 214-215)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </blockquote> Under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, before it was amended by Rep. Act No. 9337, the sale or importation of petroleum products were exempt from VAT, and instead, were subject to excise tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Petroleum dealers did not impose any output VAT on their sales to consumers.  Since they had no output VAT against which they could credit their input VAT, they shouldered the costs of the input VAT that they paid on their purchases of goods, properties, and services.  Their sales not being subject to VAT, the petroleum dealers had no input VAT credits to speak of.<br><br>It is only under Rep. Act No. 9337 that the sales by the petroleum dealers have become subject to VAT and only in its implementation may they use their input VAT as credit against their output VAT.  While eager to use their input VAT credit accorded to it by Rep. Act No. 9337, the petroleum dealers reject the limitation imposed by the very same law on such use.<br><br>It should be remembered that prior to Rep. Act No. 9337, the petroleum dealers’ input VAT credits were inexistent – they were unrecognized and disallowed by law.  The petroleum dealers had no such property called input VAT credits.  It is only rational, therefore, that they cannot acquire vested rights to the use of such input VAT credits when they were never entitled to such credits in the first place, at least, not until Rep. Act No. 9337.<br><br>My view, at this point, when Rep. Act No. 9337 has not yet even been implemented, is that petroleum dealers’ right to use their input VAT as credit against their output VAT unlimitedly has not vested, being a mere expectancy of a future benefit and being contingent on the continuance of Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, prior to its amendment by Rep. Act No. 9337.<br><br><i>Third,</i> although the petroleum dealers presented figures and computations to support their contention that the cap shall lead to the demise of their businesses, I remain unconvinced.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 9337, while imposing the 70% cap on input VAT credits, allows the taxpayer to carry-over to the succeeding quarters any excess input VAT.  The petroleum dealers presented a situation wherein their input VAT would always exceed 70% of their output VAT, and thus, their excess input VAT will be perennially carried-over and would remain unutilized.  Even though they consistently questioned the 70% cap on their input VAT credits, the petroleum dealers failed to establish what is the average ratio of their input VAT vis-à-vis their output VAT per quarter.  Without such fact, I consider their objection to the 70% cap arbitrary because there is no basis therefor.<br><br>On the other, I find that the 70% cap on input VAT credits was not imposed by Congress arbitrarily.  Members of the Bicameral Conference Committee settled on the said percentage so as to ensure that the government can collect a minimum of 30% output VAT per taxpayer.  This is to put a VAT-taxpayer, at least, on equal footing with a VAT-exempt taxpayer under Section 109(V) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 9337.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  The latter taxpayer is exempt from VAT on the basis that his sale or lease of goods or properties or services do not exceed P1,500,000; instead, he is subject to pay a three percent (3%) tax on his gross receipts in lieu of the VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  If a taxpayer with presumably a smaller business is required to pay three percent (3%) gross receipts tax, a type of tax which does not even allow for any crediting, a VAT-taxpayer with a bigger business should be obligated, likewise, to pay a minimum of 30% output VAT (which should be equivalent to 3% of the gross selling price per good or property or service sold).  The cap assures the government a collection of at least 30% output VAT, contributing to an improved cash flow for the government.<br><br>Attention is further called to the fact that the output VAT is the VAT imposed on the sales by a VAT-taxpayer; it is paid by the purchasers of the goods, properties, and services, and merely collected through the VAT-registered seller.  The latter, therefore, serves as a collecting agent for the government.  The VAT-registered seller is merely being required to remit to the government a minimum of 30% of his output VAT collection.<br><br><i>Fourth,</i> I give no weight to the figures and computations presented before this Court by the petroleum dealers, particularly the supposed quarterly profit and loss statement of a “typical dealer.”  How these data represent the financial status of a typical dealer, I would not know when there was no effort to explain the manner by which they were surveyed, collated, and averaged out.  Without establishing their source therefor, the figures and computations presented by the petroleum dealers are merely self-serving and unsubstantiated, deserving scant consideration by this Court.  Even assuming that these figures truly represent the financial standing of petroleum dealers, the introduction and application thereto of the VAT factor, which forebode the collapse of said petroleum dealers’ businesses, would be nothing more than an anticipated damage – an injury that may or may not happen.  To resolve their petition on this basis would be premature and contrary to the established tenet of ripeness of a cause of action before this Court could validly exercise its power of judicial review.<br><br><i>Fifth,</i> in response to the contention of the petroleum dealers during oral arguments before this Court that they cannot pass on to the consumers the VAT burden and increase the prices of their goods, it is worthy to quote below this Court’s ruling in <i>Churchill v. Concepcion</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to wit – <blockquote> It will thus be seen that the contention that the rates charged for advertising cannot be raised is purely hypothetical, based entirely upon the opinion of the plaintiffs, unsupported by actual test, and that the plaintiffs themselves admit that a number of other persons have voluntarily and without protest paid the tax herein complained of.  Under these circumstances, can it be held as a matter of fact that the tax is confiscatory or that, as a matter of law, the tax is unconstitutional?  Is the exercise of the taxing power of the Legislature dependent upon and restricted by the opinion of two interested witnesses?  There can be but one answer to these questions, especially in view of the fact that others are paying the tax and presumably making reasonable profit from their business. </blockquote> As a final observation, I perceive that what truly underlies the opposition to Rep. Act No. 9337 is not the question of its constitutionality, but rather the wisdom of its enactment.  Would it truly raise national revenue and benefit the entire country, or would it only increase the burden of the Filipino people?  Would it contribute to a revival of our economy or only contribute to the difficulties and eventual closure of businesses?  These are issues that we cannot resolve as the Supreme Court.  As this Court explained in <i>Agustin v. Edu</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> to wit – <blockquote> It does appear clearly that petitioner’s objection to this Letter of Instruction is not premised on lack of power, the justification for a finding of unconstitutionality, but on the pessimistic, not to say negative, view he entertains as to its wisdom.  That approach, it put it at its mildest, is distinguished, if that is the appropriate word, by its unorthodoxy.  It bears repeating “that this Court, in the language of Justice Laurel, ‘does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation.’  As expressed by Justice Tuason: ‘It is not the province of the courts to supervise legislation and keep it within the bounds of propriety and common sense.  That is primarily and exclusively a legislative concern.’  There can be no possible objection then to the observation of Justice Montemayor: ‘As long as laws do not violate any Constitutional provision, the Courts merely interpret and apply them regardless of whether or not they are wise or salutary.’  For they, according to Justice Labrador, ‘are not supposed to override legitimate policy and * * * never inquire into the wisdom of the law.’  It is thus settled, to paraphrase Chief Justice Concepcion in Gonzales v. Commission on Elections, that only congressional power or competence, not the wisdom of the action taken, may be the basis for declaring a statute invalid.  This is as it ought to be.  The principle of separation of powers has in the main wisely allocated the respective authority of each department and confined its jurisdiction to such sphere.  There would then be intrusion not allowable under the Constitution if on a matter left to the discretion of a coordinate branch, the judiciary would substitute its own…”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </blockquote> To reiterate, we cannot substitute our discretion for Congress, and even though there are provisions in Rep. Act No. 9337 which we may believe as unwise or iniquitous, but not unconstitutional, we cannot strike them off by invoking our power of judicial review.  In such a situation, the recourse of the people is not judicial, but rather political.  If they severely doubt the wisdom of the present Congress for passing a statute such as Rep. Act No. 9337, then they have the power to hold the members of said Congress accountable by using their voting power in the next elections.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I vote for the denial of the present petitions and the upholding of the constitutionality of Rep. Act No. 9337 in its entirety.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Presidential Decree No. 1158, as amended up to Rep.

Purisima to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court for conduct which puts the Court and its Members into dishonor, disrepute and discredit, and degrades the administration of justice, Purisima filed his Compliance thereto, stating that: <blockquote> It is not true that I claimed or even insinuated that this Honorable Court was pressured or influenced by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo or Malacañang Palace to issue a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) in the instant cases.  What I stated was simply that President Arroyo had on several occasions discussed with the economic team the possibility of postponing the implementation of Republic Act No. 9337.  While I believe that President Arroyo wanted to postpone the implementation of the said law, I never claimed or insinuated that this Honorable Court was influenced or pressured to issue the TRO against its implementation.<br><br>…<br><br>I do not deny that I was extremely disappointed when this Honorable Court issued the TRO, which was a serious setback to our fiscal consolidation program.  And my disappointment grew when I felt that the Government specifically the Executive branch, was not doing enough to have the TRO lifted.  At the height of my disappointment, and after hearing of rumors that Executive officials may have been instrumental in procuring the TRO, I did enquire from the other cabinet officials whether Malacañang had a hand in the issuance of the order.  I felt that it was my right and duty as Finance Secretary to make such an inquiry, given that before the issuance of the TRO, the President had inquired about the possibility of deferring the implementation of Republic Act No. 9337.  But surely, my inquiries whether Malacañang did so, did not amount to, as it was not intended to have the effect of, claiming outright or necessarily insinuating that Malacañang did so, or to hold, in any manner, this Honorable Court in contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </blockquote> Purisima cites the July 11, 2005 edition of the <i>Philippine Star</i> and the July 10, 2005  edition of the  <i>Philippine Daily  Inquirer</i>, which reported  that<br><br>Purisima did not directly accuse the President of influencing the Court in issuing the TRO, and that he would neither confirm nor deny the reports that the President had a hand in its issuance.<br><br>The Court finds Purisima’s explanation unsatisfactory.<br><br>The Court reproduces excerpts from some of the reports contained in the newspapers with regard to Purisima’s statements, to wit: <blockquote> (1) July 10, 2005, <i>The Philippine Star</i>, Opinion Section (It’s the Economy, Stupid!) <blockquote> The present political crisis will inevitably boil down to the economy as the real issue that will ultimately bring down the Arroyo Administration.  What we are hearing from people close to the Palace is that the TRO issued by the Supreme Court on the EVAT is the real reason why 10 Cabinet members, specially Cesar Purisima and Johnny Santos, resigned.  Cesar Purisima further pointed out that her decision-making process has adversely affected the economy.  The frustrated economic team felt that GMA had actually influenced the Supreme Court to issue the TRO to postpone the bad effects of the EVAT on prices purely for her political survival.  If indeed that is true, then it just confirms that our present political system has really gone from bad to worse.  What I found disgusting is that the plotters, especially Cesar Purisima, sounded like Judas Iscariot.  They could just have simply resigned without making a spectacle out of it. </blockquote> (2) July 10, 2005, <i>The Daily Tribune</i> (SC Denies Palace Pressed Issuance of E-VAT TRO) <blockquote> Reports had claimed that the former economic team of Mrs. Arroyo decided to resign over the weekend due in part to the administration’s lobbying the SC to issue a restraining order on the e-VAT, apparently to prevent  the public from further seething against the government over the continuous spiraling of the prices of basic goods and services.<br><br>…<br><br>Finance officials led by Purisima previously expressed dismay over the suspension of the e-VAT as they claimed that the TRO would cost the government at least P140 million a day in unrealized revenues.<br><br>Purisima hinted that Mrs. Arroyo had a hand in the SC’s TRO to save her presidency. </blockquote> (3) July 11, 2005, <i>Manila Standard Today</i> (Palace Debunks Purisima Claim on EVAT) <blockquote> Malacañang yesterday branded as “ridiculous” the insinuations that President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had a hand in the Supreme Court’s July 1 order suspending the implementation of the Expanded Value-Added Tax Law.<br><br>At the same time, Justice Secretary Raul Gonzalez slammed resigned Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima and ex-Trade Secretary Juan Santos for claiming that the President had wanted the implementation of the law delayed so she would not get too much political flak for the tax measure. </blockquote> (4) July 11, 2005, <i>The Philippine Star</i>, Business Section (The Last Straw that Broke a Cabinet) <blockquote> For ex-Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, the implementation of the EVAT law was a major pillar to strengthen the country’s finances, to get our fiscal house in order.  As far as he and the rest of the economic management team he heads are concerned, they are operating under the fiscal equivalent of a red alert.  They have scored some early victories, like the increase in revenue collections in recent months, but they know that they are still far from being in the clear.<br><br>That was why Purisima felt truly betrayed when he reportedly got a phone call from an official telling him “yung hinihingi nyo sa Supreme Court binigay na.”  He didn’t have any pending requests from the Court so he wondered, refusing to accept the reality of his worst fear: The EVAT had been sacrificed by the Palace. </blockquote> (5) July 12, 2005, <i>The Philippine Daily Inquirer</i> (No GMA Influence on e-VAT freeze-SC) <blockquote> Bunye made the reaffirmation after Purisima and former Trade Secretary Juan Santos insinuated that the President might have influenced the Supreme Court to grant the TRO. </blockquote></blockquote> At the time the reports came out, Purisima did not controvert the truth or falsity of the statements attributed to him.  It was only after the Court issued the show-cause order that Purisima saw it fit to deny having uttered these statements.  By then, it was already impressed upon the public’s mind that the issuance of the TRO was the product of machinations on the Court by the executive branch.<br><br>If it were true that Purisima felt that the media misconstrued his actions, then he should have immediately rectified it.  He should not have waited until the Court required him to explain before he denied having made such statements.
