				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Wilfredo P. Tagle, husband of petitioner Rosalina Tagle, was recruited by respondent Fast International Corporation (FIC), a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, to work as fisherman at Taiwan for its principal, respondent Kuo Tung Yu Huang.<br><br>On May 9, 1995, Wilfredo Tagle and respondent Kuo Tung Yu Huang concluded an employment contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for one (1) year, extendible for another year upon mutual agreement of the parties.<br><br>During the duration of the contract or on November 12, 1995, the fishing vessel boarded by Wilfredo Tagle in Taiwan collided with another and thereafter sank.  Despite efforts to look for Tagle's <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus</span>, the same proved futile.  He was, therefore, presumed dead.<br><br>His widow, herein petitioner, thus filed a claim for death benefits with respondent FIC.  The claim was approved and Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Co., Inc., the local insurer of FIC, issued a check in the amount of P650,000.00.  Upon receipt by petitioner of the check, she accomplished on March 8, 1996 a Release, Waiver and Quitclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> reading:<br><blockquote>For and in consideration of the payment of the sum of PESOS:  SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P650,000.00) representing<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Philippine Prudential Life Inc.

TAGLE of legal age, Filipino and a resident of Sariaya, Quezon, for myself and on behalf of my legitimate children/grandchildren/relatives/husband/wife, my heirs, assigns and successors in interest, do hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">release and discharge</span> the Philippine Prudential Life Ins. Co., Inc., <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">and all other persons having interest therein and thereby</span> from all <span style="font-weight: bold;">claims, demands, causes of action</span>, etc., and all such other claims, demands, causes of action, etc., <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">that may arise therefrom and/or incidentally connected therewith.</span><br><br>I hereby warrant that this Quitclaim may be pleaded as an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">absolute bar to any suit</span> that either is now pending or may be henceforth prosecuted concerning matters referred to in the preceding paragraph</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span>  And in connection herewith, I promise to defend the right and to answer all costs of suits, of the Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Co., Inc., and all other persons having interest therein or thereby.<br><br>I further hereby warrant that I fully understand the terms and conditions of this Quitclaim, that the effects hereof had been explained to me in the language/dialect I understand, and that I have executed this document voluntarily and of my free will and that I was not under fraud, mistake, undue influence, intimidation, violence or any other vice or consent."  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner, however, subsequently filed before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), National Capital Region, a complaint for additional "labor insurance" in the amount of NT$300,000.00, invoking Article II, Section 10 of the employment contract reading:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">10. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Compensation and Benefits: If after repatriation, the FISHERMAN still requires medical attention for work connected <span style="text-decoration: underline;">illness</span>, he shall be so provided at cost to the EMPLOYER.

Additional insurance coverage are in accordance with the POEA Standards for overseas fishermen. Additional Labor Insurance shall be provided to the FISHERMAN by the EMPLOYER with a limit of NT$300,000.00 per person (or its equivalent) for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accident</span> insurance covering fishermen regardless of whether accident occurred within and/or beyond work hours.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">In case of permanent total or partial <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disability</span> of the FISHERMAN during the term of employment caused by either injury or illness, the FISHERMAN shall be compensated according to POEA Standard. The computation of the total permanent/partial disability of the FISHERMAN caused by injury sustained within a war zone area shall be based in the computation rate payable for death within the war zone area per POEA Standard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On motion of FIC, the Labor Arbiter, by Order of September 19, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dismissed the complaint of petitioner on the ground that by her prior execution of the Release, Waiver and Quitclaim she is barred from filing any subsequent action against FIC.<br><br>Petitioner appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<br><br>By Resolution promulgated on July 20, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the NLRC dismissed petitioner's appeal and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision.<br><br>In affirming the Labor Arbiter's decision, the NLRC held<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Records of this case show that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent recruitment agency (FAST) is the Policy Holder of the aforesaid Insurance Policy of the deceased fisherman</span> (Annex "A" of Complainants' Manifestation and Comment/Opposition).  Its purpose therefore of insuring the decedent is not hard to discern i.e., to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">insulate itself from any eventuality which may arise during the effectivity of the employment contract</span> for which the services of the deceased fisherman was contracted.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nothing on record would indicate that the P650,000.00 paid by Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Co. Inc. under Cert./Policy No. GART-743 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">separate and distinct</span> from the obligation of the respondent FAST and its principal</span> (Huo Tung Yu Huang) arising from the employment contract.  A careful reading and scrutiny of the particular provision of the employment contract now at issue simply provides that in addition to the benefits already mentioned, the Employer is mandated to provide the fisherman insurance coverage for accident in an amount not to exceed NT$300,000.00 per person.  Considering that the risk insured against had happened, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the insurance proceeds which was even more than double the amount of the policy was paid to herein complainant-appellant</span>.  On the basis of the complainant's-appellant's receipt of said insurance proceeds.  Release Waiver and Quitclaim was executed in respondent's favor.  We are therefore in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full accord with the Labor Arbiter <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> that <span style="font-weight: bold;">this release and quitclaim forever barred the filing of any subsequent action against respondent.</span></span><br><br>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the NLRC Resolution having been denied by Resolution of September 11, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> she elevated the case to this Court via Petition for Certiorari filed on December 15, 1998, docketed as G.R.

Philippine-Singapore Transport Services, Inc.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in support of her submission that "it is apparent that the Release, Waiver and Quitclaim signed by the petitioner in favor of Prudential Life was not intended to foreclose her right over the death benefits of her husband as against the principal employer, Kuo Tung, represented by its local agent, Fast International," the CA correctly held that <span style="font-style: italic;">Principe </span>stands on a factual milieu different from the case at bar.  Held the CA:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">One.</span>  In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Principe</span>, the Motion to Dismiss filed by petitioner with POEA stated that the dismissal of the case would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without prejudice</span> as regards private respondents.  That situation did not take place in the case at bench.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two.</span>  In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Principe</span>, the release paper signed by petitioner was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only with regard to her claims against PSTSI</span>.  The second claim of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Principe</span> is against Chuan Hup who was not a party to the release document.  The second claim was based upon the joint and solidary undertaking of PSTSI and Chuan Hup.  No such circumstance existed in the case at bench.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Three.</span>  In <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Principe</span>, in the release document, what was paid to petitioner for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">death</span> of her husband was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only P7,000.00</span> which was an unconscionable amount while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the case at bench, the petitioner received P650,000.00</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the CA decision having been denied by Resolution of March 16, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> she filed the present Petition for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Certiorari</span> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, instead of a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, hence, a wrong remedy.  On this score alone, the petition is dismissible.<br><br>Why petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari and cited cases decided in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1996</span> and earlier as "judicial precedents," to assail a decision of the CA, given her awareness, as she alleged in the present petition, of the referral of her original petition to the CA consistent with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1998</span> pronouncement of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Martin</span>, can only mean two things:  Either her counsel is not versed on the Rules, or he is resorting to certiorari because the remedy of appeal had been lost.  For, when her counsel received the CA Resolution denying her Motion for Reconsideration, she had fifteen (15) days or up to April 26, 2001 to file the same.  She filed her present petition, however, on the 61st day, June 11, 2001, a Monday.<br><br>Technicality aside, on the merits, the petition just the same must be dismissed.<br><br>The present Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioner is an almost <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span> reproduction of the original Petition for Certiorari she filed.  Petitioner merely dropped NLRC as one of the respondents and impleaded in its stead the CA, and she accordingly amended the petition to reflect that it is the decision of the CA which is being assailed.<br><br>Raising the same issue she raised in her original petition,<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE RELEASE, WAIVER AND QUITCLAIM EXECUTED BY THE PETITIONER <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INCLUDED THE ADDITIONAL LABOR INSURANCE</span> SHE IS ENTITLED TO <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AS PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 10, ARTICLE II</span> OF HER DECEASED HUSBAND'S EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT,<br></blockquote>she likewise reiterates the position she proffered in arguing in the negative.<br><br>The second paragraph of the earlier-quoted Article II, Section 10 of the employment contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> explicitly states that "Benefits . . . include compensation for . . . <span style="font-weight: bold;">death</span> in accordance with social insurance laws and other pertinent provisions of the Taiwan Labor Law. . .
