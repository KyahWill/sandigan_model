Alandra, Jr., the Court Stenographer of MTC, Naval, Biliran, who was designated by Judge Aniceto A. Lirios on 17 October 1994 per Office Circular No. 94-10 to take over the functions of respondent Oliveros.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The memorandum disclosed that when the audit team arrived at the courthouse of MTC, Naval, Biliran, on 23 October 1996, they requested a representative from the Commission on Audit (COA) to witness the opening of the file safe or vault. The team was informed that no other personnel of said court knew the combination of the vault except respondent Oliveros. Their inventory, which was witnessed by Judge Lirios, some court personnel, and the COA representative, revealed that there was no cash inside the vault.<br><br>The audit team made the following findings as to the accountability of respondent Oliveros:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Fiduciary Fund</span>—<br><br>1) It was established that his accountability for consignation deposits made in Civil Case No. 324 Veneracion vs. King Hua, for Illegal Detainer and Civil Case No. 356, Veneracion vs. Eng Kee Ang, et al. for Illegal Detainer, amounted to P79,800.00.<br><br>2) Fines imposed on decided cases cannot be traced as to whether paid or not and to whom.

Serial Nos. 7966038 to 7966949 were unused and 7966950, which is the last receipt in the booklet is missing.<br><br>6) Amount indicated in the official receipts differ from the figures reflected in the cashbook.<br></blockquote>As to Alandra, the findings are as follows:<br><blockquote>For Fiduciary Fund-<br><br>1) Our examination of the official receipts for fiduciary fund as compared with the deposits in the bank showed an overage of P 2,692.00.<br><br>However, before we left for Tacloban City, we required that the bankbook be surrendered to Judge Lirios and we even suggested that Mr. Alandra, Jr. be temporarily relieved of his responsibility as accountable Officer in view of our findings. Judge Lirios acceded to our request and on the same day issued an office order designating Mr. Rey Murillo as the new officer-in-charge, copy of said designation hereto attached (Annex "9"). Mr. Alandra, Jr. did not anymore return to the office and was not able to turnover the bankbook in our presence. We then instructed Judge Lirios to submit new signature specimen to the bank and have the accounts freeze(sic) for the meantime that the bankbook has not been turned over to the new OIC. Judge Lirios, on his part, made verification from the bank as to the balance of the court's deposit and was very surprised to know that the balance of P 204,500.00 was reduced to only P 84,500.00. He was informed by the bank that Check No. 002102 dated October 18, 1996 ( a pay to cash check with no account number and name from Far East Bank in Ormoc City) which was deposited and booked on October 21, 1996, was returned for the reason "signature differs from the specimen on file". It is deduced that Mr. Alandra, Jr. wants to cover-up the shortage by depositing said check to the bank. Attached are the certified xerox copy of the check (Annex 10) and the notice of the bank (Annex 11") duly certified by Judge Lirios.<br><br>2) There is no cashbook for fiduciary fund where collections and deposits must be recorded daily.<br><br>3) Fines and forfeitures were remitted to JDF account instead of the General Fund account.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Judiciary Development Fund and General Fund-</span><br><br>1) In our cash examination, (see Annex "6") as per herein report, showed a shortage of P 680.00.<br><br>2) Of his JDF and General Fund accounts, we discovered an under-remittance totalling to P 10,220.00.<br><br>3) It was also unearthed that there were erroneous remittances made by depositing amounts collected for Legal Research and General Funds to the Judiciary Development Fund. The total amount involved is P 27,878.20.<br><br>4) He only deposited his collections from October 1995 to October 1996 on October 16 and 18, 1996, as shown in the herein photocopy of his bankbook, Annex "17".<br><br>5) There were fines imposed by the Court but no official receipts were issued nor declared as income totalling to P 1,175.00.<br></blockquote>Mrs. Soria recommended that proper administrative and criminal sanctions be imposed on respondents Clerk of Court Salvador P.

Puno dated 28 February 2005, Court Administrator Velasco found respondent Oliveros guilty of dereliction of duty and serious misconduct prejudicial to the interest of the service and recommended the imposition of a fine of P10,000.00. Respondent Oliveros was ordered to restitute the shortage of P2,813.80. It also recommended that respondent Alandra be fined P10,000.00 for serious misconduct prejudicial to the interest of the service. He was also directed to restitute the amount of P87,605.00 if transfer of overage in JDF amounting to P17,988.90 to the General Fund will be allowed by the Honorable Chief Justice. However, if transfer will not be authorized, the amount to be restituted would be P123,582.80.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">I. Administrative Liability of Salvador P.

They are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Supreme Court Circulars No. 13-92 and No. 5-93 provide the guidelines for the proper administration of court funds. SC Circular No. 13-92 commands that all fiduciary collections "shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized depository bank." In SC Circular No. 5-93, the Land Bank was designated as the authorized government depository.<br><br>It is undisputed that respondent failed to remit the consignation deposits he received from January 1992 to August 1994 to the Land Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It was only on 28 October 1999 that respondent delivered the consignation deposit to the party litigant.<br><br>Clearly, respondent's dishonesty and incessant refusal to remit the consignation deposits in Civil Cases No. 324 and No. 356 despite having been previously adjudged liable for the same act are appalling. Even after he was audited on 23 October 1996, respondent kept the deposits for more than three (3) years contrary to the mandate of SC Circular No. 13-92. The fact that he returned the consignation deposits to a party in Civil Cases No. 324 and No. 356 on 11 November 1999 does not mitigate his liability.<br><br>This is compounded by the other findings of the audit team which clearly establish that respondent is remiss in handling the official receipts, booklets and cashbook under his custody.<br><br>The mishandling of funds became more manifest when respondent incurred a shortage of P2,813.80 from his collections of JDF from 29 May 1985 to 18 October 1994. His contention that the shortage could not be justified because the booklet containing the duplicate and triplicate copies of the official receipts was not in his possession but with the Office of Mrs. Soria, is untenable. Records show that he had a total collection of P45,380.40 from May 1985 to 18 October 1994. His remittances on 30 August 1993 and 15 October 1994 were P18,433.60, and P24,133.00, respectively, for a total of P42,566.60. That leaves him short of P2,813.80. Had respondent been diligent in the performance of his duties as an accountable officer, such anomaly could not have happened.<br><br>The non-remittance of said amounts deprived the Court of the interest that may be earned if the amounts were deposited in a bank, as prudently required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Shortages in the amounts to be remitted and the years of delay in the actual remittance constitute neglect of duty for which the respondent shall be administratively liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>This Court has ordered the dismissal of clerks of court and other court personnel for failure to deposit fiduciary funds in authorized government depository banks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Since respondent Oliveros has compulsorily retired on 10 August 2004, with twenty-eight (28) years of public service, he can only be fined in this administrative case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Consequently, a fine equivalent to his salary for six (6) months, to be deducted from his retirement benefits is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He is likewise ordered to restitute the shortage of P2,813.80.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">II.

This act constitutes a violation of SC Circular No. 13-92 which provides that all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank.<br><br>The audit team also unearthed erroneous remittances by the respondent who deposited the amounts collected for Legal Research and General Funds to the Judiciary Development Fund. He has also incurred shortages and/or under-remittances in his cash collections. Furthermore, it was discovered during the audit that there was no cashbook for fiduciary fund where collections and deposits must be recorded daily and the fines and forfeitures were remitted to the JDF account instead of the General Fund account.<br><br>As to respondent's claim that he is liable only for the difference between the under remittance to the General Fund and over remittance to the JDF of P10,660, the same is untenable. As correctly evaluated by the Court Administrator:<br><blockquote>Per clarification with Ms. Verina F. Yap, SC Judicial Staff Officer, Fiscal and Monitoring Division, CMO, OCA, offsetting of over-remittance and under-remittance of collections is not allowed under accounting and auditing rules and regulations.<br><br>She explains that in the instant case, respondent Alandra must first make a representation to the Chief Justice allowing the withdrawal of P17,988.90 from the Judiciary Development Fund account to be transferred to the National Treasury so that the P18,988.90 accountability for this fund could be reduced to P1,000.00 only.  If the Honorable Chief Justice will not authorize the transfer of P17,988.90 erroneously remitted to the JDF account, the said amount will be considered income of the JDF and Mr. Alandra will have to restitute the shortage of P17,988.90 for the account of Clerk of Court General Fund.<br><br>If the overage of P17,988.90 in JDF will be authorized by the Chief Justice to be transferred to the Clerk of Court General Fund, the balance of accountabilities will be reduced to P17,395.00. However, the P11,395.00 will increase to P29,383 if the transfer will not be effected.<br><br>She adds that of the P29,383.90 shortages found for the above-indicated funds, the accountabilities for Fiduciary Fund are not yet included. Based on the report of Mrs. Soria and respondent's comment, hereunder is the shortage of Mr. Alandra in the Fiduciary Fund, to wit:<br>  <br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td width="68%">Total Collections</td><td width="32%"><div align="right">P272,805.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total Withdrawals  </td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">77,300.00</div></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="right">P195,505.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Bank Balance</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">204,500.00</div></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="right"><strong>P    8,995.00</strong></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>But if we will consider the bank balance which was reduced to P84,500.00 from P204,500.00 due to a check deposit of P120,000.00 which was dishonored by the bank "<span style="font-style: italic;">for signature differs from the signature on file</span>" the shortage in the Fiduciary Fund account as computed below would be as follows:<br>  <br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td width="77%">Total Collections </td><td width="23%"><div align="right"> P272,805.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total Withdrawals </td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">77,300.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Balance of Unwithdrawn FF</td><td><div align="right"> P195,505.00</div></td></tr><tr><td style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br></td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">84,500.00</div></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="right">P111,000.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>    Less Deposit on 11/6/96 <br></td><td style="text-align: right;">35,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>Balance of Accountabilities (shortage)</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">76,000.00</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Respondent Alandra's claim that the payments he made in the amount of P17,400.00 is more than enough to satisfy his accountabilities of P10,600.00 has no basis.<br><br>Ms. Yap explains that the payment of P17,400.00 he was referring to are withdrawals, which were not found during the audit but which he reimbursed to his successors, Mr. Rey S. Morillo and Mrs. Milagros Prisno. The payments were neither for the account of JDF, SGF, CGF, and LRF nor for the established Fiduciary Fund accountabilities.<br><br>Based on the computations above, the total accountabilities of Mr. Alandra if he failed to submit a bank certification that the dishonored check of P120,000.00 was credited to the account maintained for Fiduciary Fund would be P87,605.00 if transfer of overage in JDF amounting to P17,988.90 to General Fund will be allowed by the Honorable Chief Justice. However, if transfer will not be authorized, the amount to be restituted would be P123,582.80.<br></blockquote>Time and again, we have reminded court personnel tasked with collections of court funds, such as Clerks of Courts and cash clerks, to deposit immediately with authorized government depositories the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Delayed remittance of cash collections constitutes gross neglect of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The moment respondent accepted his appointment as clerk of court, he accepted the corresponding duties and responsibilities attached to it. He should have developed an appropriate system so that he can efficiently attend to his given tasks. Clerks of Courts are chief administrative officers of their respective courts. They must show competence, honesty, integrity and probity since they are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction.<br><br>In numerous cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court imposed the penalty of dismissal on clerks of court who fail to deposit fiduciary funds in authorized government depository as required by rules and regulations. However, we are not unmindful of the difficulties that Alandra encountered upon his assumption to the position of clerk of court, considering the utter disorder in the court's records during the incumbency of his predecessor. We also take note of the fact that respondent attempted to remit to the Fiduciary Fund on October 21, 1996 a check in the amount of P120,000.00 which, unfortunately, was dishonored because the signature therein differs from the signature on file. Furthermore, he did not misappropriate the amount of P17,988.90 as he remitted the same in good faith, albeit wrongly to the JDF. Finally, it appearing that the offense he committed appears to be his first, dismissal from service may be too harsh.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds as follows:<br><ol><li>Salvador P. Oliveros, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Naval, Biliran, is guilty of gross neglect of duty and serious misconduct prejudicial to the interest of the service for which he is fined the amount equivalent to his salary for six (6) months, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
