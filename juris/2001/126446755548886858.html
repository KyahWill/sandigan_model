We find that it fell short of what was expected.&nbsp; A "searching inquiry" means more than informing cursorily the accused that he faces a jail term but also, the exact length of imprisonment under the law and the certainty that he will serve at the national penitentiary or a penal colony. Not infrequently indeed, an accused pleads guilty in the hope of a lenient treatment, or upon bad advice or because of promises of the authorities or parties of a lighter penalty should he admit guilt or express remorse.&nbsp; It is the duty of the judge to see to it that the accused does not labor under these mistaken impressions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In every case where the accused enters a plea of guilty to a capital offense, especially where he is ignorant with little or no education, the proper and prudent course to follow is <i>to take such evidence as are available and necessary </i>in support of the material allegations of the information, including the aggravating circumstances therein enumerated, not only to satisfy the trial judge himself but also <i>to aid the Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequences of his plea</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>After the accused withdrew the plea of guilty, the trial court did not re-arraign accused-appellant.&nbsp; Re-arraignment is necessary.&nbsp; It was evident that the accused misunderstood that the two (2) informations were indictments for attempted rapes.<br><br>When life is at stake, we can not lean on the presumption that the accused understood his plea.&nbsp; We must be sure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> We cannot anchor our judgment on mere speculations and conjectures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The retaking of the accused's plea is necessary.&nbsp; Arraignment is a formal procedure in a criminal prosecution "to afford an accused due process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> An arraignment is the means of implementing the constitutional right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Actual arraignment is an element of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is imperative that the accused is thus made fully aware of possible loss of freedom, even of his life, depending on the nature of the crime imputed to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Procedural due process requires that the accused be arraigned so that he may be informed as to why he was indicted and what penal offense he has to face, to be convicted only on a showing that his guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt with full opportunity to disprove the evidence against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On August 17, 1995, the trial court issued an order reading:<br><br><blockquote>"It appearing from the searching inquiry upon the above named accused that he did not fully comprehend the consequences of his previous plea of guilty, the motion for withdrawal of the improvident plea of guilt, interposed by counsel for the accused is hereby GRANTED.<br><br>"Consequently, considering that the dropping of Crim.
