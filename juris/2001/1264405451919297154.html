Reyes Street, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, was one of victim Benjamin Raymundo's neighbors. On that fateful morning of July 24, 1991, around 7:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., she was waiting for her husband outside their house. While so engaged, [she] saw a man, whom she [later] identified as Rainier Lisbog, come out of Raymundo's house. Rosana and this person looked at each other. Later in the evening when Rosana and her husband came home from work, they learned that their neighbor, Benjamin Raymundo, had been robbed and killed.<br><br>"Ramon Bernardo, a refrigeration/aircon technician, testified that in the morning of July 24, 1991, he went to the house of Benjamin Raymundo to get a refrigeration gasket. Before reaching the gate of the compound where Benjamin lived, he met a man whom he described as wearing a ball cap, white T-shirt, black pants[; was] thin faced, dark skinned, of medium buil[d] and about 16 to 20 years old. He identified that person in open court as Jayson Diadid. When he was already inside the compound, he called out `Mang Ben, Mang Ben'. A man opened the door and demonstrated that Benjamin Raymundo was still asleep. In turn, Ramon made a sign indicating that he [would] be back. A little later at about 9:00 in the morning, Ramon came back and learned that Benjamin Raymundo had been robbed and killed. Ramon Bernardo identified the man who made a sign to him as Rainier Lisbog.<br><br>"Cozette Aragon, one of appellant's co-accused, was called to testify as a witness during appellant's trial. Cozette testified that he was introduced to Jayson Diadid by a classmate named Dennis Sison. Dennis introduced Cozette to Jayson because the latter could do whatever had to be done in the robbery being planned by Cozette. When Jayson and Cozette were planning the robbery, Jayson asked Cozette if he wanted to have his uncle killed, to which Cozette replied in the negative as he merely wanted to rob his uncle.<br><br>"On the day of the robbery, Cozette, Rainier, Jayson and appellant arriv. together at the house of Benjamin Raymundo. Cozette removed one jalousie block of a window, through which he was able to unlock the door. They then entered the house. At first they sat on the sofa.&nbsp; After that, Cozette pointed out to Jayson the room of his uncle. Jayson saw a wallet and 3 packs of cigarettes on top of a refrigerator. He took them and handed them to appellant. When Cozette and Jayson entered Benjamin's room, Rainier acted as a look-out posted by the door while appellant sat on the sofa, waiting for Cozette and Jayson, just outside Benjamin Raymundo's room. During the robbery, Benjamin was repeatedly stabbed by Jayson, leading to Benjamin's death.<br><br>"Dr. Alberto Reyes, a medico-legal officer of the NBI, testified that he performed the autopsy on the cadaver of Benjamin Raymundo. According to Dr. Reyes, the victim sustained 21 stab wounds, 7 in the front and 14 at the back. The stab wounds affected some vital organs such as the lung, the liver and the pancreas. He gave the immediate cause of death as severe hemorrhage resulting from stab wounds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (citations omitted)</blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Defense's vision</u><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant given the following narration of facts:<br><br><blockquote>"Accused<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Reyderick Lago</span> testified that on <span style="font-weight: bold;">June 24, 1991,</span> the regular classes opened. At around 6:30 to 7:00 in the morning, accused Cozette Aragon who was his classmate&nbsp; in English approached him and asked him to accompany him to the house of his uncle to get a project and collect his salary. Aragon also invited Lisbog to go with them. Thereafter, he came to know that Diadid also proceeded to the house of Aragon's uncle at the back of Don Bosco in Kalentong.<br><br>"Upon entering the gate of the house, Aragon opened the jalousie window with the use of a `<b><i>beinte nueve''</i></b>' balisong and unlocked the door. Aragon let them in. Lisbog was instructed to wait outside. While he was seated on the sofa, Aragon and Diadid went inside the room. Suddenly, he heard somebody was groaning from the room. Afraid, he immediately left the place and went to the&nbsp; house of his grandmother in Mandaluyong who advised him not to leave the place anymore.<br><br>"On cross-examination, he testified that Cozette Aragon was his classmate in one of his back subjects at Jose Fabella Memorial School. Lisbog was also his classmate. He did not know personally Jayson Diadid and Dennis Sison. He admitted that when he heard the groaning inside the room, he did not bother to verify what was happening. He went out of the house immediately and did not attend his classes anymore. He stopped schooling.

Neither is it necessary to show that two or more persons met together and entered into an explicit agreement setting out the details of an unlawful scheme or objective to be carried out. The conspiracy may be deduced from the mode or manner in which the crime was perpetrated; it may also be inferred from the acts of the accused evincing a joint or common purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellant met with his co-accused — Cozette Aragon, Jayson Diadid, Rainier Lisbog and Dennis Sison — at noon on July 23, 1991, to discuss Aragon's plan to rob an uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Initially, appellant contended that he had only accompanied Aragon, who was going to the house of the latter's uncle to get a project and collect an unpaid salary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> But appellant later admitted that he had conspired to rob but not to kill the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Except for Sison who did not show up at the meeting place agreed upon, all the four conspirators met on June 24, 1991, near the Jose Fabella Memorial School.&nbsp; From there they proceeded to the victim's house at the back of Don Bosco on Kalentong Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Upon reaching the house, Aragon forcibly opened the jalousie using a <i>viente-nueve balisong</i> (29-inch knife) and entered the house with Diadid and Lago.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The latter two entered the victim's bedroom, while appellant sat on the sofa where he waited for them to come out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> When appellant heard the groaning inside the bedroom, he became apprehensive and left, because he sensed that his two companions were stabbing the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> All this time, Lisbog acted as a lookout.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Although Aragon av.s that it was only Diadid who did the stabbing, the latter's act is deemed to be the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This Court has ruled that whenever a homicide has been committed as a consequence or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals in the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, even if they did not all actually take part in the homicide; that is, unless it appears that those who did not do so endeavored to prevent the homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The medicolegal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation testified that the victim was stabbed 21 times, 7 in front and 14 at the back. Some of his vital organs were hit like the right lung, the liver and the pancreas.&nbsp; The immediate cause of death was severe hemorrhage resulting from stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Because the victim was stabbed 21 times, it could not be said that there was no intent to kill him.&nbsp; Although Aragon testified that he had no intention to kill, but only to rob, why did the former bring his co-assailants to his uncle's house? Why did he bring a <i>balisong</i> when he entered his uncle's room? Why did he not prevent Diadid from stabbing the victim? Why was it necessary to inflict 21 stab wounds? These questions further imply that the common objective was more than robbery.<br><br>Appellant himself, in his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> agrees with the findings of the trial court that he "conspired with his co-accused to commit robbery."&nbsp; He claims, however, that there was "no concurrence of sentiment and no positive proof or evidence that he joined his co-accused in the commission of the crime of homicide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> We are not persuaded.<br><br>Time and time again, this Court has ruled that when conspiracy is proven, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As shown above the prosecution was able to prov.beyond reasonable doubt that conspiracy had attended the commission of the crime of robbery with homicide.&nbsp; Despite the protestations of appellant that he did not conspire to rob and kill, but only to rob, the victim, we hold that appellant is liable for the special complex crime of robbery with homicide.<br><br>The elements of this special complex crime are the following: (1) the taking of personal property is committed with violence or intimidation against a person; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is done with <i>animo lucrandi</i>; and (4) by reason of the robbery or on occasion thereof, homicide (used in its generic sense) is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The records and the pleadings show that all the above mentioned elements are present in the case at bar. Appellant and his cohorts broke into the house of Aragon's uncle;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> took the victim's wallet and cash, wrist watch and several pieces of jewelry amounting to P67,000;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and, in the course of the robbery, stabbed and killed the victim.<br><br>As aforesaid, whenever a homicide is committed as a consequence of or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part in the asportation will be held guilty of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, even if they did not all actually take part in the homicide, <i>unless it appears that those who did not do so endeavored to prevent the killing</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Appellant, upon hearing the groaning emanating from the bedroom, did not do anything to check on what was happening. Thinking that his cohorts were stabbing the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> appellant simply allowed them to finish their dastardly deed. He hid for two years - first in the house of his grandmother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and, later on, in that of his mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> On January 6, 1994, a barangay official apprehended and brought him to the Mandaluyong jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>It is therefore clear that appellant did not do anything to prevent his co-conspirators from stabbing and ultimately killing the victim.&nbsp; When he left the scene of the crime; he could have gone to the police to report the crime, but he hid and tried to escape the arm of the law.&nbsp; Because he did not do anything to prevent the homicide, he is therefore equally guilty of robbery with homicide.<br><br>We affirm the awards of actual damages which were duly proven.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is <i style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and the assailed Decision is <i><span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.&nbsp; </i>Costs against appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Gonzaga-Reyes,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Written by Judge Rodolfo R.
