				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><i>"Agencies tasked with the preliminary investigation and prosecution of crimes must always be wary of undertones of political harassment. They should never forget that the purpose of a preliminary investigation is to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution, and to protect one from an open and public accusation of a crime, from the trouble, expense and anxiety of a public trial, and also to protect the State from useless and expensive trial. It is, therefore, imperative upon such agencies to relieve any person from the trauma of going through a trial once it is ascertained that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a prima facie case or that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">The Case<br></div><br>Before this Court is a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> assailing the decision of the Ombudsman<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. The decision disapproved a recommendation of the Special Prosecutor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for the dismissal of the criminal case against petitioner Dr. Honorata G. Baylon (hereafter, Dr. Baylon) and co-accused, and approved a memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> recommending the prosecution of the criminal case. The petition prays that the Sandiganbayan be enjoined from further proceedings in the criminal case.<br><br><center>The Facts<br></center><br>In 1993, the Secretary of Health appointed Dr. Baylon as the Program Manager of the Government's National Voluntary Blood Donation Program (hereafter, the blood program).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The National Kidney and Transplant Institute (hereafter, NKTI) was the lead agency of the blood program. In the same year, the Department of Health (hereafter, DOH), assisted by the USAID made a study on the safety of the Philippine blood banking system.<br><br>On February 3, 1994, the DOH called a meeting of all the managers of the department's several programs. During the meeting, a comprehensive work plan for a new project "STOP D.E.A.T.H.: Hospitals for Philippines 2000" (hereafter, the project) was discussed. The blood program was one of the six (6) new programs included in the project.<br><br>A week later,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> on February 11, 1994, the DOH allotted two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) to the NKTI as start-up money for the blood program<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>. The official disbursement was made on February 18, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On February 18, 1994, the DOH issued Department Order Nos. 73-f and 73-g, series of 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Department Order No. 73-f launched the project. The sum of fifty-one million pesos (P51,000,000.00) was allocated for the blood program.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Department Order No. 73-g created an Executive Committee and a National Secretariat for the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On February 24,1994, Secretary of Health Juan M. Flavier revealed to the public the results of the USAID study, to wit:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> the blood transfusion service of the country failed to adequately meet the public demand for safe blood; and<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">the blood sourced from commercial blood banks had a contamination rate of 4%.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote>On March 3, 1994, in view of the afore-quoted findings, Secretary Flavier issued a closure order on the provincial retail outlets of commercial blood banks.<br><br>The events led to an acute shortage of blood available to the public as the commercial blood banks intentionally refused to sell blood in retaliation to the closure order. Thus, Secretary Flavier instructed the immediate implementation of the voluntary blood donation system as the only alternative source of blood.<br><br>The NKTI expedited the installation of the blood program. On March 8 and 17, 1994, requisition vouchers for the initial purchase of containers for blood were issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 1994, NKTI decided to purchase Terumo blood bags for immediate distribution to the regional hospitals and medical centers.<br><br>On March 16, 1994, NKTI obtained a quotation of the prices of blood bags (Terumo brand) from FVA-Exim Trading (hereafter, FVA). FVA is the <b><u>exclusive</u></b> distributor of Terumo blood bags and the only supplier which could supply all sizes of the blood bags.<br><br>The prices quoted were:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote>a. Single&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P72.29<br>b. Double&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P171.00<br>c. Triple&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P263.70<br></blockquote>On March 29,1994, upon NKTI's request, FVA submitted a quotation at reduced prices, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>a. Single&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; P63.54<br>b. Double&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; P150.00<br>c. Triple&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; P209.09<br></blockquote>In March 1995, the Commission on Audit (hereafter, COA) through its Resident Auditor, Ms. Blesida Gutierrez, disallowed in post-audit the above purchase on the ground that the NKTI failed to conduct a public bidding. The COA Auditor averred that the cost of the blood bags was overpriced and grossly disadvantageous to the government. The COA auditor made a comparison of the prices of the blood bags quoted by FVA to NKTI with the prices offered to other medical institutes such as the Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC), Mother Seaton and to Our Lady of Fatima,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Blood</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">NKTI </td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">PNRC</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Mother </td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Our </td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Price</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Bag </td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Seaton</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Lady of </td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Difference</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Capacity</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fatima </td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Single</td> <td>P63.54</td> <td>P38.00</td> <td>P43.00</td> <td>P43.00</td> <td>P22.21</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Double</td> <td>P150.00</td> <td>P100.00</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>P50.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Triple</td> <td>P209.09</td> <td>P155.00</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>P54.09</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Based on the above price differences, the COA concluded that the government incurred a total loss of one million nine hundred sixty four and three hundred and four pesos and seventy centavos (P1,964,304.70) arising from the transaction between NKTI and FVA. We quote the NKTI Annual Audit Report for the year 1995 prepared by the COA:<br><blockquote>"Procurement of supplies for the National Voluntary Blood Donation Program was made without public bidding in violation of COA Circular No. 85-554 and Hospital Order No. 12, s 1995 resulting to an overpricing in the amount of P1.964 M."<br></blockquote>On February 4, 1997, a complaint-affidavit was filed with the Ombudsman<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> against Dr. Baylon and other DOH officials.

According to the resolution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><blockquote>"We therefore subscribe to the finding of the Department of Health Investigation Committee which concluded that there was no overpricing for lack of legal and factual basis.

Dr. Baylon and her co-accused did not exert their best efforts at obtaining the best deal for the government and that such inaction indicated their gross inexcusable negligence. The memorandum stated that there appears to be no cogent reason to reverse the memorandum of August 9, 1999 finding probable cause against Dr. Baylon and her co-accused. The memorandum recommended thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><blockquote>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended that the motion for reconsideration be <b>Denied </b>and prosecution <b>Proceed</b> forthwith."<br></blockquote>On February 20, 2000, Ombudsman Aniano A.

Alano's request to lift the previous audit disallowance in the amount of six million six thousand and one hundred thirty three pesos and fifty four centavos (P6,006,133.54) representing the cost of the blood bags that NKTI purchased from FVI. According to the COA decision, the COA came to the following conclusions: <b><u>First</u></b>, the purchase of the Terumo blood bags without public bidding is not violative of P. D. 1594, R. A. 1760 and COA Circular No. 85-55A as the supplies were to be used in connection with a project or activity that cannot be delayed without causing detriment to public service and the materials are sold by an <b><u>exclusive</u></b> distributor who does not have sub-dealers selling at lower prices for which no suitable substitute can be obtained. <b><u>Second</u></b>, to determine if the price is excessive and thus not advantageous to the government, a canvass should have been made by the auditor as required by COA Memorandum No. 97-012, which it failed to do. The COA decided thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote>"Upon the foregoing considerations, the herein request of Dr. Filoteo A.

The price comparison is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><blockquote><center><b>1994 Prices of Terumo Blood Bags Sold to Government Hospitals</b><br></center><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div><u><strong>Hospital&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></u></div></td> <td><u><strong>Single Bag</strong></u></td> <td><u><strong>Double Bag</strong></u></td> <td><u><strong>Triple Bag</strong></u></td> </tr> <tr> <td>NKTI</td> <td>P63.54</td> <td>P150.00</td> <td>P209.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PGH</td> <td>P78.00 </td> <td>P185.40</td> <td>P285.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>JRMMC</td> <td>P85.05</td> <td>--</td> <td> --</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fabella</td> <td>P85.00</td> <td>P199.00</td> <td>--</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PCMC</td> <td>P64.00</td> <td>--</td> <td>P209.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Heart Center</td> <td>P78.00</td> <td>P190.00</td> <td>--</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>From the above table, it can be seen that NKTI was able to secure the Terumo blood bags from FVA at a price advantageous to the government.<br><br>We further note that when the COA made a finding that the government suffered a loss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> comparing the prices at which the bags were offered to PNRC, Mother Seaton and Our Lady of Fatima with the prices offered to NKTI, it committed a significant error. The prices compared cover two different years. The COA based its findings on prices offered in 1995, whereas the actual purchase of the blood bags was made by NKTI in 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The COA recognized its own error and reversed itself in its decision of June 21, 2001, when it lifted the audit disallowance in so far as the procurement of the Terumo blood bags by NKTI from FVI is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> We cannot ignore the reasons behind this, reasons that we accept in this decision as well.<br><br>The fact is that NKTI chose FVA as its supplier since it is the <b>sole</b> distributor of Terumo blood bags, and no sub-dealer or dealer could offer the bags at lower prices or at better conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The choice of the Terumo brand was also sufficiently explained. Reputable medical institutions such as St. Luke's Medical Center, The Lung Center of the Philippines, Makati Medical Center, Philippine Children's Medical Center and Cardinal Santos Medical Center use the Terumo brand and have attested to its superior qualities compared with other brands, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><u><b>Characteristic </b></u></td> <td><u><b>Terumo Brand </b></u></td> <td><div> <u><b>Other Brands</b></u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div>Ability to withstand </div></td> <td>No bursting reported </td> <td>Bursting reported</td> </tr> <tr> <td>centrifugation and</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>leading to wastage</td> </tr> <tr> <td>deep freezing</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sharpness of Needle</td> <td>Very sharp</td> <td><div>Not so sharp; causes</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div>undue pain to donor</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Needle shaft </td> <td>Does not rotate </td> <td>Rotates</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Blood flow</td> <td>Fast </td> <td><div>Not so fast because</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div>of rotation of needle</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div>Availability of the </div></td> <td>Readily available; </td> <td>Less available;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>multiple blood bag</td> <td>has a complete line</td> <td>single blood bag</td> </tr> <tr> <td>system&nbsp; </td> <td>of single, double,</td> <td>only</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>triple and quadruple</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div>blood bags</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Transfer of blood</td> <td>Easy</td> <td><div>Takes longer period</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>components</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>of time</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><b>(2) Even assuming there was injury to the Government, there was no bad faith or inexcusable negligence on the part of petitioner.</b><br><br>Here, there is no evident bad faith on the part of petitioner and her co-accused. "Bad faith" does not simply connote bad moral judgment or negligence. There must be some dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will. It partakes of the nature of fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill will for ulterior purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Neither is there "gross negligence." "Gross negligence" is characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a willful or intentional manner displaying a conscious indifference to consequences as far as other persons may be affected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>We cannot discount the fact that a sense of urgency drove petitioner to purchase the Terumo blood bags. The project could not be delayed without causing detriment to the public service. There was a shortage in the blood supply available to the public. To determine whether there was bad faith, these essential facts should not have been ignored. When the Ombudsman did not take these facts into consideration in the determination of probable cause, he gravely abused his discretion. When the Ombudsman chose not to dismiss the case despite the recommendations of the EPIB dated March 17, 1999 and the findings of the Special Prosecutor, dated January 18, 2000, he unduly harassed petitioner and her co-accused.<br><br>The petitioner was merely doing her job and only acted in response to an emergency brought about by the shortage in the blood supply available to the public. The shortage in the blood supply available to the public was a matter recognized and addressed by Secretary of Health Juan M. Flavier. Secretary Flavier attests that he "directed the NKTI to do something about the situation and immediately fast-track the implementation of the Voluntary Blood Donation Program of the government in order to prevent further deaths owing to the lack of blood."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In fact, more than finding fault in petitioner's quick action, she and her co-accused, should be commended for acting "promptly" and "diligently"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> in response to a crisis.<br><br>In <i>National Center for Mental Health Management v. COA,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> we found that respondent COA committed grave abuse of discretion when it "discarded rather hastily, if not unfairly, the factors that were actually taken into account by petitioners before the purchases were effected." We find that the same haste and unfairness exist in the case at bar. In the afore-cited case, the Court characterized expenditures as relative, adopting the comment of then COA Chairman Francisco Tantuico, Jr., to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><blockquote>"The terms `irregular', `unnecessary', `excessive,' and `extravagant," when used in reference to expenditures of funds or uses of property, are relative. The determination of which expenditure of funds or property belong to this or that type is situational. Circumstances of time and place, behavioral and ecological factors, as well as political, social and economic conditions, would influence any such determination. Viewed from this perspective, transactions under audit are to be judged on the basis of not only the standards of legality but also those of regularity, necessity, reasonableness and moderation."<br></blockquote>The urgency of the situation, and the good faith of petitioner and her co-accused are attested to by then Secretary of Health, now Senator, Juan M. Flavier. He states:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><blockquote>"...it was imperative that the blood bags were procured immediately to meet the urgent need to supply the hospitals with blood bags to start the blood program...The negotiated prices that NKTI obtained were even lower than the buying price of other tertiary government hospitals...Although the Ombudsman had already dismissed the charges against me and three others, I feel distraught and very unhappy that my colleagues who worked hard for me during my stint as Secretary of Health are being punished for acting promptly and diligently during that critical period in March 1994."<br></blockquote>Above premises considered, we fail to see how the purchases of the Terumo blood bags were made in bad faith or with gross negligence.<br><br>The Ombudsman's grave abuse of discretion is further made obvious by the fact that the charges against Secretary Flavier were dropped,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> but the charges against petitioner, Dr. Baylon and her co-accused were not. The basis for this is not seen in the records, indicating arbitrariness on the part of respondent Ombudsman.<br><br>The facts of the case also readily show that the circumstances surrounding the purchase of Terumo blood bags exempted it from the requirement of a public bidding. Executive Order No. 301, Section 1 provides:<br><blockquote>"Any provision of law, decree, executive order or other issuances to the contrary notwithstanding, no contract for public services or for furnishing supplies, materials and equipment to the government or any of its branches, agencies or instrumentalities shall be renewed or entered into without public bidding, <u>except under any of the following situations</u>:<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>"b. Whenever the supplies are to be used in connection with a <u>project or activity which cannot be delayed</u> without causing detriment to the public service;<br><br>"c. Whenever the materials are sold by an exclusive distributor or manufacturer <u>who does not have any subdealers selling at lower prices and for which no suitable substitute can be obtained elsewhere at more advantageous terms</u> to the government;<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>"e. In cases where it is apparent that the requisition of the needed supplies through negotiated purchase is most advantageous to the government to be <u>determined by the Department Head concerned</u> (<i>underscoring ours</i>)."<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">The Fallo<br></div><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition.
