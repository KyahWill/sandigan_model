				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In resolving this appeal, the Court relies on the following settled doctrines: (1) the positive identification of an eyewitness who is shown to have no ill motive to testify falsely against the accused prevails over the bare denials of the latter; (2) treachery cannot be considered if the eyewitness did not see the commencement of the assault; (3) a qualifying circumstance must be proven as clearly as the crime itself; and (4) actual damages must be proven by the best evidence available.<br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>For the consideration of this Court is an appeal from the March 24, 1999 Decision rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, Branch 45,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in Criminal Case No. U-4499 convicting Florante Leal on two counts of murder.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the said Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused, FLORANTE LEAL Y UNGOS, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of TWO COUNTS of MURDER and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of two sentences of RECLUSION PERPETUA and for the death of the victims, JOEL JACOB and EMERSON JACOB, who are brothers, to pay the heirs of said deceased, as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1)&nbsp; P100,000.00 for indemnity (P50,000.00 each);<br><br>2)&nbsp; P50,000.00 for actual expenses;<br><br>3)&nbsp; P1,000,000.00 for moral damages (P500,000.00 each); and<br><br>4)&nbsp; To pay the costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></div></blockquote><br>This case started when the Information dated August 4, 1987 was filed by Second Assistant Provincial Fiscal Jorito C.

Gonzales Jr.; and the victim's mother, Lagrimas Jacob.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General summarized the facts of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"[O]n the evening of February 20, 1987, Ariel Veloria was fetched at home in Barangay Bayaoas, Urdaneta City by the brothers Joel and Emerson Jacob, Moore Ganzagan and others and thereafter proceeded to the house of a friend of Joel Jacob where they drank beer and played the guitar (pp. 15-16, tsn, January 28, 1999).&nbsp; At about 8:00 p.m., the group (Jacob's) went to the Urduja Folk House to sing since one of their companions sings thereat (p. 17, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; At about 11:00 p.m., the other members of the group left and went home but Veloria, Ganzagan and the Jacob brothers proceeded to Q-Mart Beerhouse where they drank beer (pp. 18-19, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Thereat, Jacob's group saw another group which included Emerson Jacob's brother-in-law.&nbsp; At the latter's invitation, Jacob's group joined them (p. 21, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; At past midnight, Jacob's group left the beerhouse and walked home.&nbsp; Veloria was behind Ganzagan and Joel Jacob and behind Veloria was Emerson Jacob (p. 22, <i>supra).</i><br><br>"As the Jacob's group passed by the Rosemart Disco Club, they saw Florante Leal standing in front of said disco house (p. 22, tsn, January 12, 1999).&nbsp; Subsequently, Veloria heard shouts and as he looked at the direction where the shouts came from, he saw Emerson Jacob running towards the north, pursued by Florante Leal who was holding a knife (pp. 7-8, tsn, January 28, 1999).&nbsp; Veloria knew Leal, being his barriomate in Barangay Bayaoas (p. 4, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Leal caught up with Emerson at a Shell gasoline station and immediately stabbed Emerson Jacob.&nbsp; Veloria, who was about three meters away, saw Leal fatally stab Emerson Jacob (p. 10, <i>supra</i>).<br><br>"Moore Ganzagan who was with Joel Jacob heard shouts and as Ganzagan looked back, he saw Emerson fall down.&nbsp; Standing beside the fallen Emerson was Leal, holding a knife about a foot long (pp. 19-20, tsn, January 12, 1999).&nbsp; On seeing his fallen brother, Joel Jacob went to his assistance but was also stabbed to death by Leal despite Joel Jacob's utterance of, `I will not fight' (pp. 23-24, <i>supra</i>).<br><br>"The autopsy Report dated Febuary 21, 1987 of Dr. Ramon Gonzales Jr., Rural Health Physician of Urdaneta City, shows that Joel Jacob suffered a stab wound in the abdomen, semi-lunar in shape, penetrating, directed upwards and inwards (p. 4, tsn, Feb. 2, 1999) and hit the heart (p. 7, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Emerson Jacob's cadaver was likewise autopsied.&nbsp; Dr. Gonzales' Autopsy Report dated February 21, 1987 shows a stab wound in the abdomen, at the epigastric region, penetrating, directed upwards and downwards; a stab wound at the left anterior chest wall; a stab wound in the chest, anterior wall along the anterior axillary line, penetrating, through and through (pp. 8-9, <i>supra</i>)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Version of the Defense</i><br></div><br>Appellant denies having stabbed the victims.&nbsp; The latter, he claims, were involved in a rumble; he only approached them to help Joel Jacob, who had fallen after being stabbed.&nbsp; Testifying for the defense were appellant himself; Perfecto Lazo, one of the two waiters of the Rosemart Disco Pub on duty that night, and Elmer Domingo, a patron of the disco pub.&nbsp; Their testimonies were summarized by the defense in the following counterstatement of the facts:<br><br><blockquote>"The defense evidence tends to belie any participation of [appellant] in the alleged incident alleging among others that [o]n the evening of February 20, 1987, accused-appellant was inside the Rosemart Disco Pub situated at Poblacion, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, together with Mario Andrada and Rolando Javier drinking and disco dancing x x x.&nbsp; At around 12:30 early morning of February 21, 1987, Janus Mejia reported to him that he was x x x mauled so appellant x x x went outside to verify the matter.&nbsp; He saw and recognized the persons who mauled Mejia to be the brothers of his barkada so he pacified the protagonist[s] and let them shake hands.&nbsp; He returned later inside the [d]isco [p]ub and continued drinking, after which, Mario Andrada and Bobby Andrada asked permission to go home to which he acceded so appellant and companion Rolando Javier was left behind to consume the remaining bottles of beer.&nbsp; After a while, the security guard called appellant's attention that his two companions Mario Andrada and Bobby Andrada were involved in a rumble or fight.&nbsp; When he went outside, he saw two (2) groups of men fighting, one from the Folkhouse and the other outside the [d]isco [p]ub.&nbsp; He saw Mario Andrada and Bobby Andrada lying on the ground and on the other side of the pavement, he saw another person lying down. He carried Bobby Andrada and brought him near the building.&nbsp; When he went to help Mario Andrada, the latter stood up by himself so that he went near Emerson Jacob but somebody hit him on the neck, causing him to lost consciousness and regained it after a few minutes.&nbsp; He then saw another person lying prostrate on the ground bathed in his own blood [and] three (3) to four (4) meters away from him.&nbsp; He then ran inside the Rosemart Disco Pub because he was afraid and stayed there for about twenty (20) to thirty (30) minutes.&nbsp; He recognized that the persons outside who were involved in the rumble were the Jacob brothers, Moore Ganzagan and Ariel Veloria and one by the name of Agsalud, Byron Corpuz, Danny Agait and others whom he could no longer recognize.&nbsp; He recognized the person he mentioned as they were his former schoolmates in high school.&nbsp; After twenty (20) to thirty (30) minutes inside the pub house, he went home by riding in a tricycle.&nbsp; (TSN, March 15, 1999, pp. 3-9)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>The trial court gave full credence to the testimonies of Ganzagan and Veloria, who said that they had seen appellant stab the two victims.&nbsp; Not only did they make categorical statements pointing to appellant as the author of both crimes, but the latter himself confirmed that these witnesses bore no grudge, misunderstanding, animosity or ulterior motive to testify falsely against him.&nbsp; Their positive identification of him as the assailant prevailed over his negative denials.<br><br>The testimonies of the defense witnesses, on the other hand, were contradictory on material points.&nbsp; One witness said that the security guard did not do anything to pacify the commotion outside the disco pub, while another said that the guard fired two warning shots in the air.&nbsp; Appellant claims that he returned to the disco pub and stayed there for about twenty minutes, but a witness contradicted his assertion.<br><br>Appellant, after witnessing his friends being stabbed, did not report the incident to the police but, instead, went home and proceeded as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; The trial court ruled that such actuation was not typical of a witness who had observed a crime; hence, his testimony was not worthy of belief.&nbsp; Moreover, he admitted that, while being detained at the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) district jail in Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, he had escaped with eleven other detainees, killed two jail guards and gone into hiding for almost twelve years.&nbsp; His absurd explanation was that he did so because his lawyer had gone abroad, and he had a furniture business which he could not leave behind.&nbsp; Flight is an indication of guilt.<br><br>The trial court ruled that appellant was guilty of having stabbed the Jacob brothers, and that treachery had attended the killing because he had suddenly and unexpectedly stabbed the victims while they were unarmed and unaware of the impending attack.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Issues</span><br></div><br>Appellant submits the following assignment of errors:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>"The trial court gravely erred in finding that treachery attended the commission of the alleged deed, thus, qualifying the killing to murder.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>"The trial court gravely erred in awarding an exorbitant amount of P50,000.00 as actual expenses and P1,000,000.00 as moral damages to the parent of the two (2) victims sans competent proof to support the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Despite failure of appellant to allege that the trial court did not succeed in proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, this Court will review, as the first issue, the sufficiency of the evidence against him.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">This Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</i><br></div><br>We concur with the trial court that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are "unequivocal, forthright and replete with details, all of which are seals of self-authentication&nbsp; of their credibility.&nbsp; x x x."<br><br>Significantly, appellant no longer insists on his innocence.&nbsp; Indeed, the prosecution had presented convincing eyewitness accounts of the killing, which the defense utterly failed to contradict.

The former was likewise stabbed by appellant.&nbsp; Even the positions of the stab wounds inflicted upon the victims showed that the attacks were frontal. Thus, appellant avers that these attacks were made impulsively — on the "spur of the moment" — during a chance encounter, which he could not possibly have thoroughly prepared for.<br><br>The prosecution rebuts, arguing that the attacks were so sudden and unexpected that any defense either victim might have put up was bound to be ineffective. It contends that appellant deliberately allowed the victims' companions to pass and, when their backs were turned, he pounced on Emerson who naturally found it difficult to maneuver away from his assailant, let alone defend himself.&nbsp; The attack on Joel was also treacherous, since he was running to his fallen brother's succor, pleading for his own life and saying he would not fight, yet he was stabbed by appellant.&nbsp; His pleas were akin to those of a man with hands raised above his head in surrender and, thus, clearly in a defenseless position.<br><br>We agree with appellant.&nbsp; Treachery exists "when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure the execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It requires the concurrence of the following conditions: (1) the employment of means, methods or manner of execution that would insure the offender's safety from any retaliatory act on the part of the offended party, who has thus no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation; and (2) the deliberate or conscious choice of such means, methods or manner of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>While the accounts of the eyewitnesses positively identify the assailant, they were, however, unclear in depicting how he had launched his attack against Emerson.&nbsp; We would be going into the realm of speculation if we were to conclude that appellant planned the attack.&nbsp; Ganzagan said that he, together with Joel and Veloria, had already passed appellant when the former heard shouts coming from behind.&nbsp; By the time he turned around, Emerson was already running away. For treachery to be appreciated, it must be present and seen by the witness right at the inception of the attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Where no particulars are known as to how the killing began, its perpetration with treachery cannot be merely supposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>As regards the attack on Joel, the victim already knew that his life was at risk when he saw his fallen brother and the assailant.&nbsp; But given the ties of blood, Joel chose to ignore the threat in order to help his brother.&nbsp; These circumstances, though heroic and tragic, hardly prove treachery.&nbsp; Even if treachery becomes evident at a subsequent stage, if it was not so at the start and the attack was continuous, it cannot be considered in the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The testimonies of Ganzagan and Veloria failed to establish the requisites of treachery.&nbsp; Neither of them described how the attack commenced — whether it was sudden and unexpected, and whether the victims were totally caught unaware.&nbsp; Treachery cannot be presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> To aggravate the killing as murder, the qualifying circumstance must be proved as indubitably as the crime itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Because the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not established, under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, appellant's conviction should be on two counts of homicide only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Third Issue:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Amount of Damages</i><br></div><br>Appellant disputes the bare testimony of the victims' mother.
