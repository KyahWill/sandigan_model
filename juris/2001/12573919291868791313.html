Onciano who was born on December 13, 1981 at Tondo General Hospital. The father, Raul Gomez left Nida Onciano even before Maria Rizalina was born.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Nida Onciano met the accused-appellant, Deolito Optana in 1985 at Doris Restaurant in Olongapo City where they were both working.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> They decided to live together in 1986 without the benefit of marriage even if accused-appellant knew that Nida Onciano already had a daughter. Out of this common-law relationship, the couple had seven children, the eldest being born in 1988 and the youngest, less than a month when the accused-appellant testified in court in June, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In 1990, the couple moved to Subic and established residence at Sitio Daan Naugsol, Manganvaca, Subic, Zambales with Maria Rizalina and three born children in tow. Maria Rizalina started to go to school at Manggahan Elementary School, Subic, Zambales.<br><br>Sometime in September, 1993, Maria Rizalina was playing in the yard with her brothers and sisters when her stepfather called for her to come up to the room. Her mother was out of the house at that time. Upon entering the room, Maria Rizalina was ordered to undress but she refused. The accused-appellant slapped her face twice on her cheeks and threatened to box her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He finally succeeded in removing her clothes. The accused-appellant kissed Maria Rizalina on the mouth, on her breast, and on her private parts. Thereafter, accused-appellant removed his shorts, held both hands of Maria Rizalina and went on top of her while she was lying on the wooden bed.<br><br>Accused-appellant inserted his penis into the vagina of Maria Rizalina. The latter felt pain in her private part and shouted "masakit po." Accused-appellant stayed on top of Maria Rizalina for about ten (10) minutes making "downward and upward movement" or "pumping." Accused-appellant stood up, took a piece of cloth from the bed (pamunas) and wiped the blood in his sex organ. Afterwhich, he gave the rag to Maria Rizalina and told her to wipe her private part because there was blood on it. He told her to dress up quickly since Maria Rizalina's mother would arrive shortly. Maria Rizalina did not tell her mother what happened to her because she was afraid of the accused-appellant. She was threatened to be killed once she reports the incident. Maria Rizalina was twelve (12) years old at that time of this fateful day.<br><br>On several occasions, whenever Nida Onciano was out of the house since she was busy selling wares in the market, accused-appellant raped Maria Rizalina. The victim could no longer remember how many times she was raped but she particularly recalled that on October 28, 1995, the accused-appellant raped her inside the room where she and her brothers and sisters were sleeping. This was the last time that accused-appellant touched her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>It was on November 24, 1995 when Nida Onciano noticed that Maria Rizalina's tummy was quite protruding while the latter was sleeping on the floor. Maria Rizalina at first refused to answer her mother's inquisitions but finally revealed that the accused-appellant raped her. The next day, Nida Onciano asked her sister, Evelyn Nallos to accompany Maria Rizalina to the doctor to have her examined. At the Olongapo City General Hospital, Dr. Laila Patricio of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department found Maria Rizalina to be 6-7 months pregnant. Maria Rizalina told her that her stepfather repeatedly raped her. The Medical Report revealed the following:<br><br><center><u>Medical Certification</u></center><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">November 27, 1995<br></div><br>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:<br><br>This is to certify that RIZALINA ONSIANO 14 y/o, of Daangbakal, Daan Naugsog Subic, Zambales was examined and treated/confined in this hospital on/from November 25, 1995 xxx with the following findings and/or diagnosis:<br><br>BREAST - Enlarged, areola 3.5 x 3.5 cm, no fissures nor hematoma.<br><br>ABDOMEN - FH 21 cm, FHT -/36/ min. RLQ<br><br>§ Hymen not intact, vagina admits 2 fingers with ease, Cervix closed, uneffaced, floating cephalic.<br><br>§ Pregnancy uterine 6-7 months by size, not in labor.<br><br>(SGD.) LAILA S. PATRICIO, M.D.<br><br>Attending Physician<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>After Maria Rizalina's statement was taken at the police station, a formal complaint was filed against the accused-appellant on November 27, 1995. Considering Maria Rizalina's minor age, she was referred to the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office for assistance. Initial interviews revealed that Maria Rizalina was so confused considering that her mother was pressuring her to withdraw the complaint against the stepfather. It was then recommended that Maria Rizalina be committed to the Department of Social Welfare and Development for protective custody and placed under the care of the Substitute Home for Women in Especially Difficult Circumstances - Saup Lugud Center, San Ignacio Subdivision, Pandan, Angeles City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On February 23, 1996, Maria Rizalina delivered a baby boy at the "Hospital Ning Angeles" in Angeles City whom she named Richard Onciano. The name of the father was not indicated.<br><br>At the Saup Lugud Center, Maria Rizalina manifested signs of depression and violence to the extent of killing herself. She was committed to the National Center for Mental Health for treatment and rehabilitation.<br><br>The accused, on the other hand, denied having raped his stepdaughter. He testified that his stepdaughter was always out of the house with her barkadas. In fact, her mother, Nida was always complaining that she spent so much time looking for her. He testified further that Maria Rizalina was always absent from school. He only learned about the complaint for rape filed against him when he was apprehended by the police.<br><br>Deolito Optana testified that he met Nida Onciano in 1985 in a restaurant in Olongapo City. He knew that Nida had a daughter but he still courted her and promised to take care of both of them and help support in the education of Maria Rizalina.<br><br>Nida Onciano corroborated the accused-appellant's testimony. She did not believe that her common-law husband would rape her daughter because she considered her sexual relationship with him as very satisfactory. She averred that it was her sister, Evelyn Nallos who insisted on pursuing the case against Optana because of an old grudge against them. Evelyn Nallos took care of two of the children of Nida Onciano and Deolito Optana but who died of pneumonia and drowning during a flood. Since the death of the children, her relationship with her sister had been estranged. Evelyn Nallos still wanted to take her other children including Maria Rizalina but she refused.<br><br>On March 5, 1998, the RTC rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused Deolito Optana guilty beyond reasonable doubt by direct participation of the crime of rape as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code and for violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act 7610, judgment is rendered in the following manner:<br><ol type="1"><li> In Criminal Case No. 485-95 for rape, the accused is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua with all the accessory penalties attached thereto and to indemnify the minor Ma.

Rizalina Onciano's child Richard Onciano.<br><br></li><li> The accused is acquitted of the crimes charged in Criminal Case Nos. 482-95, 483-95, 484-95, 486-95, 488-95, 489-95, for insufficiency of evidence.<br><br></li><li> The accused shall be entitled in full of his preventive imprisonment if he agreed in writing to abide by all the disciplinary rules imposed on convicted prisoners, otherwise to only 4/5 thereof.<br><br></li><li> Costs against the accused.</li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant now comes to this Court with the following assignment of errors:<br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>THE APPELLANT'S CONVICTION BY THE TRIAL COURT IS GROUNDED ON FACTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT AND IMPROBABLE TO HAPPEN, AND THE ACTS CHARGED ARE NOT CLEAR, POSITIVE AND CONVINCING, AND NOT CONSISTENT WITH HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND TITE (SIC) NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO CONSIDER AND APPRECIATE THE ILL-MOTIVE AND CONSUMING HATRED OF APPELLANT'S IN-LAWS WHO ORCHESTRATED THE FILING OF THIS CASE, AND WHO WITH UNCUNNY MEASURES PREVENTED THE DEFENSE THE MUCH NEEDED CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO CONSIDER AND APPRECIATE THAT THE ACTUATIONS AND CONDUCT OF THE COMPLAINT AFTER THE INCIDENTS AND DURING THE TRIAL WHEN INTERTWINED WITH OTHER FACTS DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE NORM OF CONDUCT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED AND RAVAGED.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>THE COURT A QUO OVERLOOKED, MISUNDERSTOOD, MISAPPRECIATED AND MISINTERPRETED MATERIAL FACTS OF IMPORTANCE AND SUBSTANCE WHICH IF CONSIDERED AND GIVEN WEIGHT AND PROBATIVE VALUE WILL TILT THE SCALE OF "LADY JUSTICE" IN FAVOR OF ACQUITTAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>We agree with the trial court's decision .<br><br>The victim, Maria Rizalina, first took the witness stand on August 7, 1996. She was, however, observed to be psychologically and emotionally unprepared to testify at that time so the trial court decided to postpone her testimony to a later date after her complete rehabilitation at the National Center for Mental Health.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On January 22, 1997, Maria Rizalina was called back to the witness stand. Now very much calm and composed, she gave a recount of her ordeal under her stepfather.

The trial judge had these observations about the witness:<br><blockquote>Rizalina was already 14 years old when she testified in Court. At the time she testified she was succinct in her declaration and appeared to the Court to be truthful. She had no reason to fabricate a story against the accused who supported her in her daily needs and spent for her education until she finished Grade 6. Ingratitude is not a trait common to a provincial child still innocent of the vicissitudes of life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>A witness who testifies in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank manner and remains consistent is a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Since the trial court found Maria Rizalina's testimony to be credible and trustworthy, it was more than sufficient to sustain the accused-appellant's conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The fact that the accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with the young victim is corroborated by the findings of Dr. Laila Patricio, who upon examination on November, 1995 found Maria Rizalina to be 6-7 months pregnant already. Maria Rizalina confided to her that her stepfather raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This accusation was repeated when she was investigated by SPO3 Cesar Antolin at the Subic Police Station, Subic, Zambales,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and when she was interviewed by Social Welfare Officer II, Ana Ecle of the DSWD, Iba, Zambales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>When the accused-appellant was courting Nida Onciano, he was very aware that she had a daughter. Before they agreed to live together, he was made to understand that he had to accept and treat Maria Rizalina as his own daughter, too-caring for her and providing for her education.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Since Maria Rizalina did not have a father, she regarded the accused-appellant as such.

Many cases attest to the unfortunate fact that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate: in parks, along the roadside, within school premises and even inside a house where there are occupants. Lust is no respecter of time or place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, accused-appellant points to his sister-in-law, Evelyn Nallos as the person who allegedly pressured his stepdaughter to file the charges of rape against him considering an old grudge existing between the two of them. It can be recalled that Evelyn Nallos took care of two of their children who, unfortunately, died under her care, one died of meningitis and pneumonia and the other by drowning in a flood. To the defense, the deaths were plainly due to Evelyn's negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Since then, their relationship was estranged.<br><br>This contention deserves scant consideration. Ill motive is never an essential element of a crime.

It is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for some time the assaults on their virtue because of the rapist's threat on their lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The case at bar is no exception to these well-founded rule. Maria Rizalina never said anything to her mother of the many times the accused-appellant had sexually abused her for fear of her life.

She testified that she was raped several times by her stepfather. While she could hardly remember the exact dates of these instances, she only remembered the first time she was raped which was in September, 1993 when she was only 12 years old and was in Grade IV<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and the last time was on October 28, 1995. Obviously, she could not have conceived in September, 1993 because as she testified, she was not yet menstruating at that time. She started to have her menstruation when she was in Grade V<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> or in 1994. She denies going home late after school and is not fond of being out with friends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Since she maintained that her stepfather raped her several times, the child was definitely conceived as a result of the rape between September, 1993 and October 28, 1995.<br><br>Given all these facts and circumstances, we rule with moral certainty that the accused-appellant is indeed guilty of the crimes.<br><br>Accused-appellant was charged for violation of Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 and Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code for rape which read as follows:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. - Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br><br>The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">"x x x</td><td width="90%"> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"(b)</td><td><div align="justify">Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse: <u>Provided, that when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape</u> and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td>x x x</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>ART. 335 When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">"1.</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">By using force or intimidation;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"2.</td><td><div align="justify">When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"3.</td><td><p align="justify">When the woman is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify">"The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua."</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td>x x x</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>Anent the numerous informations filed, the trial court corrected the erroneous filing of these informations as it explained:<br><blockquote>It will be noted, however, that for the same act committed on the same date by the accused on the same offended party, the accused stands charged with two offenses: for violation of Section 5, paragraph (b) of Republic Act 7610 and for rape committed through force and intimidation. Thus: (1) in Criminal Case Nos. 482-95 and 487-95, the accused was charged with rape and violation of Section 5 paragraph (b) of Republic Act 7610, respectively, committed on the same date, October 1995, when the victim was 13 years old and 9 months; (2) in Criminal Case Nos. 484-95 and 488-95, the Informations charged rape and violation of the same special law, respectively, committed on the same date, "September 1995, when the victim was 13 years and 9 months old; (3) in Criminal Case Nos. 483-95 and 489-95, the accused was charged with rape and violation of the same special law, respectively, committed in October 1995 when the child was 11 years and 10 months old; and (4) in Criminal Case Nos. 485-95 and 486-95, the accused was charged with rape and violation of the same special law, respectively, committed in September 1993 when the victim was 11 years and 9 months old.<br><br><u>Charging the accused with two different offenses for the same act committed on the same date against the said victim is erroneous as it is illegal, except where the law itself so allows. Section 5 (b) Republic Act 7610, however, does not so allow. The said law in fact provides that if the child is below 12 years old, the accused must be prosecuted under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. Conversely, if the child is above 12 years old but below 18 years old, then the accused must be prosecuted under Republic Act 7610 for the so called "child abuse.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>The trial court correctly convicted the accused for Rape under Article 335 of the RPC in Criminal Case No. 485-95 for it was clearly proven that the accused had carnal knowledge with the victim through force and intimidation on that fateful day in September, 1993. This was the first time the accused raped Maria Rizalina who was able to give a detailed account of this traumatic experience. She was below 12 years old at that time. While Maria Rizalina also testified that she was raped several times after September, 1993, the prosecution, however, failed to establish the material details as to the time, place, and manner by which these offenses were committed. There is still a need for proof beyond reasonable doubt that the offenses alleged in the informations were indeed committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, the trial court acquitted the accused under Criminal Case Nos. 482-95, 483-95, 484-95, 486-95, 488-95, 489-95 for want of sufficient evidence.<br><br>Aside from the first incident of rape, all what Maria Rizalina could say was that she was molested by the accused for the last time on October 28, 1995. Whether there was force and intimidation to qualify this incident as rape was, unfortunately, not proven. Nonetheless, there is no dispute that Maria Rizalina was sexually abused by the accused on this occasion. Hence, the trial court convicted the accused under Criminal Case No. 487-95 for violation of Sec. 5(b) of R.A. 7610 or the Child Abuse Law.<br><br>In the case of <i>People v. Larin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court has explained that the elements of the offense penalized under this provision are as follows;<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or <i>lascivious conduct.</i><br><br></li><li> The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.<br><br></li><li> The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.</li></ol>A child is deemed exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse, when the child indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct (a) for money, profit, or any other consideration; or (b) under the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group. Under RA 7610, children are "persons below eighteen years of age or those unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of their age or mental disability or condition."<br><br>It must be noted that the law covers not only a situation in which a child is abused for profit, but also one in which a child, through coercion or intimidation, engages in any lascivious conduct. Hence, the foregoing provision penalizes not only child prostitution, the essence of which is profit, but also other forms of sexual abuse of children. This is clear from the deliberations of the Senate.</blockquote>From the above disquisition, the accused is certainly guilty for sexual abuse committed on his stepdaughter, using his moral ascendancy in intimidating the victim to engage in sexual intercourse with him.<br><br>The amount of damages must, however, be modified. In each of the cases, the trial court awarded the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P100,000 for moral damages and another P100,000 as exemplary damages. In line with recent jurisprudence, the award of P50,000 as civil indemnity is in order regardless of proof. In addition to civil indemnity, moral damages may, likewise, be awarded without the need for proving the same in the amount not exceeding P50,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The award of exemplary damages must be deleted for lack of legal basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated March 5, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Olongapo City is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the accused-appellant is ordered to pay the victim the amount of <b>FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.000)</b> as civil indemnify, <b>FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00)</b> as moral damages in Crim.
