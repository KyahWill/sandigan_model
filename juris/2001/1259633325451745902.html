This cannot be done.<br><br>The judgment in <b>Civil Case No. Q-26392</b> has become final and executory. What Amor and Victoria should have done was to either timely appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals under Rule 41, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, or to seasonably file a "petition for relief from judgment" under Rule 38.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> A party who fails to acquire complete relief from a decision of a court has various remedies to correct it.

The rule is true regardless of the form the issue may take in the subsequent action. It does not matter if the subsequent action involves the same or a different form of proceeding, or whether the second action is upon the same or a different cause of action, subject matter, claim or demand, as the earlier action. It is also immaterial that the two actions are based on different grounds, or tried on different theories, or instituted for different purposes, and seek different reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><center>Laches</center><br>Our ruling against Amor and Victoria is justified all the more by the fact that they are filed <b>Civil Case No. Q-93-18138</b> assailing the "compromise agreement" on October 29, 1993.
