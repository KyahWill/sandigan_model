Yungot was positively identified by his companions on the night of May 24, 1987, Jonathan Abellana and Jose Oyson, as one of those who were drinking with them at the Davao Barrio Fiesta; and by Jose Lagamon, Jr. who was also drinking at the Davao Barrio Fiesta with Celis and Sumagaysay.<br><br>2. Yungot and his companions left the Davao Barrio Fiesta after three hours.<br><br>3. Celis, Sumagaysay, Lagamon, Jr. and Barol left the Davao Barrio Fiesta and walked towards Claveria St.<br><br>4. Yungot was one of the five or six persons involved in the stabbing incident, three or four of whom were armed.<br><br>5. Celis and Sumagaysay each died of a stab wound inflicted using a single-bladed weapon.<br><br>6. Immediately after the commission of the crimes, Yungot and Magpatoc resorted to flight.<br><br>7. Prosecution witnesses Jose Oyson, Jose Lagamon, Jr. and Jonathan Abellana were not shown to have any cause to testify falsely against Yungot."</blockquote><br>The inconsistencies between the testimony of Lagamon, Jr. and Jose Oyson's testimony, particularly, the manner how Celis and Sumagaysay were attacked,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> and the number of persons involved in the stabbing incident,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> as further pointed out by Yungot, are more apparent than real, if not altogether immaterial and insignificant.&nbsp; Concededly, some inconsistencies may be noted; they are, however, not so material and substantial as to affect the credibility of the said witnesses; thus there is no compelling reason to disturb the findings of the trial court in this regard.<br><br>We now tackle the issue of whether treachery and conspiracy attended the commission of the crimes. Yungot's allegation that the trial court erred in appreciating the presence of treachery and conspiracy, is not supported by the records.<br><br>In <b><i>People vs. Rivera</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> we held that:<br><br><blockquote>"There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.&nbsp; Thus, for treachery or <i>alevosia </i>to be appreciated as a qualifying circumstance, the prosecution must establish the concurrence of two (2) conditions:&nbsp; (a) that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (b) that the offender consciously adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> </blockquote><br>Indeed, the foregoing requisites were evidently present in the case at bar.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Yungot's attack, coming from behind, on the unarmed Oscar Celis, was sudden, unprovoked, unexpected and deliberate.&nbsp; To ensure or afford impunity, three (3) other persons were holding Celis while he was being stabbed by Yungot.&nbsp; Clearly, under these circumstances, Celis was in no position and without any means to defend himself.&nbsp; The attack was done in a manner which directly and specially insured the execution of the act without any risk to Yungot arising from the defense which Celis might have made.&nbsp; Thus, as correctly held by the trial court, treachery was present in this case, qualifying the crime to murder.<br><br>We are also in agreement with the trial court's finding that there was conspiracy between the accused-appellants, as alleged in the informations.&nbsp; As enunciated by the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>"xxx xxx.-<br><br>Conspiracy of both the two accused and the others who participated in the stabbing was clearly proven by the evidence independent of the crime itself. It was shown that there was a unity of purpose of the two (2) accused and the others and the intention to stab the two victims simultaneously.&nbsp; When the two accused left the Davao Barrio Fiesta with the others immediately after the two victims and their two companions left said place, there was already the intention and plan to inflict injury upon the two victims.&nbsp; xxx xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> </blockquote><br>Conspiracy, as alleged in the informations, was convincingly established.&nbsp; There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Conspiracy may be deduced from the mode and manner by which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from acts of the accused themselves when such point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> In this case, the prosecution established that accused-appellants, Yungot and Magpatoc, and their companions left the Davao Barrio Fiesta right after Celis, Sumagaysay and their companions left the said place, with the intention "to do harm" to Celis, Sumagaysay and their two (2) companions.&nbsp; Coming from behind, Yungot stabbed Celis while three (3) others held and restrained him; and simultaneously or almost at the same time, Magpatoc rode on Sumagaysay's back and stabbed him.&nbsp; Yungot and Magpatoc each inflicted one fatal stab wound which caused the death of the victims.&nbsp; These concerted actions of accused-appellants reveal their common intent to harm Celis and Sumagaysay, if not cause them death.<br><br>In sum, we find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court that the prosecution witnesses are more credible, that their testimonies were "clear, straightforward, convincing and rigning (sic) with sincerity" and that there was, as well, no reason for them to testify falsely against the accused-appellants, specially since the trial court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor and deportment on the witness stand, hence, its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, is entitled to great respect.&nbsp; It may not be amiss to reiterate that on the issue of credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will not disturb the findings arrived at by the trial court, which was certainly in a better position to rate the credibility of the witnesses after hearing them and observing their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.&nbsp; This rule stands absent any showing that certain facts and circumstances of weight and value have been overlooked, misinterpreted or misapplied by the trial court which, if considered, would affect the result or outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>&nbsp; There is no such showing in this case, notwithstanding the valiant efforts of counsels for accused-appellants to create such an impression.<br><br>In like manner, accused-appellant Rommel Magpatoc, in his defense, submits that the credibility of prosecution witnesses, Jose Lagamon, Jr. and Jose Oyson, are suspect, pointing out several "material and substantial" inconsistencies in their respective testimonies which were "simply overlooked" and "not considered" by the trial court.<br><br>As to Lagamon, Jr.'s testimony, Magpatoc cites the following inconsistencies:&nbsp; <i>first,</i> the distance between Lagamon, Jr. and the two victims at the time of the stabbing incident; <i>second,</i> the number of persons who attacked the victims; <i>third,</i> the number of assailants who were armed with knives; <i>fourth, </i>the act of the person who pointed a knife at Lagamon, Jr.; <i>fifth,</i> the identity of the person who stabbed Oscar Celis; and <i>sixth, </i>Lagamon, Jr.'s reaction when he was threatened by one of the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> As to Jose Oyson's testimony, Magpatoc points out the following inconsistencies:&nbsp; <i>first,</i> the identity of the assailants; <i>second,</i> the number of assailants; <i>third,</i> the "unusual incident or conversation" at the Barrio Fiesta; and <i>fourth, </i>the activities/purpose of the <i>Looban </i>Young Killers group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Magpatoc likewise cites the inconsistency between Oyson's testimony and that of Dr. Pagsaligan as to the relative positions of the victims and their assailants at the time of the stabbing incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> <br><br>After a careful and thorough review of the evidence on record, particularly the testimonies of the witnesses, the Court notes that these alleged inconsistencies refer, at best, only to trivial, minor, and insignificant details and slight variations.&nbsp; In <b><i>People vs. Alolod,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>&nbsp; we held that:<br><br><blockquote>"xxx xxx. Recollection of different witnesses with respect to time, place and other circumstances of a criminal event would naturally differ in various details.&nbsp; Not all persons who witness an incident are impressed in the same manner and it is but natural that in relating their impressions, they disagree on the minor details and that there be contradictions in their testimonies.&nbsp; Witnesses cannot be expected to recollect with exactitude every minute detail of an event.&nbsp; This is especially true when the witnesses testify as to facts which transpired in rapid succession, attended by flurry and excitement.&nbsp; The testimony of each witness should not be expected to be identical to and coinciding with each other.&nbsp; It is enough that the principal points covered by their testimonies are established although they do not dovetail in all details which would even prove well-rehearsed and studied declarations.&nbsp; If witnesses should agree as to every detail of a transaction which occupied a considerable space of time, and should undertake to tell all that occurred in precisely the same order, each giving the same incident as the other in precisely the same words, that fact would be of itself a suspicious circumstance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> </blockquote><br>The alleged inconsistencies bear no materiality to the commission of the crimes imputed against accused-appellants.&nbsp; As pointed out by the Solicitor General, "xxx xxx.
