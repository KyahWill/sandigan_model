Sepulcro St., Paco, Manila and A.T. Commercial, A.B.

The RTC found Tan's and Go's consent to the Undertaking as vitiated and rendered judgment declaring the Undertaking as a nullity.&nbsp; The decision was appealed to this Court in CA- G.R. CV No. 47880.&nbsp; This Court through its Fourth Division in a Decision dated October 3, 1997 reversed and set aside the appealed judgment, and dismissed Andrew Tan's complaint.&nbsp; (Rollo, pp. 67-75)<br><br>"In the meantime, based on the Undertaking, herein plaintiff-appellant Wu Sen Woei was further able to collect $25,000.00, leaving a balance of $45,000.00 (Complaint, par. 8, Record, p. 3) Hence he filed the instant suit docketed as Civil Case No. 91-55981 to collect the said balance of $45,000.00 plus interest and attorney's fees, alleging in his Complaint that defendant had defrauded him by not actually investing the money into the hatchery business."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>The Court of Appeals held in its Decision that, based on the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, Tan's claim that the Affidavit of Undertaking had been executed under duress was rendered ineffective by the ruling in CA-GR CV No. 47880.&nbsp; The CA had ruled therein that the said Affidavit was an admission against interest, a clear acknowledgement by Tan of his obligation to Wu Sen Woei.&nbsp; Thus, the appellate court deemed it pointless to determine whether there was, instead, a consummated partnership between the two parties.<br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In his Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> petitioner raises the following issues for this Court's consideration:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"I. </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="LEFT">Whether or not the Court of Appeals committed a grave and serious error of judgment in applying the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment and </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"II. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Whether or not the Court of Appeals committed a serious error in totally disregarding the evidence presented by petitioner in the appealed case decided by the Regional Trial Court of Manila in the application of the above doctrine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Since the two issues are interrelated, they shall be discussed jointly.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;

font-weight: bold;"><br>Validity </i><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">of Affidavit of Undertaking</span><br></div><br>Clearly, the present case is closely related to the civil action for annulment of document filed by petitioner before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dagupan against respondent on April 3, 1991.&nbsp; In that action, the RTC-Dagupan declared null and void the Affidavit of Undertaking executed by Tan in favor of Wu Sen Woei.&nbsp; Upon appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> however, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> reversed the RTC judgment and upheld the validity of the Affidavit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> That CA Decision became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In the present case, the appellate court relied on its earlier Decision in CA-GR CV No. 47880 by applying the doctrine on conclusiveness of judgment.<br><br>Indeed, the CA's earlier Decision concerning the validity of Andrew Tan's Affidavit of Undertaking has become conclusive on the parties, pursuant to Section 47 (c) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The parties are bound by the matters adjudged and those that are actually and necessarily included therein.&nbsp; Under the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, which is also known as "preclusion of issues" or "collateral estoppel," issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties involving a different cause of action.<br><br>The concept clearly applies to the present case, because petitioner again seeks refuge in the alleged nullity of the same Affidavit of Undertaking which, as earlier mentioned, was already ruled upon with finality.&nbsp; In other words, the question on the validity of the Affidavit has been settled.&nbsp; The same question, therefore, cannot be raised again even in a different proceeding involving the same parties.<br><br>Although the action instituted in this case (collection of a sum of money) is technically different from that action instituted by Andrew Tan before the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan (for annulment of document), "the concept of conclusiveness of judgment still applies because under this principle, the identity of causes of action is not required but merely identity of issues. Simply put, conclusiveness of judgment bars the relitigation of particular facts or issues in another litigation between the same parties on a different claim or cause of action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Significantly, petitioner no longer questioned the CA Decision in CA-GR CV No. 47880.&nbsp; Thus, it has become final and executory and no longer subject to review.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner's assertion that the Affidavit of Undertaking had been executed under duress is contradicted by the events that took place following its execution&nbsp; Petitioner did not immediately question its validity.&nbsp; In fact, of the $70,000 that he undertook to pay Wu Sen Woei, the former has been able to make payments in the amount of $25,000, pursuant to the terms of the Affidavit.&nbsp; His counsel even executed a letter requesting an extension of time and a reduction of the monthly installments that were due, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Dear Mr. Wu:<br><br>This has reference in the affidavit of Undertaking executed by our client, Andrew Tan, in your favor through the intercession of Atty. Victor Bessat.<br><br>We would like to inform you that our client is now in tight financial situation due to the economic dislocation caused by the recent earthquake and the flooding of most of Region I which caused massive destruction on his prawn business and construction business.&nbsp; He had suffered losses in an amount of no less than P500,000.<br><br>In view thereof, our client is not in a financial position to comply with the terms of the undertaking. Hence, in behalf of our client, we are constrained to request for an extension of time for him to pay the agreed amount and to reduce the monthly payment from US$10,000 to US$2,000 a month. This is the amount and mode of payment which he can personally meet considering his financial predicament.<br><br>We hope you can understand the plight of our client.&nbsp; He does not wish to evade his obligation and would comply with it in the manner allowable under his present financial situation.<br><br>We hope to hear from you soon.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Very truly yours,<br><br>(Sgd.)&nbsp; ATTY.
