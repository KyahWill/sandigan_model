of Makati, Branch 145 in Civil Case No. 96-1211.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The facts of the case, as stated
in the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 10, 2000, are as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The Anglo-Asean Bank and Trust Limited (Anglo-Asean, for brevity),
is a private bank registered and organized to do business under the laws of the
Republic of Vanuatu but not in the Philippines.  Its business consists primarily in receiving fund placements by
way of deposits from institutions and individual investors from different parts
of the world and thereafter  investing
such deposits in money market placements and potentially profitable capital
ventures in Hongkong, Europe and the United States for the purpose of
maximizing the returns on those investments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Enticed by the lucrative prospects of doing business with
Anglo-Asean, Abelardo Licaros, a Filipino businessman, decided to make a fund
placement with said bank sometime in the 1980’s.  As it turned out, the grim outcome of Licaros’ foray in overseas
fund investment was not exactly what he envisioned it to be.  More particularly, Licaros, after having
invested in Anglo-Asean, encountered tremendous and unexplained difficulties in
retrieving, not only the interest or profits, but even the very investments he
had put in Anglo-Asean.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Confronted with the dire prospect of not getting back any of his
investments, Licaros then decided to seek the counsel of Antonio P. Gatmaitan,
a reputable banker and investment manager who had been extending  managerial, financial and investment
consultancy services to various firms and corporations both here and
abroad.  To Licaros’ relief, Gatmaitan
was only too willing enough to help.  Gatmaitan voluntarily offered to assume the payment of Anglo-Asean’s
indebtedness to Licaros subject to certain terms and conditions.  In order to effectuate and formalize the
parties’ respective commitments, the two executed a notarized MEMORANDUM OF
AGREEMENT on July 29, 1988 (Exh. “B”; also Exhibit “1”), the full text of which
reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, Gatmaitan presented to Anglo-Asean the Memorandum of
Agreement earlier executed by him and Licaros for the purpose of collecting the
latter’s placement thereat of U.S.$150,000.00.  Albeit the officers of Anglo-Asean allegedly committed themselves to
“look into [this matter]”, no formal response was ever made by said bank to
either Licaros or Gatmaitan.  To date,
Anglo-Asean has not acted on Gatmaitan’s monetary claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evidently, because of his inability to collect from Anglo-Asean,
Gatmaitan did not bother anymore to make good his promise to pay Licaros the
amount stated in his promissory note (Exh. “A”; also Exh. 2”).  Licaros, however, thought differently.  He felt that he had a right to collect on
the basis of the promissory note regardless of the outcome of Gatmaitan's
recovery efforts.  Thus, in July 1996,
Licaros, thru counsel, addressed successive demand letters to Gatmaitan (Exhs.
“C” and “D”), demanding payment of the latter’s obligations under the
promissory note.  Gatmaitan, however,
did not accede to these demands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hence, on August 1, 1996, in the Regional Trial Court at Makati,
Licaros filed the complaint in this case.  In his complaint, docketed in the court below as Civil Case No. 96-1211,
Licaros prayed for a judgment ordering Gatmaitan to pay him the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘a)  Principal Obligation in
the amount of Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P3,500,000.00);</p>

<p class="2Q">b)  Legal interest thereon
at the rate of six (6%) percent per annum from July 16, 1993 when the amount
became due until the obligation is fully paid;</p>

<p class="2Q">c)  Twenty percent (20%) of
the amount due as reasonable attorney’s fees;</p>

<p class="2Q">d)  Costs of the suit.’”<a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After trial on the merits, the
court a quo rendered judgment in favor of petitioner Licaros and found
respondent Gatmaitan liable under the Memorandum of Agreement and Promissory
Note for P3,150,000.00 plus 12% interest per annum from July 16, 1993 until the
amount is fully paid.  Respondent was
likewise ordered to pay attorney’s fees of P200,000.00.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Respondent Gatmaitan appealed the
trial court’s decision to the Court of Appeals.  In a decision promulgated on February 10, 2000, the appellate
court reversed the decision of the trial court and held that respondent
Gatmaitan did not at any point become obligated to pay to petitioner Licaros
the amount stated in the promissory note.  In a Resolution dated April 7, 2000, the Court of Appeals denied
petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration of its February 10, 2000 Decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hence this petition for review on
certiorari where petitioner prays for the reversal of the February 10, 2000
Decision of the Court of Appeals and the reinstatement of the November 11, 1997
decision of the Regional Trial Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The threshold issue for the
determination of this Court is whether the Memorandum of Agreement between
petitioner and respondent is one of assignment of credit or one of conventional
subrogation.  This matter is
determinative of whether or not respondent became liable to petitioner under
the promissory note considering that its efficacy is dependent on the
Memorandum of Agreement, the note being merely an annex to the said memorandum.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An assignment of credit has been
defined as the process of transferring the right of the assignor to the
assignee who would then have the right to proceed against the debtor.  The assignment may be done gratuitously or
onerously, in which case, the assignment has an effect similar to that of a
sale.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the other hand, subrogation has
been defined as the transfer of all the rights of the creditor to a third
person, who substitutes him in all his rights.  It may either be legal or conventional.  Legal subrogation is that which takes place without agreement but by
operation of law because of certain acts.  Conventional subrogation is that which takes place by agreement of
parties.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The general tenor of the foregoing
definitions of the terms “subrogation” and “assignment of credit” may make it
seem that they are one and the same which they are not.  A noted expert in civil law notes their
distinctions thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Under our Code, however, conventional subrogation is not identical
to assignment of credit.  In the former,
the debtor’s consent is necessary; in the latter it is not required.  Subrogation extinguishes the obligation and
gives rise to a new one; assignment refers to the same right which passes from
one person to another.  The nullity of
an old obligation may be cured by subrogation, such that a new obligation will
be perfectly valid; but the nullity of an obligation is not remedied by the
assignment of the creditor’s right to another.”<a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For our purposes, the crucial
distinction deals with the necessity of the consent of the debtor in the
original transaction.  In an assignment
of credit, the consent of the debtor is not necessary in order that the
assignment may fully produce legal effects.</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> What the law requires in an assignment of credit is
not the consent of the debtor but merely notice to him as the assignment takes
effect only from the time he has knowledge thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> A creditor may, therefore, validly assign his credit
and its accessories without the debtor’s consent.</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> On the other hand, conventional subrogation requires
an agreement among the three parties concerned – the original creditor, the
debtor, and the new creditor.  It is a
new contractual relation based on the mutual agreement among all the necessary
parties.  Thus, Article 1301 of the
Civil Code explicitly states that “(C)onventional subrogation of a third person
requires the consent of the original parties and of the third person.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The trial court, in finding for
the petitioner, ruled that the Memorandum of Agreement was in the nature of an
assignment of credit.  As such, the
court a quo held respondent liable for the amount stated in the said agreement
even if the parties thereto failed to obtain the consent of Anglo-Asean
Bank.  On the other hand, the appellate
court held that the agreement was one of conventional subrogation which
necessarily requires the agreement of all the parties concerned.  The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the
Memorandum of Agreement never came into effect due to the failure of the
parties to get the consent of Anglo-Asean Bank to the agreement and, as such,
respondent never became liable for the amount stipulated.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We agree with the finding of the
Court of Appeals that the Memorandum of Agreement dated July 29, 1988 was in
the nature of a conventional subrogation which requires the consent of the
debtor, Anglo-Asean Bank, for its validity. We note with approval the following
pronouncement of the Court of Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Immediately discernible from above is the common feature of
contracts involving conventional subrogation, namely, the approval of the
debtor to the subrogation of a third person in place of the creditor.  That Gatmaitan and Licaros had intended to
treat their agreement as one of conventional subrogation is plainly borne by a
stipulation in their Memorandum of Agreement, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“WHEREAS, the parties herein have come to an agreement on the
nature, form and extent of their mutual prestations which they now record
herein <u>with the express conformity of the third parties </u>concerned”
(emphasis supplied),</p>

<blockquote>which third party is admittedly Anglo-Asean
Bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Had the intention been merely to confer on appellant the status of
a mere “assignee” of appellee’s credit, there is simply no sense for them to
have stipulated in their agreement that the same is conditioned on the “express
conformity” thereto of Anglo-Asean Bank.  That they did so only accentuates their intention to treat the agreement
as one of conventional subrogation.  And
it is basic in the interpretation of contracts that the intention of the
parties must be the one pursued (Rule 130, Section 12, Rules of Court).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Given our finding that the Memorandum of Agreement  (Exh. “B”; also Exh. “1”), is not one of
“assignment of credit” but is actually a “conventional subrogation”, the next
question that comes to mind is whether such agreement was ever perfected at
all.  Needless to state, the perfection
– or non-perfection – of the subject agreement is of utmost relevance at this
point.  For, if the same Memorandum of
Agreement was actually perfected, then it cannot be denied that Gatmaitan still
has a subsisting commitment to pay Licaros on the basis of his promissory
note.  If not, Licaros’ suit for
collection must necessarily fail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Here, it bears stressing that the subject Memorandum of Agreement
expressly requires the consent of Anglo-Asean to the subrogation.  Upon whom the task of securing such consent
devolves, be it on Licaros or Gatmaitan, is of no significance.  What counts most is the hard reality that
there has been an abject failure to get Anglo-Asean’s nod of approval over
Gatmaitan’s being subrogated in the place of Licaros.  Doubtless, the absence of such conformity on the part of
Anglo-Asean, which is thereby made a party to the same Memorandum of Agreement,
prevented the agreement from becoming effective, much less from being a source
of any cause of action for the signatories thereto.”<a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aside for the “whereas clause”
cited by the appellate court in its decision, we likewise note that on the
signature page, right under the place reserved for the signatures of petitioner
and respondent, there is, typewritten, the words “WITH OUR CONFORME.” Under
this notation, the words “ANGLO-ASEAN BANK AND TRUST” were written by hand.</span><a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> To our mind, this provision which contemplates the
signed conformity of Anglo-Asean Bank, taken together with the aforementioned
preambulatory clause leads to the conclusion that both parties intended that
Anglo-Asean Bank should signify its agreement and conformity to the contractual
arrangement between petitioner and respondent.  The fact that Anglo-Asean Bank did not give such consent rendered the
agreement inoperative considering that, as previously discussed, the consent of
the debtor is needed in the subrogation of a third person to the rights of a
creditor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this petition, petitioner
assails the ruling of the Court of Appeals that what was entered into by the
parties was a conventional subrogation of petitioner’s rights as creditor of
the Anglo-Asean Bank which necessarily requires the consent of the latter.  In support, petitioner alleges that: (1) the
Memorandum of Agreement did not create a new obligation and, as such, the same
cannot be a conventional subrogation; (2) the consent of Anglo-Asean Bank was
not necessary for the validity of the Memorandum of Agreement; (3) assuming
that such consent was necessary, respondent failed to secure the same as was
incumbent upon him; and (4) respondent himself admitted that the transaction
was one of assignment of credit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner argues that the parties
to the Memorandum of Agreement could not have intended the same to be a
conventional subrogation considering that no new obligation was created.  According to petitioner, the obligation of
Anglo-Asean Bank to pay under Contract No. 00193 was not extinguished and in
fact, it was the basic intention of the parties to the Memorandum of Agreement
to enforce the same obligation of Anglo-Asean Bank under its contract with
petitioner.  Considering that the old
obligation of Anglo-Asean Bank under Contract No. 00193 was never extinguished
under the Memorandum of Agreement, it is contended that the same could not be
considered as a conventional subrogation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are not persuaded.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is true that conventional
subrogation has the effect of extinguishing the old obligation and giving rise
to a new one.  However, the
extinguishment of the old obligation is the effect of the establishment of a contract
for conventional subrogation.  It is not
a requisite without which a contract for conventional subrogation may not be
created.  As such, it is not
determinative of whether or not a contract of conventional subrogation was
constituted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, it is of no moment that
the subject of the Memorandum of Agreement was the collection of the obligation
of Anglo-Asean Bank to petitioner Licaros under Contract No. 00193.  Precisely, if conventional subrogation had
taken place with the consent of Anglo-Asean Bank to effect a change in the
person of its creditor, there is necessarily created a new obligation whereby
Anglo-Asean Bank must now give payment to its new creditor, herein
respondent.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner next argues that the
consent or conformity of Anglo-Asean Bank is not necessary to the validity of
the Memorandum of Agreement as the evidence on record allegedly shows that it
was never the intention of the parties thereto to treat the same as one of
conventional subrogation.  He claims
that the preambulatory clause requiring the express conformity of third
parties, which admittedly was Anglo-Asean Bank, is a mere surplusage which is
not necessary to the validity of the agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As previously discussed, the
intention of the parties to treat the Memorandum of Agreement as embodying a
conventional subrogation is shown not only by the “whereas clause” but also by
the signature space captioned “WITH OUR CONFORME” reserved for the signature of
a representative of Anglo-Asean Bank.  These provisions in the aforementioned Memorandum of Agreement may not
simply be disregarded or dismissed as superfluous.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is a basic rule in the
interpretation of contracts that “(t)he various stipulations of a contract
shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense
which may result from all of them taken jointly.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Moreover, under our Rules of Court, it is mandated
that “(i)n the construction of an instrument where there are several provisions
or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give
effect to all.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Further, jurisprudence has laid down the rule that
contracts should be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to the
different provisions thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the case at bench, the
Memorandum of Agreement embodies certain provisions that are consistent with
either a conventional subrogation or assignment of credit.  It has not been shown that any clause or
provision in the Memorandum of Agreement is inconsistent or incompatible with a
conventional subrogation.  On the other
hand, the two cited provisions requiring consent of the debtor to the
memorandum is inconsistent with a contract of assignment of credit. Thus, if we
were to interpret the same as one of assignment of credit, then the
aforementioned stipulations regarding the consent of Anglo-Asean Bank would be
rendered inutile and useless considering that, as previously discussed, the
consent of the debtor is not necessary in an assignment of credit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner next argues that
assuming that the conformity of Anglo-Asean was necessary to the validity of
the Memorandum of Agreement, respondent only had himself to blame for the
failure to secure such conformity as was, allegedly, incumbent upon him under
the memorandum.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As to this argument regarding the
party responsible for securing the conformity of Anglo-Asean Bank, we fail to
see how this question would have any relevance on the outcome of this
case.  Having ruled that the consent of
Anglo-Asean was necessary for the validity of the Memorandum of Agreement, the
determinative fact is that such consent was not secured by either petitioner or
respondent which consequently resulted in the invalidity of the said
memorandum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With respect to the argument of
petitioner that respondent himself allegedly admitted in open court that an
assignment of credit was intended, it is enough to say that respondent
apparently used the word “assignment” in his testimony in the general
sense.  Respondent is not a lawyer and
as such, he is not so well versed in law that he would be able to distinguish
between the concepts of conventional subrogation and of assignment of
credit.  Moreover, even assuming that
there was an admission on his part, such admission is not conclusive on this
court as the nature and interpretation of the Memorandum of Agreement is a
question of law which may not be the subject of stipulations and admissions.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Considering the foregoing, it
cannot then be said that the consent of the debtor Anglo-Asean Bank is not
necessary to the validity of the Memorandum of Agreement.  As above stated, the Memorandum of Agreement
embodies a contract for conventional subrogation and in such a case, the
consent of the original parties and the third person is required.</span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The absence of such conformity by Anglo-Asean Bank
prevented the Memorandum of Agreement from becoming valid and effective.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals did not
err when it ruled that the Memorandum of Agreement was never perfected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having arrived at the above
conclusion, the Court finds no need to discuss the other issues raised by
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the instant petition is DENIED and the Decision of
