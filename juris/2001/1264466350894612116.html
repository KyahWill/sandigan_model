				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petitioner in the case is the Government Service Insurance System (hereafter, "GSIS").&nbsp; Having lost the case in the trial court and the Court of Appeals, it now comes to this Court for redress.<br><br>At the onset, we state that the issue is not "suability" or whether GSIS may be sued despite the doctrine of state immunity from suit, but liability, whether or not GSIS may be liable to pay damages to respondent spouses given the applicable law and the circumstances of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Case<br></div><br>The case is a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Angeles City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> ordering GSIS to pay respondents Gonzalo (now deceased)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and Matilde Labung-Deang (hereafter, "spouses Deang") temperate damages, attorney's fees, legal interests and costs of suit for the loss of their title to real property mortgaged to the GSIS.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Facts<br></div><br>Sometime in December 1969, the spouses Deang obtained a housing loan from the GSIS in the amount of eight thousand five hundred pesos (P8,500.00). Under the agreement, the loan was to mature on December 23, 1979.&nbsp; The loan was secured by a real estate mortgage constituted over the spouses' property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 14926-R issued by the Register of Deeds of Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> As required by the mortgage deed, the spouses Daeng deposited the owner's duplicate copy of the title with the GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On January 19, 1979, eleven (11) months before the maturity of the loan, the spouses Deang settled their debt with the GSIS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and requested for the release of the owner's duplicate copy of the title since they intended to secure a loan from a private lender and use the land covered by it as collateral security for the loan of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which they applied for with one Milagros Runes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They would use the proceeds of the loan applied for the renovation of the spouses' residential house and for business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>However, personnel of the GSIS were not able to release the owner's duplicate of the title as it could not be found despite diligent search.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As stated earlier, the spouses as mortgagors deposited the owner's duplicate copy of the title with the GSIS located at its office in San Fernando, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Satisfied that the owner's duplicate copy of the title was really lost, in 1979, GSIS commenced the reconstitution proceedings with the Court of First Instance of Pampanga for the issuance of a new owner's copy of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On June 22, 1979, GSIS issued a certificate of release of mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On June 26, 1979, after the completion of judicial proceedings, GSIS finally secured and released the reconstituted copy of the owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 14926-R to the spouses Deang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On July 6, 1979, the spouses Deang filed with the Court of First Instance, Angeles City a complaint against GSIS for damages, claiming that as result of the delay in releasing the duplicate copy of the owner's title, they were unable to secure a loan from Milagros Runes, the proceeds of which could have been used in defraying the estimated cost of the renovation of their residential house and which could have been invested in some profitable business undertaking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In its defense, GSIS explained that the owners' duplicate copy of the title was released within a reasonable time since it had to conduct standard pre-audit and post-audit procedures to verify if the spouses Deang's account had been fully settled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On July 31, 1995, the trial court rendered a decision ruling for the spouses Deang.&nbsp; The trial court reasoned that the loss of the owner's duplicate copy of the title "in the possession of GSIS as security for the mortgage... without justifiable cause constitutes negligence on the part of the employee of GSIS who lost it," making GSIS liable for damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> We quote the dispositive portion of the decision:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court renders judgment ordering the GSIS: </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">"a) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">To pay the plaintiffs-spouses the amount of P20,000.00 as temperate damages;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">"b) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">To pay plaintiffs-spouses the amount of P15,000.00 as attorney's fees;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">"c) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">To pay legal interest on the award in paragraphs a) and b) from the filing of the complaint;

Second, the GSIS is liable to pay a reasonable amount of damages and attorney's fees, which the appellate court will not disturb.&nbsp; We quote the dispositive portion:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding no reversible error in the appealed judgment, the same is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Issue<br></div><br>Whether the GSIS, as a GOCC primarily performing governmental functions, is liable for a negligent act of its employee acting within the scope of his assigned tasks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court's Ruling<br><br>We rule that the GSIS is liable for damages.&nbsp; We deny the petition for lack of merit.<br><br>GSIS, citing the sixth paragraph of Article 2180 of the Civil Code argues that as a GOCC, it falls within the term "State" and cannot be held vicariously liable for negligence committed by its employee acting within his functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"Article 2180.&nbsp; The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>"Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business of industry.<br><br>"The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">State is responsible in like manner</span> when it acts though a special agent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but not when the damage has been caused by the official to whom the task was done properly pertains</span>, in which case what is provided in Article 2176 shall be applicable.<br><br>xxx (<i>underscoring ours</i>)"</blockquote></blockquote><br>The argument is untenable.&nbsp; The cited provision of the Civil Code is not applicable to the case at bar.&nbsp; However, the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in citing it as the applicable law.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the conclusion is the same.&nbsp; As heretofore stated, we find that GSIS is liable for damages.<br><br>The trial court and the Court of Appeals treated the obligation of GSIS as one springing from <i>quasi-delict</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We do not agree. Article 2176 of the Civil Code defines <i>quasi-delict</i> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Whoever by act or omission causes damages to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done.&nbsp; Such fault or negligence, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties</span>, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter (<i>underscoring ours</i>)."</blockquote><br>Under the facts, there was a pre-existing contract between the parties. GSIS and the spouses Deang had a loan agreement secured by a real estate mortgage.&nbsp; The duty to return the owner's duplicate copy of title arose as soon as the mortgage was released.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> GSIS insists that it was under no obligation to return the owner's duplicate copy of the title immediately.&nbsp; This insistence is not warranted.&nbsp; Negligence is obvious as the owners' duplicate copy could not be returned to the owners. Thus, the more applicable provisions of the Civil Code are:<br><br><blockquote>"Article 1170.&nbsp; Those who in the performance of their obligations are guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay and those who in any manner contravene the tenor thereof are liable for damages."<br><br>"Article 2201.&nbsp; In contracts and quasi-contracts, the damages for which the obligor who acted in good faith is liable shall be those that are the natural and probable consequences of the breach of the obligation, and which the parties have foreseen or could have reasonably foreseen at the time the obligation was constituted xxx."</blockquote><br>Since good faith is presumed and bad faith is a matter of fact which should be proved,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we shall treat GSIS as a party who defaulted in its obligation to return the owners' duplicate copy of the title.&nbsp; As an obligor in good faith, GSIS is liable for all the "natural and probable consequences of the breach of the obligation." The inability of the spouses Deang to secure another loan and the damages they suffered thereby has its roots in the failure of the GSIS to return the owners' duplicate copy of the title.<br><br>We come now to the amount of damages.&nbsp; In a breach of contract, moral damages are not awarded if the defendant is not shown to have acted fraudulently or with malice or bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The fact that the complainant suffered economic hardship<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> or worries and mental anxiety<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> is not enough.<br><br>There is likewise no factual basis for an award of actual damages.&nbsp; Actual damages to be compensable must be proven by clear evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> A court can not rely on "speculation, conjecture or guess work" as to the fact and amount of damages, but must depend on actual proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>However, it is also apparent that the spouses Deang suffered financial damage because of the loss of the owners' duplicate copy of the title.&nbsp; Temperate damages may be granted.<br><br><blockquote>"Article 2224. Temperate or moderate damages, which are more than nominal but less than compensatory damages, may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty."</blockquote><br>GSIS submits that there must be proof of pecuniary loss.&nbsp; This is untenable.&nbsp; The rationale behind&nbsp; temperate damages is precisely that from the nature of the case, definite proof of pecuniary loss cannot be offered.&nbsp; When the court is convinced that there has been such loss, the judge is empowered to calculate moderate damages, rather than let the complainant suffer without redress from the defendant's wrongful act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The award of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) in temperate damages is reasonable considering that GSIS spent for the reconstitution of the owners' duplicate copy of the title.<br><br>Next, the attorney's fees.&nbsp; Attorney's fees which are granted as an item of damages are generally not recoverable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the rule and counsel's fees are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit.&nbsp; The award of attorney's fees demands factual, legal and equitable justification; its basis cannot be left to speculation or conjecture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We find no circumstance to justify the award of attorney's fees.&nbsp; We delete the same.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Fallo<br></div><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we DENY the petition.&nbsp; We <b>AFFIRM</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
