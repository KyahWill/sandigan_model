Immediately upon his arrival, Paterno Pareno asked Remedios Renoria to accompany him to the nipa hut located about fifty (50) meters away from their <i>(Remedios Renoria's)</i> house. Remedios Renoria acceeded because she [knew] Paterno.<br><br>"When Paterno Pareno and Remedios Renoria reached the place, appellant was already inside the nipa hut obviously waiting for them. Paterno Pareno suddenly dragged Remedios Renoria inside the nipa hut. Then, appellant and Paterno Pareno immediately covered her mouth and removed her clothing. However, it was appellant who removed her underwear. This was quickly followed by appellant discarding his own underwear.<br><br>"Remedios Renora was then made to lie down on a wooden bed. Thereafter, appellant positioned himself on top of her and immediately inserted his penis inside her vagina. She felt pain. Afterwards, appellant grasped her breasts. She could not cry for help because appellant and Paterno Pareno were covering her mouth.<br><br>"Having satisfied his lust, appellant left immediately. Remedios Renoria, thereafter, stood up, got dressed and went home.<br><br>"On April 24, 1997, Remedios Renoria went to see her uncle, Larry Frias, to report the ordeal she suffered in the hands of appellant. In turn, Larry Frias told Remedios Renoria's mother [about] the incident. Thereafter, Remedios Renoria's mother asked Larry Frias to do what [was] best for her daughter.<br><br>"Out of genuine concern for his niece who was only thirteen <i>(13) </i>years old at the time she was ravished, and because Remedios Renoria and her [were] both unlettered Larry Frias took the initiative to go to the Office of the Bantay Bata in Quezon City to ask for help.<br><br>"At the Office of the Bantay-Bata, Larry Frias narrated what happened to Remedios Renoria. He was then given referral letters to the Department of Social Welfare and Development <i>(DSWD) </i>and the National Bureau of Investigation <i>(NBI).</i><br><br>"Larry Frias and Remedios Renoria went to the Valenzuela Police Station on April 28, 1997. PO2 Virginia Viacrusis took the statement of Remedios Renoria.<br><br>"The following day, or on April 29, 1997, they went to the NBI for medico-legal examination. Dr. Armie Soreta-Umil, an NBI Medico-Legal Officer, conducted a physical examination on the victim and submitted a medical report which reads:<br><blockquote><i>Living Case No. MG-97-626</i><br><br><center><i>Findings</i><br></center><br><i>Conclusions:</i><br><br><i>1.&nbsp; No evident sign of extra-genital physical injuries noted on the body at the time of examination.

His statement of facts is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>"Evidence for the defense shows that on February 2, 1997, at about 7:00 in the evening, accused-appellant Renato Flores was ordered by his father to get the latter's salary in Ulingan, Valenzuela City. His father worked for Rudy Frias, private complainant's grandfather. He testified that private complainant [was] his girlfriend and that their marriage was being arranged by her mother and her uncle. On the night the crime charged allegedly occurred, accused-appellant recalled that it was private complainant's mother, Rowena Frias, who invited him to sleep in their house. He slept in the sofa together with private complainant. The following morning, accused-appellant's parents were summoned by Rowena Frias and Larry Frias. Private complainant's mother asked accused-appellant if he love[d] her daughter to which he an[s]wered in the affirmative. Thereafter, they talked about their plan of getting married and Rowena even allowed her daughter to go with accused-appellant the following day, bringing with her a bag of clothes. Since then, the couple lived together as husband and wife for more or less three months until May 28, 1997 when private complainant was fetched by her mother. She never returned since then. The next time they saw each other was when private complainant visited him in jail. She informed him that she was in fact merely forced by Larry Frias to file a complaint."<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b><br></div><br>After a careful study and a judicious assessment of the evidence submitted by both parties, the RTC ruled that the guilt of appellant was proven with moral certainty. It added that his denial could not prevail over the victim's positive assertions, which were convincing and credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It brushed aside his defense that he and the victim were sweethearts, and that they lived together as husband and wife.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></div><br>Appellant assigns a sole alleged error for our consideration:<br><blockquote>"The Court <u>a-quo</u> gravely erred in finding that the guilt of the accused-appellant for the crime charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the insufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The appeal is devoid of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Main Issue: </b><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Sufficiency of Evidence</i></b><br></div><br>In reviewing rape cases, the Court is guided by the following principles: (1) to accuse a man of rape is easy, but to disprove the accusation is difficult, though the accused may be innocent; (2) inasmuch as only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and should not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Corollary to the foregoing legal yardsticks is the dictum that when a victim of rape says that she has been defiled, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed against her. So long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing principles, we have carefully scrutinized the testimony of Remedios Renoria, who was 13 years old at the time the rape was committed, as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0"

0);">[16]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>A careful review of the evidence adduced by both parties leads us to the conclusion that the RTC did not err in finding appellant guilty of rape. The lone testimony of the victim, if credible, is sufficient to sustain a conviction. This is so because, from the nature of the offense, her sole testimony is oftentimes the only evidence that can be offered to establish the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As correctly observed by the lower court:<br><blockquote>"x x x. Minor complainant was forthright. She narrated how she was sexually abused by accused Renato Flores. She was straight forward in pin pointing to the accused as her abuser. There [are] no facts and/or circumstances from which it could be reasonably inferred that the minor complainant falsely testified or she was actuated by improper motive. The absence of clear and convincing evidence of the existence of improper motive sustain[s] the conclusion that no improper motive exist[s] and her testimony should be given full faith and credit. The Court is persuaded by the sincerity and c[a]ndor of minor Remedios Renoria. She showed no sign of hostility but interest to bring the malefactor to justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Well-settled is the rule that the trial court's assessment of credibility of witnesses is accorded great respect, owing to its direct opportunity to observe their demeanor during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><u><i>Force and Intimidation</i></u><br><br>We disagree with appellant's contention that the prosecution failed to prove the force and intimidation inflicted upon the offended party.<br><br>Well-established is the rule that for the crime of rape to exist, it is not necessary that the force employed be so great or be of such character that it could not be resisted; it is only necessary that the force employed by the guilty party be sufficient to consummate the purpose for which it was inflicted. In other words, force as an element of rape need not be irresistible; as long as it brings about the desired result, all considerations of whether it was more or less irresistible are beside the point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Intimidation must be viewed in the light of the perception of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime, not by any hard and fast rule; it is therefore enough that it produced fear -- fear that if she did not yield to the bestial demands of her ravisher, some evil would happen to her at that moment or even thereafter.<br><br>The fact that complainant bore no physical evidence of any force used against her person is of no moment. The absence of any external sign of injury does not necessarily negate the occurrence of rape, proof of injury not being an essential element of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> What is important is that because of force and intimidation, the victim was made to submit to the will of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As stated in <i>People v. Maglente,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the test is whether the threat or intimidation produces fear in the mind of a reasonable person -- that if one resists or does not yield to the desires of the accused, the threat would be carried out.<br><br>In the present case, the victim narrated how, with the use of threat, she had been coerced by appellant into submitting to his carnal desires. Pertinent portions of her affidavit are reproduced as follows:<br><blockquote>"08.T. Paano ang [nangyaring] pang-aabuso sa iyo o pang re Rape?<br><br>S. Ganito po iyon noong Feb. 2, 1997, sa ganap na ika 9:00 ng gabi ay pinatawag ako ni Atong alias Renato Flores at may sasabihin daw po siya sa akin, noon pong pumunta ako ay nasa loob daw po siya ng kubo, sabi ni Patter punta daw sa kubo at doon daw ko usap ni Atong, punta ako kubo hila ako sa kamay ni Atong tulak ako Patter, at takip bibig ko ng kamay ni Atong at sama panyo kamay at tali panyo sa lbibig, higa ako sa papag ni Atong (referring to Renato Flores) at tanggal lahat ng damit ko, pag katapos ay kiss niya ako sa labi at dede ko at pagkatapos ay pasok niya ang titi niya sa pek-pek ko taas baba siya at -- pagkatapos ay parang pagod na pagod siya at dagan siya sa dibdib ko at tanggal niya ang tali sa bibig ko, at sabi niya ay [sinabihang "H]uwag kang magsusumbong at papatayin kita naiintindihan mo ba[?"]<br><br>"09.T.

Moreover, the victim could not have shouted for help, as her mouth was covered by the accused. She testified thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">"Q:</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Now after the accused inserted his penis into your vagina, what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He h[e]ld my breast, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you shout or [ask] for help?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">No, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Why?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> They were covering my mouth, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Indeed, it is inconceivable how a 13-year-old girl could muster enough strength to resist two men in their prime. It would be incongrous to assume that she could overcome the superior strength of appellant and his cohort, Paterno Pareno.<br><br><u><i>Lack of Resistance</i></u><br><br>Appellant likewise contends that complainant's lack of physical struggle shows that she consented to the sexual assault. We are not persuaded.<br><br>In a long line of cases, we have held that different people react differently to different situations. There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a frightful experience. While the reaction of some women who are faced with the possibility of rape is struggling or shouting for help, still others become virtually catatonic because of the mental shock they experienced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>To the depraved mind of appellant, complainant's failure to resist or to shout may have been a sign of consent. But in the crime of rape, what is given paramount consideration is the state of mind of the victim, not of the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><u><i>"Sweethearts Theory"</i></u><br><br>While appellant interposed the defense of denial, he additionally alleged that he and Remedios were sweethearts, and that they had lived as husband and wife from February 3, 1997 until May 28, 1997. To support this contention, he presented several witnesses who testified that they had seen the victim in his house. These are unavailing, however, because they did not have personal knowledge of the fact. Moreover, there is no sufficient evidence on record that would support this defense. A "sweethearts defense" should be substantiated by some documentary or other evidence of the relationship -- like mementos, love letters, notes, pictures and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Appellant presented only a bag of clothes allegedly belonging to complainant.<br><br>We believe that the bag of clothes and the presence of complainant in the house of appellant do not establish their alleged amorous relationship. As correctly observed by the trial court:<br><blockquote>"Defense['s] claim that the minor complainant is his sweetheart and they lived together as husband and wife cannot be given serious consideration. There was not even a letter or photograph of the minor-victim to show that the accused and she (Remedios Renoria) [were] sweethearts. The bag of clothes is not concrete proof that the clothes [belong] to minor complainant.<br><br>"x x x [I]f it is really true that Remedios Renoria and the accused lived as husband and wife in the house of the accused and left only on May 28, 1997 when fetched by the sister, why was she able to give her written statement to the police on April 28, 1997 charging the accused [with] rape and [to submit] herself [to] physical and genital examination before the NBI on April 29, 1997."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant's claim of love relationship is belied by the concurrence of the following actuations of complainant: (1) disclosing the rape incident to her uncle, (2) seeking help from police authorities, (3) subjecting herself to medical examination, (4) filing a Complaint for rape and recounting in court the details of her horrible experience.<br><br>Further, the sweethearts defense does not necessarily preclude rape. Even if it were true, such relationship would not, by itself, establish consent, for love is not a license for lust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> A love affair could not have justified what appellant did -- subjecting complainant to his carnal desires <i>against her will.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Inconsistencies</i><br><br>In his vain attempt to discredit the testimony of complainant, appellant cites two inconsistencies. <i>First,</i> he concedes that she was forcibly brought by Pareno to the nipa hut. Prosecution Witness Larry Frias' testimony, however, allegedly showed that Pareno merely <i>instructed </i>her to go to the nipa hut with him. This circumstance allegedly raises the possibility that she consented to the sexual intercourse. <i>Second, </i>appellant submits that, while the victim avers that her mother went to the police station with her, Larry Frias testified that only he had accompanied private complainant to the NBI, the DSWD and the Municipal Hall to file a Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The solicitor general correctly debunks appellant's contentions in this wise:<br><blockquote>"A careful review of Remedios Renoria's testimony reveals that on February 2, 1997, Paterno Pareno arrived at their (<i>Remedios Renoria</i>[<i>'s</i>]) house and asked her to accompany him to the nipa hut located at Ulingan, Lawang-Bato, Valenzuela; that when they reached the place, Paterno Pareno dragged her inside the nipa hut where appellant was obviously waiting; and that appellant and Paterno Pareno covered her mouth and undressed her.<br><br>"In other words, Paterno Pareno used force on Remedios Renoria only when they finally reached the nipa hut, the place where the crime was committed.<br><br>"Anent the issue of who really was with Remedios Renoria at the time she went to the police station to report the incident, Remedios Renoria clarified during her cross examination that it was Larry Frias who accompanied her to the police station<br><br>"Demonstrably, the alleged inconsistences pointed out by appellant do not actually exist. Assuming that they do exist, the same are very trivial in nature [and] cannot impair the essential integrity of the prosecution evidence as a whole."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Further, the aforecited inconsistencies, even if true, are minor in character and do not impugn the credibility of complainant. Indicative of an unrehearsed testimony, slight contradictions even serve to strengthen credibility. Indeed, the Court cannot expect a rape victim to remember every ugly detail of the sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> A witness who is telling the truth is not always expected to give a perfectly concise testimony, considering the lapse of time and the treachery of human memory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><u><i>The Delay in Reporting the Incident</i><br></u><br>Complainant's failure to report the incident immediately, according to appellant, belies her claim of rape. This contention is untenable.<br><br>There is no standard form of behavior when a person is confronted by a shocking, harrowing and unexpected incident. The workings of the human mind, when placed under emotional stress, are unpredictable. Rape is a traumatic experience, and the shock concomitant with it may linger for a while. Oftentimes, the victim would rather bear the ignominy and the pain in private, rather than reveal her shame to the world or risk the rapist's carrying out his threat to harm her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In sum, the credibility of the complainant's testimony is not diminished by the delay in reporting the incident or by the lack of strong resistance. One cannot expect a 13-year old girl to act like an adult or a mature and experienced woman who would have the courage and intelligence to disregard a threat to her life and complain immediately that she had been sexually assaulted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><u><i>Indemnity and Moral Damages</i><br></u><br>It has been the policy of the Court to award outrightly to a victim of rape an amount not exceeding P50,000 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto, </i>upon an indubitable showing of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> When the rape is committed in its qualified form and the death penalty is imposed, the indemnity given is P75,000.<br><br>Moreover, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, appellant should be ordered to pay the amount of P50,000 as moral damages. It may be awarded without need of independently showing that the victim suffered mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the crime of rape, these are assumed by the law.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b> with the <b><i>MODIFICATION</i></b> that an additional award of P50,000 as moral damages be given to the victim<i>.</i> Costs against appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo</i>, (<i>Chairman</i>), <i>Vitug, Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 18-29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Judge Adriano R.
