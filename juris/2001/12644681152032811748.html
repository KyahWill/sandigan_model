Marilou A. Cabanatan, Court Stenographer III of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)
of Quirino, Branch 38, charges Crisostorno T. Molina, Sheriff IV and
officer-in-charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, with abuse of authority,
grave misconduct, oppression, dishonesty and violation of Civil Service Rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The factual circumstances leading
to the Administrative Complaint are summarized by the Office of the Court
Administrator (OCA), as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1. SWORN COMPLAINT, with attachments, dated December 23, 1999 of
Marilou A. Cabanatan charging Crisostomo T. Molina, Sheriff IV and
Officer-In-Charge, RTC, Branch 38, Maddela, Quirino with Abuse of Authority,
Grave Misconduct, Oppression, Dishonesty and Violation of Civil Service Rules.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The charges of Abuse of Authority and Grave Misconduct were based
on the following narration of facts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On December 21, 1999 at about 9:00 o’clock in the morning,
complainant borrowed the office attendance logbook from its custodian, Wilgeer
T. Andres. She intended to use the same as reference in the preparation of her
answer to the memorandum issued by the respondent (who) required her to explain
her alleged absences and tardiness. However, respondent allegedly scolded her
as he did not want her to see the logbook.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Later, at about 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon, respondent,
who was then allegedly intoxicated, approached the complainant and said: <i>‘Patas
lang ti laban ha? Lumaban ka! Ania ti kayat mo a laban? Putang ina!’ </i>Respondent
was, according to the complainant, in a boxing position when he uttered the
aforequoted words.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Complainant added that when she saw again the respondent later in
the afternoon, the latter reiterated his challenge to her. Then, much later,
even her co-employees, Wilgeer T. Andres and Ernesto V. Fontanilla, were also
challenged by the respondent to a fight.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Regarding the charge of Oppression, the same was anchored on the
allegation that respondent withheld complainant’s checks representing her
salaries for October 1-15, 1999, September 1-15, 1999 and December 15-31, 1999.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The complaint for Dishonesty and Violation of Civil Service Rules
were premised on the averment that respondent had been going on official travel
allegedly to ‘submit pertinent papers to the Supreme Court’, but he submits
Certificate of Appearance issued by Judge Ma. Theresa Dela Torre-Yadao, the
presiding judge of RTC, Branch 38, Maddela, Quirino and acting presiding judge
of RTC, Quezon City, instead of those issued by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Complainant also adds that respondent refuses to sign or enter his
name in the attendance logbook of the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. COMMENT dated February 29, 2000 of the respondent denying the
averments in the complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On the charge of Abuse of Authority and Grave Misconduct,
respondent had a different story to tell. According to him, complainant took
the attendance logbook without asking permission from him and she was already
fifty (50) meters away from their building when he saw her. Hence, he allegedly
instructed the Security Guard, one Marcos Gargabite, to retrieve the said
logbook.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Respondent likewise narrated that it was actually the complainant
who shouted invectives at him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Anent the charge of Oppression, respondent claims that he never
gave any instruction to Mr. Norman A. Ruaboro, the clerk in charge of salary
checks from October to December  1999,
to withhold the salary of the complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Lastly, regarding the charges of Dishonesty and Violation of Civil
Service Rules, respondent controverted only the allegation in connection with
his official travels. He contended that he goes to Manila, specifically to RTC,
Branch 99, Quezon City, whenever there were orders, warrants of arrest and
other pleadings and documents needed to be brought to the immediate attention
of Judge Yadao who was designated as Acting Presiding Judge of said court.”<a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After evaluating the Complaint,
the Court Administrator recommended its referral to the Executive Judge of the
Regional Trial Court of Cabaroquis, Quirino, for investigation, report and
recommendation within sixty (60) days from receipt of the records.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The Court adopted the
recommendation of the OCA in a Resolution dated July 5, 2000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Meanwhile, this Court also asked
the Court Administrator to assess complainant’s letter dated June 5, 2000,
expressing her doubts on the impartiality of the Executive Judge of Cabaroquis,
Quirino.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Court Administrator
recommended in a memorandum dated August 28, 2000 that the instant Complaint be
referred instead to Executive Judge Jose Rosales of the Regional Trial Court of
Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. Accordingly, in a Resolution dated October 4, 2000,</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> this Court required
Executive Judge Rosales to conduct the investigation of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thereafter, on August 9, 2001,
Executive Judge Rosales submitted his “Investigation, Report and Recommendation,”
wherein he recommended the dismissal of the respondent. Regarding the charge of
abuse of authority and grave misconduct, Executive Judge Rosales made the
following findings:</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“It is thus crystal clear that in the morning of December 21, 1999
during office hours, the respondent not only allowed but also himself joined a
drinking session<i> </i>with his<i> </i>male co-employees of the court inside
the courtroom which caused his inebriation in the morning and afternoon of that
date. As the designated OIC of the Court, he should have prohibited the holding
of such drinking session within the courtroom and he should have refrained from
himself imbibing the hard drink as it was still office hours to provide good
example to the other employees under him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It will be noted that, according to the respondent himself, they
(he and the employees) ‘declared x x x a Christmas party. It was a holiday on
our part’ (TSN, July 2<i>, </i>2001, p. 6) despite the fact that by his own
admission, it was a working day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The pretext that it was an ‘extended Christmas Celebration’ of all
courts (TSN June 25, 2001, p. 10) does not seem to have any basis at all.
Firstly, only the male employees participated. Secondly, the evidence discloses
that the party only consisted of drinking one bottle of Fundador and no food
was served, contrary to the claim of the respondent that they prepared some
food for the lady employees. Thirdly, even the respondent went somewhere else
at 11:00 A.M. and only returned at around 12:45 P.M. No one testified that they
took lunch in the courtroom at noontime. It is thus apparent that the group of
male employees led by the respondent took it upon themselves to unilaterally
declare a holiday without any sanction of law or any authority from any court
official. This alone and the drunkenness of the respondent already are
sufficient bases for disciplinary action against the respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The charge that while very drunk he challenged the complainant,
Wilgeer Andres and Ernesto Fontanilla his subordinates, is supported by clear
and convincing evidence.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As to the charge of oppression,
Executive Judge Rosales found that the respondent’s “withholding of the salary
checks and bonus did not have a solid basis. There was no authorization [by]
the presiding judge or the respondent as OIC [officer in charge] of the Court
to direct the withholding of the complainant’s checks emanating from the
Supreme Court. Moreover, it would appear that the complainant’s side was not
first heard before her salary was cut off, thus, depriving her of her right to
her salary without due process.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Executive Judge Rosales also found
the respondent guilty of dishonesty. The latter’s act of collecting
reimbursement for trips made with inadequate or false supporting documents is an
act of dishonesty. There is no evidence that he went to the Supreme Court, as
he could not present any certificate of appearance signed by the OCA. By
submitting Certificates of Travel stating that his destination was the Supreme
Court, but failing to substantiate them</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> with the proper
certificates of appearance from the Court itself, it appears that he
“falsified” such Certificates, an act tantamount to dishonesty. In the words of
Executive Judge Rosales:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The explanation of the respondent that it was a requirement for
the certificate of appearance to be signed only by Judge Yadao and that there
was no need to obtain a certificate of appearance from the Supreme Court opens
up a new can of worms.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“For it is common knowledge that for every official travel made by
a public official, he usually claims travel expenses and per diems. Hence the
respondent’s claim that he travelled to Metro Manila on official business and
for official purpose at his own expense culled from his RATA sounds incredible.
Complainant Marilou Cabanatan posited that she obtained the carbon originals of
the Travel [O]rders and Certificates of Appearance from the relevant office in
the Provincial Government of Quirino Province where the respondent submitted
them to claim reimbursements of travel expenses and per diems. She further
testified that she saw documents in the Provincial Capitol of Quirino showing
that the respondent collected his claims for travel expenses; as a matter of
fact, the copies of Travel Orders and Certificates of Appearance of the
respondent which had been submitted during the instant investigation were extra
copies taken from the files of the Provincial Government of Quirino in
connection with the still pending claims for the respondent’s travel expenses
and that she could not obtain other travel orders and certificates of
appearance because they were already on file, the respondent already having
received his reimbursements of his travel expenses and per diems for such travels.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The act of respondent of collecting reimbursements for trips made
with inadequate or false supporting documents is an act of dishonesty.
Apparently, the employees of the Provincial Capitol of Quirino processing his
claims for reimbursements of travel expenses and per diems did/do not realize
that the signature of Judge Yadao on the certificates of appearance was
inadequate to support his said claims and that the certificates of appearance
must emanate from the Supreme Court when the travel orders directed him to go
to the Supreme Court or to the Court Administrator in Manila. It will be borne
in mind that among the required documents supporting a claim for transportation
is a certificate of travel completed. If the travel order directed the respondent
to go to the Supreme Court or to the Court Administrator, his travel would not
be considered complete if he did not go to the Supreme Court in Manila ‘to
deliver pertinent papers.’ There is no evidence that he went to the Supreme
Court as he could not present any certificate of appearance signed by the
Office of the Court Administrator. In submitting a certificate of travel
completed where his destination was the Supreme Court in accordance with his
travel order and he did not go to the Supreme Court as he did not have any
certificate of appearance, perforce, he would be considered to have falsified
such certification. Such falsification is an act of dishonesty.”<a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Executive Judge Rosales further
found respondent to have violated Civil Service Rules when he refused to sign
his name and enter his daily arrival and departure times in the attendance
logbook. The fact that he was the OIC of the court did not exempt him from this
requirement, the investigating Judge said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having thus found respondent
guilty of abuse of authority and grave misconduct, oppression, dishonesty and
violation of Civil Service Rules, Executive Judge Rosales recommended his
dismissal from the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This Court referred to the OCA the
report and the recommendation of Executive Judge Rosales for evaluation, report
and recommendation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This Court agrees with the
indorsement of the OCA that respondent be dismissed from the service as the
findings and recommendation of the Executive Judge Rosales are well-taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Time and time again, this Court
has emphasized that the conduct or behavior of everyone connected with an
office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to
the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of
responsibility.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Being the OIC of the Office of the
Clerk of Court, the respondent occupies an important position and function in
the Judiciary.</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No position demands greater moral righteousness and
uprightness from its holder than that in the Judiciary.  Those connected with the dispensation of
justice bear a heavy burden of responsibility. In particular, Clerks of Court
must show competence, honesty and probity, charged as they are with
safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Part of this stringent requirement
is that agents of the law should refrain from the use of language that is
abusive, offensive, scandalous, menacing or otherwise improper. Judicial
employees are expected to accord every due respect, not only to their
superiors, but also to others and their rights at all times. Their every act
and word should be characterized by prudence, restraint, courtesy and dignity.</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the present case, the assailed
acts of respondent -- challenging his co-employees to a fight, making
derogatory remarks and getting, drunk within the court premises during official
time -- fell short of the standard. He has in fact, admitted having had a
drinking spree with his male officemates on December 21, 1999 inside the
courtroom.</span><a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As correctly observed by the
investigating Judge, “(I)t is noteworthy that Wilgeer Andres, Court Legal
Researcher and the ‘Overseer’ of Branch 38, RTC of Quirino, corroborated the
testimony of the complainant Marilou Cabanantan on the incidents on December
21, 1999. He corroborated the fact that the respondent, who was inebriated,
shouted at the complainant in x x x Ilocano words.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aside from being the OIC of the
Office of the Clerk of Court, the respondent is also the Sheriff who likewise
plays an important part in the administration of justice. Being at the grass
roots of our judicial machinery, Sheriffs and deputy Sheriffs are in close
contact with the litigants; hence, their conduct should all the more maintain
the prestige and the integrity of the court.</span><a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dishonesty has no place in the
Judiciary. Indeed, all government personnel are mandated to act with justness
and sincerity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In finding the respondent guilty
of dishonesty, Executive Judge Rosales wrote as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“It is unclear from the testimony of the respondent if, indeed, he
went to the Supreme Court and, if so, if he submitted thereat ‘pertinent
documents’ or [attended] x x x ‘to the needs of our office,’ as stated in his
travel orders. At any rate, his alleged visit ‘on official business’ to the
Supreme Court is not corroborated by other convincing and credible evidence
such as certificates of appearance (from the Supreme Court) which he did not
allegedly need anyway as the signature of Judge Yadao in the certificates was
enough. It can likewise be stated, in the absence of such credible evidence,
that the respondent did not really go to the Supreme Court or even to Judge
Yadao or his mission was to bring certain things not connected with the court.
For it was incumbent upon him to show by substantial evidence that he really
went to Metro Manila and accomplished the purpose for which the travel orders
were issued. He failed to do so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is also interesting that while the travel orders commanded him
to go to the Supreme Court or to the Court Administrator, his certificates of
appearance were signed by Judge Yadao at her office in Quezon City, thus
negating and contradicting the alleged purpose of the travel as stated in the
travel orders. As the former Honorable Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo
observed in his recommendation to conduct an investigation on the complaint of
Marilou Cabanatan, ‘Second, we find it quite odd for [J]udge Yadao to issue the
Travel Orders and Certificates of Appearance of the respondent. The explanation
offered by the respondent and the statement of the purpose of the travel of the
respondent to Manila appears to be incongruous. [If t]he purpose of his travel
were to bring urgent matters to Judge Yadao’s attention, if this [were] so, why
would there be a Travel Order issued in advance? Why did the respondent present
only the Certificate of Appearance issued by Judge Yadao in her capacity as
Acting Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 99, Quezon City, when his Travel Orders
directed him to go to the Supreme Court to submit pertinent papers?'<a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We agree with the foregoing
conclusion of Executive Judge Rosales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finally, aside from submitting
falsified travel orders to support his claim for allowance from the Provincial
Capitol of Quirino, the respondent failed to sign his name and enter his times
of arrival and departure in the attendance logbook. Such omission is in
violation of Sections 1 and 2, Rule XVII of the Rules Implementing Book V of
Executive Order 292, (“The Administrative Code of 1987”) which provides as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Section 1. It shall be the duty of each head of the department or
agency to require all officers and employees under him to strictly observe the
prescribed office hours.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Section 2. Each head of the department or agency shall require a
daily record of attendance of all the officers and employees under him
including those serving in the field or on the water, to be kept on the proper
form and, whenever possible, re-gistered on the bundy clock.”</blockquote>
