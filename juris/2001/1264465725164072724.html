For the use of the premises, Socorro collected rent from Deogracias and Rosalina in the token amount of one thousand five hundred pesos (P1,500.00) a month supposedly for the main purpose of enabling them "to keep their self respect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> From 1968 to 1987, Deogracias and Rosalina were able to sell and dispose of all the lots in the three residential subdivisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> owned by Socorro, amounting to about ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00).&nbsp; As real estate manager and administrative assistant, they were also able in the course of twenty years to find qualified tenants for Socorro's commercial buildings.&nbsp; They supervised the construction and maintenance of Socorro's property and collected rent on behalf of and for the interest of Socorro.&nbsp; Despite all these efforts, on October 17, 1988, Socorro gave Deogracias and Rosalina notice to vacate the two units at No. 67 Elias Angeles St., Naga City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Deogracias and Rosalina averred that Socorro agreed to allow them to use the two units for the duration of their lifetime as compensation for their services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> By now ejecting them from the premises, Socorro reneged on her obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>Second</b>, Deogracias and Rosalina were the owners of two (2) commercial lots with improvements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On May 28, 1986, Deogracias and Rosalina became indebted to Socorro in the amount of six hundred thirty eight thousand six hundred thirty five pesos and thirty six centavos (P638,635.36).&nbsp; The parties agreed that to pay for the debt, Deogracias and Rosalina were to sell the two (2) commercial lots for two million and five hundred thousand pesos (P2.5M) and deliver part of the proceeds of the sale to Socorro.&nbsp; While looking for a buyer, Deogracias and Rosalina conveyed the property to Socorro by way of first mortgage.&nbsp; Instead of a real estate mortgage, Socorro prepared two (2) documents, a "deed of absolute sale"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> covering Deogracias and Rosalina's property and a "memorandum of agreement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Due to the ascendancy of Soccorro over them and also because of Socorro's repeated assurance that the documents had the same effect as a real estate mortgage, Deogracias and Rosalina signed the same.&nbsp; Socorro presented the "deed of absolute sale" to the register of deeds of Naga City and as a consequence TCT Nos. 9388 and 9424 were released in her favor.&nbsp; It was only in September 1988, that Deogracias and Rosalina discovered that they were deprived of the ownership of their property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, Deogracias and Rosalina pray that their true intention of entering into a real estate mortgage and not an absolute sale be given effect, that the "deed of absolute sale" and "memorandum of agreement" be declared void and that the T.C.T.s issued in Socorro's name be canceled and new T.C.T.s be issued in favor of Deogracias and Rosalina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On October 28, 1988, Deogracias and Rosalina paid the filing fee of four hundred forty pesos (P440.00)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and legal research fee of ten pesos (P10.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The computation of the filing fee was based on the following amounts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Judge Naval told the Carmelite Sisters that he could not issue the <i>ex-parte</i> restraining order because a Supreme Court administrative circular required a hearing with notice to the adverse party.&nbsp; To this statement, Sister Margaret Mary retorted, "<i>Why would</i> <i>Atty. Padilla </i>(Socorro's counsel, Atty. Sabino Padilla, Jr.)<i> ask for an ex-parte restraining order when according to you that is prohibited by an order or circular of the Supreme Court?&nbsp; Do you mean Atty.

Padilla, filed a motion to inhibit Judge Naval praying that the ends of justice would best be served if the case was re-raffled to another judge.&nbsp; Basically, the grounds cited were: <b>First</b>, while still a law practitioner and politician, Judge Naval was a frequent customer of the restaurant owned by Deogracias and was a good friend of his. <b>Second</b>, Judge Naval was also a close friend of Rosalina and Deogracias' attorney, Atty. Dennis B. Recon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On January 23, 1989, the trial court denied Socorro's motion to inhibit.

Manio, Presiding Judge, Branch 19, Naga City about the Christmas Party of the entire Court personnel which would be held at 5:30 o'clock that afternoon of December 16.<br><br>"The inhibition of this Presiding Judge would not have been a problem had Defendant's counsel filed his motion before this Court had refused to issue ex parte a restraining order despite strong representations therefor by three (3) Sisters of Charity and their Mother Superior, allegedly upon instructions of Counsel for the Defendant. To grant the `motion to inhibit' at this stage of the proceedings when this Court, after hearing, has already denied defendant's motion for issuance of a restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction, and has already partially denied defendant's motion to dismiss, may create a bad precedent, and may even adversely affect the integrity of the bar and of the bench because the said Sisters of Charity impressed upon this Presiding Judge not to be apprehensive in issuing the restraining order ex parte as the Supreme Court will sustain it, their counsel being a brother of a Justice of the Supreme Court.<br><br>"This Presiding Judge believes that he is competent to hear this case and to render judgment which is fair and just to both parties.<br><br>"WHEREFORE, defendant's motion `to inhibit' is hereby DENIED.<br><br>"SO ORDERED.<br><br>"Given in Chambers, this 23rd day of January 1989, at the City of Naga, Philippines."</blockquote></blockquote><br>On April 17, 1989, Deogracias and Rosalina filed a "motion to admit attached supplemental complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The supplemental complaint pleaded<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on March 30, 1989, subsequent to the filing of the above-entitled case and conformably with the true agreement of the parties herein in their Memorandum of Agreement which they acknowledged before Notary Public Manuel M.

Deogracias and Rosalina merely paid the amount of the docket fees computed by the Clerk of Court.&nbsp; They were in good faith and relied on the assessment of the Clerk of Court.&nbsp; This is a finding of fact which the Court of Appeals carefully made.&nbsp; In the absence of abuse of discretion, we shall not disturb the same.<br><br>In <i>Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the issue was whether or not the court acquired jurisdiction over the case even if the docket fee paid was not sufficient.&nbsp; This Court ruled that since the petitioners did not intend to defraud the government by paying insufficient docket fees, a more liberal interpretation of the rules should apply.&nbsp; In <i>Sun Insurance Office, Ltd., v. Asuncion</i>, private respondent, like Deogracias and Rosalina in the case at bar, demonstrated willingness to abide by the rules by paying the additional docket fees as required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the Court concluded that the trial court was vested with jurisdiction and consequently stated the following rules:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not simply the filing of the complaint of appropriate initiatory pleading, but the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action.&nbsp; Where the filing of the initiatory pleading is not accompanied by payment of the docket fee, the court <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may allow payment of the fee within a reasonable time</span> but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.<br><br>xxx<br><br>"3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the trial court acquired jurisdiction over a claim by the filing of the appropriate pleading and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">payment of the prescribed filing fee</span>, but subsequently, the judgment awards a claim not specified in the pleading, or if specified the same has been left for the determination of the court, the additional filing fee shall constitute a lien on the judgment. It shall be the responsibility of the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized deputy to enforce said lien and assess and collect the additional filing fee (<i>underscoring ours</i>)."<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Ng Soon v. Alday</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> this Court stated that the initial payment of the filing fees corresponding to the estimated amount of the claim is allowed subject to the adjustment of what may be proved later.&nbsp; If what is proved (amount of claims for damages) is less than what is claimed, then a refund may be made; if more, additional fees will be exacted.&nbsp; The rule comes into play when the situation found in <i>Manchester Development Corporation v.

(par. 14 (b), sub-par. 4);<br><br>"d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Court obviously took the motion to inhibit in a different&nbsp; light.&nbsp; Not only did it deny the motion; in so doing, i<span style="text-decoration: underline;">t vented its anger at undersigned counsel and the Carmalite Sisters.</span>(par. 15);<br><br>"e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were Carmelite (sic) Sisters, or if their official name is to be used, they were Sisters belonging to the order of Discalced Carmilites.&nbsp; The Sisters or Daughters of Charity, are an entirely different religious congregation.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It seems that the Court could not get correctly even this very elementary fact</span>.

With all due respect, it is submitted that the foregoing version of the Carmelite Sisters is to be believed. (par. 18).<br><br>"i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When defendant pointed this out in her motion to dismiss and other pleadings, this Court instead of dismissing both the original and the supplemental complaint sought to remedy the irremediable.&nbsp; It refrained from passing on it in ruling on the motion to dismiss; but in a separate order of July 12, 1989, it required the plaintiffs to pay the difference between what they had paid on the original complaint and what they should pay on the "supplemental" complaint. In other words, instead of dismissing the "supplemental" complaint for non-payment of the filing fee, which is all that it could do, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Court went out of its way to save the day for the plaintiffs</span> by giving them an opportunity to pay the correct filing fee and thus retain jurisdiction over the same.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But that is not all.</span> It even gave plaintiffs credit for the inadequate filing fee they paid under their original complaint; (par. 22); and<br><br>"j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, if plaintiffs insist on their change of theory, the obvious remedy is not by way of "supplemental" or even "amended" complaint, but by dismissing the original complaint and filing an entirely new one. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But of course, that would mean a raffle and plaintiffs apparently do not want to risk having their case fall into another branch or sala.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>"It is respectfully submitted, however, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">plaintiffs' obvious desire to keep their case in this particular branch of the court is no excuse for violating the rules.</span> (par. 27).

Padilla's innuendoes are not necessarily disrespectful to the court as to be considered contumacious.&nbsp; A lawyer's remarks explaining his position in a case under consideration do not necessarily assume the level of contempt that justifies the court to exercise the power of contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Courts must be slow to punish for direct contempt.&nbsp; This drastic power must be used sparingly in cases of clearly contumacious behavior in <i>facie curiae.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The salutary rule is that the power to punish for contempt must be exercised on the preservative, not vindictive principle,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and on the corrective and not retaliatory idea of punishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> The courts must exercise the power to punish for contempt for purposes that are impersonal because that power is intended as a safeguard not for the judges as persons but for the functions that they exercise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Snide remarks or even sarcastic innuendoes do not necessarily assume that level of contumely actionable under Rule 71 of the Revised Rules of Court. Judges generally and wisely pass unnoticed any mere hasty and unguarded expression of passion, or at least pass it with simply a reproof.&nbsp; In the natural order of things, when a case is decided, one party wins and another loses, and oftentimes, both sides are equally confident and sanguine.&nbsp; Thus, disappointment is great for the party whose action or view fails.&nbsp; It is human nature that there be bitter feelings which often reach to the judge as the source of the supposed wrong.&nbsp; A judge, therefore, ought to be patient, and tolerate everything which appears as but a momentary outbreak of disappointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Lawyers may not be held to too strict an account for words said in the heat of the moment, because of chagrin at losing cases, and that the big way is for the court to condone even contemptuous language.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> While judges must exercise patience, lawyers must also observe temperate language as well.
