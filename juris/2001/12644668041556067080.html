The above-mentioned cases were then jointly heard.<br><br>The trial court summarized the evidence for the prosecution as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Witness Marlon Sotero narrated that Aviguetero, a relative and neighbor in Sta. Ignacia, Tarlac, visited him and his wife sometime in November 1993, and asked him if he wanted to work as a factory worker in Malaysia as she knew Aurora Soliven who had a recruitment agency in Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; He replied that he had a job but if the overseas employment were certain, then he would be interested.&nbsp; He was given a bio-data form by Aviguetero and after filling it up, he gave it to her and she in turn gave the papers to Soliven.&nbsp; He paid P1,500.00 for the passport and was told that if he could make full payment of the processing and placement fees then he would be able to leave sooner.&nbsp; So he gave the amount of P27,000.00 in Soliven's house in Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; He left the country on February 19, 1994 on a tourist visa.&nbsp; He saw Pascua only before he left and learned with some companions in Penang, Butterworth, Malaysia, there was no work for them.&nbsp; They stayed at the Paktai Hotel with instructions that a certain Abdul Hamid Asari, the contact of the accused would give them working permits.&nbsp; When Asari arrived at the hotel, he took their passports and even their pocket money, purportedly to show to their prospective employer.&nbsp; Later they were brought to the Tiktak Factory and they started to work at the rate of 15 ringits or the equivalent of P150.00 a day. After a month, they decided to report the matter to the police.&nbsp; Pascua who arrived in Malaysia took his ticket.&nbsp; He returned to Manila on May 8, 1994 and immediately went to the TV program `Hoy, Gising' to relate his unfortunate flight in Malaysia.&nbsp; He was referred to Camp Crame and soon Pascua and Soliven were apprehended.&nbsp; The case was referred to the Department of Justice.&nbsp; He executed a statement marked Exh. `D.' He went to the POEA and was told that the three accused were not licensed recruiters.&nbsp; (see Exhs. A, B, and C).<br><br>"Jaylord Balauro, civil engineering graduate is also a relative of Aviguetero and he also resides in Sta. Ignacia, Tarlac.&nbsp; He knows Soliven but denies knowing Pascua.&nbsp; He recalls that sometime in 1993 Aviguetero informed him that there were job openings abroad.&nbsp; He was then working as stock engineer at Procter and Gamble.&nbsp; There (sic) some neighbors who were earlier recruited by Aviguetero, one of them, his uncle Edmund Pasamonte.&nbsp; Aviguetero introduced him and his mother to Soliven, a recruiter with a licensed agency.&nbsp; Aviguetero and Soliven told them the placement fee was about P27,000.00. they also promised a lot of things: first, there was a job placement for an engineer in Singapore, then after about 2 to 3 months, he was told to wait for a working visa to Bahrain.&nbsp; Having given some amount to Soliven at her agency at El Niño Apartelle in N. Domingo St. cor. Banahaw St., Cubao, QC, he was anxious to leave.&nbsp; It was his father who made complete payment of P27,000.00 at Soliven's residence in Cubao.&nbsp; (see photocopy of cash voucher dated March 28 showing full payment of P27,000.00 by Jaylord Balauro marked Exh. E, signed by Mrs. Soliven).&nbsp; Finally, he was told that he could work as engineer in Malaysia. He left on a tourist visa.&nbsp; His passport was stamped in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia good for 7 days.&nbsp; There were three of them who arrived on April 1, 1994.&nbsp; Their contact, Maribel Banigued was supposed to fetch them at the airport but she did not.&nbsp; He called her up and she instructed them to take a bus to Traveller's Inn where he met Banigued.&nbsp; She told them that an employer would fetch them, but no one came.&nbsp; They stayed for 21 days in Kuala Lumpur and one day in Singapore.&nbsp; When he ran out of funds, he had to sell some pieces of jewelry and he wrote Aviguetero telling her about his predicament. His father told him to come home and he did come back on April 23, 1994.&nbsp; His father asked for reimbursement from Soliven and Aviguetero and he was given P18,300.00 on April 30, 1994.&nbsp; His affidavit-complaint is marked Exh. `F.'<br><br>"Shirley Velasco was introduced by her aunt Zenaida Santiago to Mrs. Soliven on February 10, 1994 at Soliven's residence at E. Rodriguez St., QC. Santiago was earlier recruited by Soliven as a factory worker in Malaysia.&nbsp; After the introduction, she submitted a bio-data form to Ms. Soliven who told her to come back for her passport for which she paid P1,600.00. After a week Soliven told her she was ready to leave and work as a factory worker.&nbsp; On February 18, 1994 she was asked to pay P27,000.00 as full payment of placement/processing fee and that was when she met Mrs. Pascua at Soliven's residence.&nbsp; She gave the amount to Pascua upon instruction of Soliven.&nbsp; Pascua was supposed to fly with her and other recruits. But at the departure area, when she presented her passport with an entry `service staff,' immigration people asked for some documents which she could not produce, hence was not allowed to leave. She saw Soliven and Aviguetero at the canteen.&nbsp; Soliven just took her baggage and told her to go home."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>The defense presented the accused-appellant whose testimony is summarized by the trial court as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"In her defense, Aurora Soliven testified that she was an agent for Cocolife since 1994 and the nature of her work brought her to different places to solicit insurance.&nbsp; She denies having recruited the private complainants in these cases.&nbsp; She explained that it was Remedios Pascua who facilitated the employment of her son Pedro Che Soliven and son-in-law Allan Deticio in Malaysia (see receipt dated March 25, 1994 marked Exh. `4').&nbsp; Another son Peter was also recruited by Maribel Banigued, Pascua's colleague to whom she paid P20,000.00 (see cash voucher dated December 16, 1993 marked&nbsp; Exh. `5'). She clarified that the Sotero spouses introduced themselves to her as relatives of Aviguetero, her close friend and comadre.&nbsp; They were asking for help to work abroad.&nbsp; Relating her children's experience who left as tourists, she told them that if they were really interested, she would introduce them to Pascua and she gave them Pascua's address at the back of UST.&nbsp; Before he left, Sotero dropped by her place to ask for her son`s address in Malaysia.&nbsp; Then he came back, he went to her place to ask for financial help as it was enrollment time and he had no money.&nbsp; Taking pity on him, she gave him several amounts:&nbsp; P3,000.00; P500.00; P1,100.00 and P800.00, respectively (see certification dated June 2, 1994 marked Exhibit `1').&nbsp; Sotero's wife Ligaya also asked for a loan in the amount of P17,000.00 (see letter dated May 24, 1994 marked Exh. `6' bearing the signature of Ligaya Sotero).<br><br>"She met Jaylord Balauro sometime in November 1994.&nbsp; Sotero introduced Balauro to her as a relative of Aviguetero.&nbsp; Balauro also wanted to work abroad so she told them that Sotero already knew Pascua and Banigued.&nbsp; Balauro used to frequent her place before he left abroad as he had nowhere else to go in the city.&nbsp; She clarified that although Exh. `2' shows that she promised to pay Juanito Balauro the amount of P18,300.00 the money came from Banigued, who sent a certain Mr. Sacramento to pay Balauro.<br><br>"Regarding Shirley Velasco, she recalls that Velasco came to her residence bringing a letter from her aunt Zenaida Santiago.&nbsp; She too was asking for assistance to work abroad.&nbsp; She gave Velasco the address of Pascua.&nbsp; She denies seeing Velasco off at the airport.&nbsp; She also denies receiving any amount from her.&nbsp; During the preliminary investigation at the DOJ she told Pascua to give back the money paid by Velasco so she would desist from her complaint.&nbsp; So Pascua gave the money to Soliven's sister, Lolita Graza, who, in turn gave it to Velasco."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>In its Decision dated April 16, 1996, the trial court declared that "with respect to the accused Aurora Soliven, the court is morally convinced that the elements of the offense of illegal recruitment on a large scale has been sufficiently proved: she offered overseas employment to several persons for a fee, without the necessary license to recruit from the POEA." The trial court likewise found her "guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa for pretending to be a licensed recruiter and offering overseas jobs to the complainants for a fee which representations were false and resorted to only for the purpose of getting money from said complainants." The trial court stated that "it is of no moment that she made partial reimbursement to the complainants because the offense was already consummated.&nbsp; The accused assertions of innocence appears inconsistent with her actuations in these cases."<br><br>In due time, the accused-appellant filed her appeal and in her Appellant's Brief contends that the trial court committed the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>"The trial court gravely erred in convicting accused-appellant of the crimes charged despite failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>"The trial court gravely erred in not considering the defense interposed by accused-appellant."</blockquote><br>Being interrelated, the assigned errors shall be discussed jointly.<br><br>Accused-appellant claims that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt for illegal recruitment and estafa; that the trial court considered private complainants' testimonies at face value; and that it failed to consider some facts and circumstances which show that she never recruited private complainants and that she never pretended to be a licensed recruiter.&nbsp; Accused-appellant quoted in her brief the testimonies of private complainants Marlon Sotero and Jaylord Balauro showing that it was their relative Aviguetero who recruited them to work abroad.&nbsp; As to private complainant Shirley Velasco, appellant avers that although the former claimed in her testimony that it was accused-appellant who recruited her, this was belied by her affidavit of desistance (Exhibit "3"), thus:<br><br><blockquote>"3. That we are no longer interested in the prosecution of this case as the filing arose out of misunderstanding or misapprehension of facts."</blockquote><br>Accused-appellant further maintains that while it is true that she has no license or authority to recruit or engage in recruitment activities, this is of no moment considering that she is not engaged in recruitment activities nor pretended to be a licensed recruiter or owner of a licensed recruitment agency.<br><br>Accused-appellant also contends that based on the foregoing arguments, she could not have likewise committed the crime of estafa under Article 315, 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br>Article 38 of the Labor Code, as amended, defines illegal recruitment thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Art. 38.&nbsp; <i>Illegal Recruitment</i>. - (a)&nbsp; Any recruitment activities, including the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, to be undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority shall be deemed illegal and punishable under Article 39 of this code.&nbsp; The Ministry of Labor and Employment or any law enforcement officer may initiate complaints under this Article.<br><br>"(b) Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage and shall be penalized in accordance with Article 39 hereof.<br><br>"Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring and/or confederating with one another in carrying out any unlawful or illegal transaction, enterprise or scheme defined under the first paragraph hereof.&nbsp; (Illegal recruitment is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group.)</blockquote><br>Article 13(b) of the same Code defines "recruitment and placement" as:<br><br><blockquote>"any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, that any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement."</blockquote><br>To prove illegal recruitment, only two elements need be shown, viz., (1) the offender undertakes either any activity within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" defined under Art. 13 (b), or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code; and&nbsp; (2) he has no valid license or authority required by law to enable one to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> A license is a document issued by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) authorizing a person or entity to operate a private employment agency, while an authority is a document issued by the DOLE authorizing a person or association to engage in recruitment and placement activities as a private recruitment entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant having admitted that she has no license or authority to recruit or engage in recruitment activities, only the first element of the crime has to be discussed, i.e., whether or not said appellant has undertaken recruitment activities (or any of the activities enumerated in Article 34 of the Labor Code, as amended).<br><br>The following testimonies of the three private complainants attest to accused-appellant's engagement in recruitment activities:<br><br>Private complainant Marlon Sotero on cross-examination:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Under what circumstances did you meet accused Aurora Soliven?

of the accused consisting of her promise of employment to certain persons and of transporting them abroad fall squarely within the ambit of recruitment and placement as defined by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>With regard to accused-appellant's claim that she did not pretend to be a licensed recruiter or owner of a licensed recruitment agency, the same is belied by the private complainants' testimony that she was personally introduced by Aviguetero to them as a recruiter with a licensed agency.&nbsp; And at any rate, it is not required that it be shown that such person wrongfully represented himself as a licensed recruiter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also faults the trial court for allegedly considering private complainants' testimonies at face value.<br><br>It is a well settled rule that the evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect because such court has the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and determine if they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Such findings of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal absent any clear showing that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight or substance which could have affected the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This Court finds that the trial court did not overlook, misunderstand or misapply facts or circumstances of weight or substance which could have affected the result of the case.<br><br>There is large-scale illegal recruitment if it is committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group; its elements, therefore, are the two above-mentioned plus the fact that it is committed against three or more persons.<br><br>Large-scale illegal recruitment involves economic sabotage, and is penalized by Article 39 (a) of the Labor Code, as amended, with life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00.<br><br>The accused-appellant having recruited at least three persons, giving them the impression of her ability to send workers abroad, assuring them of their employment in Malaysia, and collecting various amounts for alleged processing and placement fees without license nor authority to so recruit or offer job placements abroad, thus committed large scale illegal recruitment.<br><br>The trial court also did not err in finding the accused guilty of estafa. The elements of estafa in general are: (1) that the accused defrauded another: (a) by abuse of confidence, or (b) by means of deceit; and (2) that damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation is caused to the offended party or third person.<br><br>All these elements are present in the instant case:&nbsp; the accused-appellant deceived the complainants into believing that she had the authority and capability to send them abroad for employment; that there were available jobs for them in Malaysia for which they would be hired; and that by reason or on the strength of such assurance, the complainants parted with their money in payment of the various processing and placement fees.&nbsp; As all these representations of the accused-appellant proved false, paragraph 2(a), Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code is thus applicable.<br><br>The penalty for estafa depends on the amount defrauded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code states:<br><br><blockquote>"Art. 315. <i>Swindling (estafa)</i>.&nbsp; -&nbsp; Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:<br><br>"1<sup>st</sup> The penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to prision mayor in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.&nbsp; In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be;<br><br>"2<sup>nd</sup> The penalty of prision correccional in its minimum and medium periods, if the amount of the fraud is over 6,000 pesos but does not exceed 12,000 pesos;"</blockquote><br>The trial court sentenced accused-appellant Aurora Soliven to suffer imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal each in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-94-58865, Q-94-58867 and Q-94-58870.&nbsp; Pursuant to the aforequoted Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalties imposed on appellant Aurora Soliven should be reduced as follows:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. Q-94-58865 (which pertains to private complainant Shirley Velasco), the amount involved is P27,000.00.&nbsp; The penalty prescribed by law therefor is <i>prision correccional</i> maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum to be imposed in its maximum period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the proper penalty to be imposed on accused-appellant is a prison term of four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to seven (7) years and four (4) months of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. Q-94-58867, accused-appellant defrauded private complainant Marlon B. Sotero in the amount of P21,600.00 (appellant having returned to the latter the amount of P5,400.00).&nbsp; The penalty prescribed by law therefor is <i>prision correccional</i> maximum to <i>prision mayor </i>minimum.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the proper penalty to be imposed on accused-appellant is a prison term of four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i> medium as minimum, to six (6) years and four (4) months of <i>prision mayor</i> minimum as maximum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. Q-94-58870, accused-appellant defrauded private complainant Jaylord Balauro in the amount of P8,700.00 (appellant having returned to the latter the amount of P18,300).&nbsp; Hence, the penalty prescribed should be that imposed in paragraph 2 of Art. 315<i> </i>of the Revised Penal Code, in its medium period.&nbsp; The maximum period ranges from one (1) year, eight (8) months and twenty-one (21) days, to two (2) years, eleven (11) months and ten (10) days.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the accused-appellant may be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty the minimum of which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed by law, <i>viz</i>., <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium and maximum periods - two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) months and the maximum of which shall be the abovementioned imposable penalty.
