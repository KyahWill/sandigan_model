				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal is taken from the 26th February 1999 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, Branch 19,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 2329, convicting accused Fortunato Balano of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the private complainant, Elsie Ninang, the amounts of P50,000.00 for moral damages and P20,000.00 for exemplary damages.<br><br>The Information filed before the court <i>a quo</i> charging the accused with the crime of rape read:<br><blockquote>"That on or about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of April 20, 1996, at Sitio Binandosan, Barangay Christianuevo, Municipality of Lebak, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with lewd and unchaste designs, and by means of force and intimidation and violence, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of ELSIE NINANG against her will and consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Accused Fortunato Balano pleaded "not guilty" to the charge when arraigned.<br><br>At the trial, the prosecution presented five witnesses, namely, the private complainant Elsie Ninang, her daughter Richeryll Ninang, her husband Alejandro Ninang, Dr. Gaudencio Labian, and SPO4 Vicente Oro. The defense, in its case, placed the accused himself at the witness stand and, on sur-rebuttal, one Orlando Torres to corroborate Balano's <i>alibi</i>.<br><br>Private complainant Elsie Ninang testified that on 20 April 1999, she was in her house at Poblacion II, Binandosan, Lebak, Sultan Kudarat, together with her daughter Richeryll and niece Genelyn. It was around ten o'clock in the evening, that day, when she was awakened by a beam from a flashlight held by the accused. He held her by the neck and threatened to kill her. Richeryll was awakened, and seeing what the accused was doing to her mother, she yelled, "Mother," "Mother." The angered accused told Elsie to tell her daughter to stop shouting. Threatened, Richeryll covered herself with a blanket. The accused hit Elsie on her left chest, lower portion of her breast and abdomen, causing her to lose consciousness for about half an hour. When she came to, she found herself naked. She then realized that the accused had raped her; indeed, she could feel his semen coming out from her vagina. Accused pointed his knife at her, telling her to go with him and threatening to kill her if she did not. She pleaded with the accused to just leave and go home. After awhile, he left.<br><br>Elsie knows the accused quite well, her husband, Alejandro, being the brother of the wife of the accused.<br><br>The following day, Elsie went to see her sister-in-law Anita Empalmado and related to her what the accused had done. Anita, together with Elsie and Richeryll, repaired to Kumalawit, Lebak, Sultan Kudarat, where Alejandro and the latter's brother were harvesting palay. Informed of the incident, Alejandro, Elsie and Richeryll, went to a physician to have Elsie examined before reporting the matter to the police.<br><br>Richeryll Ninang, the eight-year-old daughter of Elsie, corroborated the testimony of her mother. She testified that on 20 April 1996, around ten o'clock in the evening, she, together with her mother and cousin Genelyn, was sleeping in their house when she awoke and saw the accused choking and hitting her mother. Her father, Alejandro, was in Kumalawit at the time. She started to shout until the accused threatened to kill her. She covered herself with a blanket but in a way that she could still manage to see the accused undress her mother and place himself on top of her. After he was through, her mother pleaded with the accused to leave them alone.<br><br>Dr. Gaudencio Labian, the Chief of Medical and Community Hospital at Lebak, Sultan Kudarat, found Elsie to have sustained injury on the right side of the face and right middle portion of the neck, as well as contusions on her breast bone and right hip. Dr. Labian, however, was unable to conduct a genital examination.<br><br>Police investigator SPO4 Vicente Oro testified that on 22 April 1996, he took the sworn statements of Elsie Ninang and Richeryll Ninang following the complaint for rape lodged against Fortunato Balano.<br><br>Alejandro Ninang, the victim's husband, said that he was not at home but elsewhere at work in the evening of 20 April 1996. He only came to learn of the sexual assault when his wife went to Kumalawit to report to him the incident. He accompanied his wife to a doctor to have her examined. He confirmed that the accused was the husband of his sister.<br><br>In his defense, accused Balano claimed that between five thirty in the afternoon and eight o'clock in the evening of 20 April 1996, he was all the time at the house of his employer Lorenzo Cabalfin in Tinungos, Brgy. Christianuevo, Lebak, Sultan Kudarat, drinking "<i>tuba</i>" with his brother-in-law, Alejandro Ninang, his employer Lorenzo Cabalfin and his wife, and an older brother. Alejandro later left the group for Binandosan, Lebak, Sultan Kudarat. Balano said that he slept at his employer's house. The following day, he was surprised to be invited to the house of a barangay official and informed of a complaint for rape filed by Elsie Ninang against him. He was advised by the barangay official to proceed to the house of his parents-in-law in Binandosan. When he arrived, Alejandro told him not to worry about the "problem" as Alejandro knew that his wife was flirting with other men. Alejandro intimated to him that on 20 April 1996, he caught his wife having sexual intercourse with another man in their house at Binandosan. Alejandro, the accused said, had even promised to testify in his favor. He denied all the charges hurled against him by Elsie. He averred that the only motive of Elsie in filing the complaint for rape was to get back at him because he slapped her at one time in a confrontation between them.<br><br>On rebuttal, Alejandro and Elsie both refuted the asseverations of Balano.<br><br>On sur-rebuttal, the defense presented Orlando Torres to corroborate the testimony of the accused that they had a drinking spree in the house of Cabalfin on 20 April 1996 from five thirty in the afternoon to ten o'clock in the evening. He said that Alejandro left for home at around eight o'clock in the evening. He slept in the house of Cabalfin, together with Balano and the latter's wife, because of a heavy downpour that night.<br><br>The accused was later called back to the witness stand to testify that Elsie and Alejandro started to live separately following the 20th April 1996 incident.<br><br>The trial court rejected the defense claim of denial, as well as <i>alibi</i>, and on 26 February 1999, rendered a decision finding the accused guilty of rape; the trial court held:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, upon all the foregoing considerations, the Court finds the accused, Fortunato Balano, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape. Accordingly, the Court hereby sentences the accused, Fortunato Balano:<br><br>"a) to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA;<br><br>"b) to indemnify the private offended victim, Elsie Ninang, in the amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages, and the further amount of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages, conformably with current jurisprudential policy; and<br><br>"c) to pay the costs.<br><br>"Being a detention prisoner, the accused, Fortunato Balano, is entitled to full credit of the entire period of his preventive imprisonment, in accordance with Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 6127, provided he had agreed in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners, otherwise, with only four-fifths (4/5) thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>In this appeal, Fortunato Balano insists that he is innocent, and he seeks a reversal of his conviction. The Office of the Solicitor General, in the Appellee's brief, maintains otherwise.<br><br>In reviewing rape cases, the Court, as always, has been guided by the settled principles that - 1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more difficult, however, for the person accused, although innocent, to disprove; b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the claim of the defense, Elsie's testimony appears to be most credible and convincing. She has been able to recount her ordeal in the hands of accused-appellant in a plain and straightforward manner. Hereunder is her testimony (reproduced <i>verbatim</i> from the transcript of stenographic notes):<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">"FISCAL VALENSON:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="10%"> <br></td><td width="90%"> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q</td><td>On April 20, 1996, in the evening, do you remember where did you sleep?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td>In our house, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q</td><td>Who were your companions in your house when you sleep there?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td>My daughter and my niece, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q</td><td>You said you are married.

A plain housewife would not unduly just subject herself to so humiliating a public scrutiny as that which is attendant in criminal accusations of this nature. It would also be quite unlikely for her to risk ridicule or possible alienation from family and friends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The failure of Elsie to submit herself to genital examination, bewailed by accused-appellant, deserves scant consideration. A medical examination is not an indispensable requirement for the successful prosecution of rape. The testimony of the victim alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict an accused of that crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Equally important, the narration given by the private complainant was bolstered by the testimony of her daughter, Richeryll, who witnessed the entire episode committed against her mother. She recounted how accused-appellant, whom she positively identified, physically abused and raped her mother.

Given Richeryll's tender age and her trauma in witnessing the assault on her mother, the child-witness cannot be expected to recall every detail of the incident. Indeed, the minor lapses in her testimony should tend to buttress, rather than weaken, her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The Court can only accord great respect to the factual findings of the trial court. The well-entrenched rule is that an appellate court will not disturb the assessment of the trial court on matters of credibility, considering that the latter would naturally be in a much better position than an appellate court to appreciate testimonial evidence. The known exceptions from the rule, such as when the trial court is shown to have plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, could likely affect the result of the case, or when the evidence on record utterly fails to support or substantiate the findings and conclusions of the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> are not here extant.<br><br>In the face of the strong evidence against him, accused-appellant's claim of <i>alibi</i> hardly needs to be belabored.<br><br>The crime of rape is defined in and made punishable under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11, of Republic Act No. 7659, which reads:<br><blockquote>"ART. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed. - </i>Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br>"1.
