They also saw appellant shoot, for the third time, Teodoro Coronado.<br><br>Sensing the presence of the roving patrol, appellant turned his attention towards them and shot at them twice.&nbsp; Fortunately, nobody was hit as the members of the roving patrol were able to immediately scamper for safety.<br><br>Thereafter, a taxi passed by. Appellant again shot his gun towards the taxi.&nbsp; He then ran away from the scene of the incident.<br><br>Coming out from hiding fifteen minutes later, the roving patrol carried Teodoro Coronado and loaded him on a taxicab.&nbsp; The roving patrol was able to bring Teodoro Coronado to the Cebu City Medical Center for treatment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Despite the medical attention given to Teodoro Coronado, he died on November 12, 1996 as a result of the gunshots wounds he sustained on November 11, 1996.&nbsp; As explained by Dr. Policarpio Murillo IV in his testimony:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT"><i>Q</i></div></td> <td style="font-style: italic;" valign="TOP" width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Now kindly examine again you have copy of the death certificate tell us the cause of death? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"><i>A</i></div></td> <td style="font-style: italic;" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The causes of death as written in the Certificate of Death for this patient is hemorrhagic shock secondary to penetrating gunshot wound to the abdomen, perforating the descending colon at 2 points with moderate fecal spilege 3.0 cm cortical laceration of the left kidney with non-expanding retro peritoneal hematoma 50% renal contusion on the left moderate hemoperitoneum and I include here other operative notes, other cause of death.

However, for all the pains counsel took to impeach Belcher's credibility by leading him through an intricate maze of questions during cross-examination clearly calculated to trap him into making inconsistent statements, Belcher remained resolute in his declaration that when he and the roving patrol arrived at the place where they heard the gunshots, <i>they saw accused-appellant brandishing a revolver with the victim already prostrate on the ground, and that upon seeing them, accused-appellant fired at them causing them to scamper for safety in different directions</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>So long as the witnesses' testimonies agree on substantial matters, the inconsequential inconsistencies and contradictions dilute neither the witnesses' credibility nor the verity of their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> When the inconsistency is not an essential element of the crime, such inconsistency is insignificant and can not have any bearing on the essential fact testified to, that is the killing of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant next argues that Belcher did not actually see the accused-appellant fire the shots that hit the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> According to him, this negates his positive identification as the assailant of the victim.<br><br>The argument fails to persuade.<br><br>Even in the absence of direct evidence, accused may still be convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: 1.] there is more than one circumstance; 2.] the facts from which the inference are derived are proven; and 3.] the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; With regard to what yardsticks are to be used in assaying the probative value thereof -<br><br>Wharton suggests four basic guidelines in the appreciation of circumstantial evidence, (1) it should be acted upon with caution; (2) all the essential facts must be consistent with the hypothesis of guilt; (3) the facts must exclude every other theory but that of guilt; and (4) the facts must establish such a certainty of guilt of the accused as to convince the judgment beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is the one who committed the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The peculiarity of circumstantial evidence is that the guilt of the accused cannot be deduced from scrutinizing just one particular piece of evidence.&nbsp; It is far more like puzzle which when put together reveals a convincing picture pointing towards the conclusion that the accused is the author of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Even were we to go along with the claim of accused-appellant that eyewitness Belcher may not have seen the actual shooting of the victim, this will not extricate him from his predicament because the following circumstances lead to the inevitable conclusion that accused-appellant was the perpetrator of the crime.<br><br>First, it must be pointed out that immediately after hearing gunshots, Efren Belcher and the other members of the roving <i>barangay tanod </i>patrol rushed towards the area where they heard the shots and there they saw accused-appellant holding a revolver<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> one and a half meters away<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> from Teodoro Coronado who was already slumped on the ground<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and mortally wounded.&nbsp;

2.] demonstrate that it would be physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Accused-appellant failed to establish the second requisite.&nbsp; Since the distance between the house and the place of the incident was only about eighty (80) meters, it was not impossible for accused-appellant to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In other words, accused-appellant's defense that he was at some other place at the time of the killing does not satisfactorily show that it was physically impossible for him to have perpetrated the felony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>All told, the core issue raised by accused-appellant centers on the credibility of the witnesses.&nbsp; The doctrinal rule is that findings of fact made by the trial court, which had the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses and to determine the probative value of the other testimonies, are entitled to great weight and respect because the trial court is in a better position to assess the same, an opportunity not equally open to an appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter that is best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor, conduct and attitude, especially under cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> A meticulous review of the records of this case, convinced us that the trial court did not err in finding the accused-appellant guilty of killing the victim.<br><br>Anent the third assigned error, accused-appellant contends that the lower court erred in finding that treachery and evident premeditation attended the commission of the felony, inasmuch as:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>The lower court hastily concluded in its decision that treachery ands evident premeditation attended the commission of the crime without setting forth therein the facts and circumstances which may sustain such finding, in violation of the Constitution.<br><br></li><li>The testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution failed to establish the manner as to how the Accused-Appellant allegedly shot the deceased Coronado.&nbsp; Thus, there can be no basis for the trial court's finding that the crime was committed with treachery and evident premeditation.</li></ol></blockquote><br>We agree.<br><br>Article 14, paragraph (16), of the Revised Penal Code provides that there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specifically to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.&nbsp; The testimony of prosecution witness Efren Belcher, although sufficient to prove that accused-appellant did indeed kill Teodoro Coronado, is nevertheless wanting as far as proof of treachery is concerned.&nbsp; As we recently pointed out in <b><i>People v.
