				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A father who unleashes raw lust on his own flesh and blood is worse than a beast for humanity has yet to hear a tale of a beast which defiled the sanctity of its own young.<br><br>Accused-appellant Virgilio Lorica started sexually abusing his daughter Elenita P. Lorica since she was ten (10) years old when they were still residing in Quezon Province. He raped Elenita whenever his wife and other children were out of their house. He threatened her not to tell anybody about it, otherwise he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Elenita, who could not stand his father's abuses, nonetheless told her mother about the rapes but her mother did not believe her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Thus, Elenita cowered into silence.<br><br>When the family transferred to Brgy. Linga, Pila, Laguna, Elenita was not spared of the same ordeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Accused-appellant's maniacal assault on Elenita, however, ended on October 20, 1997 when Elenita, after being raped twice on that day,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> courageously reported the incident to her Ate Inday and friend Richel Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Richel accompanied Elenita to Brgy. Captain Rodolfo Enriquez who lost no time in referring the incident to the Philippine National Police in Pila, Laguna. Elenita's statement was taken<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and she was also brought to the Laguna Provincial Hospital for medical examination. It was found that Elenita's "vagina admits one finger with ease at 3, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock position with old hymenal tear."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Elenita's mother, Felicidad P. Lorica was informed about the incident.<br><br>The following day or on October 21, 1997, a formal complaint for rape was filed by Elenita against accused-appellant before the Municipal Trial Court of Pila, Laguna. He was arrested on the same day. In an order dated October 27, 1997, the court furnished appellant a copy of the complaint and affidavits submitted by the complainant and directed him to appear and file his counter affidavit and those of his witnesses within ten (10) days from receipt of the order in accordance with Section 3 (b) of Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure.<br><br>On November 20, 1997, finding reasonable ground to hold accused-appellant for trial, an Information was forthwith filed before the Regional Trial Court of Sta. Cruz, Laguna, the fallo of which reads:<br><blockquote>"That on or about October 20, 1997 at Brgy. Linga, Municipality of Pila, province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his daughter, ELENITA P. LORICA, a thirteen-year old girl, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, accused-appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>Accused-appellant denied having raped his daughter Elenita claiming that on the date in question he was working at the pet store of Roderick Ravellas in Brgy. Labuin, Pila, Laguna up to 10 o'clock in the evening. Thereafter, he proceeded to Lando Sultan's house at Victoria, Laguna to cook <i>kalamay</i> and stayed there till 7 o'clock the following morning.<br><br>On September 18, 1998, the trial court rendered judgment, finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and sentenced him to suffer the supreme penalty of death and to pay private complainant P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; P50,000.00 as moral damages; and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Hence, this automatic review.<br><br>In assailing the trial court's decision accused-appellant argues that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He claims that the testimony of the private complainant is wanting in details as to how the imputed rape was committed, and that the prosecution, in fishing for incriminating information, proceeded by propounding a leading question which assumed that appellant did not insert his organ into the private complainant before the latter could be given the chance to even report on this point.<br><br>We find such argument without merit.<br><br>When Elenita testified that she had been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that the rape has been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Contrary to the allegations of the accused-appellant, Elenita was able to recall the material details of the several assaults on her honor. In court, she narrated said ordeal:<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"TRIAL PROSECUTOR:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Please tell us how your father raped you at Brgy.

Whenever I tried to shout, he threatened me, he would kill me."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Elenita cannot be expected to remember every ugly detail of the appalling outrage especially so since she might in fact have been trying to forget them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Total recall should not be expected, especially if it is the victim herself on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Moreover, Elenita's seemingly hostile attitude when she testified in court is understandable. Elenita, has barely reached puberty, she is young, immature, unschooled and ignorant. We cannot judge her by the norms of behavior expected from mature women.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Besides, leading questions are found to be necessary in cases where there is difficulty in getting direct and intelligent answers from a witness who, by reason of tender years or old age, is ignorant, immature, uneducated, confused and terrified.<br><br>In fine, we give credence to Elenita's testimony. Her account of the rape on October 20, 1997 is enough to prove accused-appellant's guilt. No woman, especially of tender age, such as the private complainant in this case, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to a public trial if she was not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Considering the inbred modesty and antipathy of a Filipina in airing public, things that affect her honor, it is hard to conceive that the complainant would assume and admit the ignominy she had undergone if it were not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant likewise asserts that the death penalty cannot be imposed on him on the ground that the prosecution failed to establish the age of the victim beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to present the birth certificate of the private complainant and that the sworn statement of Felicidad P. Lorica that private complainant was born on March 23, 1984, is hearsay considering that Felicidad Lorica never testified in court.<br><br>We find the contention meritorious.<br><br>In cases where the victim is alleged to be a minor, it is essential that independent proof of the actual age of the rape victim be given as to remove any iota of doubt that the victim is indeed under 18 years of age as to fall under the qualifying circumstances enumerated in Republic Act 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In other words, the minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself. Otherwise, failure to sufficiently establish the victim's age is fatal and consequently bars conviction for rape in its qualified form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution failed to present Elenita's birth certificate or any other official document or record to show just how old she really is. Elenita's testimony that she was only 13 years old when accused-appellant raped her is not sufficient evidence to prove her true age. Also, the sworn statement of Felicidad Lorica, Elenita's mother, stating that Elenita was born on March 23, 1984, cannot be given evidentiary value considering that the allegations contained therein were never testified to by the affiant and hence are self-serving and purely hearsay.<br><br>Thus, having failed to establish the minority of the complainant, this Court is impelled to hold accused-appellant liable of simple rape only, and to reduce the penalty imposed by the trial court to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. However, we affirm the trial court's award of P50,000.00 civil indemnity; P50,000.00 moral damages and P25,000.00 exemplary damages.<br><br>In rape cases, the award of civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Moral damages are automatically awarded to the victim without the need of pleading or proof, as the mental, physical and psychological trauma suffered by the victim is too obvious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Exemplary damages is awarded to deter fathers with similar perverse tendencies or aberrant sexual behavior from sexually abusing their own daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appealed decision finding appellant VIRGILIO LORICA guilty of rape and ordering him to pay private complainant Elenita P.
