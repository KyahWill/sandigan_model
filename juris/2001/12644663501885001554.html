				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Of all the so-called heinous crimes, none perhaps more deeply provokes feelings of outrage, detestation and disgust than incestuous rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> This case is a revolting example.<br><br>For twice ravishing and thereafter impregnating his 14-year old daughter, Rodrigo Galvez y Jerez was charged with two (2) counts of Rape committed on April 30, 1993 and June 30, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The two (2) Informations similarly worded except for the dates and times of commission of the offenses aver -<br><blockquote>That on or about [the] midnight of April 30, 1993, at Barangay Itomang, Municipality of Talisay, Camarines Norte and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his own daughter, one Venus Galvez y Estacion, [a] 14 year old girl, and against her will.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment in both cases, accused-appellant entered a plea of "not guilty".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The cases thereafter proceeded to trial. By agreement of the prosecution and the defense, the hearing of the two cases were held jointly.<br><br>After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines, Norte, Branch 40,<i> </i>found accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged in both cases and rendered judgment against him thus:<br><blockquote>IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, the court finds the accused Rodrigo Galvez y Jerez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape in both cases and in Criminal Case No. 8386 is hereby sentenced to suffer a penalty of imprisonment of <b><i>Reclusion Perpetua</i></b> and in Criminal Case No. 8387 to suffer the supreme penalty of death.<br><br>Accordingly, the accused is hereby condemned to pay the offended party Venus Galvez the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) in each case as moral damages. With costs.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>On automatic review before the Court, accused-appellant alleges that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT <i>A QUO </i>ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT'S ALIBI.<br></blockquote>The Prosecution's version of the sexual assaults on private complainant's chastity is summed thus in the People's Brief:<br><blockquote>Accused-appellant and Virginia Galvez are husband and wife with four (4) children, the eldest of which is the victim, Venus, who, at the time of the incident in Criminal Case No. 8386 was only thirteen (13) years old and fourteen (14) years old when the incident in Criminal Case No. 8387 occurred. She has three (3) brothers, Erwin, Richard and Jerryglen, aged 9, 7, and 6 years old, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In 1993, accused-appellant, Venus and her three (3) brothers were living at Barangay Itomang, Talisay, Camarines Norte in a one-room house. Virginia was then in Manila working as a babysitter since February 1, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At midnight of April 30, 1993, while Venus was sleeping at their house together with her brothers, she was awakened by accused-appellant, just arrived from a drinking spree, who told her to prepare food for him. After she prepared his food, she went to sleep again. However, she was awakened because she felt her father on top of her. She noticed that the latter was removing or pulling down her panty. She resisted but accused-appellant succeeded in removing her panty. Thereafter, he inserted his penis inside her vagina. She felt pain and in the morning, she noticed that there was blood in her genital organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On June 25, 1994, her mother arrived from Manila. However, her youngest brother met an accident and was treated first at Daet Provincial Hospital but later transferred to Naga City. On June 30, 1994, while her mother was at Naga City attending to her injured brother, Venus was left at their house with her two (2) brothers and accused-appellant. At around 10:00 o'clock that evening, she was again awakened from her sleep when she felt her father on top of her. By then, she noticed that her panty was already removed and he inserted his penis inside her vagina. She resisted and felt pain all over her body because of her resistance. She even tried to reach out to her brothers who were sleeping nearby. Accused-appellant then took hold of her two (2) hands and told her to keep quiet because somebody might hear the noise. He further threatened her not to report what happened to anybody, especially to her mother and neighbors, otherwise, something bad will happen to her and to those who will be told.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Virginia Galvez confirmed that on July 30, 1994, she was at Bicol Regional Hospital at Naga City watching over her son, Gerryglen (<i>sic</i>), who sustained injuries in an accident. Meanwhile, Venus was left at their house with accused-appellant and her two (2) other sons. She stayed at the hospital with Gerryglen for fifteen (15) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Sometime in August 1994, Virginia noticed that Venus' monthly periods had stopped coming and she was becoming "healthy". Virginia then confronted her daughter and the latter revealed that it was accused-appellant who raped her several times. She immediately confronted her husband who admitted the rape. Undecided whether to take any action against her husband at first, considering that it was her family's reputation at stake, Virginia finally summoned the courage to report to the Police Station at Talisay where she and Venus executed Sworn Statements which led to the filing of the Complaint against accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On September 17, 1994, Venus was examined by Dr. Marcelito Abas at Camarines Norte Provincial Hospital. The findings, as evidenced by the Medical Certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> revealed the following:<br><br>Genital Examination:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-Admits middle finger easily<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-Multiple Healed Lacerations, hymen;<br><br>Laboratory Result: Pregnancy Test - Positive.<br><br>Dr. Abas confirmed in open court that the multiple healed lacerations of the victim's hymen was caused by the entry of the penis or the result of various sexual intercourses that the victim had experienced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>At the time of the medical examination, the victim was already three (3) months on the family way. She gave birth to a baby girl on April 3, 1995, whose fact of birth was registered with the Local Civil Registrar's Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant vehemently denied that he sexually abused the victim. Insisting that he is innocent, he disclaims committing the first rape because at the time of its commission, his wife was employed as a baby sitter in Manila<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> having started to work therein on January 2, 1992, accompanied by the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and they returned to the family residence only on March 4, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Likewise claiming innocence on the second sexual assault on the private complainant, he testified that on June 27, 1994, his son Jerry Glen was bumped by an "owner type" jeep and fractured his right ankle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Jerry Glen was then brought to the Provincial Hospital in Daet and was later transferred to the Bicol Regional Hospital in Naga in the evening of June 27, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to him, he could not have raped the victim on June 30, 1994 because he was with his wife and the private complainant at the Bicol Regional Hospital the whole day and evening of said date tending to their injured son.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The Court has ruled that in reviewing rape cases, it will be guided by the settled realities that an accusation for rape can be made with facility. While the commission of the crime may not be easy to prove, it becomes even more difficult for the person accused, although innocent, to disprove that he did not commit the crime. In view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are normally involved, the testimony of the complainant must always be scrutinized with great caution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus, in a prosecution for rape, the complainant's credibility becomes the single most important issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing principles, the Court has assiduously scrutinized the testimony of fourteen-year old Venus Galvez and has reached the opinion that her testimony on the acts of rape perpetrated by her father is clear and could have only been narrated by a victim subjected to such sexual assaults.

However, such a defense is unavailing given the facts prevailing herein. The Court has consistently looked upon the defense of alibi with suspicion and received it with caution not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it can be easily fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Unless supported by clear and convincing evidence, the same cannot prevail over the positive declarations of the victim who, in a simple and straightforward manner, convincingly identified the accused-appellant as the defiler of her chastity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Established is the rule that testimonies of rape victims, especially child victims, are given full weight and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It bears emphasis that the victim was barely thirteen when she was raped. In a litany of cases, this Court has applied the well settled rule that when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says she has been raped, she says, in effect, all that is necessary to prove that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Courts usually give greater weight to the testimony of a girl who is a victim of sexual assault, especially a minor, particularly in cases of incestuous rape, because no woman would be willing to undergo a public trial and putting up with the shame, humiliation and dishonor of exposing her own degradation were it not to condemn an injustice and to have the offender apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The embarrassment and stigma of allowing an examination of her private parts and testifying in open court on the painfully intimate details of her ravishment effectively rule out the possibility of a false accusation of rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> by the private complainant. Indeed, it would be most unnatural for a young and immature girl to fabricate a story of rape by her father; allow a medical examination of her genitalia, subject herself to a public trial and expose herself to public ridicule all because she wanted to exact revenge against accused-appellant for allegedly inflicting upon her physical injuries because she purportedly came home late.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Verily -<br><blockquote>Well settled is the rule that no woman would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and submit herself to public humiliation and scrutiny via a public trial if her sordid tale was not true and her sole motivation was not to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> A young girl's revelation that she has been raped coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and her willingness to undergo pubic trial where she would be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity by, as in this case, her own father, cannot be so easily dismissed as a mere concoction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Courts usually give credence to the testimony of a girl who is a victim of sexual assault particularly if it constitutes incestuous rape because, normally, no person would be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial and to testify on the details of her ordeal were it not to condemn an injustice. Needless to say, it is settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, since when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, it would not be remiss to point out that ill motive is never an essential element of a crime. It becomes inconsequential where there are affirmative, nay, categorical declarations towards the accused-appellant's accountability for the felony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the light of the positive testimony of the victim proving accused-appellant's criminal accountability, his alibi must perforce fail. As between the categorical testimony that rings of truth on one hand and the bare alibi on the other, the former must prevail. A mere denial like alibi is inherently a weak defense and constitutes self-serving negative evidence which can not be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on positive matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as the Court finds no reason to reverse the ruling of the trial court insofar as the rapes were committed, all that remains to be determined is the propriety of the penalties imposed upon accused-appellant.<br><br>The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>was correctly imposed on accused-appellant with regard to the sexual assault committed on April 30, 1993, as alleged in the Information in Criminal Case No. 8386, considering that R.A. No. 7659 which restored the death penalty took effect only on December 31, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Nevertheless, while accused-appellant's guilt was likewise proved beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 8387, the Court finds the imposition of the death penalty against him unwarranted. The pertinent provisions of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11, R.A. No. 7659 provides that:<br><blockquote>ART. 335. <b>When and how rape is committed</b>. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><center>x x x x x x x x x<br></center><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br></blockquote>The two circumstances of minority and relationship must <i>concur</i>;<i> </i>otherwise, if only one is proven during trial, even if the complaint or information alleged both, the death penalty cannot be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, while the complaint alleged that she was thirteen years old at the time of the commission of the offense, the prosecution did not present independent proof to substantiate the age of Venus such as her birth certificate, school record or other competent evidence to establish her minority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Viewed <i>vis-à-vis </i>the foregoing statutory and jurisprudential standards, accused-appellant can only be convicted of simple rape which is punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>The Court notes that while the trial court awarded moral damages, it did not award any civil indemnity which is mandatory upon the finding of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Civil indemnity is distinct from and should not be denominated as moral damages which are based on different jural foundations and assessed by the court in the exercise of sound discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Current case law fixes indemnity <i>ex delicto </i>in case of simple rape at P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Given the prevailing facts of this case, exemplary damages in each case of rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> pegged at P25,000.00 in line with controlling case law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and recently reiterated in <b><i>People v.
