Amora, and rebuttal witness Esteban Dagandan.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 7094, complainant testified that on September 8, 1990, she was asked by her mother Felipa Aca-ac to buy cooked fish (<i>inon-onan</i>) for dinner from a store in Barangay Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol. On her way home, she met accused-appellant, who held her by the hand and forced her to go with him to the vacant house of one Pinay Aguirre.&nbsp; Once inside, accused-appellant removed complainant's shorts and panty and made her lie down on the floor, which was covered with coconut leaves.&nbsp; Complainant claimed that accused-appellant fondled her breasts and licked her private parts.&nbsp; He then went on top of her and made "push and pull movements." When he was through, complainant said, accused-appellant withdrew his penis and white fluid came out.&nbsp; Complainant said she then wiped her private parts and put on her clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; She said she did not tell anyone what happened to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Algerico Lonio, a resident of Barangay Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol and a classmate of complainant, testified that at about 7:00 p.m. of September 8, 1990, he was at the house of one Emmie Blasco when he saw accused-appellant and complainant going inside the house of Pinay Aguirre, which was known in the neighborhood to be haunted.&nbsp; Out of curiosity, he said, he followed the two and peeped through the fence at the back. He saw accused-appellant undress complainant, go on top of her, and make "push and pull movements." Lonio said he knew that the two were having sexual intercourse, which lasted for about three minutes.&nbsp; He claimed he did not tell anyone what he saw for fear of his life.&nbsp; But, Lonio said, on February 27, 1991, he and complainant had a quarrel in school during which he asked complainant about the rape.&nbsp; According to Lonio, complainant admitted that accused-appellant had raped her and then left crying.&nbsp; Lonio later narrated the incident to complainant's mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <br><br>In Criminal Case No. 7091, complainant testified that at about 4:00 p.m. of September 22, 1990, after gathering some guavas in Barangay Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol, she passed by the house of accused-appellant on her way home.&nbsp; When accused-appellant saw her, he tried to lure her on the pretext that he had some papayas for her. Complainant got inside the house but, sensing that there was no papaya in the house, she immediately tried to leave. Accused-appellant, however, closed the door and brought her to his bedroom where he raped her. Accused-appellant threatened her with harm if she told anyone about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>In Criminal Case No. 7092, complainant testified that at about 4:30 p.m. of October 17, 1990, as she was gathering firewood in Barangay Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol, accused-appellant came and forced her to remove her shorts and panty.&nbsp; She was made to lie down on the ground covered with nipa leaves and was then raped by accused-appellant. Complainant went home after the incident, bringing with her the firewood she had gathered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8<br><br>]</sup> In Criminal Case No. 7093, complainant testified that at about 1:00 p.m. of January 12, 1991, as she was on her way home from the house of a certain Betty, she saw accused-appellant near the house of one Ned Reyes in Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol.&nbsp; Accused-appellant seized her and dragged her to a bush near the plantation and made her undress and lie down.&nbsp; Then he allegedly forced her to have sexual intercourse with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>Complainant's mother, Felipa Aca-ac, testified that accused-appellant is the cousin of her father-in-law, Faustino Aca-ac.&nbsp; She said that in the afternoon of February 27, 1991, she learned from Lonio that her daughter had been raped by accused-appellant.&nbsp; She said that when she confronted her daughter, the latter admitted that accused-appellant had raped her four times.&nbsp; According to her, the next day, February 28, 1991, she took Fritzie to Dr. Stella Maris J. Amora of the Governor Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital for medical examination.&nbsp; Felipa said that accused-appellant offered to pay P12,000.00 as settlement of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br>Dr. Amora testified that there was no laceration in the hymen of complainant.&nbsp; She said, however, that it was possible that there could be a penetration of a male organ up to the labia minora and the hymen would still be intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]<br><br></sup>&nbsp;The defense presented six witnesses, namely, accused-appellant Decoroso Aca-ac, Faustino Aca-ac, Felix Adorable, Rosalio Pamayloan, Petronia Aca-ac, and Alberto Cempron.<br><br>Accused-appellant Decoroso Aca-ac y Cespon, 57 years old at the time of the alleged rape incidents, denied the charges and claimed that Felipa Aca-ac had instigated complainant to file the charges because he told Felipa's husband that Felipa was having an affair with another man. He said the charges were trumped up by Felipa because she wanted to extort P30,000.00 from him.&nbsp; He also stated that he had a quarrel with Felipa's husband, Roberto, because the latter had stolen his chicken. Accused-appellant said he reported the matter to Barangay Captain Felix Adorable.&nbsp; He stated that Faustino Aca-ac tried to get the parties to settle the case, but he failed in his efforts.&nbsp; Accused-appellant alleged that at 57, he was already old and that he could no longer have an erection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br>Faustino Aca-ac, grandfather of complainant and a cousin of accused-appellant, testified that he did not believe accused-appellant committed the crime. He said accused-appellant and complainant's parents had a misunderstanding which he tried to settle unsuccessfully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>Felix Adorable, a former barangay captain of Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol and an incumbent barangay kagawad, confirmed accused-appellant's claim that he had filed a complaint against Roberto Aca-ac, complainant's father, with the Katarungang Pambarangay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <br><br>Rosalio Pamayloan was a neighbor of accused-appellant and a resident of Villalimpia, Loay, Bohol for 12 years.&nbsp; He testified that he had been a principal in a public school since 1983. He personally knew accused-appellant and vouched for the character of accused-appellant as a good man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <br><br>Petronia P. Aca-ac, wife of accused-appellant, testified that she and her husband had been married for 36 years and had six children, two of whom had died.&nbsp; On the four occasions on which it was alleged accused-appellant had raped complainant, Petronia said her husband was in their house helping her make "nipa shingles."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <br><br>On rebuttal, the prosecution presented Esteban Dagandan, who testified that complainant's mother, Felipa, worked as a nurse of his (Dagandan's) wife, because the latter had suffered a stroke.&nbsp; Dagandan disputed accused-appellant's claim that complainant and her mother had demanded P30,000.00 for the settlement of the case.&nbsp; He said that sometime in May 1992, Albert "Berting" Cempron, a nephew of accused-appellant, accompanied by his wife Lydia, thrice went to his (Dagandan's) house asking Felipa to withdraw the case against accused-appellant.&nbsp; Accused-appellant offered to pay Felipa P12,000.00 as settlement of the case, but the same was rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <br><br>Felipa Aca-ac was recalled to the stand.&nbsp; She denied Rosalio Pamayloan's testimony that she proposed a settlement of the case for P30,000.00 and that accused-appellant had no criminal record in their barangay.&nbsp; She said that she rejected Albert Cempron's P12,000.00 offer, made in behalf of accused-appellant, for the settlement of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <br><br>Complainant Fritzie Aca-ac was also recalled to the stand. She rebutted the testimony of accused-appellant that he could no longer have an erection.&nbsp; She said she saw accused-appellant insert his erect penis into her vulva.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br>On sur-rebuttal, Alberto A. Cempron, the barangay captain of Matin-aw, Carmen, Bohol, testified that he tried to bring the parties to an amicable settlement of their case because they are relatives and his wife is a cousin of complainant's father.&nbsp; However, he said he was unsuccessful as accused-appellant's wife was willing to pay only P12,000.00, but Felipa wanted P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On February 19, 1994, the trial court rendered a decision convicting accused-appellant of frustrated rape in Criminal Case No. 7094 and acquitting him of the charges in the rest of the cases.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, under Criminal Case No. 7094, the Court finds accused Decoroso Aca-ac y Cespon guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated rape and he is hereby sentenced to undergo an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from twelve (12) years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum, with all its accessory penalties, to indemnify the offended party Fritzie Aca-ac the sum of P30,000.00 as moral damages and another amount of P20,000.00 in the concept of exemplary damages.<br><br>As regards the three other above-entitled cases, Criminal Case Nos. 7091, 7092, &amp; 7093, all for rape, accused Decoroso Aca-ac y Cespon, alias Kokong, is hereby acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote> <br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that accused-appellant was guilty of consummated rape and accordingly sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><i>First.</i>&nbsp; In holding that the crime committed was frustrated rape, the trial court relied on the findings of Dr. Amora which showed that complainant did not have any lacerations in her hymen which in fact was intact.&nbsp; The trial court pointed out that there was no evidence of penetration into the vagina of complainant.<br><br>This is error. As this Court explained in <i>People v. Orita</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> rape is either attempted or consummated.&nbsp; There can be no frustrated rape. While the penultimate paragraph of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> prescribes death for attempted or frustrated rape, and a homicide committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the provision on frustrated rape is a "dead provision."&nbsp; This Court said in <i>Orita</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, in the crime of rape, from the moment the offender has carnal knowledge of his victim, he actually attains his purpose and, from that moment also all the essential elements of the offense have been accomplished.&nbsp; Nothing more is left to be done by the offender, because he has performed the last act necessary to produce the crime.&nbsp; Thus, the felony is consummated.&nbsp; In a long line of cases (People v. Oscar, 48 Phil. 527 (1925); People v. Hernandez, 49 Phil. 980 (1925); People v. Royeras, 56 SCRA 666 (1974); People v. Amores, 58 SCRA 505 (1974)), we have set the uniform rule that for the consummation of rape, perfect penetration is not essential. Any penetration of the female organ by the male organ is sufficient.&nbsp; Entry of the labia or lips of the female organ, without rupture of the hymen or laceration of the vagina, is sufficient to warrant conviction.&nbsp; Necessarily, rape is attempted if there is no penetration of the female organ (People v. Tayaba, 62 Phil. 559 (1935); People v. Rabadan and Olaybar, 53 Phil. 694 (1927); United States v. Garcia, 9 Phil. 434 (1907)) because not all acts of execution were performed.&nbsp; The offender merely commenced the commission of a felony directly by overt acts.&nbsp; Taking into account the nature, elements, and manner of execution of the crime of rape and jurisprudence on the matter, it is hardly conceivable how the frustrated stage in rape can ever be committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </blockquote><br>As the Court of Appeals noted, accused-appellant should be convicted of rape in its consummated stage and not merely for frustrated rape, since the entry of the male organ into the labia of the female organ alone is sufficient to constitute consummated rape.<br><br>For that matter, the mere touching of the labia or pudendum by the male organ is enough to consummate the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It is enough that there is a penetration, however slight, of the external genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Consequently, the fact that there was no laceration of complainant's private parts or that her hymen was intact, as testified to by Dr. Amora,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> does not preclude a finding of rape against accused-appellant. It bears emphasis that a broken hymen or laceration of any part of the female genital is not a pre-requisite for a conviction for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <br><br>Accused-appellant's claim that it was impossible for him, then 57 years old, to commit the crime of rape because he could no longer have an erection is self-serving.&nbsp; Age is not the criterion in determining sexual interest and potency.<br><br>The birth certificate (Exh. C) of complainant shows that she was born on April 9, 1979.&nbsp; Since complainant was then about 11 years old when she was raped by accused-appellant on September 8, 1990, the crime is statutory rape under Art. 335, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br><i>Second</i>. Accused-appellant contends that the way complainant narrated the lurid details of how she was allegedly raped is not the way an innocent child below 12 years of age testifies, but the way a woman, who is worldly and experienced in sex, will testify.&nbsp; Accused-appellant questions complainant's narration as he likens them to stories contained in pornographic magazines and movies.<br><br>The contention has no merit.&nbsp; Where an alleged rape victim says she was sexually abused, she says almost all that is necessary to show that rape had been inflicted on her person, provided&nbsp; her testimony meets the test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> For no woman would allow an examination of her private parts or go through the humiliation of a trial unless she has actually been so brutalized that she desires justice for her suffering.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;In this case, accused-appellant has not shown any reason for complainant's testimony not to be given credence.&nbsp; At the time she was raped, complainant was an 11 year-old Grade 5 student of Loay Central School in Loay, Bohol.&nbsp; After she was deflowered by accused-appellant, she was forced to silence by threats on her life.&nbsp; It was only on March 1, 1991 when she executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> before the police authorities narrating therein how she had been raped four times by accused-appellant.&nbsp; She told her story in open court.&nbsp; Complainant testified how she was raped on September 8, 1991, thus:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY.

NAMOCATCAT:<br><br>The witness is trying to say to enter the mouth of the vagina until the clitoris.&nbsp; This child is still very young to demonstrate the fact that the penetration was made up to the labia minora of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote> <br>Her consistent testimony despite intense and lengthy interrogation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> belies accused-appellant's claim that she was telling a tale culled from pornographic magazines or movies.&nbsp; Faced with complainant's testimony, accused-appellant could only offer the defense of denial.&nbsp; It is well-settled that denial cannot prevail over the positive identification and categorical testimony of complainant.&nbsp; The rule is that between the positive declarations of the prosecution witnesses and the negative statements of the accused, the former deserves more credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>That is why accused-appellant had to summon to his aid an alleged affidavit of desistance (Exh. 3) of complainant and her mother.&nbsp; But how could this bind complainant and her mother or prove anything when the so-called affidavit is unsigned?<br><br><i>Third</i>. Accused-appellant says complainant did not immediately report the incidents to the authorities nor tell the same to her mother.&nbsp; He claims that the cases were filed merely to extort money from him.<br><br>These claims have no basis.&nbsp; The fact that complainant did not immediately report the matter to the authorities was fully explained by the prosecution. Complainant was only 11 years old when the rape incidents took place.&nbsp; Young girls usually conceal for some time their defilement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Moreover, accused-appellant, being the cousin of her paternal grandfather, exercised moral ascendancy over complainant and even threatened her with death if she told anyone what he had done to her.<br><br>Nor is there any probable reason for complainant to allow herself to be used as a pawn of her mother Felipa to extort money from accused-appellant. Unless it can be shown that complainant was moved by ill will to falsely implicate accused-appellant, the inescapable conclusion is that her testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br><i>Fourth</i>. Accused-appellant doubts the veracity of Algerico Lonio's testimony that he had witnessed the rape of complainant on September 8, 1990.&nbsp; Accused-appellant points out that Lonio failed to report the incident to complainant's parents or to the authorities despite the fact that there was no threat to his life.&nbsp; Accused-appellant also points out certain improbabilities in the testimony of Lonio, to wit: that he peeped through the "back fence of the house" and saw accused-appellant raping complainant; that despite the fact that the supposed incident happened between 7:00 to 8:00 p.m., no mention was made of any form of illumination of the place; and that accused-appellant made "push and pull movements" when the medical findings show that complainant's hymen was intact, thereby proving that there could not have been any penetration by accused-appellant's organ.<br><br>These arguments have no merit.&nbsp; On cross-examination, Lonio said that he knew what would happen to complainant when accused-appellant took her to the empty house of Pinay Aguirre because his (Lonio's) own younger sister and the sister of complainant had been abused by accused-appellant before. He said he saw how accused-appellant violated complainant against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Answering questions of the trial court, Lonio categorically said:<br><br><blockquote>COURT: (TO WITNESS)<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that you followed the two, accused and the complainant, after they entered the gate of the house of Pinay Aguirre.&nbsp; Did accused Decoroso not close the gate after they gained entrance to the gate?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decoroso closed the gate.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it locked?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He just closed it without locking.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How far is the gate to the house of Pinay Aguirre?

It was evident that Lonio was telling the truth.&nbsp; He cried after narrating to the court how he told his mother about the incident.
