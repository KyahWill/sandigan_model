Respondent then did not renew the probationary status of petitioner as teacher for the school year 1996-97.<br><br>Petitioner appealed said decision to the Civil Service Commission.<br><br>On April 14, 1998, the Civil Service Commission issued a Resolution affirming the decision of respondent university's Board of Regent.<br><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On December 11, 1998, petitioner received the Resolution of the Civil Service Commission dated November 13, 1998 denying the motion for reconsideration of petitioner.<br><br>On December 28, 1998, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a Motion for Extension of Period to File Petition for Review asking for 15 days from December 28, 1998 or until January 12, 1999 to do so.<br><br>On January 12, 1999, petitioner filed her Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On February 17, 1999, petitioner through counsel received a copy of the Resolution dated January 28, 1999 issued by the Court of Appeals, Special Fifth Division, granting an extension of 15 days from December 26, 1998, or until January 10, 1999, to file the petition for review.&nbsp; The Resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote>"Acting on the motion filed by counsel for petitioner on December 28, 1998, the Court resolves to grant petitioner an extension of fifteen (15) days from December 26, 1998, or until January 10, 1999, within which to file petition for review."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>On March 10, 1999, counsel of petitioner received a copy of the Resolution dated February 24, 1999, issued by the Court of Appeals, Former Fourth Division, dismissing the petition for review.&nbsp; It reads:<br><br><blockquote>"CONSIDERING that the petition for review was filed on January 12, 1999 by registered mail, beyond the extended period which expired on January 10, 1999, the petition for review is hereby DISMISSED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On March 24, 1999, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On July 29, 1999, counsel of petitioner received a copy of the Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated July 22, 1999 denying the motion for reconsideration of petitioner.&nbsp; The Resolution states:<br><br><blockquote>"CONSIDERING that petitioner herself admits filing the petition at least one day late, the motion for reconsideration of Our dismissal is hereby DENIED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this petition wherein petitioner raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>WHETHER PETITIONER'S APPEAL WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS TIMELY PURSUANT TO SECTION 4, RULE 43 IN RELATION TO SECTION 1, RULE 22 OF THE 1997 REVISED RULES ON CIVIL PROCEDURE;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS' RESOLUTIONS DATED FEBRUARY 24, 1999 DISMISSING THE APPEAL AND THE RESOLUTION DATED JULY 22, 1999 DENYING RECONSIDERATION (ANNEXES "A-REVIEW" AND "B-REVIEW", <u>SUPRA</u>) -&nbsp; ARE IN ACCORD&nbsp; WITH THE AFORE-STATED RULES AND THE SUPREME COURT RULINGS OR ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE IN THE CASES OF "ASTA MOSKOWSKY VS.

Petitioner bewails the fact that she received the resolution embodying said grant only on February 17, 1999.&nbsp; By that time, she had already filed her petition on January 12, 1999, having reckoned the extended period from December 28, 1998, as she had prayed for in her motion for extension.<br><br>In disputing the dismissal of her petition, petitioner insists that the 15-day extension was timely sought since December 28, 1998, a Monday should be considered as the fifteenth day of filing her appeal, not December 26, 1998, which was a Saturday. In support of her claim, petitioner relies on Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court that provides:<br><br><blockquote>"In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day</u></b>." (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner also contends that assuming that January 10, 1999, a Sunday, was the last day of the extension period, petitioner asserts that January 11, 1999, a Monday, should be considered as the last day of filing the petition based on the just quoted "law for pretemission of holidays". Hence, petitioner submits that the delay is only one (1) day, a delay that is allegedly excusable due to a mistake in good faith and without any intention to delay, because the petition was filed the following day therefrom or on January 12, 1999.<br><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>Based on Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court and as applied in several cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> where the last day for doing any act required or permitted by law falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, petitioner still had until December 28, 1998, a Monday and the next business day to move for a 15-day extension considering that December 26, 1998, the last day for petitioner to file her petition for review fell on a Saturday.&nbsp; The motion for extension filed on December 28, 1998 was thus filed on time since it was filed before the expiration of the time sought to be extended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The next issue to resolve then is when should the 15-day extension be reckoned, should it be counted from December 26, 1998 or December 28, 1998?<br><br>As a rule, the extension should be tacked to the original period and commence immediately after the expiration of such period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, in <i>Moskowsky vs. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <i>Vda. De Capulong vs. Workmen's Insurance Co., Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we allowed the extended period to commence from the specific time prayed for in the motion for extension. In this case, petitioner specifically manifested that she be granted an extension of 15 days from December 28, 1998 or until January 12, 1999 for her to file her petition for review.&nbsp; Hence, the period for reckoning the commencement of the additional 15 days should have been from December 28, 1998, and not December 26, 1998.&nbsp; Thus, the petition filed by petitioner with the Court of Appeals on January 12, 1998, exactly 15 days from December 28, 1998, was filed on time.<br><br>The underpinning consideration in <i>Moskowski, Vda. de Capulong</i> and in the case at bar, is the liberal interpretation of the Rules to achieve substantial justice. Petitioner would be outright denied her right to appeal if the original period of December 26, 1998 would be the basis of the 15-day extension period.&nbsp; While the right to appeal is a statutory, not a natural right, nonetheless "it is an essential part of our judicial system and courts should proceed with caution so as not to deprive a party of the right to appeal, but rather, ensure that every party-litigant has the amplest opportunity for the proper and just disposition of his cause, freed from the constraints of technicalities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The unfairness of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider the fact that petitioner received notice that the extension was to be counted from the original period and not from the date that she had prayed for, a month after she had already filed her petition.&nbsp; The equitable solution in the case at bar, as amply supported by jurisprudence, is to thus base the extension from the period requested by petitioner.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the case is hereby REMANDED to the appellate court for further proceedings.
