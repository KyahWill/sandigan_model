In its Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> filed on June 8, 1989, the petitioner contended that the High Court of Malaya acquired jurisdiction over the person of private respondent by its voluntary submission to the court's jurisdiction through its appointed counsel, Mr. Khay Chay Tee. Furthermore, private respondent's counsel waived any and all objections to the High Court's jurisdiction in a pleading filed before the court.<br><br>In due time, the trial court rendered its Decision dated October 14, 1991 dismissing petitioner's complaint. Petitioner interposed an appeal with the Court of Appeals, but the appellate court dismissed the same and affirmed the decision of the trial court in a Decision dated May 19, 1993.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition which is anchored on two (2) assigned errors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br><b>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE&nbsp; MALAYSIAN COURT DID NOT ACQUIRE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER PNCC, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT (a) THE FOREIGN COURT HAD SERVED SUMMONS ON PNCC AT ITS MALAYSIA OFFICE, AND (b) PNCC ITSELF APPEARED BY COUNSEL IN THE CASE BEFORE THAT COURT.</b><br><br><center>II<br></center><br><b>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DENYING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT TO (SIC) THE MALAYSIAN COURT JUDGMENT.</b><br></blockquote>Generally, in the absence of a special compact, no sovereign is bound to give effect within its dominion to a judgment rendered by a tribunal of another country;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> however, the rules of comity, utility and convenience of nations have established a usage among civilized states by which final judgments of foreign courts of competent jurisdiction are reciprocally respected and rendered efficacious under certain conditions that may vary in different countries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In this jurisdiction, a valid judgment rendered by a foreign tribunal may be recognized insofar as the immediate parties and the underlying cause of action are concerned so long as it is convincingly shown that there has been an opportunity for a full and fair hearing before a court of competent jurisdiction; that the trial upon regular proceedings has been conducted, following due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant and under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice; and that there is nothing to indicate either a prejudice in court and in the system of laws under which it is sitting or fraud in procuring the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>A foreign judgment is presumed to be valid and binding in the country from which it comes, until a contrary showing, on the basis of a presumption of regularity of proceedings and the giving of due notice in the foreign forum. Under Section 50(b),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court, which was the governing law at the time the instant case was decided by the trial court and respondent appellate court, a judgment, against a person, of a tribunal of a foreign country having jurisdiction to pronounce the same is presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties and their successors in interest by a subsequent title. The judgment may, however, be assailed by evidence of want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact. In addition, under Section 3(n), Rule 131 of the Revised Rules of Court, a court, whether in the Philippines or elsewhere, enjoys the presumption that it was acting in the lawful exercise of its jurisdiction. Hence, once the authenticity of the foreign judgment is proved, the party attacking a foreign judgment, is tasked with the burden of overcoming its presumptive validity.<br><br>In the instant case, petitioner sufficiently established the existence of the money judgment of the High Court of Malaya by the evidence it offered.

authenticity of the foreign judgment, said foreign judgment enjoys presumptive validity and the burden then fell upon the party who disputes its validity, herein private respondent, to prove otherwise.<br><br>Private respondent failed to sufficiently discharge the burden that fell upon it - to prove by clear and convincing evidence the grounds which it relied upon to prevent enforcement of the Malaysian High Court judgment, namely, (a) that jurisdiction was not acquired by the Malaysian Court over the person of private respondent due to alleged improper service of summons upon private respondent and the alleged lack of authority of its counsel to appear and represent private respondent in the suit; (b) the foreign judgment is allegedly tainted by evident collusion, fraud and clear mistake of fact or law; and (c) not only were the requisites for enforcement or recognition allegedly not complied with but also that the Malaysian judgment is allegedly contrary to the Constitutional prescription that the "every decision must state the facts and law on which it is based."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Private respondent relied solely on the testimony of its two (2) witnesses, namely, Mr. Alfredo N. Calupitan, an accountant of private respondent, and Virginia Abelardo, Executive Secretary and a member of the staff of the Corporate Secretariat Section of the Corporate Legal Division, of private respondent, both of whom failed to shed light and amplify its defense or claim for non-enforcement of the foreign judgment against it.<br><br>Mr. Calupitan's testimony centered on the following: that from January to December 1982 he was assigned in Malaysia as Project Comptroller of the Pahang Project Package A and B for road construction under the joint venture of private respondent and Asiavest Holdings;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that under the joint venture, Asiavest Holdings would handle the financial aspect of the project, which is fifty-one percent (51%) while private respondent would handle the technical aspect of the project, or forty-nine percent (49%);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and, that Cora Deala was not authorized to receive summons for and in behalf of the private respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Ms. Abelardo's testimony, on the other hand, focused on the following: that there was no board resolution authorizing Allen and Gledhill to admit all the claims of petitioner in the suit brought before the High Court of Malaya,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> though on cross-examination she admitted that Allen and Gledhill were the retained lawyers of private respondent in Malaysia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The foregoing reasons or grounds relied upon by private respondent in preventing enforcement and recognition of the Malaysian judgment primarily refer to matters of remedy and procedure taken by the Malaysian High Court relative to the suit for collection initiated by petitioner. Needless to stress, the recognition to be accorded a foreign judgment is not necessarily affected by the fact that the procedure in the courts of the country in which such judgment was rendered differs from that of the courts of the country in which the judgment is relied on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Ultimately, matters of remedy and procedure such as those relating to the service of summons or court process upon the defendant, the authority of counsel to appear and represent a defendant and the formal requirements in a decision are governed by the <i>lex fori</i> or the internal law of the forum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <i>i.e</i>., the law of Malaysia in this case.<br><br>In this case, it is the procedural law of Malaysia where the judgment was rendered that determines the validity of the service of court process on private respondent as well as other matters raised by it. As to what the Malaysian procedural law is, remains a question of fact, not of law. It may not be taken judicial notice of and must be pleaded and proved like any other fact. Sections 24 and 25 of Rule 132 of the Revised Rules of Court provide that it may be evidenced by an official publication or by a duly attested or authenticated copy thereof. It was then incumbent upon private respondent to present evidence as to what that Malaysian procedural law is and to show that under it, the assailed service of summons upon a financial officer of a corporation, as alleged by it, is invalid. It did not. Accordingly, the presumption of validity and regularity of service of summons and the decision thereafter rendered by the High Court of Malaya must stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On the matter of alleged lack of authority of the law firm of Allen and Gledhill to represent private respondent, not only did the private respondent's witnesses admit that the said law firm of Allen and Gledhill were its counsels in its transactions in Malaysia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> but of greater significance is the fact that petitioner offered in evidence relevant Malaysian jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> to the effect that (a) it is not necessary under Malaysian law for counsel appearing before the Malaysian High Court to submit a special power of attorney authorizing him to represent a client before said court, (b) that counsel appearing before the Malaysian High Court has full authority to compromise the suit, and (c) that counsel appearing before the Malaysian High Court need not comply with certain pre-requisites as required under Philippine law to appear and compromise judgments on behalf of their clients before said court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, there is no basis for or truth to the appellate court's conclusion that the conditional appearance of private respondent's counsel who was allegedly not authorized to appear and represent, cannot be considered as voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Malaya, inasmuch as said conditional appearance was not premised on the alleged lack of authority of said counsel but the conditional appearance was entered to question the regularity of the service of the writ of summons. Such conditional appearance was in fact subsequently withdrawn when counsel realized that the writ was properly served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the ground that collusion, fraud and clear mistake of fact and law tainted the judgment of the High Court of Malaya, no clear evidence of the same was adduced or shown. The facts which the trial court found "intriguing" amounted to mere conjectures and specious observations. The trial court's finding on the absence of judgment against Asiavest-CDCP Sdn. Bhd. is contradicted by evidence on record that recovery was also sought against Asiavest-CDCP Sdn. Bhd. but the same was found insolvent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Furthermore, even when the foreign judgment is based on the drafts prepared by counsel for the successful party, such is not <i>per se</i> indicative of collusion or fraud. Fraud to hinder the enforcement within the jurisdiction of a foreign judgment must be extrinsic, <i>i.e</i>., fraud based on facts not controverted or resolved in the case where judgment is rendered,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> or that which would go to the jurisdiction of the court or would deprive the party against whom judgment is rendered a chance to defend the action to which he has a meritorious defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Intrinsic fraud is one which goes to the very existence of the cause of action is deemed already adjudged, and it, therefore, cannot militate against the recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Evidence is wanting on the alleged extrinsic fraud. Hence, such unsubstantiated allegation cannot give rise to liability therein.<br><br>Lastly, there is no merit to the argument that the foreign judgment is not enforceable in view of the absence of any statement of facts and law upon which the award in favor of the petitioner was based. As aforestated, the <i>lex fori</i> or the internal law of the forum governs matters of remedy and procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Considering that under the procedural rules of the High Court of Malaya, a valid judgment may be rendered even without stating in the judgment every fact and law upon which the judgment is based, then the same must be accorded respect and the courts in this jurisdiction cannot invalidate the judgment of the foreign court simply because our rules provide otherwise.<br><br>All in all, private respondent had the ultimate duty to demonstrate the alleged invalidity of such foreign judgment, being the party challenging the judgment rendered by the High Court of Malaya. But instead of doing so, private respondent merely argued, to which the trial court agreed, that the burden lay upon petitioner to prove the validity of the money judgment.
