Ricaforte was brought to accused Alba who asked him if he was one of Acevedo's goons.&nbsp; Ricaforte answered in the negative and was then brought to accused Rembulat and Gortayo, both of whom were also carrying firearms. At this point, Rembulat and Gortayo started firing repeatedly at the hut<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> where Acevedo was staying.

The concept of "proof beyond reasonable doubt" does not entail absolute certainty of the fact that the accused committed the crime, and neither does it exclude the possibility of error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Only moral certainty is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the cases at bar, the quantum of proof beyond reasonable doubt was met.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Villablanca</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we held that the testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a conviction where it is both positive and credible.&nbsp; How much more in this situation where two prosecution witnesses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> gave unflinching and reliable testimonies against accused appellants?&nbsp; Witnesses are weighed and not numbered.&nbsp; With this in mind, we sustain the convictions and discuss accused-appellants' individual culpabilities <i>in</i> <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br>Francisco Alovera and Ronnie Gonzaga were categorically identified by prosecution witness Magcope.&nbsp; The latter testified that the accused-appellants both shot and fired at the tower where Acevedo took refuge.&nbsp; These are specific and overt acts that leave no doubt as to their guilt in the crime of murder.<br><br>We agree with the trial court that <b>Adriano Gortayo's</b> cuplability is indisputable.&nbsp; We adopt the trial court's reasoning, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"Considering the testimony of Ricaforte that Gortayo was the only person who fired from Gate No. 1 (TSN, January 25, 1991, p. 23) no other conclusion can be drawn except that it was Gortayo who shot and hit the victim (<b><i>underscoring ours</i></b>). Moreover, proof as to who among the armed men that fired at the tower actually killed the victim is not necessary should the presence of conspiracy be established.&nbsp; Where conspiracy is proven, the act of one is the act of all (People vs. M/Sgt. Reynaldo Landicho, et. al., G. R. No. 116600, July 3, 1996)."</blockquote></blockquote><br>Agueda T. Alba and Saturnino Rembulat, Jr. are likewise guilty of the crime charged.&nbsp; True, they did not actually fire upon Acevedo.&nbsp; Still, their participation in the conspiracy to murder him is apparent. <b>First</b>, they were conspicuously present during the commission of the crime, in such a way that they could not be considered as innocent bystanders.&nbsp; <b>Second</b>, they arrived and left the scene of the crime with the other accused-appellants.&nbsp; <b>Third</b>, they did nothing to prevent or stop the successive shooting of the tower, where they knew Acevedo was hiding.&nbsp; <b>Fourth</b>, Alba had a motive to kill Acevedo on account of the dispute over the fishpond which has become more bitter through the years. We agree with the trial court:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"Accused Alba would have easily dissuaded her son-in-law, Gortayo from firing his gun if the former has also no intention of inflicting harm on Engr. Acevedo.&nbsp; On the contrary, the Court cannot simply disregard the fact that on account of the raging fishpond controversy between accused Alba and the victim, the former was determined to eliminate Engr. Acevedo in order to retake actually possession of the disputed fishpond.&nbsp; Presumably, she was able to attain her purpose."</blockquote></blockquote><br>In <b>People v. Taliman</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we held that coupled with enough circumstantial evidence, motive may be sufficient to support a conviction.&nbsp; Motive was clearly established in this case.<br><br>Furthermore, we note that Alba and Gortayo were not immediately apprehended even after a warrant was issued for their arrest.&nbsp; They tried to flee.&nbsp; Flight indicates guilt.&nbsp; Accused-appellants' act of not confronting their accuser goes against the principle that the first impulse of an innocent man when accused with wrongdoing is to express his innocence at the first opportune time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><i>Alibi</i> and denial, which are the defenses interposed by accused-appellants, are the weakest of all defenses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and must fail given the straightforward, candid and positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Besides, the rule is that the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses is entitled to great respect.&nbsp; The court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor and deportment on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In fact, the trial court noted the deportment of the prosecution witnesses and hailed their manner of testifying as "straightforward...devoid of any embellishment or exaggerations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Anent the trial court's decision, "The reliability and veracity of their (prosecution witnesses') testimonies cannot be suspect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Attempted Murder<br></div><br>Given that there was a conspiracy, we likewise find all accused-appellants guilty of the crime of attempted murder. Magcope testified that he witnessed Acevedo being fired at.&nbsp; At this point, accused-appellants Gonzaga and Alovera started shooting at him with their armalites.&nbsp; The only reason why he was not injured was because he was able to jump out of the irrigation canal and was able to crawl towards the fishpond dike where he hid himself during the firing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<br><br>Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"Art. 6. <i>Consummated, frustrated and attempted felonies.- </i>x x x There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance."</blockquote></blockquote><br>Clearly, there was an attempt to murder Magcope, a plan that would have been carried out if it weren't for Magcope's timely dodging of the shots fired at him.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Penalties Imposed<br></div><br>At the time of the commission of the offense of murder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the penalty imposable under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code was <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance that attended the murder, the proper imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Article 51 of the Revised Penal Code provides that "A penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by law for the consummated felony shall be imposed upon the principals in an attempt to commit the felony."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Damages Awarded<br></div><br>The records are bereft of any receipt or voucher to justify the trial court's award of actual damages for funeral and burial expenses.&nbsp; Hence, we delete the same.&nbsp; Every pecuniary loss must be established by credible evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>An award of moral damages in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) to the heirs of Acevedo is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moral damages are also awarded taking into consideration the pain and anguish of the victim's family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Civil indemnity awarded for wrongful death in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) is in line with current jurisprudence.&nbsp; This can be awarded without need of proof other that the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Fallo<br></div><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Kalibo, Aklan, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> with <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODIFICATION</span>.<br><br>Accused-appellants Agueda T.
