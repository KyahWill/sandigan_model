				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The case is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Dumaguete City, Branch 44, finding accused Jerson Acojedo y Emia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, and sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Joel Garde in the sum of P50,000.00.<br><br>On September 28, 1993, 3<sup>rd</sup> assistant provincial prosecutor of Negros Oriental Romeo T. Katada filed with the Regional Trial Court, Dumaguete City an information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> charging accused Jerson Acojedo y Emia with murder, reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"That at about one o'clock in the early dawn of May 4, 1993, at sitio Balansini, Barangay Humay-humay, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with intent to kill and by means of treachery and evident premeditation did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and stab with the use of a sharp bladed weapon, one Joel Garde, inflicting on the victim the following injuries, to wit:<br><br>"1. Wound, stabbed, right back, at the para-vertebral line at the level of the mid-scapular area - T &amp; T;<br><br>Entrance: wound, stabbed, 1 ½ inch long by ½ inch width penetrating the chest including the other vital organs;<br><br>Exit: ½ inch long by 1/3 inch width, front medial to right areola;<br><br>"2. Wound, stabbed, right back upper scapula, 1 inch long by 3/6 inch width, superficial;<br><br>"which injuries caused the death of the victim soon thereafter.<br><br>"Contrary to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>"Dumaguete City, Philippines, September 22, 1993."<br></blockquote>On January 27, 1994, the trial court arraigned the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> He pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial ensued.<br><br>In the evening of May 3, 1994, there was a dance in sitio Balansini, Barangay Humay-humay, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental to culminate its fiesta celebration. Joel Garde, together with his wife Mary Garde and son Joel Garde, Jr., attended the dance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At around one o'clock dawn of May 4, 1993, Joel went out of the dance hall to urinate in a nearby area, about five (5) meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Mary, who was near Joel because she was asking him to go home already, saw the accused Jerson Acojedo following him from the dance floor to the place where he urinated. While Joel was urinating, Jerson stabbed him twice at the back with a hunting knife. Joel fell to the ground. When Mary shouted for help, Jerson ran away. The two stab wounds caused Joel's instantaneous death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Mary had known accused Jerson for a long time because they lived in adjoining barangays. She positively identified Jerson as her husband's assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Mary also testified that on April 8, 1993, her husband and Jerson had an altercation regarding money Joel had in his possession belonging to somebody else that Jerson wanted to collect. Joel refused to give the money to Jerson. This infuriated Jerson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The prosecution presented Dr. Fe L. Mercado, physician at the Guihulngan District Hospital, who conducted a post mortem examination on the body of Joel Garde. As per Medico Legal Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the victim sustained one penetrating wound and one superficial wound at the back. The first one was fatal, which caused his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accused Jerson, who lived in Barangay Planas, adjoining barangay of Humay-humay, put up the defense of denial and <i>alibi</i>. He claimed that he had been plowing his farm the whole day of May 3, 1993, and retired early in the evening to prepare for the next day's toil. He never left his house after he ate supper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> His mother, Dalia Acojedo, corroborated his testimony and testified that she saw her son, accused Jerson, fast asleep in their house in the middle of the night the incident took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Accused Jerson relies heavily on the affidavit of desistance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> executed by Mary Garde, wife of the victim. The affidavit stated that Mary Garde was no longer interested in pursuing the case against accused Jerson because she was not certain as to the identity of her husband's assailant. The barangay captain of Humay-humay, Dorie Talledo, testified that Mary Garde failed to appear in court despite subpoena several times on account of her uncertainty as to accused Jerson's identity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>After due trial, on March 26, 1999, the trial court promulgated a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused JERSON ACOJEDO is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and the Court hereby imposes upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Accused shall indemnify the heirs of the victim, Joel Garde in the sum of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).<br><br>"SO ORDERED.<br><br>"GIVEN this 16<sup>th</sup> day of March, 1999 in the City of Dumaguete, Philippines.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">"(Sgd.) ALVIN L. TAN<br>"Judge"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></div></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In his brief, accused-appellant claims that the trial court erred in giving full weight and credence to the testimony of prosecution witnesses and in disregarding his defense of denial and <i>alibi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>We find the appeal without merit.<br><br>Findings of facts of the trial court are generally accorded weight and are not disturbed on appeal unless substantial facts had been overlooked which, if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the lower court found the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses credible and straightforward. They positively identified accused-appellant Jerson Acojedo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In an attempt to discredit prosecution witness Mary Garde, the defense presented her as a hostile witness. Mary Garde's testimony as a hostile witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> only served to bolster the prosecution's evidence, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q:</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Mrs. Garde, this affidavit the thumbmark of which has been identified by you is written in English, can you tell us what is your educational attainment?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A:</td> <td><div align="justify">I have not gone to school.

Accused-appellant Jerson testified that it would take two (2) hours to walk from his place to where the dance was held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> His mother, on the other hand, testified that it would take only thirty (30) minutes to go to barangay Humay-humay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The testimony of defense witness Dorie Talledo, barangay captain of Humay-humay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> has been discredited inasmuch as it was established that she is the aunt of accused-appellant Jerson Acojedo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Relationship <i>per se</i> does not affect the credibility of a witness. However, in the case at bar, Dorie Talledo's relationship with accused-appellant, taken together with the self-serving and conflicting testimonies of accused-appellant and his mother, assumes importance. "Indeed, blood relatives tend to be naturally protective of each other and are not above giving false testimonies in favor of one another, especially a relative in danger of being convicted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Lastly, we agree with the trial court that treachery attended the commission of the crime. There is overwhelming evidence to show that the victim, Joel Garde, was totally unaware of the attack and was defenseless when he was stabbed at the back.
