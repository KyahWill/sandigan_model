				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A contract of sale is not invalidated by the fact that it is subject to probate court approval. The transaction remains binding on the seller-heir, but not on the other heirs who have not given their consent to it. In settling the estate of the deceased, a probate court has jurisdiction over matters incidental and collateral to the exercise of its recognized powers. Such matters include selling, mortgaging or otherwise encumbering realty belonging to the estate. Rule 89, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, deals with the conveyance of real property contracted by the decedent while still alive. In contrast with Sections 2 and 4 of the same Rule, the said provision does not limit to the executor or administrator the right to file the application for authority to sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber realty under administration. The standing to pursue such course of action before the probate court inures to any person who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment or to be entitled to the avails of the suit.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated April 16, 1999 and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 12, 2000, both promulgated by the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CV No. 49491.

Lina as the new [a]dministrator of the Intestate Estate of Remedios R. Sandejas in this proceedings. (Record, SP. Proc. No. R-83-15601, pp. 288-290)<br><br>"On August 28, 1986, heirs Sixto, Roberto, Antonio and Benjamin, all surnamed Sandejas, and heirs [sic] filed a [M]otion for [R]econsideration and the appointment of another administrator Mr. Sixto Sandejas, in lieu of [I]ntervenor Alex A. Lina stating among others that it [was] only lately that Mr. Sixto Sandejas, a son and heir, expressed his willingness to act as a new administrator of the intestate estate of his mother, Remedios R. Sandejas (Record, SP. Proc. No. 85-33707, pp. 29-31). On October 2, 1986, Intervenor Alex A. Lina filed his [M]anifestation and [C]ounter [M]otion alleging that he ha[d] no objection to the appointment of Sixto Sandejas as [a]dministrator of the [i]ntestate [e]state of his mother Remedios R. Sandejas (Sp. Proc. No. 85-15601), provided that Sixto Sandejas be also appointed as administrator of the [i]ntestate [e]state of his father, Eliodoro P. Sandejas, Sr. (Spec. Proc. No. 85-33707), which two (2) cases have been consolidated (Record, SP. Proc. No. 85-33707, pp. 34-36). On March 30, 1987, the lower court granted the said [M]otion and substituted Alex Lina with Sixto Sandejas as petitioner in the said [P]etitions (Record, SP. Proc. No. 85-33707, p.52). After the payment of the administrator's bond (Record, SP. Proc. No. 83-15601, pp. 348-349) and approval thereof by the court (Record, SP. Proc. No. 83-15601, p. 361), Administrator Sixto Sandejas on January 16, 1989 took his oath as administrator of the estate of the deceased Remedios R. Sandejas and Eliodoro P. Sandejas (Record, SP. Proc. No. 83-15601, p. 367) and was likewise issued Letters of Administration on the same day (Record, SP. Proc. No. 83-15601, p. 366).<br><br>"On November 29, 1993, Intervenor filed [an] Omnibus Motion (a) to approve the deed of conditional sale executed between Plaintiff-in-Intervention Alex A.

No. 83-15601, pp. 554-561) to which the administrator filed a [M]otion to [D]ismiss and/or [O]pposition to said omnibus motion on December 13, 1993 (Record, SP. Proc. No. 83-15601, pp. 591-603).<br><br>"On January 13, 1995, the lower court rendered the questioned order granting intervenor's [M]otion for the [A]pproval of the Receipt of Earnest Money with promise to buy between Plaintiff-in-Intervention Alex A.

No. 83-15601, pp. 652-654). x x x."</blockquote>The Order of the intestate court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, [i]ntervenor's motion for the approval of the Receipt Of Earnest Money With Promise To Sell And To Buy dated June 7, 1982, is granted. The [i]ntervenor is directed to pay the balance of the purchase price amounting to P729,000.00 within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Order and the Administrator is directed to execute within thirty (30) days thereafter the necessary and proper deeds of conveyancing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b></center><br>Overturning the RTC ruling, the CA held that the contract between Eliodoro Sandejas Sr. and respondent was merely a contract to sell, not a perfected contract of sale. It ruled that the ownership of the four lots was to remain in the intestate estate of Remedios Sandejas until the approval of the sale was obtained from the settlement court. That approval was a positive suspensive condition, the nonfulfillment of which was not tantamount to a breach. It was simply an event that prevented the obligation from maturing or becoming effective. If the condition did not happen, the obligation would not arise or come into existence.<br><br>The CA held that Section 1, Rule 89<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the Rules of Court was inapplicable, because the lack of written notice to the other heirs showed the lack of consent of those heirs other than Eliodoro Sandejas Sr. For this reason, bad faith was imputed to him, for no one is allowed to enjoy a claim arising from one's own wrongdoing. Thus, Eliodoro Sr. was bound, as a matter of justice and good faith, to comply with his contractual commitments as an owner and heir. When he entered into the agreement with respondent, he bound his conjugal and successional shares in the property.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b></center><br>In their Memorandum, petitioners submit the following issues for our resolution:<br><blockquote>"a) Whether or not Eliodoro P. Sandejas Sr. is legally obligated to convey title to the property referred to in the subject document which was found to be in the nature of a contract to sell - where the suspensive condition set forth therein [i.e.] court approval, was not complied with;<br><br>"b) Whether or not Eliodoro P. Sandejas Sr. was guilty of bad faith despite the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the respondent [bore] the burden of proving that a motion for authority to sell ha[d] been filed in court;<br><br>"c) Whether or not the undivided shares of Eliodoro P. Sandejas Sr. in the subject property is three-fifth (3/5) and the administrator of the latter should execute deeds of conveyance therefor within thirty days from receipt of the balance of the purchase price from the respondent; and<br><br>"d) Whether or not the respondent's petition-in-intervention was converted to a money claim and whether the [trial court] acting as a probate court could approve the sale and compel the petitioners to execute [a] deed of conveyance even for the share alone of Eliodoro P. Sandejas Sr."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>In brief, the Petition poses the main issue of whether the CA erred in modifying the trial court's Decision and in obligating petitioners to sell 3/5 of the disputed properties to respondent, even if the suspensive condition had not been fulfilled. It also raises the following collateral issues: (1) the settlement court's jurisdiction; (2) respondent-intervenor's standing to file an application for the approval of the sale of realty in the settlement case, (3) the decedent's bad faith, and (4) the computation of the decedent's share in the realty under administration.<br><br><center><b><u>This Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The Petition is partially meritorious.<br><br><b><u><center>Main Issue:<br><i>Obligation With a Suspensive Condition</i></center></u></b><br>Petitioners argue that the CA erred in ordering the conveyance of the disputed 3/5 of the parcels of land, despite the nonfulfillment of the suspensive condition -- court approval of the sale -- as contained in the "Receipt of Earnest Money with Promise to Sell and to Buy<i>" </i>(also referred to as the "Receipt<i>"</i>). Instead, they assert that because this condition had not been satisfied, their obligation to deliver the disputed parcels of land was converted into a money claim.<br><br>We disagree. Petitioners admit that the agreement between the deceased Eliodoro Sandejas Sr. and respondent was a contract to sell. Not exactly. In a contract to sell, the payment of the purchase price is a positive suspensive condition. The vendor's obligation to convey the title does not become effective in case of failure to pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the agreement between Eliodoro Sr. and respondent is subject to a suspensive condition -- the procurement of a court approval, not full payment. There was no reservation of ownership in the agreement. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Receipt, petitioners were supposed to deed the disputed lots over to respondent. This they could do upon the court's approval, even before full payment. Hence, their contract was a conditional sale, rather than a contract to sell as determined by the CA.<br><br>When a contract is subject to a suspensive condition, its birth or effectivity can take place only if and when the condition happens or is fulfilled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, the intestate court's grant of the Motion for Approval of the sale filed by respondent resulted in petitioners' obligation to execute the Deed of Sale of the disputed lots in his favor. The condition having been satisfied, the contract was perfected. Henceforth, the parties were bound to fulfill what they had expressly agreed upon.<br><br>Court approval is required in any disposition of the decedent's estate per Rule 89 of the Rules of Court. Reference to judicial approval, however, cannot adversely affect the substantive rights of heirs to dispose of their own <i>pro indiviso</i> shares in the co-heirship or co-ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In other words, they can sell their rights, interests or participation in the property under administration. A stipulation requiring court approval does not affect the validity and the effectivity of the sale as regards the selling heirs. It merely implies that the property may be taken out of <i>custodia legis,</i> but only with the court's permission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It would seem that the suspensive condition in the present conditional sale was imposed only for this reason.<br><br>Thus, we are not persuaded by petitioners' argument that the obligation was converted into a mere monetary claim. Paragraph 4 of the Receipt,<i> </i>which petitioners rely on,<i> </i>refers to a situation wherein the sale has not materialized. In such a case, the seller is bound to return to the buyer the earnest money paid plus interest at fourteen percent per annum. But the sale was approved by the intestate court; hence, the <i>proviso</i> does not apply.<br><br>Because petitioners did not consent to the sale of their ideal shares in the disputed lots, the CA correctly limited the scope of the Receipt<i> </i>to the <i>pro-indiviso</i> share of Eliodoro Sr. Thus, it correctly modified the intestate court's ruling by excluding their shares from the ambit of the transaction.<br><br><center><b><u>First Collateral Issue:<br><i>Jurisdiction of Settlement Court</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioners also fault the CA Decision by arguing, <i>inter alia, </i>(a) jurisdiction over ordinary civil action seeking not merely to enforce a sale but to compel performance of a contract falls upon a civil court, not upon an intestate court; and (b) that Section 8 of Rule 89 allows the executor or administrator, and no one else, to file an application for approval of a sale of the property under administration.<br><br>Citing <i>Gil v. Cancio</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><i> </i>and <i>Acebedo v. Abesamis,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><i> </i>petitioners contend that the CA erred in clothing the settlement court with the jurisdiction to approve the sale and to compel petitioners to execute the Deed of Sale. They allege factual differences between these cases and the instant case, as follows: in <i>Gil, </i>the sale of the realty in administration was a clear and an unequivocal agreement for the support of the widow and the adopted child of the decedent; and in <i>Acebedo, </i>a clear sale had been made, and all the heirs consented to the disposition of their shares in the realty in administration.<br><br>We are not persuaded. We hold that Section 8 of Rule 89 allows this action to proceed. The factual differences alleged by petitioners have no bearing on the intestate court's jurisdiction over the approval of the subject conditional sale. Probate jurisdiction covers all matters relating to the settlement of estates (Rules 74 &amp; 86-91) and the probate of wills (Rules 75-77) of deceased persons, including the appointment and the removal of administrators and executors (Rules 78-85). It also extends to matters incidental and collateral to the exercise of a probate court's recognized powers such as selling, mortgaging or otherwise encumbering realty belonging to the estate. Indeed, the rules on this point are intended to settle the estate in a speedy manner, so that the benefits that may flow from such settlement may be immediately enjoyed by the heirs and the beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Motion for Approval was meant to settle the decedent's obligation to respondent; hence, that obligation clearly falls under the jurisdiction of the settlement court. To require respondent to file a separate action -- on whether petitioners should convey the title to Eliodoro Sr.'s share of the disputed realty -- will unnecessarily prolong the settlement of the intestate estates of the deceased spouses.<br><br>The suspensive condition did not reduce the conditional sale between Eliodoro Sr. and respondent to one that was "not a definite, clear and absolute document of sale," as contended by petitioners. Upon the occurrence of the condition, the conditional sale became a reciprocally demandable obligation that is binding upon the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> That <i>Acebedo </i>also involved a conditional sale of real property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> proves that the existence of the suspensive condition did not remove that property from the jurisdiction of the intestate court.<br><br><center><b><u>Second Collateral Issue:<br><i>Intervenor's Standing </i></u></b></center><br>Petitioners contend that under said Rule 89, only the executor or administrator is authorized to apply for the approval of a sale of realty under administration. Hence, the settlement court allegedly erred in entertaining and granting respondent's Motion for Approval.<br><br>We read no such limitation. Section 8, Rule 89 of the Rules of Court, provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 8. <i>When court may authorize conveyance of realty which deceased contracted to convey. Notice. Effect of deed.--</i>Where the deceased was in his lifetime under contract, binding in law, to deed real property, or an interest therein, the court having jurisdiction of the estate may, on application for that purpose, authorize the executor or administrator to convey such property according to such contract, or with such modifications as are agreed upon by the parties and approved by the court; and if the contract is to convey real property to the executor or administrator, the clerk of the court shall execute the deed. x x x."</blockquote>This provision should be differentiated from Sections 2 and 4 of the same Rule, specifically requiring only the executor or administrator to file the application for authority to sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber real estate for the purpose of paying debts, expenses and legacies (Section 2);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> or for authority to sell real or personal estate beneficial to the heirs, devisees or legatees and other interested persons, although such authority is not necessary to pay debts, legacies or expenses of administration (Section 4).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Section 8 mentions only an application to authorize the conveyance of realty under a contract that the deceased entered into while still alive. While this Rule does not specify who should file the application, it stands to reason that the proper party must be one who is to be benefited or injured by the judgment, or one who is to be entitled to the avails of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Third Collateral Issue:<br><i>Bad Faith</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioners assert that Eliodoro Sr. was not in bad faith, because (a) he informed respondent of the need to secure court approval prior to the sale of the lots, and (2) he did not promise that he could obtain the approval.<br><br>We agree. Eliodoro Sr. did not misrepresent these lots to respondent as his own properties to which he alone had a title in fee simple. The fact that he failed to obtain the approval of the conditional sale did not automatically imply bad faith on his part. The CA held him in bad faith only for the purpose of binding him to the conditional sale. This was unnecessary because his being bound to it is, as already shown, beyond cavil.<br><br><center><b><u>Fourth Collateral Issue:<br><i>Computation of Eliodoro's Share</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioners aver that the CA's computation of Eliodoro Sr.'s share in the disputed parcels of land was erroneous because, as the conjugal partner of Remedios, he owned one half of these lots plus a further one tenth of the remaining half, in his capacity as a one of her legal heirs. Hence, Eliodoro's share should be 11/20 of the entire property. Respondent poses no objection to this computation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the CA held that, at the very least, the conditional sale should cover the one half (1/2) <i>pro indiviso</i> conjugal share of Eliodoro plus his one tenth (1/10) hereditary share as one of the ten legal heirs of the decedent, or a total of three fifths (3/5) of the lots in administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' computation is correct. The CA computed Eliodoro's share as an heir based on one tenth of the entire disputed property. It should be based only on the remaining half, after deducting the conjugal share.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The proper determination of the seller-heir's shares requires further explanation. Succession laws and jurisprudence require that when a marriage is dissolved by the death of the husband or the wife, the decedent's entire estate - under the concept of conjugal properties of gains -- must be divided equally, with one half going to the surviving spouse and the other half to the heirs of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> After the settlement of the debts and obligations, the remaining half of the estate is then distributed to the legal heirs, legatees and devices. We assume, however, that this preliminary determination of the decedent's estate has already been taken into account by the parties, since the only issue raised in this case is whether Eliodoro's share is 11/20 or 3/5 of the disputed lots.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <i>PARTIALLY GRANTED.</i> The appealed Decision and Resolution are <i>AFFIRMED</i> with the <i>MODIFICATION</i> that respondent is entitled to only a pro-indiviso share equivalent to 11/20 of the disputed lots.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Gonzaga-Reyes,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Justice Mariano M.
