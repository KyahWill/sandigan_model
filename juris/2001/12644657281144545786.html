Thereafter, Jesus Salvatierra, Jr. (Salvatierra, Jr.) and Alfredo Bedar (Bedar) held William's arms while Salvatierra, Sr. stabbed him with a dagger on the left side of his stomach and on his left breast.&nbsp; William cried "arayaten dale kabsat, amang ko"&nbsp; ("Help me, my brothers, my father!).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Dominador Campos (Dominador) who was then in the farm tending his cows, heard William's cry for succor and ran towards the place where the voice was coming from.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He saw his brother William, bloodied and lying on the ground. Salvatierra, Sr. threatened Dominador with a spading fork.&nbsp; Dominador tried to grab the spading fork from Salvatierra, Sr. and in the struggle, Salvatierra, Sr. then dropped the spading fork and stabbed Dominador on the left armpit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Just then, Ernesto Lumague (Lumague) and Alfredo Campos (Alfredo) arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lumague wrestled the knife from Salvatierra, Sr.'s hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; William and Dominador were taken to the Ilocos General Hospital in San Fernando, La Union for treatment of their wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Dr. Franklin delos Santos, a surgeon at the Ilocos General Hospital, who treated William and Dominador, testified during the trial and declared that their wounds, if not immediately treated, could have resulted in the death of the patients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense tried to establish that on the night of the incident, Salvatierra, Sr. and his son, Salvatierra, Jr. were watching a television program in their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After dinner, they proceeded to the <i>nipa</i> hut where they used to sleep and heard their dogs barking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Salvatierra, Sr. trained a flashlight where the dogs were and saw William holding two of their ducks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> William noticed them and turned to run away.&nbsp; However, he stumbled on a barbed wire fence and let go of the ducks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thereafter, William, Dominador and Alfredo arrived at the scene and stoned Salvatierra, Sr. hitting him on different parts of his body.&nbsp; Salvatierra, Sr. who was now dizzy because of the blows he received got hold of a spading fork to defend himself.&nbsp; At this juncture, Dominador went behind Salvatierra, Sr. and tried to strangle him with a rope.&nbsp; Salvatierra, Sr. fell on his back.&nbsp; Thereupon, William sat on Salvatierra, Sr.'s stomach and tried to gouge his eyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Salvatierra, Jr. rushed to their nipa hut to get a knife in order to cut the rope around his father's neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Just then, Alfredo hit him with a stone on the forehead and on his breast.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> His father told him to run and ask for help but he was chased by William who hit him at the back with a stone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He managed to escape and proceeded to the place of Antonio Sobejana who reported the incident to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the meantime, Ernesto Lumague was able to get the knife from Salvatierra, Sr. and used it to stab the latter at the back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thereafter, Ernesto Lumague, Alfredo Lumague, Alfredo Campos, Dominador Campos and one Dagul Disum left Salvatierra, Sr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. U-9275, the trial court found the Salvatierras guilty as charged but acquitted Bedar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, pursuant to Art. 249 in relation to Art. 6 this Court finds Jesus Salvatierra, Sr. and Jesus Salvatierra, Jr. guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide and hereby sentences them, pursuant to Art. 249 in relation to Art. 50 of the Revised Penal Code, to suffer an imprisonment of the medium period of prision mayor ranging from 8 years and 8 days to 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the court goes one degree lower to determine the minimum which according to Reyes in his Appendix B (sic), Table of Penalties, is prision mayor in its minimum period.&nbsp; WHEREFORE, the accused are adjudged to suffer an imprisonment of 7 years and 4 months of prision mayor as maximum, to the benefit of their preventive imprisonment and to pay jointly and severally the private complainant William Campos and the civil liability of P25,000 with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; There being a serious doubt as to the participation of Alfredo Bedar, who arrived late, the court acquits him with costs de oficio.&nbsp; Since the other accused Salvatierra, Jr. at the time of the commission of the offense,&nbsp; pursuant to Arts. 192, P.D. 603 as amended the judgment with respect to said minor "will be suspended upon application of the youthful offender and if it finds that the best interest of the public as well as that of the offender will be served thereby, and commit such minor to the custody or care of the Department of Social Welfare, or to any training institutions operated by the government or duly licensed agencies or any other responsible person until he shall have reached the age of twenty-one years of age, or for a shorter period as the court may deem proper, after considering the reports and recommendations of Social Welfare or the agency or responsible individual under whose care he has been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Salvatierra, Sr. was also found guilty in Criminal Case No. U-9276, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the&nbsp; Court opines that the&nbsp; prosecution was able to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The court hereby convicts the accused Jesus Salvatierra, Sr. of the crime of Frustrated Homicide and pursuant to Art. 249 in relation to Art. 6 and Article 50 of the Revised Penal Code, to suffer an imprisonment of the medium period of prision mayor ranging 8 years and 1 day to 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking into consideration the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the court goes one degree lower to determine the minimum, which according to Reyes in his Table of Penalties, Appendix B (sic), is prision mayor in its minimum period.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREFORE, the court sentences the accused to suffer an imprisonment of 7 years and 4 months of prision mayor in its minimum to 9 years and 4 months of prision mayor as maximum, to the benefit of his preventive imprisonment and to pay the civil liability to private complainant Dominador Campos P25,000 with costs.<br></blockquote><br>The knife used in these stabbing incidents is ordered confiscated in favor of the government.&nbsp; The rests are ordered returned to the accused Jesus Salvatierra Sr. upon proper receipt and inventory and upon finality of judgment if these cases are not appealed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Salvatierras appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellate tribunal affirmed the trial court's decision, with the following modifications:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED, with the modification that&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; appellant JESUS SALVATIERRA, SR. who is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal in two (2) counts of frustrated murder, is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of Four (4) years and Two (2) Months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to Nine (9) Years and Four (4) Months of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum;&nbsp; (b) while JESUS SALVATIERRA, JR., who is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as co-principal in one (1) count of&nbsp; frustrated homicide, is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to four (4) years, two (2) months of prision correccional, as maximum.&nbsp; The sum of&nbsp; P25,000.00 each awarded to complainants:&nbsp;&nbsp; WILLIAM CAMPOS and DOMINADOR CAMPOS is DELETED.&nbsp; All other aspects of the appealed decision stay. No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>The Salvatierras came to this Court for relief, <i>via</i> a petition for review, alleging that:<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE CONVICTION OF THE PETITIONERS BY GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES WILLIAM CAMPOS AND DOMINADOR CAMPOS.<br><br>2.&nbsp; THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED&nbsp; IN FINDING THE PETITIONERS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE.<br><br>3.&nbsp; THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT A CONSPIRACY EXISTED BETWEEN THE ACCUSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We affirm the questioned decision.<br><br>It is well-settled that the findings and conclusions of the trial court are accorded respect if they are supported by substantial evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In the absence of showing that the factual findings were reached arbitrarily<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> or that some facts and circumstances were overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> such findings, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are conclusive on this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It is, likewise, axiomatic that the assessment of&nbsp; credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best left to the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> since the trial judge has the best opportunity to observe the deportment of witnesses and determine the veracity of their declarations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In the case before us, the candid statements of the victim, William Campos, certainly deserves credence.&nbsp; He categorically testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Do you recall where were you in the night of February 18, 1997? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Where were you on that date and time?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">I was in the place of my work.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">At what time were you in the place of your work?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Up to 9:00 o'clock in the evening.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">What are you doing at the place at that time, Mr. Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">I just finished working overtime.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">And what time did you leave your place of work on the night of February 18, 1997?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Past 10:00 o'clock in the evening.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

These statements belied the allegation of the defense that Dominador strangled Salvatierra, Sr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The participation of Jesus Salvatierra, Jr. as co-conspirator was also established. William Campos categorically pinpointed him as the one who held his arm just before Jesus Salvatierra, Sr. approached and stabbed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The defense failed to convincingly rebut this assertion.&nbsp; Dominador Campos likewise testified that when he arrived at the scene of the incident, he found his brother William already on the ground, bloodied, and Salvatierra, Jr. was already running towards their <i>nipa</i> hut.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The conspiracy between Salvatierra, Sr. and Salvatierra, Jr. was proven by their concerted actions.&nbsp; In a number of cases, this Court ruled that where the acts of the accused collectively and individually demonstrate the existence of a common design towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful purpose, conspiracy is evident and all the perpetrators should be held liable as principals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> following the <i>dictum</i> that the act of one would be the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It did not matter that it was Salvatierra, Sr. who actually stabbed the victims. Salvatierra, Jr. facilitated the commission of the crime when he held William's arms thus preventing the latter from defending himself against the attack on his person.<br><br>Finally, the Court agrees with the appellate tribunal that the trial court erred in suspending the sentence of Salvatierra, Jr.&nbsp; P.D. No. 603,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as amended by P.D. No. 1179 and P.D. No. 1210, requires that a youthful offender should apply for a suspension of his sentence.&nbsp; No such application was made by Salvatierra, Jr.&nbsp; More importantly, since he was already over 18 years of age when the decision of the trial court was promulgated, the right to apply for a suspended sentence is no longer available to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> He is, nevertheless, entitled to a reduced sentence, as so imposed by the appellate court, in accordance with Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto.</i><br><br>Costs against accused-appellants.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Pardo,</i> and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> William Campos, TSN, 21 Jan. 1998, p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at&nbsp;
