				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Teresita D. Gaite appeals to this Court seeking to review the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals that denied her motion to reopen the case convicting her of violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22, and the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> denying her motion for reconsideration of the decision.<br><br>On September 3, 1993, the trial court convicted accused Teresita D. Gaite of violation of B.P. Blg. 22 on five counts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Accused Gaite interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On December 18, 1995, the Court of Appeals promulgated a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> acquitting petitioner Gaite in three of the five cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> but convicting her in two cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 1996, petitioner Gaite elevated her conviction to the Supreme Court on certiorari;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> however, on August 12, 1996, the Court dismissed the case. On December 9, 1996, the Supreme Court issued an entry of judgment and remanded the records to the court of origin.<br><br>On May 28, 1997, petitioner Gaite filed with the trial court a petition for new trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, on June 23, 1997, the court denied the petition for lack of merit and for having been filed out of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On June 30, 1997, petitioner Gaite filed with the trial court a motion for inhibition of the presiding judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On July 7, 1997, the court denied the motion and issued a warrant of arrest against petitioner Gaite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On July 15, 1997, petitioner Gaite filed with the trial court a motion for reconsideration and recall of warrant of arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On July 28, 1997, the trial court denied the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On August 11, 1997, petitioner filed with the trial court an urgent petition for relief from judgment and/or reopen the cases, with ancillary prayer for immediate recall of warrant of arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On August 27, 1997, the trial court denied the petition for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On September 10, 1997, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari alleging that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the above-mentioned motions and petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On June 29, 1998, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 1998, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration; however, on February 1, 1999, the Court of Appeals denied the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contended that the Court of Appeals erred in not allowing the reopening of the cases because she possessed newly discovered evidence that would materially affect her conviction. Also, she alleged that her conviction should not have been affirmed in the two cases, considering her defense of payment or overpayment.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>Petitioner filed her motion for new trial five months after the decision had become final and executory. The Rules of Court provides that a motion for new trial must be filed before a judgment of conviction becomes final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioner attempted to re-examine her conviction for two counts of violation for B.P. Blg. 22. She insisted that she already paid more than the amounts contained on the checks she issued which were subsequently dishonored. She also feigned ignorance of notice given to her as to the dishonor of the checks she issued. She alleged that she failed to adequately explain certain documents she presented during the trial.<br><br>Petitioner had several opportunities to raise such contentions, but she failed to do so. Such allegations raise issues of facts which can not be ventilated in this Court. We have ruled in countless cases that a petition for certiorari may only dwell on questions of law, not of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The courts may not be utilized as instruments of delay in the execution of judgments.
