They were living at Hadrian St., Don Bonifacio Subd., Pulong Maragul, Angeles City. Her mother, Liwayway Marie Scott-Daugherty, has a maternal half-brother by the name of Love Joy De Guzman who also lived at Hadrian St. in her (Geneva's) grandmother's hut. Her uncle Love Joy is jobless and oftentimes ate at their house. One morning of December 1998 before Christmas and while she was in front of their house, her uncle Love Joy asked her to go to his house. Once inside the house, accused asked her to buy coffee for him. After buying coffee, Geneva fell asleep. When she woke up, she was already naked and the accused was on top of her. Her uncle was also naked and she felt his penis was inside her vagina. Accused was making a push-up movement and she felt pain in her vagina. After her uncle removed himself on top of her, she saw blood in her vagina. Her uncle told her not to tell anyone what he did or he may kill her and her mother. Accused then asked her to leave. As told by her uncle, she did not inform her mother nor anyone of what Love Joy did to her.<br><br>Sometime in February 1999 and while she was watching video at the store, her uncle Love Joy called her again and asked her to go to his house. Once inside Love Joy's house, the latter kissed her on the neck. Accused removed her skirt and panty and he undressed himself. Accused mounted her and inserted his penis into her vagina. Again she felt pain. After the sexual attack, she went back to the store and saw a certain "Boy Pabalan." She told Boy Pabalan what Love Joy had done to her and the latter brought her to the Barangay Hall. Her mother, who was informed by her brother, Joseph Scott, brought her to a doctor for examination. She was examined by Dr. Lauro C. Biag of the Ospital Ning Angeles (ONA) on February 15, 1999 and the doctor found in her genitalia complete healed lacerations at 7, 11, 1 o'clock and incomplete healed lacerations at 3, 5, 12 o'clock. On the same date, the doctor issued a medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> indicating therein his findings. When the doctor testified in court, he alleged that the hymenal lacerations on the victim's genitalia may have been caused by the insertion of a hard object inside the vagina. She was also brought to a police station where she filed a complaint against her uncle Love Joy De Guzman. She and her mother executed sworn statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx<br></center><br>Accused Love Joy De Guzman admitted that the victim Geneva Marie Daugherty is his niece and the latter's mother is his half-sister. He however denied the rape accusations made against him. He alleged that he had not seen the latter on the dates mentioned by her, specifically in the months of December 1998 and February 1999, when the rapes were allegedly committed. He reasoned out that he was always out during the nighttime as he had to meet his barkadas at Check-point, Balibago, Angeles City. He usually went home at 6 o'clock in the morning and will sleep the whole day. He will only wake up at around 5 to 6 in the evening to see his barkadas again. He further alleged that there was no chance or opportunity for him to see Geneva because at daytime he was sleeping the whole day. He never woke up even at noon in order to eat lunch. He only stayed awake at daytime during Sundays. However, during the Sundays of the months above-mentioned, he had no opportunity to see Geneva Marie. He does not know the reason why Geneva Marie complained that he raped her as he was maintaining a good relationship with her and her mother.<br></blockquote>Owing to the severity of the penalty imposed in this case, the Court must be guided by the principle that: (a) an accusation for rape can be made with facility. While the commission of the crime may not be easy to prove, it becomes even more difficult for the person accused, although innocent, to disprove that he did not commit the crime; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are normally involved, the testimony of the complainant must be always be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <sup> </sup>Thus, in a prosecution for rape, the complainant's credibility becomes the single most important issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Considering that the persons present during a rape are usually only the offender and the offended, the core of the questions raised is the credibility of the witnesses. It is doctrinally settled in this regard that such issue is to be resolved primarily by the trial court because it is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner of testifying. Accordingly, its findings are entitled to the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any showing that the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the first assigned error, accused-appellant in sum insists he should be acquitted because the Informations filed against him are fatally defective because the specific dates of the sexual assaults are not stated with particularity.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br><i>The exact time and date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><i> </i>As we pointed out recently in <i>People v. Felicito Barbosa y Turallo:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>Failure to recall the exact date of the crime is not an indication of false testimony. Moreover,<b> the precise dated when the victim was raped is not an element of the offense. The gravamen of the crime is the fact of carnal knowledge under any of the circumstances enumerated under Article 335 </b>of the Revised Penal Code. As long as it is alleged that the offense was committed at any time as near to the actual date at which the offense was committed in the information is sufficient. <b>The allegations that rapes were committed "before and until October 15, 1994", "sometime in the year 1991 and the days thereafter", "sometime in November 1995 and some occasions prior and/or subsequent thereto</b>" and <i>"<b>on or about and sometime in the year 1988" </b></i><b>constitute sufficient compliance </b>with Section 11, Rule 110 of the Revised Rule of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>In the second assigned error, accused-appellant claims that his culpability was not adequately proven. However, other than his defense of denial and alibi, he did not elaborate on the particular facts or circumstances which would prove his innocence.<br><br>Accused-appellant's pretensions of innocence simply pales in comparison to the young complainant's testimony which was given in a straightforward and spontaneous manner. We have assiduously scrutinized the testimony of complaining witness Geneva Marie Daugherty and ultimately reached the conclusion that she was indeed defiled by accused-appellant. Seven-year old Geneva's testimony on the acts of rape perpetrated against her by her uncle is clear and could have only been narrated by a victim subjected to such sexual assaults. Indeed, the enormity of accused-appellant's bestiality is graphically detailed in the following sickening account of the seven-year old victim:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

defense. We have consistently looked upon the defense of alibi with suspicion and received it with caution not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it can be easily fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><sup> </sup>Unless supported by clear and convincing evidence, the same cannot prevail over the positive declarations of the victim who, in a simple and straightforward manner, convincingly identified the accused-appellant as the defiler of her chastity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Well-established is the rule that testimonies of rape victims, especially child victims, are given full weight and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><sup> </sup>It bears emphasis that the victim was barely seven years old when she was raped. In a litany of cases, we have applied the well settled rule that when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says she has been raped, she says, in effect, all that is necessary to prove that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Courts usually give greater weight to the testimony of a girl who is a victim of sexual assault, especially a minor, particularly in cases of incestuous rape, because no woman would be willing to undergo a public trial and put up with the shame, humiliation and dishonor of exposing her own degradation were it not to condemn an injustice and to have the offender apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The embarrassment and stigma of allowing an examination of her private parts and testifying in open court on the painfully intimate details of her ravishment effectively rule out the possibility of a false accusation of rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> by the complainant. There is no cogent reason to discount the findings of the trial court that the testimony of Geneva was spontaneous and straightforward. She vividly recalled details that a seven-year old girl could not possibly concoct. Verily -<br><blockquote>Well settled is the rule that no woman would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and submit herself to public humiliation and scrutiny via a public trial if her sordid tale was not true and her sole motivation was not to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><sup> </sup>A young girl's revelation that she has been raped coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and her willingness to undergo pubic trial where she would be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity by, as in this case, her own father, cannot be so easily dismissed as a mere concoction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><sup> </sup>Courts usually give credence to the testimony of a girl who is a victim of sexual assault particularly if it constitutes incestuous rape because, normally, no person would be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial and to testify on the details of her ordeal were it not to condemn an injustice. Needless to say, it is settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, since when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, ill motive is not an essential element of a crime. It becomes inconsequential where there are affirmative, nay categorical, declarations towards the accused-appellant's accountability for the felony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the light of the positive testimony of the victim proving accused-appellant's criminal accountability, his alibi must perforce fail. As between the categorical testimony that rings of truth on one hand and the bare alibi on the other, the farmer must prevail. A mere denial like alibi is inherently a weak defense and constitutes self-serving negative evidence which can not be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on positive matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>All told, the proffered alibi of accused-appellant cannot stand against the positive identification by the complainant that he is the defiler of her womanhood. Indeed, the revelation of an innocent girl not even into her teens whose chastity has been abused deserves full credit, as the willingness of complainant to face police investigation and to undergo the trouble and humiliation of a public trial is eloquent testimony of the truth of her complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <sup> </sup>In short, it is most improbable for an innocent and guileless girl of seven years as herein offended party, to brazenly impute a crime so serious as rape to any man, let alone her uncle, if it were not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Finding no cogent reason to reverse the ruling of the trial court insofar as the rapes were committed, what remains to be determined is the propriety of the penalties imposed by the trial court upon accused-appellant.<br><br>The two (2) informations specifically allege, <i>inter alia, </i>that accused-appellant, "being the maternal uncle of the complainant xxx with lewd design and taking advantage of the innocence and tender age of the victim did then and there have carnal knowledge with xxx a girl 7 years of age, by means of force and intimidation and against her will and consent." The allegation in the informations concerning the minority of the victim, who was seven (7) years of age at the time the crimes were committed, and her relationship as niece of the offender who is her maternal uncle are special qualifying circumstances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which would categorize the crime as qualified rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of R.A.

These were even admitted and confirmed by accused-appellant himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><sup> </sup>With regard to minority, it may be pointed out that a birth certificate or any other official document may no longer be necessary to establish the age of the victim where, as in this case, the same is admitted and not disputed by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><sup> </sup>However, aside from said admission, the prosecution likewise produced Geneva's certificate of birth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> thus laying to rest any further question as to her minority.<br><br>With regard to the award of damages, we note that while the trial court correctly ordered the accused-appellant to indemnity the victim in the sum of P75,000.00 for each count of rape, it failed to award moral damages. As we pointed out in <i>People v. Cornelio Supnad,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><i> </i>a conviction for rape carries with it the award of moral damages to the victim since it is recognized that her injury is concomitant with and necessarily results from the odious crime of rape to warrant <i>per se </i>an award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><sup> </sup>Moral damages are automatically granted in rape cases without need of proof for it is assumed that the victim has suffered moral injuries entitling her to such an award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Considering that the alternative circumstance of relationship has aggravated the offense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and consistent with our ruling in <i>People v.
