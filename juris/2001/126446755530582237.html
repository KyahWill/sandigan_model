General summarized the evidence for the prosecution in this wise:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"In the early afternoon of April 18, 1994 at Ambulong, Magdiwang, Sibuyan Island, Romblon, Barangay Captain Percival Orbe was in his residence together with Barangay Kagawad Antonio Macalipay and Barangay Tanod Melchor Recto, appellant's cousin.&nbsp; They were trying to settle a land dispute involving Linda Rance and Cornelio Regis, Jr.&nbsp; While the meeting was in progress, Orbe was summoned by SPO4 Fortunato Rafol to proceed to the bodega of Rance.<br><br>"There, they noticed that the padlock of the bodega was destroyed, and the palay stored therein, stolen. Forthwith, Barangay Kagawad Macalipay, who happened to be the chairman of the Barangay Agrarian Reform Committee (BARC), conducted an investigation.<br><br>"SPO4 Rafol and SPO1 Male, also made their investigation and reported their findings to Linda Rance. At this point, Barangay Tanod Melchor Recto passed by. He saw SPO4 Rafol, Wilfredo Arce, [S]pouses Crestito and Linda Rance at the bodega. He went to Barangay Captain Orbe and inquired why they were there. Barangay Captain Orbe told him that the padlock of the bodega was destroyed and the palay, stolen. Orbe requested Melchor Recto to stay as he might be needed. Thereupon, Barangay Tanod Melchor Recto began his own ocular investigation.<br><br>"While SPO4 Rafol and SPO1 Male were leaving the premises, the group of [A]ppellant Julio Recto, Cornelio Regis, Jr., Dante Regis, Melvar Relox, Teodoro de la Serna, Enrica Regis and Nida Regis arrived.&nbsp; The group stopped at the first `trampa' near the bodega. Barangay Captain Orbe advised them not to create trouble, but, Dante Regis pulled a piece of wood and threw it towards them.&nbsp; Thereafter, [A]ppellant Recto, while holding a balisong or fan knife, approached Barangay Captain Orbe. The latter responded by telling the former to surrender the balisong. Appellant stepped backward, opened his jacket and pulled out a gun, a de sabog.&nbsp; Upon seeing the gun, Barangay Captain Orbe retreated, while Barangay Kagawad Antonio Macalipay stepped forward with both arms raised and uttered the words: `Do not do it. We'll just settle this. (Ayoson ta lang ine).' Julio Recto, however, immediately pulled the trigger, hitting Barangay Kagawad Macalipay, causing him to fall down on the ground.&nbsp; Then Cornelio Regis, Jr. approached the fallen Macalipay and flipped his bolo at the latter who rolled and fell into the rice paddy.<br><br>"Melchor Recto saw the shooting from his hiding place behind a concrete pillar.&nbsp; He then ran inside the old dilapidated bathroom of the bodega. Barangay Captain Orbe also followed. Inside the bathroom, Melchor Recto peeped through the window and saw [A]ppellant Recto fire his gun at Emilio Santos.&nbsp; Santos also fired his revolver at appellant and later, turned around and crawled.&nbsp; While crawling, Santos fired another shot towards Regis, Jr[.], but, the latter was able to reach and hack the former with a bolo.<br><br>"Amidst the din, Percival Orbe and Melchor Recto heard [A]ppellant Julio Recto saying: `Where is that kapitan?' When Melchor could no longer see Julio Recto, he jumped out of the bathroom window and ran.&nbsp; While running, Julio Recto shot him hitting the latter's thigh. Barangay Captain Orbe also got out of the bathroom through the top and landed [o]nto the ricefield. Before he could take a step, he was also shot by [A]ppellant Julio Recto at his right elbow, but was still able to continue running and cross the southern portion of the ricefield.&nbsp; He caught up with the wounded Melchor Recto and both went their separate ways. On the other hand, both Barangay Kagawad Antonio Macalipay and Emiliano `Renato' Santos died due to multiple wounds inflicted on them by herein appellant."

Then, he took two (2) steps forward and said why are you like that. Alberto Rance, the son of Mrs. Linda Rance, shot him, hitting him on his left side.&nbsp; He ran towards Alberto Rance who shot him with the latter behind the concrete porch holding his gun with his two (2) hands resting on the concrete wall (porch) of the bodega, and with Emiliano Santos also holding his gun [which] he used in shooting Regis, Jr.&nbsp; The distance between Alberto Rance and the unarmed Julio Recto was 11 ½ meters when x x x Julio Recto r[a]n towards Alberto Rance[;] the latter ran and he saw Wilfredo Arce [turn] and [pick] up a gun and he grabbed the gun and while pulling it, it fired and he did not know whether it hit somebody.

However, Julio Recto was able to take possession of this gun from Wilfredo Arce, took cover behind a post and still managed to shoot Santos who was somewhere else.&nbsp; He threw the gun later on the disputed land and ran to the direction of the banana plantation of Regis, Jr. and he reached his house. Both of them were outside the house of Regis, Jr. when x x x [M]aritime [P]oliceman Morada and Galin arrived. x x x."

Thus, the attack on him did not amount to direct assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>We now determine the criminal liability of appellant with respect to the attack.&nbsp; He shot Melchor only once, but the latter sustained five gunshot entry wounds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>all located at his backside, at the vicinity of his buttocks.&nbsp; Because the gun used by the former was a <i>de sabog,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> each bullet contained several pellets inside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In other words, a single shot from a <i>de sabog </i>results in the spewing of several pellets.&nbsp; The nature of the weapon used for the attack and the direction at which it was aimed -- the victim's back -- unmistakably showed appellant's intent to kill.<br><br>However, for reasons other than his own desistance, appellant was not able to perform all the acts of execution necessary to consummate the killing, since the wounds he inflicted were not mortal.&nbsp; In <i>United States v. Eduave,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this Court has held that if the wounds would not normally cause death, then the last act necessary to produce homicide has not been performed by the offender.&nbsp; Thus, appellant's liability amounted only to <i>attempted</i>, not frustrated, homicide.<br><br>The penalty that is lower by two degrees<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>than that prescribed by law for consummated homicide shall be imposed upon appellant.&nbsp; After applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, it shall be taken from the medium period, since there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances proven.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 1971, the trial court was correct in ruling that the attack on Percival Orbe - then a barangay captain, a person in authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> -- amounted to qualified direct assault, because he was attacked on the occasion of the performance of his duty.&nbsp; At the time, he was attempting to pacify appellant and to keep the peace between the two groups.<br><br>A felony "is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator." In this case, the nature of the weapon used by appellant unmistakably shows that he intended to kill Orbe. However, like the wounds inflicted by the accused on Melchor Recto, those on Orbe were not fatal.<br><br>As evidenced by the Medico-Legal Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>prepared by Dr. Ramon D. Villanueva of the Romblon Provincial Hospital and the testimony given by Dr. Giovannie C. Fondevilla of the same hospital, Orbe sustained several gunshot wounds in the vicinity of his right elbow.&nbsp; Those injuries could not have caused his death. Moreover, according to Dr. Fondevilla, no surgical intervention was required; only medication was given to him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> to prevent any secondary infection from setting in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Evidently, appellant had not yet been able to perform all the acts of execution necessary to bring about the death of Orbe, because the latter was able to run away after being fired at.&nbsp; Although appellant had already directly commenced the commission of a felony by overt acts (shooting Orbe with a <i>de sabog</i>), he was not able to consummate that felony for some reason other than his spontaneous desistance. Thus, he committed <i>attempted</i> homicide.<br><br>Given these circumstances, appellant should therefore be convicted of the complex crime of qualified direct assault with attempted homicide. To be imposed therefor should be the penalty for the most serious crime -- in this case qualified direct assault -- the same to be imposed in its maximum period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The Indeterminate Sentence Law should also be applied in this case.<br><br><i>Qualified Direct Assault with Murder </i><br><br><i>(Criminal Case No. 1972) </i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 1972, appellant does not question the finding of the trial court that he shot Antonio Macalipay.&nbsp; However, he submits that it erred in finding the presence of the qualifying circumstance of treachery.&nbsp; We agree.<br><br><i>First</i>, the victim's companions outnumbered those of appellant.&nbsp; As shown by the pleadings and records of the case, his group consisted of seven individuals; the victims, sixteen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, the heated confrontation on April 18, 1994 arose as a consequence of an earlier judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>of the trial court in favor of appellant's group.&nbsp; This case strained the relations of the parties who, after all, were related by blood and marriage.&nbsp; In fact, prior to this event, appellant -- believing that his uncle Cornelio Regis Jr. should get the landlord's share of the <i>palay </i>or rice harvest -- attempted to harvest the fields thrice: (1) in October 1993; (2) in December 1993; and, (3) in March 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> All of these attempts failed, because Linda Rance hired a group of bodyguards headed by the victim, Emiliano "Renato" Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In short, the confrontation was not totally unexpected.<br><br><i>Third, </i>both groups were armed.&nbsp; The exchange of gunfire was substantiated by the Medico-legal Certificates presented by both the prosecution and the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Moreover, the deceased Santos carried a gun which Alberto Rance, son of Crestito and Linda, had given him for his protection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><i>Fourth, </i>appellant's group asked the police station commander to assemble the workers of the disputed rice field on April 15, 1994 at the Municipal Building of Magdiwang, Romblon, to inform them of the trial court's Decision awarding the land to Cornelio Regis Jr. For this reason, the members of the group were to start collecting the landlord's share of the harvest starting April 18, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><i>Fifth, </i>appellant was seen holding a <i>balisong</i> or fan knife during the heated confrontation, before he pulled out the shotgun and pointed it at the other group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Macalipay, in a bold yet foolish attempt, stepped forward in front of appellant and told him: "<i>Ayosan ta lang ini</i>?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (No, don't, because we will just settle this)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> And "[s]imultaneously with the last word in the phrase [`]don't because we will just settle this,[']"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> appellant fired his gun, killing the victim.<br><br>Evidently, the victim had all the opportunity to escape or defend himself from the aggression that was to ensue, yet chose not to grab the opportunity and instead placed himself in a position more open to attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Equally important, his vulnerable position had not been deliberately sought by appellant. It was thrust on the latter by the former himself.&nbsp; In short, appellant did not deliberately choose the mode of attack to kill the victim with impunity and without risk to himself.<br><br>Jurisprudence teaches us:<br><br><blockquote>"Treachery does not exist [when] the evidence does not show that appellant deliberately adopted a mode of attack intended to ensure the killing of [the victim] with impunity, and without giving the victim an opportunity to defend himself.&nbsp; Further, the shooting took place after a heated exchange of words and a series of events that forewarned the victim of aggression from appellant.&nbsp; In this case, it appears to have occurred on sudden impulse but preceded by acts of appellant showing hostility and a heated temper that indicated an imminent attack and put the deceased on guard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>"If the decision to kill was sudden, there is no treachery, even if the position of the victim was vulnerable, because it was not deliberately sought by the accused, but was purely accidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>"When there is no evidence that the accused has, prior to the moment of the killing, resolved to commit the crime, or there is no proof that the death of the victim was the result of meditation, calculation or reflection, treachery cannot be considered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Section 16 of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code states that "there is treachery when the offender commits any of crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make."<br><br>In this case, appellant was out in the open during the entire span of time from the heated discussion, to the brewing of the violence, and up to the shooting of Macalipay.&nbsp; At the time, his every action, which indicated the imminence of more violence, was visible to them -- to the victim and the latter's companions.&nbsp; Appellant was actually vulnerable to any attack that they could have made at the time, had they chosen to.&nbsp; His mode of attack was therefore not without risk to himself. Absent treachery, the killing is homicide, not murder.<br><br>Considering that Antonio Macalipay was a <i>kagawad</i> who was in the actual performance of his duties when he was shot, the attack on him constituted direct assault.<br><br>Applying the provisions of Articles 148 (direct assault), 249 (homicide) and 48 (penalty for complex crimes), appellant should be held liable for the complex crime of qualified direct assault with homicide.&nbsp; The penalty to be imposed on him should be for homicide, which is the more serious crime, to be imposed in the maximum period. This penalty shall comprise the maximum of his indeterminate sentence, and the minimum shall be within the range of the penalty next lower than that prescribed for homicide.<br><br><i>Homicide (Criminal Case No. 1973)</i><br><br>We sustain appellant's conviction for homicide in Criminal Case No. 1973 because, in the words of the trial judge: "The late Emiliano Santos was only beaten to the draw by co-accused Julio Recto.
