The said accused is credited with the full term in serving his sentence of the preventive imprisonment which he has undergone during the pendency of this case, subject to the conditions imposed in Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>As the two other accused, namely, Napoleon Presillas and Nazareno Presillas, are still at-large and in order that this case shall not remain as pending in the records of the Court, let this case be ARCHIVED in so far as said two accused are concerned and to be revived upon their arrest. Let alias warrant of arrest issue for the said two (2) accused, Napoleon and Nazareno Presillas, and said warrant be returned only upon their arrest.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals. The said court rendered a decision on July 29, 1999 which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Trial Court is hereby MODIFIED by imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua upon the accused-appellant Timoteo Bracero. However, no judgment shall be entered and instead, the records of the case are hereby ordered elevated to the Supreme Court for its review pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 13, Rule 124, Revised Rules of Court (See also People vs. Esparcia, 187 SCRA 282, 288).<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court accepted the appeal and required the parties to file additional briefs, if they so desired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On February 17, 2000, accused-appellant filed his brief ascribing to the trial court the following errors, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDIBILITY TO THE TESTIMONIES OF SPOUSES ALBERTO AND MARITES DENSING ON THE ALLEGED POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OR (sic) APPELLANT TIMOTEO BRACERO DESPITE ITS GLARING INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE DEFENSE OF ALIBI INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT TIMOTEO BRACERO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The relevant antecedents are as follows:<br><br>At around seven o'clock in the evening of July 7, 1993, three (3) men later identified as Napoleon Presillas, Nazareno Presillas and accused-appellant, came to the residence of the complainants Alberto and Marites Densing looking for Alberto's father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Napoleon Presillas then ordered Alberto to come down. He did so accompanied by his wife, Marites. When they alighted, Alberto was directed by the trio to sit under a coconut tree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The trio then identified themselves as members of the military and informed them that they came to retrieve the two (2) hand grenades which the spouses allegedly have in their possession. Failure to surrender the same, they were told, would mean payment of a fine amounting to ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Alberto denied having hand grenades in his possession and told them that he did not have money to pay the supposed fine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, the trio who now claimed to be members of the New People's Army (NPA) insisted in their demand for the hand grenades and the money while pointing a gun at Alberto. Afraid for his and his wife's lives, Alberto said that he had one hundred fifty pesos (P150.00) in his wallet and a cow to sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Napoleon ordered Marites to get the wallet. She was accompanied by accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> who when they reached the couple's room held her by the waist, mashed her breasts and embraced her. Marites however was able to wrest herself from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> When she found the money, she gave it to the accused-appellant, then went outside to where the group was.<br><br>Napoleon then held Marites and directed her towards the back of the house while accused-appellant and Nazareno guarded an immobilized Alberto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> While they were at the back of the house, Napoleon ordered Marites to lie down and threatened to shoot her if she did not obey. Trembling with fear, Marites complied. Napoleon then removed her clothes and ordered her to take off her short pants. He placed himself on top of her and forcibly removed her underpants. He then embraced her tightly and succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thereafter, he ordered her to stand up and put on her clothes. He admonished her not to tell her husband about what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Afterward, they proceeded to Eutiquio Presbitero's house to sell the Densing's cow. At a distance of about half a kilometer to said house, only Alberto and Napoleon proceeded while Marites, guarded by Nazareno and accused-appellant, stayed behind and waited near a field of coconut trees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant ordered Marites to go farther into the field and ordered her to lie down. When she asked why, accused-appellant replied that if she valued their safety, she should just do as she was told. Marites pleaded with him to spare her, saying that Napoleon already raped her, but accused-appellant refused. Afraid, Marites then did as she was told. Accused-appellant then removed his pants and Marites' short pants and underpants. He placed himself on top of her and succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> After satisfying his carnal lust, he ordered her to stand. Holding her by the forearm, he noticed the watch she was wearing. He forcibly took it from her despite her protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Moments later, Marites saw her husband and Napoleon coming. The trio discussed something among themselves. After that, the spouses were led into a grove of bamboo trees where Alberto was ordered to sit while Napoleon, holding Marites by the arm, led her away allegedly to collect dried leaves to be used for sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thereupon, Napoleon ordered Marites to lie down. When she refused, Napoleon pinned her to the ground, pulled down her short pants and underpants, raised her dress and again succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He then led Marites back to her husband with the warning not to tell her husband about the second rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Marites sat beside her husband but could only cry when Alberto asked her what happened. Napoleon told the spouses that he and his companions cannot stay anymore but gave them instructions as to where they will deliver the proceeds of the sale of their cow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, they let the spouses go. On their way home, Marites told Alberto of the three (3) acts of rape committed against her by accused-appellant and Napoleon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The following day, the spouses reported the incident to the police stationed at Sogod. Their affidavits were taken. Thereafter, they proceeded to the Dosado Memorial Hospital where Marites was subjected to a physical and medcial examination by Dr. Lilia Diaz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The findings revealed healed lacerations and the presence of spermatozoa in Marites' genitalia.<br><br>Thereafter, the instant case was filed.<br><br>As already mentioned above, accused-appellant inceptively faults the trial court for convicting him despite what he claims to be the seemingly untrustworthy identification made by the Densing spouses based on the inconsistencies between their written statements and testimonies in open court.<br><br>When an accused assails the identification made by witnesses, he is in effect attacking the credibility of those witnesses who referred to him as the perpetrator of the crime alleged to have been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Inevitably, the case turns on the question of credibility.<br><br>It has long been a well-settled rule of evidence and procedure that the issue of credibility of witnesses is within the exclusive province of a trial court to determine under the well-nigh principle that findings of trial courts deserve respect from appellate courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The foregoing rule notwithstanding, a thorough examination of the records of the case reveals that the trial court's findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence on record.<br><br>The testimonies of Alberto and Marites were not only consistent with, and corroborative of, each other. Their narration of what transpired before the trial court was clear, coherent and categorical. There was no discernable hesitation or uncertainty on the part of the spouses in identifying the accused-appellant during the trial. Marites testified on direct examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Now a few seconds before you brought away from your house, what happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> We were robbed by them and money was taken away from us.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now, who robbed you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Napoleon Presillas, Nazareno Presillas and Timoteo Bracero.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">You mentioned about money Mrs. Witness, where was the money being placed which you said was being robbed by those persons?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> On the wallet which was placed upstairs.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who of those three persons actually took the wallet?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><u>Timoteo Bracero.</u><br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now Mrs. Witness, could you tell this Honorable Court how was Timoteo Bracero able to know the wallet upstairs containing money?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">They were asking money from us and I told them that we have no money and with this because they wanted that will be fined with that handgrenade in the amount of ten thousand pesos and we further told them that the only money we have was only one hundred fifty pesos.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who told those three persons about the money amounting of one hundred fifty pesos?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> I was the one, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What about the possession of that money about the wallter?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> I was the one who got the wallet, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Now, what actually prompted you Mrs. Witness to tell the truth of those three (3) persons about the wallet containing one hundred fifty pesos?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Because they were forcibly demanding us to produce in the amount of ten thousand pesos and I told them that we have no money in this amount and the only money that we have was only one hundred fifty pesos, the remaining amount which we used in our daily subsistence.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who in particular Mrs, witness forcibly demanded that the amount of tel thousand pesos?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Napoleon Presillas.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now when Napoleon, or you said a few minutes ago mrs.

</tbody></table></blockquote>Another well-entrenched rule in our jurisprudence is that it is a natural reaction for victims of criminal violence to strive to ascertain the appearance of the malefactors and observe the manner in which the crime was committed. In Marites' case, it is important to note that it was accused-appellant who accompanied her inside their house when she searched for her husband's money; that it was accused-appellant who held her by the waist, mashed her breasts and embraced her; and that it was accused-appellant who raped her in the coconut grove. Given these grueling circumstances, it would have been impossible for Marites not to remember accused-appellant's face and demeanor. In Alberto's case, it is not likely that he will forget a classmate's face. As aforestated, Alberto testified that accused-appellant was a classmate in high school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Moreover, records do not disclose any improper motive on the part of the spouses to falsely point to accused-appellant as one of the perpetrators of the robbery-rape. Consequently, their identification of the accused-appellant should be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant lamely opines that there is an inconsistency between the written sworn statement given by Alberto to the Sogod Police on August 12, 1993 and his testimony given in open court. He contends that such inconsistency could lead to no other conclusion than that he was not properly identified by Alberto.<br><br>As we have already discussed above, we have expended considerable time and effort studying the records of this case and we find nothing in the spouses' account of events which will show that their credibility is impeachable.<br><br>Alberto's initial failure to reveal the names of the assailants when they reported the matter to the police does not detract from the fact that accused-appellant was one of the perpetrators of the robbery-rape as testified to by the spouses in open court. Besides, the alleged "inconsistency" is too trivial and minor to consider.<br><br>In numerous cases decided by the Court, it has been held that inconsistencies between the sworn statement and direct testimony given in open court do not necessarily discredit the witness since an affidavit, being taken <i>ex-parte</i>, is oftentimes incomplete and is generally regarded as inferior to the testimony of the witness in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant next interposes the defense of denial and alibi. He maintains that he was in his home at the time the crime was committed.<br><br>Alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive identification of herein accused-appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> For alibi to prosper, it would not be enough for the accused-appellant to prove that he was elsewhere when the crime was committed. He went further to demonstrate that it would have been physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Records show that accused-appellant resides in Danao City and that it was not physically impossible for him to be in Sogod, the scene of the crime, at the time the incident happened. By his own admission, accused-appellant testified that transportation from Cebu City to Sogod, passing through Danao City, was still available from five o'clock in the afternoon to six o'clock in the evening. Consequently, it would not have been impossible for him to be in Sogod at around seven o'clock in the evening when the incident transpired.<br><br>Finally, accused-appellant and his co-accused were charged with the special complex crime of robbery with multiple rape under paragraph 2 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code which is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. However, the trial court found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the separate crimes of robbery and rape and imposed upon him the penalty respective to each crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This is erroneous. When the robbery is accompanied by rape, as in the case at bar, the same must be punished as a special complex crime. As discussed above, accused-appellant is guilty of robbery with one (1) count of rape, consequently, he should be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that accused-appellant Timoteo Bracero is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with rape and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, together with the accessory penalty provided by law.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, Pardo</i>, and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J.</i>, (<i>Chairman</i>), on official leave.<br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, pp. 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 36-37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 82-83.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 107-108.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, April 5, 1994, p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> TSN, April 8, 1994, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 4; TSN, April 5, 1994, pp. 7-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, April 8, 1998, p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TSN, April 7, 1994, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> TSN, April 5, 1994, p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 15-16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 17-18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>Id</i>., at 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>People v.
