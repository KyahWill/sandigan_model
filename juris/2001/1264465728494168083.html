				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the multitude of cases which passed this Court, we did not flinch in sending men rapacious of the flesh to the gallows.&nbsp; Lamentably, there still remains such callous men who commit unimaginable acts and even concoct tales, no matter how absurd, just to exculpate themselves.<br><br>The case at bench is an illustration.<br><br>On August 4, 1998, a cold-blooded ravager, Rolly Abulencia y Coyos, preyed on ten-year old Rebelyn Garcia.<br><br>In the early morning of the following day, Rebelyn's lifeless, naked body was found floating at the Colobong creek in San Manuel, Pangasinan, with marks of bruises, burns and injuries manifesting that she was defiled and later drowned to death.<br><br>In an Information dated September 7, 1998, docketed as Criminal Case No. U-9777, Abulencia was charged before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 46, Urdaneta City for rape with homicide.&nbsp; The Information reads:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about August 4, 1998, between 5:00 o'clock P.M. to 8:00 0'clock in the evening, at barangay San Juan, San Manuel, Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloneously (sic) have carnal knowledge of one REBELYN GARCIA y AGAPAY, a minor 10 years of age.&nbsp; That by reason thereof, to conceal his criminal act, with intent to kill, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously drown said Rebelyn Garcia y Agapay in the San Juan River of said municipality.&nbsp; The body of the victim was later retrieved at the Colobong Creek at Sitio Casilagan, Brgy. San Juan, San Manuel, Pangasinan, to the damage and prejudice of her heirs.<br><br>"Contrary to Art. 266-A, No. 1(d), Republic Act No. 8353, in relation to Art. 249, Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>When arraigned, with the assistance of counsel, Abulencia pleaded not guilty. At the trial, the prosecution presented six (6) witnesses, namely: Dr. Asuncion Tuvera, PO3 Avelino Sandi, PO3 Randy Bergado, Dennis Mojares, Reynaldo Garcia, Jr. and Reynaldo Garcia, Sr. The defense presented, as lone witness, Abulencia himself.<br><br>The facts are not disputed:<br><br>Rebelyn Garcia, the victim, was a 10-year old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> lass from Poblacion, Asingan, Pangasinan and a fourth grader at the Narciso Ramos Elementary School. She is the daughter of Reynaldo and Alicia Garcia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On August 4, 1998, at about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, Rebelyn's brother, Reynaldo Garcia, Jr., and a jeepney driver were at the Asingan jeepney terminal waiting for passengers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>After two (2) hours, accused Rolly Abulencia arrived and invited Reynaldo to a drinking spree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Reynaldo joined Abulencia and one Reynaldo Pascua in drinking Red Horse beer at the Asingan jeepney terminal.&nbsp; At about 12 o'clock noon, each one had consumed about four (4) bottles of beer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Reynaldo and Abulencia rode a tricycle and proceed to the former's residence at Poblacion, Asingan where they again drank beer and later slept on a bamboo bed (<i>papag</i>).&nbsp; Rebelyn was then inside the house.&nbsp; At that time, her parents were not around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Reynaldo and Abulencia woke up at about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon of that day.&nbsp; Abulencia then asked permission to buy <i>dilis </i>from a nearby store.&nbsp; But Reynaldo, noticing that Abulencia was drunk, advised the latter not to leave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Abulencia ignored Reynaldo and went out.&nbsp; Rebelyn tagged along.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Abulencia and Rebelyn never returned, although the store where they were supposed to buy <i>dilis </i>is merely 40 meters away from the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereupon, Reynaldo and his family started looking for the two as far as Rosales, Pangasinan but failed to find them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>About 8:00 o'clock in the evening, Abulencia surrendered to Mayor Felipe Sevilleja of San Manuel, Pangasinan.&nbsp; PO3 Randy Bergado, a PNP officer assigned in San Manuel who was then in the mayor's house, was informed by Abulencia that "he had a small girl companion that he accidentally bumped at the Aburido bridge" and who "might have been dead because the flow of the river is so fast."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>PO3 Bergado immediately turned over Abulencia to the San Manuel police station.&nbsp; Forthwith, PO3 Avelino Sandi entered the incident in the police blotter.&nbsp; Abulencia was later detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>At about 6:00 o'clock the following morning (August 5, 1998), Rebelyn's lifeless, naked body was found floating at the Colobong creek near the Aburido bridge at Sitio Casilagan, San Juan, San Manuel, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Dr. Asuncion Tuvera, Municipal Health Officer, conducted an autopsy on the victim's cadaver.&nbsp; The doctor's autopsy report states:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A.

He got nervous and proceeded to the house of his Auntie Deciang Delfin and asked her to accompany him to the authorities so he could surrender.&nbsp; They approached Mayor Sevilleja of San Miguel, Pangasinan.<br><br>After the trial on the merits, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered its decision dated March 16, 1999, convicting accused Rolly Abulencia of the crime as charged.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision states:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds ROLLY ABULENCIA y COYOS, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of aggravated RAPE WITH HOMICIDE (punishable under Article 266-A, No. 1(d) and Article 266-B, paragraph 4 of republic Act No. 8353, in relation to Article 249, Revised Penal Code and republic Act No. 7659) and the Court sentences Rolly Abulencia to suffer the penalty of DEATH, to be implemented in the manner provided for by law.&nbsp; Ordering the accused to indemnify the heirs of Rebelyn Garcia, the sum of P75,000.00 damages, and another sum of P20,000.00 for exemplary damages plus P6,425.00 as actual damages."<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Appellant Rolly Abulencia bewails his conviction, asserting that the court <i>a quo:</i><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>"x x x GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING (HIM) OF THE CRIME CHARGED BASED PRINCIPALLY ON THE MEDICO-LEGAL FINDINGS (EXHIBIT "A") AND DESPITE THE PAUCITY OF DIRECT EVIDENCE POINTING TO (HIM) AS THE CULPRIT IN THE X X X INCIDENT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>"x x x ERRED IN RELYING ON THE VULNERABILITY OF DEFENSE EVIDENCE RATHER THAN THE STRENGTH OF PROSECUTION EVIDENCE IN FINDING A VERDICT OF GUILT AGAINST (HIM)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant mainly contends that there is no direct evidence linking him to the commission of the crime and that the findings of the medico-legal officer are not sufficient to warrant his conviction by the trial court.<br><br>This Court does not agree.<br><br>Normally, the crime of rape - whether simple, qualified or complexed with other crimes - is committed in seclusion, thereby rendering its prosecution difficult owing to the absence of witnesses to its commission.<br><br>The prosecution of such crime becomes even more intricate and complex if homicide is committed since the victim herself would no longer be able to testify against the perpetrator.&nbsp; In most cases, only circumstantial evidence is available to prove its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The absence of direct evidence, however, does not preclude the conviction of a person accused of the complex crime of rape with homicide.&nbsp; Circumstantial evidence can be as potent as direct evidence to sustain a conviction provided that there is a concurrence of all the requisites prescribed in Section 5, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 5.&nbsp; <i>Circumstantial Evidence, when sufficient.- </i>Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:<br><br>"(a)&nbsp; There is more than one circumstance;<br><br>"(b)&nbsp; The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and<br><br>"(c)&nbsp; The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Likewise this Court has held that an accused can be convicted based on circumstantial evidence if the circumstances proven constitute an unbroken chain which leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Admittedly, in the case at bar, the trial court relied solely on circumstantial evidence in finding that the appellant is guilty as charged - and it did so correctly.<br><br>It is established from the testimony of prosecution witness Reynaldo Garcia, Jr. that he met the appellant in the morning of that fateful day of August 4, 1998 and later, both engaged in a drinking spree; that they slept on the <i>papag</i> of Garcia's house in the afternoon of that day; that the victim Rebelyn, was also in the same house at that time; that after waking up, the appellant left the house at about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon to buy <i>dilis</i> in the nearby store located 40 meters away, the victim tagging along; that the appellant and Rebelyn never returned; that in the evening of the same day, the appellant surrendered to Mayor Sevilleja, reporting that he was with the victim when the latter allegedly fell from the bridge after he "accidentally tripped <i>(napatid)</i> her" off; that the appellant admitted having raped the victim in a tape interview by Dennis Mojares, another prosecution witness; that the victim was found dead the following morning floating at the Colobong creek near the Aburido bridge; and that the autopsy conducted on her cadaver shows that she was sexually abused and, thereafter, brutally killed.<br><br>The appellant himself admitted that he was <b>alone with Rebelyn</b> in the evening of August 4, 1998.&nbsp; His only defense is that Rebelyn died because she accidentally fell from the bridge. We find her tale so fantastic to be accorded any iota of credibility.&nbsp; This is his incredible story:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"COURT: </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">How about Rebelyn when you left the house? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">I saw Rebelyn when I was on my way to the market, sir, she was at my back.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">On your way, Rebelyn was following you in the market?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"ATTY.
