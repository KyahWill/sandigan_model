				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup>of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 24, Naga City, finding accused-appellant Amador Bismonte guilty of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the complainant, Sarah Joy Casiao, the amounts of P50,000.00 as indemnity, P25,000.00 as moral damages, and the costs of the suit.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>On March 19, 1996, complainant Sarah Joy Casiao then 12 years old, assisted by her mother Jael Casiao, filed with the Municipal Trial Court of Pasacao, Camarines Sur a complaint for rape against accused-appellant Amador Bismonte on the basis of which an information was filed in the Regional Trial Court on June 4, 1996 charging --<br><blockquote>That on or about the 15th day of March 1996, at about 2:00 o'clock in the morning at Brgy. Antipolo, Municipality of Pasacao, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, by means of force and intimidation did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with. . . Sarah [Joy] Casiao a 12-year old, against her will and the offended party suffered damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and forthwith he was tried.<br><br>The prosecution presented evidence showing the following:<br><br>Sarah Joy Casiao, born on February 21, 1984, is the daughter of Jesus and Jael Casiao of Antipolo, Pasacao, Camarines Sur.&nbsp; At the time material to this case, the Casiao family lived in a nipa but located about a kilometer away from the barangay proper.&nbsp; The house, made of bamboo and other wooden materials, had no rooms and its occupants slept either on a bed placed on one side of the house or on the floor.&nbsp; Sarah Joy's parents earned their living by selling foodstuffs such as macaroni soup and pancit from a stall located near the cockpit in Centro Antipolo.&nbsp; They also raised and sold garlic and eggplant to supplement their income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On March 15, 1996, which is a <i>tupada</i> or cockfight day, the Casiao spouses opened their store as early as 1 o'clock in the afternoon. At 3 o'clock, Sarah Joy and her younger brother Izra, 10, and cousin John-john,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><sup> </sup>5, went to the store to help out. About three hours later, the children returned home and, after taking their dinner, went to sleep at around 10 o'clock in the evening. Sarah Joy left the door at the back of their house unlocked as her parents had not yet come home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Sometime later, Sarah Joy woke up because someone was focusing his flashlight on her face, She sat up and, from the illumination of the overnight lamp (<i>patentihan</i>) near her bed, recognized the intruder to be accused-appellant Amador Bismonte, a barriomate, whom she had known since birth. Accused-appellant warned her not to make any outcry. He grabbed complainant's left hand, went behind her, and covered her mouth.&nbsp; Without removing his hand, accused-appellant dragged Sarah Joy out of the house.&nbsp; As she was being taken out, Sarah Joy tried to wake Izra and John-john up but the two remained fast asleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the backyard, accused-appellant pushed Sarah Joy to the ground, sat astride her, pulled down her shorts and underwear with one hand, and had sexual intercourse with her. Accused-appellant prevented Sarah Joy from shouting by covering her mouth with his hand.&nbsp; Before leaving, accused-appellant warned complainant not to report the incident to anyone or she would be killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Sarah Joy went back inside their house crying and woke up Izra and John-john. At around 2:00 a.m., Jesus and Jael Casiao came home from the store and found their daughter inside the house, naked from the waist down, crying, and trembling.&nbsp; The sleeping area was in disarray and there were muddy footprints all over the house.&nbsp; Sarah Joy told them that she had been raped by accused-appellant.&nbsp; Jesus Casiao took his bolo and would have gone to accused-appellant's house had be not been prevailed upon by his wife to let the authorities take care of the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At 5:30 in the morning of that day, March 16, 1996, Jesus Casiao went to the then barangay chairman of Antipolo, Serino Ador, to report the assault on his daughter.&nbsp; Jesus also reported the incident to the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Pasacao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><sup> </sup>At around 5:20 that afternoon, Jesus Casiao took Sarah Joy to the Bicol Medical Center in Naga City for a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Dr. Emily Papica, who had examined Sarah Joy, issued the following certification (Exh.

On cross-examination, Mrs. Casiao admitted that the figures she had testified to were rough estimates only and that she was unsure about the amount for the medical expenses her family incurred although she was certain they paid P1,000.00 for medicines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The defense then presented its case.&nbsp; Testifying in his behalf, accused-appellant, 32, denied the allegations against him.&nbsp; He claimed that, at the time of the incident, he was working in a bakery owned by his brother-in-law Rodrigo Sibulo in Barangay Centro of Antipolo.&nbsp; He said that he, his brother-in-law, and his cousin, Romeo Beringuela, started making bread at 7 o'clock in the evening and finished work at around 6 o'clock in the morning of the following day, March 16, 1996. Thereafter, he went straight home and slept.&nbsp; He said that at no time during that period did he leave the bakery and that it was only after he was arrested on March 18, 1996 that he first heard of the rape of Sarah Joy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, accused-appellant admitted knowing Sarah Joy and her family's residence.&nbsp; He said that he was a barangay tanod in their barangay and, as such, he was issued a flashlight.&nbsp; However, he denied having used it in the evening of March 15, 1996 because he was allegedly in the bakery of Sibulo at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Rodrigo Sibulo and Romeo Beringuela corroborated accused-appellant's alibi.&nbsp; Both claimed they were with accused-appellant in Sibulo's bakery from 7:00 in the evening of March 15, 1996 to 6:00 in the morning of March 16, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Beringuela said that the Casiao residence was about 300 meters from Sibulo's bakery and that the distance could be traversed in three minutes by foot.&nbsp; He also stated that when there was a <i>tupada </i>or cockfight, the barangay tanods would patrol the streets at night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>For his part, Sibulo testified that throughout the evening of March 15, 1996, his bakery was using electricity provided by the Camarines Sur I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (CASURECO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The defense next presented Rodolfo Brusola, who testified that complainant's mother, Jael Casiao, as barangay treasurer in 1997, failed to account for some P10,000.00 of barangay funds which she had to reimburse.&nbsp; Upon motion of the prosecution, however, the trial court disallowed the defense from further proceeding with its questioning regarding this point pursuant to Rule 130, Â§51(a)(3),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><sup> </sup>considering that the proposed testimony did not concern the moral character of complainant but that of her mother, Jael Casiao. Nevertheless, Brusola was allowed to testify on the alleged good moral character of accused-appellant.&nbsp; Brusola admitted, however, that part of accused-appellant's duty as a barangay tanod was to patrol the barangay in the evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>To discredit accused-appellant's testimony that he was working at Sibulo's bakery from 7:00 in the evening of March 15, 1996 to 6:00 in the morning of March 16, 1996, the prosecution recalled Jesus and Jael Casiao to the witness stand.&nbsp; Jael Casiao testified that it was not true that accused-appellant was in Sibulo's bakery throughout the evening of March 15, 1996 because she in fact saw him at around 10:00 p.m. that night when he bought a bowl of macaroni soup and pancit from her food stall. She said that accused-appellant even lingered for a while in the store.&nbsp; Jael remembered him saying that he was hungry and that it was difficult having to live in a place far away.&nbsp; Jael also said that sometime that night, she went to Sibulo's bakery, which was located just five to six meters from her store, to buy some bread.&nbsp; The bakeshop, however, was already closed. She peeped through the slats on the side of the bakery and saw several people inside fast asleep.&nbsp; On cross-examination, she explained that she and her husband kept their store open long after the <i>tupada </i>had ended that day at the request of some customers, for whom she prepared meals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Jesus Casiao corroborated his wife's testimony.&nbsp; According to him, at around 10 o'clock in the evening of March 15, 1996, accused-appellant went to their store for macaroni soup and pancit and that he stayed there for a while.&nbsp; Between 11:00 to 11:45 p.m. he claimed he again saw accused-appellant while he (Jesus Casiao) was on his way to the store of one Salvador PeÃ±ales to buy kerosene for the Coleman lamp used in their store.&nbsp; According to Jesus Casiao, accused-appellant inquired about his (Jesus Casiao's) nephew, Edgar Salem, whose whereabouts he did not know. Accused-appellant then went towards the direction of the school grounds nearby.&nbsp; Jesus recalled that accused-appellant was wearing a sweater, a pair of jogging pants, and boots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also presented Gloria Casili and Elmer Malate, Administrative Officer and Technical Services Department Manager of CASURECO, respectively, to rebut Rodrigo Sibulo's testimony that as of March 15, 1996, CASURECO was already supplying electricity to Antipolo, and that he had already subscribed to the cooperative at that time.&nbsp; Casili testified that although barangay Antipolo was within the coverage of CASURECO, it was only on April 10, 1996 that CASURECO was able to service that area.&nbsp; In addition, she submitted a certification issued by CASURECO's general manager, attesting that as of February 1, 1999 it had no registered subscriber in barangay Antipolo by the name of Rodrigo Sibulo.&nbsp; On the other hand, Malate submitted a certification, also issued by CASURECO's general manager, attesting to the fact that Sibulo did not have electrical connection from any of the barangays adjoining Antipolo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In an attempt to discredit the Casiao spouses' rebuttal testimony, the defense in turn presented Miguel Tayoto, fellow barangay tanod of accused-appellant in Antipolo.&nbsp; Tayoto stated that the cockpit arena, the Casiaos' food stall, and Sibulo's bakery were all within view from his house and that before retiring at 10 o'clock in the evening of March 15, 1996, he looked out of the window of his room towards the cockpit arena and saw that the area was deserted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 1999, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads -<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the court finds that the prosecution has ably established the guilt of the accused, Amador Bismonte, beyond reasonable doubt and hereby sentences him to reclusion perpetua, to indemnify the victim Sarah Joy Casiao in the amount of P50,000.00, to pay her moral damages in the sum of P25,000.00 and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges that --<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE CATEGORICAL TESTIMONY OF THE MEDICO-LEGAL OFFICER NEGATING THE PROBABILITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT UPON THE ALLEGED VICTIM.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN DISALLOWING THE DEFENSE TO PRESENT PROOF OF ILL-MOTIVE ON THE PART OF THE COMPLAINANT (MOTHER OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM) IN INSTITUTING THE INSTANT MALICIOUS CHARGE AGAINST THE ACCUSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><i>First</i>.&nbsp; Accused-appellant cites the findings of Dr. Papica that there were no signs of external injuries on the victim and, although there were lacerations in complainant's hymen, the same had healed.&nbsp; Accused-appellant argues that this negate complainant's claim that she had been raped a few hours prior to the medical examination.<br><br>This contention has no merit.&nbsp; The absence of external injuries and/or of fresh hymenal lacerations does not necessarily negate the commission of rape as neither constitutes an element of this crime as defined in Art. 335 (1) (now Art. 266-A par. 1(a)) of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; What is required to be proved is carnal knowledge by use of force or intimidation.&nbsp; The testimony of complainant establishes these two elements.

No. 50041, January 27, 1989, 169 SCRA 530)<br><br>Secondly, the hymen is lacerated only once and, as a rule, this happens during the first sexual act, however, this is not always the case (Solis, <i>supra</i>, pp. 341, 343-344). The laceration of the hymen can be caused by any of the following:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Passage of clotted blood during menstruation.<br><br></li><li>Ulceration due to diseases, like diphteria.<br><br></li><li>Jumping or running.<br><br></li><li>Falling on hard or sharp objects.<br><br></li><li>Medical instrumentation.<br><br></li><li>Local application or irritation.<br><br></li><li>Self-scratching due to irritation.<br><br></li><li>Masturbation.<br><br></li><li>Insertion of foreign bodies.<br><br></li><li>Previous operation.<br></li></ol></blockquote>(Solis, Legal Medicine, <i>supra</i>, p. 344)<br><br>Hence, [a] complainant's hymen could have been previously lacerated due to any of the foregoing causes.&nbsp; If so, the absence of any fresh laceration due to the alleged rape is not surprising and does not indicate that she was not raped.<br></blockquote>Indeed, this Court have sustained convictions for rape despite the fact that the victim did not exhibit external injuries<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> or that healed, and not fresh, hymenal lacerations were detected after an examination conducted on the same day,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the following day,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or three days<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> after the commission of the rape.<br><br>At any rate, as earlier stated, Sarah Joy clearly explained how, by intimidation and physical strength, accused-appellant, a 32 year-old barangay tanod, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; For purposes of establishing the element of force or intimidation in rape, it is not necessary that it be of such character as could not be resisted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> As has been held in a case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the victim need not kick, bite, hit, slap, or scratch the offender with her fingernails to show that she has been raped; it is sufficient that the woman yielded because of an authentic apprehension of bodily harm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant contends that it was improbable for Sarah Joy to have immediately recognized him in view of the glare of flashlight on her face which must have "momentarily blinded" her.&nbsp; This contention is likewise without merit.&nbsp; Sarah Joy explained that she was able to recognize accused-appellant because of the light from a lamp, located a meter away from her bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> She had no difficulty identifying accused-appellant because she had known him all her life.<br><br>Neither is there any merit to accused-appellant's contention that Sarah Joy's testimony that she had suffered moral damages as a result of the rape in the amount of P100,000.00, "runs counter to the deportment of a grieving and anxious victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Sarah Joy's testimony is even unnecessary because the law presumes that she has suffered as a result of the rape and is thus entitled to moral damages without need of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As held in <i>People v.

Accused-appellant assails the credibility of complainant's parents, Jesus and Jael Casiao.&nbsp; He contends that Jael Casiao's conduct in "fussing" over the expenses her family incurred in relation to the prosecution of this case betrays her true motive to obtain money with which to settle her liability to the barangay for funds which she could not account.&nbsp; Accused-appellant likewise claims that it was improbable for the Casiaos to have kept their food stall open until the early morning of March 16, 1996 considering that the <i>tupada </i>ended at 6 o'clock in the afternoon of the previous day, March 15, 1996. Lastly, he says that it is unbelievable for anyone to play "toss coin" at that late hour, as the Casiao couple had testified, since the electricity for the barangay had been cut off earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>These contentions are likewise without merit.&nbsp; Jael Casiao testified on the expenses incurred by her family in prosecuting this case as a prosecution witness.&nbsp; The trial court, therefore, correctly ruled that the defense cannot introduce evidence showing that she owed the barangay money she allegedly misappropriated, as the issue concerns Jael's reputation and not that her daughter, Sarah Joy Casiao.&nbsp; Needless to say, there is no basis for the claim of the defense that complainant's parents, especially her mother, instigated the filing of this case for ulterior motives.<br><br>As for the fact that the Casiao kept their food stall open until the early hours of March 16, 2001, Jael Casiao satisfactorily explained that it was because some individuals from a neighboring barangay had asked her to prepare dinner for them, and not because there were people playing "toss coin." What she said was that some individuals usually stayed behind even after the <i>tupada </i>had closed, playing "toss coin."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In contrast to the testimonies of Sarah Joy and her parents which are consistent, accused-appellant's defense of alibi suffers from serious contradictions. Thus, (1) accused-appellant's testimony that Romeo Beringuela, Rodrigo Sibulo, and himself baked 25 kilos of flour in the evening of March 15, 1996 only in one "setting"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> contradicts Sibulo's statement that they baked the flour in two settings by first mixing half of the 25 kilos of flour and cutting the dough into pieces and that it was only after this was done that the other half was similarly prepared;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (2) Sibulo's statement that after operating the bakery for six months, Beringuela, accused-appellant's alleged assistant, learned how to bake bread (such that when accused-appellant was on duty as barangay tanod, Beringuela took care of baking the bread while he (Sibulo) assisted him)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> is contradicted by Beringuela who declared that after the arrest of accused-appellant, the bakery had to close because "nobody can mix the dough"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>; and (3) accused-appellant's testimony that he started working in Sibulo's bakery in February 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52] </sup>does not coincide with Sibulo's statement that he hired accused-appellant as early as March 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The defense's version of events is further rendered unlikely by the testimony not only of Jesus Casiao but also that of the defense witnesses Tayoto and Beringuela that the electricity provided by the barangay generator is shut off before 12:00 in the evening. Taken in conjunction with the testimonies of the personnel of the CASURECO that it was only on April 16, 1996 that CASURECO supplied electricity to Barangay Antipolo, it is clear that it would have been next to impossible for accused-appellant and his alleged companions to have baked the 25 kilos of flour throughout the evening of March 15, 1996 up to the early morning of March 16, 1996 without electricity.<br><br>Even granting that accused-appellant was working in Sibulo's bakery on the night in question, it was not impossible for him to have gone to private complainant's house, which is only about a kilometer away, commit the crime, and then go back to Sibulo's bakery.
