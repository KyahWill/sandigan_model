Wounded, the two proceeded to the house of Romeo Matias, Sr., where they met the latter's wife, Isidra Matias. Rendor and Flores confided to Isidra that they were ambushed by Pamfilo Quimson with some unidentified companions. Raul Rendor was noticeably weak and pale, and he was constantly clutching his stomach, while Antonio Flares was trembling. Thereafter, Isidra told their family driver to bring Rendor and Flores to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Wilfredo Matias, who earlier accompanied another victim, met Rendor and Flores at the Albay Provincial Hospital where the two were subsequently brought. There, Rendor told Wilfredo Matias that Pamfilo Quimson was one of their assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The following day, Raul Rendor was operated on in order to repair the perforated wounds in his right diaphragm and the lacerated wounds in his lungs. Surgical packs were temporarily placed inside his body to prevent further bleeding at the back of his liver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In the morning of August 21, 1995, Raul Rendor underwent a second operation to remove the said surgical packs. Later that day, Raul Rendor died of respiratory failure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Penafiel, SPO3 Bea and P03 Borromeo were the first policemen to respond to the ambush-slaying of Matias' group at the corner of Colon and Mabini Streets.&nbsp; The three policemen found the blue Tamaraw FX resting on the shoulder of the road.&nbsp; They took Glenda Villareal and Romeo Matias, Sr. to the Pio Duran Memorial Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Minutes later, SPO3 Iglesia arrived at the crime scene and secured it. He saw the Tamaraw FX slanting on the right shoulder of the road and facing the direction of the house of Romeo Matias, Sr., some 100 meters ahead. He found the body of Crisaldo Guimba, which had been lifted out of the Tamaraw FX by onlookers, lying on the road some three (3) meters from the rear of the ambushed vehicle. He made a sketch and caused the vehicle to be photographed. He also recovered 39 empty bullet shells from the crime scene.<br><br>Based on the physical evidence at hand, Major Arroyo of the PNP Crime Laboratory concluded that the ambush vehicle was fired upon from the right side and at the back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the investigation of the shooting incident was transferred to the Task Force Katarungan under Senior Superintendent D. Saminiano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><sup> </sup>On August 19, 1995, the Task Force went to the Albay Provincial Hospital to interview Raul Rendor. His wife Vivian and his attending physician, Dr. Barrosa gave their consent to the interview.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><sup> </sup>The investigation was brief because the witness was in pain and had difficulty in breathing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><sup> </sup>The sworn statement of the late Raul Rendor pointed to accused Pamfilo Quimson as one of the gunmen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Based on the evidence presented, the court a quo found the injuries and cause of death of the victims to be as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"ROMEO MATIAS, SR.: He died on the spot. There were sixteen (16) gunshot wounds of varying sizes, some characterized by contusion collars and tattooing. Gunshot Wound No. 2 involved an avulsion of the scalp and evisceration of the tissues of the brain. Each of the wounds was fatal. The cause of death is `hemorrhagic shock due to skull fracture, secondary to multiple fatal gunshot wounds with brain tissue evisceration' (Exhibit `C').<br><br>"CRISALDO GUIMBA: He died also on the spot. He sustained fourteen (14) gunshot wounds, mostly at the back. The most fatal is wound No. 1 which involved skull fracture and avulsion of the scalp. The cause of death is also `hemorrhagic shock due to skull fracture secondary to fatal gunshot wounds' (Exhibit `E').<br><br>"RAUL RENDOR: He sustained gunshot wounds involving vital organs of the body and died on August 21, 1995,<b><i> </i></b>at Albay Provincial Hospital. The cause of death is `respiratory failure, secondary to gunshot wounds' (Exhibit `J').<br><br>"GLENDA VILLAREAL: No medical evidence was presented. However, witnesses testified that they saw her wounded and had to be brought to the Albay Provincial Hospital where she died on August 18, 1995.<br><br>"ANTONIO FLORES: He did not testify in the case. There is no medical evidence to prove his injuries."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>On October 2, 1995, accused-appellant Pamfilo Quimson was charged with Multiple Murder and Frustrated Murder under the following information:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Albay, hereby accuses PAMFILO QUIMSON alias NOEL QUIMSON, of the crime of MULTIPLE MURDER with FRUSTRATED MURDER, committed as follows:<br><br>`That on or about 8:45 in the evening of August 17, 1995 at Barangay Bagumbayan, Ligao, Albay, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, together with two male persons, who are still unidentified, conspiring, confederating and helping each other for a common purpose, with intent to kill, with treachery, evident premeditation and with the use of firearms (M-16, M-14 and 9MM pistol), did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously fire at a blue colored Tamaraw FX, causing the death of the following passengers - ROMEO MATIAS, SR., GRISALDO GUIMBA, RAUL RENDOR and GLENDA VILLAREAL y BORBE; seriously wounding ANTONIO "REY" FLORES which would have produced the crime of MURDER, as a consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason or cause independent of the will of the perpetrators, that is the immediate medical assistance given to Flores, to the damage and prejudice of the victims and their heirs.'<br><br>"ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment on November 14, 1995, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In disowning liability for the offense charged; accused-appellant interposed the defense of alibi. At around 8 o' clock in the evening of August 17, 1995, accused-appellant claimed that he was in Macalaya, Castilla, Sorsogon, with two of his fellow soldiers in the house of a <i>barangay kagawad. </i>According to accused-appellant, they were then drinking in the said house located just outside their camp from 5:00 in the afternoon to 10:00 in the evening. Thereafter, accused-appellant and his two companions returned to their quarters inside the military camp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, accused-appellant was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and was sentenced accordingly. With the court <i>a quo's </i>imposition of the death penalty, the case is now before us on automatic review. Accused-appellant raises the following errors:<br><br><blockquote>"ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING THE STATEMENT OF RAUL RENDOR AS A DYING DECLARATION AND BASING ITS JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION UPON IT.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THERE EXISTED EVIDENCE OF <i>RES GESTAE, </i>AND BASING ITS JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION UPON IT.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED ON THE BASIS OF INADMISSIBLE, INCREDIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE AND IGNORING THE MORE CREDIBLE AND PREPONDERANT EVIDENCE FOR THE ACCUSED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The appeal is not meritorious.<br><br>We have long since held that in order for a dying declaration to be admissible in evidence, the following requisites must concur: (1) the declaration was made by the deceased under consciousness of his impending death; (2) the deceased was at the time competent as a witness; (3) the declaration concerns the cause and surrounding circumstance of the declarant's death; and (4) it is offered in a criminal case wherein the declarant's death is the subject of inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The only question raised by accused-appellant against the admissibility of the written ante mortem statement of Raul Rendor is whether or not the latter made his declaration under the consciousness of his impending death. Accused-appellant invites our attention to that portion of the said statement wherein Rendor promised to give a <i>supplemental statement </i>after he had recovered, and to the fact that the same was made almost twelve (12) hours after Rendor's first operation. He also points to the testimony of Dr. Barrosa, Rendor's physician, admitting that Rendor was <i>quite fine.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>At first glance, it would seem that appellant's argument may have some basis. A thorough study of Dr. Barrosa's testimony, however, would prove the contrary.<br><br><blockquote>"x x x<br><br>"CONDITION OF PATIENT:<br>- conscious, coherent, ambulatory<br>- Blood Pressure: 100/80<br>- Cardiac Rate: 120/min.<br><br>"BRIEF HISTORY:<br><br>- Nature of Incident: Ambushed<br>- Time of Incident: 8:30 P.M.<br>- Place of Incident: Centro, Ligao, Albay<br><br>"Physical Examination revealed the following findings:<br>- there was a round wound below the right scapular area<br>- another round wound through and through at the back of his leg<br>- Abdomen was flat<br>- with abdominal tenderness at the right upper quadrant<br>- other quadrant soft, no guarding<br><br>"IMPRESSION:<br><br>- intra-thoracic injury<br>- intra- abdominal injury"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>"x x x<br><br>"A- Operative Findings of the first operation of Raul Rendor:<br>- the patient was placed under general anesthesia<br>- Close tube thoracotomy (right) F32 rectal tube revealing a pint of fresh blood and evacuating around<br>- midline incision carried from skin down to peritoneum<br>- upon opening the abdominal wall, 2.0 liters of blood consisting of clotted and non-clotted was found or evacuated<br><br>- recovery of slug inside abdominal cavity<br>- around 750 cc of clotted blood was evacuated<br><br>"a) 2.5"cm. lacerated wound was seen at the anterior surface of right lobe of liver<br><br>"b) stellate-shaped laceration around 7.0 cm. in greatest diameter noted surrounded by necrotic liver tissues postero lateral surface of the (right) lobe of liver<br><br>- a 2.0 cm. perforation of the right diaphragm was also seen<br>- repair of diaphragmatic laceration was done using chronic I straumatic needle<br>- repairing liver laceration using parenchyma suture of metal patching was done<br>- bleeding persisted<br>- application of 7 square packs surrounding the liver was done<br>- close<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td width="91%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Will you explain in layman's language the findings you have read? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">This 2.5 aceration of the right lobe of liver.

The purpose of this is to prevent the bleeding of the liver."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>The medical findings quoted above show just how serious Rendor's condition was. With two vital organs damaged, his arduous discomfort and agonizing pain are quite real. More so since the effect of anesthesia had obviously worn off after almost 12 hours from the first operation.&nbsp; We also take note of Dr. Barrosa's impression of Rendor who was perceptibly fatigued and in anguish during the taking of the latter's statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In fact, Rendor could not even bring himself to sign his declaration. After only six questions, the interview had to be stopped.&nbsp; He only had enough strength left to place his thumbmark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><sup> </sup>Indeed, Rendor was in such a precarious state that the idea of dying could not have escaped him.<br><br>In the early case of <b>U.S. vs. Virrey,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><sup> </sup>this court had occasion to illustrate some of the means by which to determine the declarant's state of mind at the time he gives his ante mortem statement.<br><br>"This may be shown by the words or statements of the declarant himself, or it may be inferred from the nature and extent of the wounds inflicted. It may also be shown by his conduct at the time and the communications, if any, made to him by his medical adviser or others, if acquiesced in by him. The fact that a clergyman has administered to him the last rites of the church also tends to show that he was under the sense of approaching death. (citations omitted)<br><br>"When death supervenes speedily after such a declaration is made, the inference that the declarant realized his condition may be obvious; but it should be remembered that it is the belief in impending death and not the rapid succession of death, in point of fact, that renders the testimony admissible. The admissibility of the declaration, as is thus apparent, depends on the state of declarant's mind at the time of making the declaration; and the mere fact that death does not immediately follow will not render the declaration inadmissible, provided death does ensue as a result of the injuries which are the subject of the declaration."<br><br>The isolated pronouncements of Dr. Barrosa as pointed out by accused-appellant are not persuasive. These were but the result of the mismatch between the good doctor and the cunning defense counsel. When the doctor was provided the chance to explain and clarify his answers however, Rendor's true condition was affirmed.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP">"x x x </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td width="91%"><div align="JUSTIFY">And the surgery was done at 1:20 P.M. of August 18?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Or in the afternoon of the following day?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And it was done that time because you did not find anything urgent with respect to the patient?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A -</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">In general, <b><i>his blood volume </i></b>is very low and his complaint of on and off pain of the upper portion of his abdomen, that's why initially, I was already contemplating of ...</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And the purpose of the operation was to evacuate the blood stocked up or accumulated on his thorax and abdominal cavity?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The primary reason is that operation called "exploratory laparotomy", wherein in entirety, the midline portion of the abdomen was being opened from the upper portion of the area going down.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And that operation shows that there was no danger?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And because of that finding, the surgeons applied packs to stop the bleeding?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A -</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And they succeeded doing so?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A -</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"COURT:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q -</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The examining counsel wanted to know from you doctor, why several hours had elapsed before the actual operation could be performed on the patient.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Before we operate on the patient, I still build up the patient.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q -</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">What do you mean by building up?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>To correct his blood volume;

Rendor's assent was with regard to his willingness to give a subsequent statement rather than on the investigator's vain hope for the declarant's recovery.<br><br>Now, even without the questioned written declarations of Rendor, his spontaneous disclosure of their assailants to Mrs. Matias, in whose house they took refuge immediately after the ambush,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> is likewise admissible as an ante mortem statement. With the pain and discomfort from his injured lung and liver, with his heart rate increasing due to the loss of blood from his internal wounds, and with no medical assistance still in sight, Rendor's state of mind was unmistakably on his possible dissolution.<br><br>And even granting for the sake of argument that such a statement is not admissible as a dying declaration, the same may still be admitted as part of <i>res gestae </i>since it was made immediately after the startling occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><sup> </sup>Rendor's declaration before Mrs. Matias is genuinely an emanation of the incident for he had then no opportunity to concoct or contrive an untrue version of the attack.<br><br>In support of his second assigned error, accused-appellant attacks the probative value of the late Raul Rendor's declarations. He argues that the result of the police investigation belies Rendor's statement mentioning an M-14 rifle as one of those used in the ambush. Then he claims that Rendor and Pamfilo Quimson did not know each other, hence, could not have possibly identified the latter. He also claims that Rendor's seat in the ill-fated vehicle prevented him from seeing their assailants, plus the fact that the natural response of Rendor would have been to seek cover.<br><br>We are not convinced. The lack of precision with which Rendor identified one of the firearms used is of no moment for we cannot expect him to have full knowledge on the matter. Similarly, We do not accept accused-appellant's argument that Rendor would not have seen their assailants because he was seated at the back of the driver. No evidence, testimonial or otherwise was ever advanced to establish this. On the other hand, there is evidence to the effect that Rendor was seated beside the driver. Be that as it may, the fact that Rendor was seated elsewhere will not prevent him from seeing their attackers. Contrary to what accused-appellant argues, jurisprudence recognizes that victims of criminal violence have a penchant for seeing the looks, faces and features of their assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><sup> </sup>Aside from seeking cover from the volley of gunshots, it is equally natural for Rendor to strive to see the appearance of their attackers and observe the manner the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's contention that Rendor doesn't know the former is likewise not enough to discredit the questioned declarations.&nbsp; Generally, people in rural communities know each other either by face, by name or both.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><sup> </sup>While Rendor is originally from Oas and accused-appellant is from Ligao, the former's wife testified that they stayed for about three (3) years in Ligao sometime after they got married.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><sup> </sup>Also according to her, their house is near that of the Quimson's. She also testified that they occasionally pass by the Quimson's in going to the market and would even see accused-appellant. While Rendor and accused-appellant may not have been friends, it is unlikely that their paths had not crossed during those three (3) years that the Rendor spouses stayed in Ligao. Besides, the degree of closeness or familiarity with the accused-appellant on the part of the witness, although helpful, is by no means an indispensable requirement for the purpose of identifying the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, accused-appellant's claim that he made himself scarce in Ligao is both unbelievable and unsubstantiated to deserve consideration. It is quite incredible that accused would only spend a maximum of two (2) hours during his visit to his family in Ligao,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><sup> </sup>if indeed his visits were infrequent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><sup> </sup>He could not even remember the very few times that he went to Ligao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He also failed to substantiate his claim, that he stayed in Tigaon, Camarines Sur after graduating from high school, by presenting his aunt in whose house he allegedly stayed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>As regards his third assigned error, we find the same to be full of holes. The evidence he offered is inadequate to support his defense of alibi. In order for us to consider such a defense, accused-appellant must convincingly prove that it was impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><sup> </sup>Where there is the least chance for him to be present at the crime scene, alibi will not hold water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On its own, accused-appellant's alibi is already defective. While he claims that, upon returning to camp in the afternoon of August 16, 1995 he never left, he did admit subsequently of having a drinking session some 30 meters outside their camp the following night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The same night that Romeo Matias, Sr. and his group were ambushed. Add to this the camp's slack policy on monitoring the whereabouts of its soldiers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>and accused-appellant's alibi becomes unreliable for it shows that he can easily leave camp unobserved. The corroborative evidence on the alleged drinking session that fateful night is equally unreliable because when such evidence is offered by his friends and relatives, the same is held with extreme suspicion considering the facility by which it may be fabricated or concocted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> More so when these witnesses themselves prove to be unreliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Finally, accused-appellant also claims that their camp from Ligao, Albay takes a good five (5) hours of travel. He tempers It down however, when he added that the five (5) hour travel time includes waiting time. Subsequently though, he also admitted that when he was arrested by the police, it took them three (3) hours more or less, to reach Ligao, Albay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><sup> </sup>Hence, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the proximate time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>All these considered, we affirm the findings of the trial court and hold accused-appellant Pamfilo Quimson guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of Murder.<br><br>As to the award of damages, the trial, court failed to award <i>civil indemnity </i>or compensatory damages to the heirs of the victim.
