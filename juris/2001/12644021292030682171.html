				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On May 1, 2001, President Macapagal-Arroyo, faced by an "angry and violent mob armed with explosives, firearms, bladed weapons, clubs, stones and other deadly weapons" assaulting and attempting to break into Malacañang, issued Proclamation No. 38 declaring that there was a state of rebellion in the National Capital Region.&nbsp; She likewise issued General Order No. 1 directing the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to suppress the rebellion in the National Capital Region.&nbsp; Warrantless arrests of several alleged leaders and promoters of the "rebellion" were thereafter effected.<br><br>Aggrieved by the warrantless arrests, and the declaration of a "state of rebellion," which allegedly gave a semblance of legality to the arrests, the following four related petitions were filed before the Court-<br><br>(1) G.R. No. 147780 for prohibition, injunction, <i>mandamus</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i> (with an urgent application for the issuance of temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction) filed by Panfilo M. Lacson, Michael Ray B. Aquino, and Cezar O. Mancao; (2) G.R. No. 147781 for <i>mandamus</i> and/or review of the factual basis for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, with prayer for a temporary restraining order filed by Miriam Defensor-Santiago; (3) G.R. No. 147799 for prohibition and injunction with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or restraining order filed by Rolando A. Lumbao; and (4) G.R. No. 147810 for certiorari and prohibition filed by the political party <i>Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino</i>.<br><br>All the foregoing petitions assail the declaration of a state of rebellion by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the warrantless arrests allegedly effected by virtue thereof, as having no basis both in fact an in law. Significantly, on May 6, 2001, President Macapagal-Arroyo ordered the lifting of the declaration of a "state of rebellion" in Metro Manila.&nbsp; Accordingly, the instant petitions have been rendered moot and academic.&nbsp; As to petitioner's claim that the proclamation of a "state of rebellion" is being used by the authorities to justify warrantless arrests, the Secretary of Justice denies that it has issued a particular order to arrest specific persons in connection with the "rebellion." He states that what is extant are general instructions to law enforcement officers and military agencies to implement Proclamation No. 38.&nbsp; Indeed, as stated in respondents' Joint Comments:<br><br><blockquote><b>[I]t is already the declared intention of the Justice Department and police authorities to obtain regular warrants of arrests from the courts for all acts committed prior to and until May 1, 2001 which means that preliminary investigators will henceforth be conducted.</b><br><br><div style="margin-left: 200px;">(Comment, G.R. No. 147780, p. 28; G.R. No. 147781, p. 18; G.R. No. 147799, p. 16; G.R. No. 147810, p. 24)<br></div></blockquote><br>With this declaration, petitioners' apprehensions as to warrantless arrests should be laid to rest.<br><br>In quelling or suppressing the rebellion, the authorities may only resort to warrantless arrests of persons suspected of rebellion, as provided under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, if the circumstances so warrant. The warrantless arrest feared by petitioners is, thus, not based on the declaration of a "state of rebellion."<br><br>Moreover, petitioners' contention in G.R. No. 147780 (<i>Lacson Petition</i>), 147781 (<i>Defensor-Santiago Petition</i>), and 147799 (<i>Lumbao Petition</i>) that they are under imminent danger of being arrested without warrant do not justify their resort to the extraordinary remedies of <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition, since an individual subjected to warrantless arrest is not without adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law.&nbsp; Such an individual may ask for a preliminary investigation under Rule 112 of the Rules of court, where he may adduce evidence in his defense, or he may submit himself to inquest proceedings to determine whether or not he should remain under custody and correspondingly be charged in court.&nbsp; Further, a person subject of a warrantless arrest must be delivered to the proper judicial authorities within the periods provided in Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, otherwise the arresting officer could be held liable for delay in the delivery of detained persons.&nbsp; Should the detention be without legal ground, the person arrested can charge the arresting officer with arbitrary detention. All this is without prejudice to his filing an action for damages against the arresting officer under Article 32 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; Verily, petitioners have a surfeit of other remedies which they can avail themselves of, thereby making the prayer for prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> improper at this time (Sections 2 and 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).<br><br>Aside from the foregoing reasons, several considerations likewise inevitably call for the dismissal of the petitions at bar.<br><br><i>G.R. No. 147780</i><br><br>In connection with their alleged impending warrantless arrest, petitioners Lacson, Aquino, and Mancao pray that the "appropriate court before whom the informations against petitioners are filed be directed to desist from arraigning and proceeding with the trial of the case, until the instant petition is finally resolved." This relief is clearly premature considering that as of this date, no complaints or charges have been filed against any of the petitioners for any crime.&nbsp; And in the event that the same are later filed, this court cannot enjoin criminal prosecution conducted in accordance with the Rules of Court, for by that time any arrest would have been in pursuance of a duly issued warrant.<br><br>As regards petitioner's prayer that the hold departure orders issued against them be declared null and void <i>ab initio</i>, it is to be noted that petitioners are not directly assailing the validity of the subject hold departure orders in their petition.&nbsp; The are not even expressing intention to leave the country in the near future. The prayer to set aside the same must be made in proper proceedings initiated for that purpose.<br><br>Anent petitioner's allegations <i>ex abundante ad cautelam</i> in support of their application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, it is manifest that the writ is not called for since its purpose is to relieve petitioners from unlawful restraint (<i>Ngaya-an v. Balweg</i>, 200 SCRA 149 [1991]), a matter which remains speculative up to this very day.<br><br><i>G.R. No. 147781</i><br><br>The petition herein is denominated by petitioner Defensor-Santiago as one for <i>mandamus.</i>&nbsp; It is basic in matters relating to petitions for <i>mandamus</i> that the legal right of the petitioner to the performance of a particular act which is sought to be compelled must be clear and complete.&nbsp; <i>Mandamus</i> will not issue the right to relief is clear at the time of the award (<i>Palileo v. Ruiz Castro</i>, 85 Phil. 272).&nbsp; Up to the present time, petitioner Defensor-Santiago has not shown that she is in imminent danger of being arrested without a warrant.&nbsp; In point of fact, the authorities have categorically stated that petitioner will not be arrested without a warrant.<br><br><i>G.R. No. 147799</i><br><br>Petitioner Lumbao, leader of the People's Movement against Poverty (PMAP), for his part, argues that the declaration of a "state of rebellion" is violative of the doctrine of separation of powers, being an encroachment on the domain of the judiciary which has the constitutional prerogative to "determine or interpret" what took place on May 1, 2001, and that the declaration of a state of rebellion cannot be an exception to the general rule on the allocation of the governmental powers.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; To be sure, section 18, Article VII of the Constitution expressly provides that "[t]he President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion..." thus, we held in Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Hon. Zamora, (G.R. No. 141284, August 15, 2000):<br><br><blockquote>xxx The factual necessity of calling out the armed forces is not easily quantifiable and cannot be objectively established since matters considered for satisfying the same is a combination of several factors which are not always accessible to the courts. Besides the absence of testual standards that the court may use to judge necessity, information necessary to arrive at such judgment might also prove unmanageable for the courts.&nbsp; Certain pertinent information necessary to arrive at such judgment might also prove unmanageable for the courts.&nbsp; Certain pertinent information might be difficult to verify, or wholly unavailable to the courts.&nbsp; In many instances, the evidence upon which the President might decide that there is a need to call out the armed forces may be of a nature not constituting technical proof.<br><br>On the other hand, the President as Commander-in-Chief has a vast intelligence network to gather information, some of which may be classified as highly confidential or affecting the security of the state.&nbsp; In the exercise of the power to call, on-the-spot decisions may be imperatively necessary in emergency situations to avert great loss of human lives and mass destruction of property. xxx<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(at pp. 22-23)</div></blockquote><br>The Court, in a proper case, may look into the sufficiency of the factual basis of the exercise of this power.&nbsp; However, this is no longer feasible at this time, Proclamation No. 38 having been lifted.<br><br><i>G.R. No. 147810</i><br><br>Petitioner <i>Laban ng Demoktratikong Pilipino</i> is not a real party-in-interest.&nbsp; The rule requires that a party must show a personal stake in the outcome of the case or an injury to himself that can be redressed by a favorable decision so as to warrant an invocation of the court's jurisdiction and to justify the exercise of the court's remedial powers in his behalf (<i>KMU Labor Center v. Garcia, Jr.,</i> 239 SCRA 386 [1994]).&nbsp; Here, petitioner has not demonstrated any injury to itself which would justify resort to the Court.&nbsp; Petitioner is a juridical person not subject to arrest.&nbsp; Thus, it cannot claim to be threatened by a warrantless arrest.&nbsp; Nor is it alleged that its leaders, members, and supporters are being threatened with warrantless arrest and detention for the crime of rebellion.&nbsp; Every action must be brought in the name of the party whose legal right has been invaded or infringed, or whose legal right is under imminent threat of invasion or infringement.<br><br>At best, the instant petition may be considered as an action for declaratory relief, petitioner claiming that its right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is affected by the declaration of a "state of rebellion" and that said proclamation is invalid for being contrary to the Constitution.<br><br>However, to consider the petition as one for declaratory relief affords little comfort to petitioner, this Court not having jurisdiction in the first instance over such a petition.&nbsp; Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, Article VIII of the Constitution limits the original jurisdiction of the Court to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and over petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus</i>, <i>quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petitions are hereby DISMISSED.&nbsp; However, in G.R. No. 147780, 147781, and 147799, respondents, consistent and congruent with their undertaking earlier adverted to, together with their agents, representatives, and all persons acting for and in their behalf, are hereby enjoined from arresting petitioners therein without the required judicial warrant for all acts committed in relation to or in connection with the May 1, 2001 siege of Malacañang.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Puno, Mendoza, Panganiban,</i> and <i>Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Vitug, J.,</i> see separate opinion.<br><i>Kapunan,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> see dissenting opinion.<br><i>Pardo, J.,</i> join the dissent of J.

Domingo in Sta. Rosa, Laguna.<br><br>In the early morning of May 1, 2001, the crowd at EDSA decided to march to Malacañan Palace.&nbsp; The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was called to reinforce the Philippine National Police (PNP) to guard the premises of the presidential residence. The marchers were able to penetrate the barricades put up by the police at various points leading to Mendiola and were able to reach Gate 7 of Malacañan.&nbsp; As they were being dispersed with warning shots, tear gas and water canons, the rallyists hurled stones at the police authorities.&nbsp; A melee erupted.&nbsp; Scores of people, including some policemen, were hurt.<br><br>At noon of the same day, after the crowd in Mendiola had been dispersed, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 38 declaring a "state of rebellion" in Metro Manila:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">Presidential Proclamation No. 38<br></div><br>DECLARING STATE OF REBELLION IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION<br><br>WHEREAS, the angry and violent mob, armed with explosives, firearms, bladed weapons, clubs, stones and other deadly weapons, in great part coming from the mass gathering at the EDSA Shrine, and other armed groups, having been agitated and incited and, acting upon the instigation and under the command and direction of known and unknown leaders, have and continue to assault and attempt to break into Malacañang with the avowed purpose of overthrowing the duly constituted Government and forcibly seize power, and have and continue to rise publicly, shown open hostility, and take up arms against the duly constituted Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to the government certain bodies of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, and to deprive the President of the Republic of the Philippines, wholly and partially, of her powers and prerogatives which constitute the continuing crime of rebellion punishable under Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code;<br><br>WHEREAS, armed groups recruited by known an unknown leaders, conspirators, and plotters have continue (<i>sic</i>) to rise publicly by the use of arms to overthrow the duly constituted Government and seize political power;<br><br>WHEREAS, under Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution, whenever necessary, the President as the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, may call out such armed forces to suppress the rebellion;<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, by virtue of the powers vested in me by law hereby recognize and confirm the existence of an actual and on-going rebellion compelling me to declare a state of rebellion;<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I am issuing General Order No. 1 in accordance with Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution calling upon the Armed forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to suppress and quell the rebellion.<br><br>City of Manila, May 1, 2001.</blockquote><br>The President Likewise issued General Order No. 1 which reads:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">GENERAL ORDER NO. 1<br></div><br>DIRECTING THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE TO SUPPRESS THE REBELLION IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION<br><br>WHEREAS, the angry mob and violent mob, armed with explosives, firearms, bladed weapons, clubs, stones, and other deadly weapons, in great part coming from the

National Police and the officers and men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to immediately carry out the necessary and appropriate actions and measures to suppress and quell the rebellion with due regard to constitutional rights.<br><br>City of Manila, May 1, 2001.</blockquote><br>Pursuant to the proclamation, several key leaders of the position were ordered arrested.&nbsp; Senator Enrile was arrested without warrant in his residence at around 4:00 in the afternoon.&nbsp; Likewise arrested without warrant the following day was former Ambassador Ernesto Maceda.&nbsp; Senator Honasan and Gen. Lacson were also ordered arrested but the authorities have so far failed to apprehend them.<br><br>Ambassador Maceda was temporarily released upon recognizance while Senator Ponce Enrile was ordered released by the Court on cash bond.<br><br>The basic issue raised by the consolidated petitions is whether the arrest or impending arrest without warrant, pursuant to a declaration of "state of rebellion" by the President of the above-mentioned persons and unnamed other persons similarly situated suspected of having committed rebellion is illegal, being unquestionably a deprivation of liberty and violative of the bill of rights under the Constitution.<br><br>The declaration of a "state of rebellion" is supposedly based on Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution which reads:<br><br><blockquote>The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion.&nbsp; In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.&nbsp; Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus,</i> the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress.&nbsp; The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.&nbsp; Upon the initiative of the president, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.<br><br>The Congress, if not in session, shall, within twenty-four hours following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with its rules without need of a call.<br><br>The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing.<br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts an agencies over civilians where the civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.<br><br>The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>During the suspension of the privilege of the writ any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released.</blockquote><br>Section 18 grants the President, as Commander-in-Chief, the power to call out the armed forces in cases of (1) lawless violence, (2) rebellion and (3) invasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the latter two cases, i.e., rebellion or invasion, the President may, when public safety requires, also (a) suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, or (b) place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.&nbsp; However, in the exercise of this calling out power as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, the Constitution does not require the President to make a declaration of a "state of rebellion" (or, for that matter, of lawless violence or invasion). The term "state of rebellion" has no legal significance.&nbsp; It is vague and amorphous and does not give the President more power than what the Constitution says, i.e, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. As Justice Mendoza observed during the hearing of this case, such a declaration is "legal surplusage." But whatever the term means, it cannot diminish or violate constitutionally-protected rights, such as the right to due process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the rights to free speech and peaceful assembly to petition the government for redress of grievances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and the right against unreasonable searches and seizures,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> among others.<br><br>In <i>Integrated Bar of the Philippines vs. Zamora, et al.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he distinction (between the calling out power, on one hand, and the power to suspend the privilege of the write of <i>habeas corpus</i> and to declare martial law, on the other hand) places the calling out power in a different category from the power to delcare martial law and the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, otherwise, the framers of the Constitution would have simply lumped together the three powers and provided for their revocation and review without any qualification.&nbsp; <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</i><br><br>x x x<br><br>The reason for the difference in the treatment of the aforementioned powers highlights the intent to grant the president the widest leeway and broadcast discretion in using the "calling out" power because it is considered as the lesser and more benign power compared to the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the power to impose martial law, both of which involve the curtailment and suppression of certain basic civil rights and individual freedoms, and thus necessitating affirmation by Congress and, in appropriate cases, review by this Court.</blockquote><br>On the other hand, if the motive behind the declaration of a "state of rebellion" is to arrest persons without warrant and detain them without bail and, thus, skirt the Constitutional safeguards for the citizens' civil liberties, the so-called "state of rebellion" partakes the nature of martial law without declaring it as such.&nbsp; It is a truism that a law or rule may itself be fair or innocuous on its face, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye so as to practically make it unjust and oppressive, it is within the prohibition of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In an ironic sense, a "state of rebellion" declared as a subterfuge to effect warrantless arrest and detention for an unbailable offense places a heavier burden on the people's civil liberties than the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the declaration of martial law because in the latter case, built-in safeguards are automatically set on motion:&nbsp; (1) The period for martial law or suspension is limited to a period not exceeding sixty day; (2) The President is mandated to submit a report to Congress within forty-eight hours from proclamation or suspension; (3) The proclamation or suspension is subject to review by Congress, which may revoke such proclamation or suspension.

The existence of "lawless violence, invasion or rebellion" only authorizes the President to call out the "armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion."<br><br>Not even the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus </i>or the declaration of martial law authorizes the president to order the arrest of any person.&nbsp; The only significant consequence of the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is to divest the courts of the power to issue the writ whereby the detention of the person is put in issue.&nbsp; It does not by itself authorize the President to order the arrest of a person. And even then, the Constitution in Section 18, Article VII makes the following qualifications:<br><br><blockquote>The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released.</blockquote><br>In the instant case, the president did not suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.&nbsp; Nor did she declare martial law.&nbsp; A declaration of a "state of rebellion," at most, only gives notice to the nation that it exists, and that the armed forces may be called to prevent or suppress it, as in fact she did.&nbsp; Such declaration does not justify any deviation from the Constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br>As a general rule, an arrest may be made only upon a warrant issued by a court.&nbsp; In very circumscribed instances, however, the Rules of Court allow warrantless arrests. Section 5, Rule 113 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp; Arrest without warrant; when lawful. -&nbsp; A police officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>(b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>xxx<br><br>In cases falling under paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the person arrested without a warrant shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police station or jail shall be proceeded against in accordance with section 7 of the Rule 112.</blockquote><br>It must be noted that the above are exceptions to the constitutional norm enshrined in the Bill of Rights that a person may only be arrested on the strength of a warrant of arrest issued by a "judge" after determining "personally" the existence of "probable cause" after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.&nbsp; Its requirements should, therefore, be scrupulously met:<br><br><blockquote>The right of a person to be secure against any unreasonable seizure of his body and any deprivation of his liberty is a most basic and fundamental one.&nbsp; The statute or rule which allows exceptions to the requirement of warrants of arrests is strictly construed.&nbsp; Any exception must clearly fall within the situations when securing a warrant would be absurd or is manifestly unnecessary as provided by the Rule.&nbsp; We cannot liberally construe the rule on arrests without warrant or extend its application beyond the cases specifically provided by law.&nbsp; To do so would infringe upon personal liberty and set back a basic right so often violated and so deserving of full protection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>A warrantless arrest may be justified only if the police officer had facts and circumstances before him which, had they been before a judge, would constitute adequate basis for a finding of probable cause of the commission of an offense and that the person arrested is probably guilty of committing the offense.&nbsp; That is why the Rules of Criminal Procedure require that when arrested, the person "arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense" in the presence of the arresting officer.&nbsp; Or if it be a case of an offense which has "just been committed," that the police officer making the arrest "has personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it."<br><br>Petitioners were arrested or sought to be arrested without warrant for acts of rebellion ostensibly under Section 5 of Rule 113.&nbsp; Respondent's theory is based on <i>Umil vs. Ramos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> where this court held:<br><br><blockquote>The crimes of rebellion, subversion, conspiracy or proposal to commit such crimes, and crimes or offenses committed in furtherance thereof or in connection therewith constitute direct assault against the State and are in the nature of <i>continuing crimes.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Following this theory, it is argued that under Section 5(a), a person who "has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit" rebellion and may be arrested without a warrant at any time so long as the rebellion persists.<br><br>Reliance on Umil is misplaced.&nbsp; The warrantless arrests therein, although effected a day or days after the commission of the violent acts of petitioners therein, were upheld by the Court because at the time of their respective arrests, they were members of organizations such as the Communist Party of the Philippines, the New Peoples Army and the National United Front Commission, then outlawed groups under the Anti-Subversion Act.&nbsp; Their mere membership in said illegal organizations amounted to committing the offense of subversion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which justified their arrests without warrants.<br><br>In contrast, it has not been alleged that the person to be arrested for their alleged participation in the "rebellion" on May 1, 2001 are members of an outlawed organization intending to overthrow the government.

Rebellion, insurrection, or sedition are political offenses where the line overt acts and simple advocacy or adherence to a belief is extremely thin.&nbsp; If a court has convicted an accused of rebellion and he is found roaming around, he may be arrested.&nbsp; But until a person is proved guilty, I fail to see how anybody can jump to a personal conclusion that the suspect is indeed a rebel and must be picked up on sight whenever seen.&nbsp; The grant of authority in the majority opinion is too broad.&nbsp; If warrantless searches are to be validated, it should be Congress and not this Court which should draw strict and narrow standards.&nbsp; Otherwise, the non-rebels who are critical, noisy, or obnoxious will be indiscriminately lumped up with those actually taking up arms against the Government.<br><br>The belief of law enforcement authorities, no matter how well-grounded on past events, that the petitioner would probably shoot other policemen whom he may meet does not validate warrantless arrests.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I cannot understand why the authorities preferred to bide their time, await the petitioner's surfacing from underground, and ounce on him with no legal authority instead of securing warrants of arrest for his apprehension.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br><i>CRUZ, J., </i>concurring and dissenting:<br><br>I submit that the affirmation by this Court of the Garcia-Padilla decision to justify the illegal arrests made in the cases before us is a step back to that shameful past when individual rights were wantonly and systematically violated by the Marcos dictatorship.&nbsp; It seems some of us have short memories of that repressive regime, but I for one am not one to forget so soon.&nbsp; As the ultimate defender of the Constitution, this Court should not gloss over the abuses of those who, out of mistaken zeal, would violate individual liberty in the dubious name of national security.&nbsp; Whatever their ideology and even if it be hostile to ours, the petitioners are entitled to the protection of the Bill of Rights, no more and no less than any other person in this country.&nbsp; That is what democracy is all about.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br><i>FELICIANO, J., </i>concurring and dissenting:<br><br>12. My final submission, is that, the doctrine of "continuing crimes," which has its own legitimate function to serve in our criminal law jurisprudence, cannot be invoked for weakening and dissolving the constitutional guarantee against warrantless arrest.&nbsp; Where no overt acts comprising all or some of the elements of the offense charged are shown to have been committed by the person arrested without warrant, the "continuing crime" doctrine should not be used to dress up the pretense that a crime, begun or committed elsewhere, continued to be committed by the person arrested in the presence of the arresting officer.&nbsp; The capacity for mischief of such a utilization of the "continuing crimes" doctrine, is infinitely increased where the crime charged does not consist of unambiguous criminal acts with a definite beginning and end in time and space (such as the killing or wounding of a person or kidnapping and illegal detention or arson) but rather of such problematic offenses as membership in or affiliation with or becoming a member of, a subversive association or organization. For in such cases, the overt constitutive acts may be morally neutral in themselves, and the unlawfulness of the acts a function of the aims or objectives of the organization involved. Note, for instance, the following acts which constitute prima facie evidence of "membership in any subversive association:"<br><br>a)&nbsp; Allowing himself to be listed as a member in any book or any of the lists, records, correspondence, or any other document of the organization;<br><br><i>b)&nbsp; Subjecting himself to the discipline of such or association or organization in any form whatsoever;</i><br><br><i>c)&nbsp; Giving financial contribution to such association or organization in dues, assessments, loans or in any other forms;</i><br><br><i>xxx</i><br><br><i>f)&nbsp;&nbsp; Conferring with officers or other members of such association or organization in furtherance of any plan or enterprise thereof;</i><br><br><i>xxx</i><br><br>g)&nbsp; <i>Preparing documents, pamphlets, leaflets, books, or any other type of publication to promote the objectives and purposes of such association or organization;</i><br><br><i>xxx</i><br><br><i>k)&nbsp; Participating in any way in the activities, planning action, objectives, or purposes of such association or organization.</i><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It may well be, as the majority implies, that the constitutional rule against warrantless arrests and seizures makes the law enforcement work of police agencies more difficult to carry out. It is not our Court's function, however, and the Bill of Rights was not designed, to make life easy for police forces but rather to protect the liberties of private individuals.&nbsp; Our police forces must simply learn to live with the requirements of the Bill of Rights, to enforce the law by modalities which themselves comply with the fundamental law.&nbsp; Otherwise they are very likely to destroy, whether through sheer ineptness or excess of zeal, the very freedoms which make our policy worth protecting and saving</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>It is observed that a sufficient period has lapsed between the fateful day of May 1, 2001 up to the present.&nbsp; If respondents have ample evidence against petitioners, then they should forthwith file the necessary criminal complaints in order that the regular procedure can be followed and the warrants of arrest issued by the courts in the normal course.&nbsp; When practicable, resort to the warrant process is always to be preferred because "it interposes an orderly procedure involving `judicial impartiality' whereby a neutral and detached magistrate can make informed and deliberate determinations on the issue of the probable cause."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The neutrality, detachment and independence that judges are supposed to possess is precisely the reason the framers of the 1987 Constitution have reposed upon them alone the power to issue warrants of arrest.

Makalintal (G.R. No. 132603, Sept. 18, 2000), this Court held that "courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is `capable of repetition, yet evading review' ...."<br><br><b>I &amp; II- <i>President&nbsp; Macapagal-Arroyo's declaration of a "state of rebellion" and </i>the implementation of the warrantless arrests premised on the said declaration are unconstitutional.</b><br><br>Nowhere in the Constitution can be found a provision which grants upon the executive the power to declare a "state of rebellion," much more, to exercise on the basis of such declaration the prerogatives which a president may validly do under a state of martial law.&nbsp; President Macapagal-Arroyo committed a constitutional short cut. She disregarded the clear provisions of the Constitution which provide:<br><br><blockquote>"<b>Sec. 18</b>. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.&nbsp; Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress.&nbsp; The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.&nbsp; Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.<br><br>The Congress, if not in session, shall within twenty-four hours following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with its rules without need of a call.<br><br>The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual bases of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing.<br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.<br><br>The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Obviously, the power of the President in cases when she assumed the existence of rebellion is properly laid down by the Constitution.&nbsp; I see no reason or justification for the President's deviation from the concise and plain provisions.&nbsp; To accept the theory that the President could disregard the applicable statutes, particularly that which concerns arrests, searches and seizures, on the mere declaration of a "state of rebellion<b>" is in effect to place the Philippines under martial law without a declaration of the executive to that effect and without observing the proper procedure</b>.&nbsp; This should not be countenanced.&nbsp; In a society which adheres to the rule of law, resort to extra-constitutional measures is unnecessary where the law has provided everything for any emergency or contingency.&nbsp; For even if it may be proven beneficial for a time, the precedent it sets is pernicious as the law may, in a little while, be disregarded again on the same pretext but for evil purposes.&nbsp; <b>Even in time of emergency, government action may vary in breath and intensity from more normal times, yet it need not be less constitutional</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>My fear is rooted in history.&nbsp; Our nation had seen the rise of a dictator into power.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the changes made by the 1986 Constitutional Commission on the martial law text of the Constitution were to a large extent a reaction against the direction which the Supreme Court took during the regime of President Marcos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Now, if this Court would take a liberal view, and consider that the declaration of a "state of rebellion" carries with it the prerogatives given to the President during a "state of martial law," then, I say, the Court is traversing a very dangerous path.&nbsp; It will open the way to those who, in the end, would turn our democracy into a totalitarian rule.&nbsp; History must not be allowed to repeat itself.&nbsp; Any act which gears towards possible dictatorship must be severed at its inception.<br><br>The implementation of warrantless arrests premised on the declaration of a "state of rebellion" is unconstitutional and contrary to existing laws.&nbsp; The Constitution provides that "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizure of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be <b><i>inviolable</i></b><i>, </i>and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> If a state of martial law "<i>does not suspend the operation of the Constitution,</i> nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians, where civil courts are able to function, <i>nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ,"</i>28(a)<i> </i>then it is <i>with more reason</i>, that a mere declaration of a state of rebellion could not bring about the suspension of the operation of the Constitution or of the writ of <b>habeas</b> <b>corpus</b>.<br><br>Neither can we find the implementation of the warrantless arrests justified under the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.&nbsp; Pertinent is Section 5, Rule 113, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 5. <b><i>Arrest without warrant, when lawful</i></b><i>.</i> - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense.<br><br>(b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts and circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>x x x."</blockquote><br>Petitioners cannot be considered <i>"to have committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense" </i>at the time they were hunted by Berroya for the implementation of the warrantless arrests. None of them participated in the riot which took place in the vicinity of the Malacañang Palace.&nbsp; Some of them were on their respective houses performing innocent acts such as watching television, resting, etc..&nbsp; The sure fact however is that they were not in the presence of Berroya.&nbsp; Clearly, he did not see whether they had committed, were committing or were attempting to commit the crime of rebellion.&nbsp; But of course, I cannot lose sight of the legal implication of President Macapagal-Arroyo's declaration of a "state of rebellion." Rebellion is a continuing offense and a suspected insurgent or rebel may be arrested anytime as he is considered to be committing the crime.&nbsp; Nevertheless, assuming <i>ex gratia argumenti</i> that the declaration of a state of rebellion is constitutional, it is imperative that the said declaration be reconsidered.&nbsp; In view of the changing times, the dissenting opinion of the noted jurist, Justice Isagani Cruz, in <i>Umil v. Ramos,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><i> </i>quoted below must be given a second look.<br><br><blockquote>"I dissent insofar as the<i> ponencia</i> affirms the ruling in Garcia-Padilla vs. Enrile that subversion is a continuing offense, to justify the arrest without warrant of any person at <i>any time</i> as long as the authorities say he has been placed under surveillance on suspicion of the offense.&nbsp; That is a dangerous doctrine.&nbsp; A person may be arrested when he is doing the most innocent acts, as when he is only washing his hands, or taking his supper, or even when he is sleeping, on the ground that he is committing the `continuing' offense of subversion.&nbsp; Libertarians were appalled when that doctrine was imposed during the Marcos regime.&nbsp; I am alarmed that even now this new Court is willing to sustain it.&nbsp; I strongly urge my colleagues to discard it altogether as one of the disgraceful vestiges of the past dictatorship and uphold the rule guaranteeing the right of the people against unreasonable searches and seizures.&nbsp; We can do no less if we are really to reject the past oppression and commit ourselves to the true freedom.&nbsp; Even if it be argued that the military should be given every support in our fight against subversion, I maintain that that fight must be waged honorably, in accordance with the Bill of Rights.&nbsp; I do not believe that in fighting the enemy we must adopt the ways of the enemy, which are precisely what we are fighting against.&nbsp; I submit that our more important motivation should be what are we fighting for."</blockquote><br>I need not belabor that at the time some of the suspected instigators were arrested, (the others are still at-large), a long interval of time already passed and hence, it cannot be legally said that they had <i>just committed </i>an offense.&nbsp; Neither can it be said that Berroya or any of his men had "personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the persons to be arrested have committed a crime." That would be far from reality.<br><br><b>III - The acts of the rallyists at the vicinity of Malacañang Palace on May 1, 2001 do not constitute rebellion.</b><br><br>Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code reads:<br><br><blockquote>"ART. 134. <i>Rebellion or insurrection - How committed.</i> - The crime of rebellion or insurrection is committed by <i>rising publicly</i> and <i>taking arms </i>against the Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to said Government or its laws, the territory of the Republic of the Philippines or any part thereof, of any body of land, naval or other armed forces, or depriving the Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives." <i>(As amended by RA No. 6968, O.G. 52, p. 9864, 1990)</i></blockquote><br>From the foregoing provisions, the elements of the crime of rebellion may be deduced, thus: <i>first</i>, that there be <b>(a) public uprising</b> and <b>(b) taking arms</b> against the government; <i>second</i>, that the purpose of the uprising or movement is either <b>(a)</b> to remove from the allegiance to said government or its laws <b>(1)</b> the territory of the Philippines or any part thereof; or <b>(2)</b> anybody of land, naval or other armed forces; or <b>(b)</b> to deprive the Chief Executive or Congress, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Looking at the events on a magnified scale, I am convinced that the two elements of the crime of rebellion are lacking.<br><br><i>First,</i> there was no "<i>taking of arms</i> " against the government.&nbsp; To my mind, "<i>taking arms</i>" connotes the multitude's <i>deliberate</i> and <i>conscious</i> resort to arms or weapons for the purpose of aiding them in accomplishing any of the purposes of rebellion. <i> Admittedly,</i> the Estrada loyalists pelted the policemen with rocks and stones and attacked them with sticks and clubs, but such was merely a result of the heightening tension between opposite camps during the period of dispersal.&nbsp; The stones, rocks, sticks, clubs and other improvised weapons were not deliberately resorted to by the Estrada loyalists to further any of the purposes of rebellion.&nbsp; They availed of them, at the precise moment of dispersal (<i>this explains why their weapons were those which could be easily gathered on the street</i>) and only for the purpose of stopping the policemen from dispersing them.&nbsp; In this age of modernity, one who intends to overthrow the government will not only settle for stones, woods, rocks, sticks or clubs as means to disable the government.&nbsp; It will be extremely pathetic and the result will only be in vain. Unlike a true rebellion which is <i>organized</i>, what happened at the vicinity of Malacañang was merely a riot, a mob violence, or a tumultuous uprising.&nbsp; At this juncture, it bears stressing that the crime of rebellion <i>is a vast movement of men and a complex net of intrigues and plots</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>It must be distinguished from riot and offenses connected with mob violence.&nbsp; In rebellion/insurrection, there is an organized and armed uprising against authority.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Second, the purpose of the Estrada loyalists was neither <b>(a)</b> to remove from the allegiance to the government or its laws <b>(1)</b> the territory of the Philippines or any part thereof; or <b>(2)</b> any part of land, naval or other armed forces; nor <b>(b)</b> to deprive the Chief Executive or Congress, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.&nbsp; I looked at the chronology of events, and one thing surfaced - the Estrada loyalists mainly demanded that their beloved "president" should not be incarcerated.&nbsp; The crowd at Edsa swelled in great magnitude on April 25, 2001, the day Estrada was arrested.&nbsp; In fact, when they followed Erap at Camp Crame, they were shouting "<i>Edsa</i>! <i>Edsa!</i> and<i> they vowed not to leave until Estrada is released</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>One must not be swayed by the theory of respondents that the purpose of those people who gathered in Edsa and marched to Malacañang was to commit rebellion.&nbsp; For sure, there were a thousand and one reasons why they proceeded to Edsa.&nbsp; In determining their purpose, one must trace the roots, -- what prompted them to go to Edsa?&nbsp; They were the Estrada loyalists who wanted him to be freed.&nbsp; If indeed there were minorities who advocated another cause, the same should not be considered as the prevailing one in the determination of what crime was committed.&nbsp; Facts should not be stretched just to build a case of rebellion.&nbsp; This runs counter to the principle of due process.<br><br>As a final word, I subscribe to the principle that the rule of law implies the precept that similar cases be treated similarly.&nbsp; Men can not regulate their actions by means of rule if this precept is not followed. Edsa I, Edsa II and Edsa III are all public uprisings.&nbsp; Statements urging people to overthrow the government were uttered in all these occasions.&nbsp; Injuries were sustained, policemen were attacked, standing structures were vandalized... in all these scenarios, one cannot be said to be extremely away from the other.&nbsp; The only difference is that the first two succeeded, while the last failed.&nbsp; This should not result to an unbridled or unlimited exercise of power by the duly constituted authorities.&nbsp; It is during these trying times that fealty to the Constitution is strongly demanded from all, especially the authorities concerned.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to give DUE COURSE to the petitions and GRANT the same and to enjoin the respondents from arresting the petitioners in G.R.
