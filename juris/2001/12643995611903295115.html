				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an administrative complaint for sexual harassment against respondent Judge Osmundo Villanueva of the Fourth Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat.<br><br>Complainant Lucita E. Biboso, 33, claimed that at around 11 o'clock in the morning of August 20, 1996, she went to see respondent at the MCTC in Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat to "follow up" her case (Civil Case No. 71).&nbsp; Complainant made the following account of how she was allegedly molested by respondent:<br><br>. . . [Judge Osmundo M. Villanueva] invited me to get inside his chamber for personal conference. When&nbsp; we were already inside his office, he locked the room.&nbsp; To my surprise he immediately embraced and kissed me, hugged me and hurriedly removed my blouse he took advantage of caressing my breasts and began unzipping my pants.&nbsp; Shocked and helpless during that time, I cried and cried and cannot resist from his sexual advances . . . being weak against [his] male strength.&nbsp; So what I did was to evade his sexual advances and immediately run outside of his chamber and went home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>Complainant said that she was again molested by respondent on September 4, 1996 inside the latter's chamber in Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat.&nbsp; According to complainant, she went to see respondent because he allegedly told her that she had to sign some papers in "connection with the issuance of a warrant of arrest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>In his Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to the complaint, respondent denied having made any sexual advances against complainant at any time.&nbsp; He claimed that complainant and her father-in-law, Cipriano Biboso, trumped up charges against him because he had dismissed two cases (Civil Case No. 71 entitled "Lucita Biboso v. Haide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Navarra" and Criminal Case No. 1662-B entitled "Cipriano Biboso v. Heide Navarra") filed by complainant and her father-in-law.&nbsp; He contended that he could not have sexually molested complainant on August 20, 1996 in Esperanza because he was in Lebak, Sultan Kudarat from August 19-23, 1996, discharging his duties as Acting Presiding Judge of the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court for Lebak-Kalamansig, Sultan Kudarat.<br><br>To support his alibi, respondent submitted several documents, namely: copies of the transcript of stenographic notes, dated August 20, 1996, of the preliminary investigation of complainant in Criminal Case No. 2033-L, conducted in Lebak (Exh. 8); the complaints in Criminal Case Nos. 2033-L and 2034-L, both entitled "People v. Eric Camporedondo and Christopher Camporedondo," received and notarized by him on August 20, 1996, also in Lebak (Exhs. 10 and 11);&nbsp; the itinerary of his travels and the corresponding disbursement voucher prepared by the Clerk of Court of the MCTC of Lebak-Kalamansig showing that he was in Lebak from August 19-23, 1996 (Exhs. 5 and 6); and a certification, dated May 25, 1998, by the Clerk of Court of the MCTC of Lebak-Kalamansig stating therein that respondent judge was in Lebak from August 19-23, 1996 (Exh. 7).&nbsp; As to the second incident of sexual harassment which allegedly took place on September 4, 1996, respondent stated that such could not have been committed as there was no session in Esperanza on that date.<br><br>The case was referred to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat for investigation, report, and recommendation. During the investigation, complainant and her sister-in-law, Lorna Biboso, testified, while respondent, in addition to himself, presented as his witnesses SPO4 Rogelio Venus, Romeo Chiva, process server of MCTC, Bagumbayan-Esperanza, and Virginia Dumaguing, Clerk of Court, MCTC, Lebak-Kalamansig.<br><br>In his report, dated February 5, 2001, Executive Judge German M. Malcampo found complainant's claim of sexual harassment to be unsubstantiated due to material inconsistencies between complainant's affidavit-complaint and her testimony during the investigation of the case.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in view of his finding that respondent gave assistance to complainant's father-in-law in filing a case in his sala, Judge Malcampo recommended that respondent be reprimanded and ordered to pay a fine in the amount of P20,000.00.<br><br>The recommendation is well taken.&nbsp; Indeed, the evidence presented during the investigation of the case fails to show that respondent sexually harassed complainant.&nbsp; Contrary to her statement in her affidavit-complaint that respondent judge sexually molested her on August 20, 1996 inside his chamber in Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, complainant testified during the investigation of this case that their meeting actually took place on August 27, 1996 in the courthouse in Bagumbayan, Sultan Kudarat, during which respondent merely shook her hand, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="LEFT">ATTY.

testimony and complaint-affidavit, in contrast to the credible testimonial and documentary evidence presented by respondent, put in serious doubt the veracity of her claims. Indeed, it appears, as respondent judge claims, that this case was filed to punish him for having dismissed the cases filed by complainant and her father-in-law, especially as the filing of this case came on the heels of the dismissal of the latter.&nbsp; There could no other reason for complainant to turn against respondent when the latter had previously helped complainant in her legal problems to the extent of preparing her father-in-law's complaint-affidavit for estafa against Navarra and even issuing a writ of execution in one case (Civil Case No. 71) and a warrant of arrest in another (Criminal Case No. 1662-B). Furthermore, it took complainant more than a year after the commission of the alleged sexual harassment on September 4, 1996 to file the instant administrative complaint.&nbsp; Even complainant's explanation as to why she executed her affidavit-complaint only on October 16, 1997 was conflicting. She initially stated that she was only able to execute her complaint-affidavit for this case on said late date because rumors had spread by that time that she was respondent's lover (<i>kabit</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> During her cross-examination, however, she stated that she had to defer the execution of her complaint because she had to wait for her husband to come back from Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The foregoing notwithstanding, as found by the investigating judge, respondent should be held liable for his conduct in relation to Criminal Case No. 1662-B.&nbsp; Respondent acted as a lawyer for complainant and her father-in-law when he drafted complainant's affidavit which became the basis of a complaint for estafa filed against Heidi Navarra.&nbsp; By acting as counsel for complainant and the latter's father-in-law in a case filed in his court, respondent compromised his neutrality and independence.&nbsp; How could he then be expected to decide with objectivity and fairness the cases in which he has acted as a lawyer for the plaintiff or complainant?&nbsp; Respondent's misconduct in this case is further compounded by the fact that he rendered the legal services in question using government facilities during office hours.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge Osmundo M.
