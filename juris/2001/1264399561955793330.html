San Jose, Ormoc City, was strolling in the public plaza where he met Jonathan `Jojo' Alkuino, a former resident of the barangay (pp. 6-11, tsn, July 22, 1997).<br><br>"2.&nbsp; Montano Bañez took him aside and invited Jojo to a drinking spree in a nearby store.&nbsp; They sat side by side on a bench outside the store and while exchanging pleasantries and drinking, appellant Pedro Ramirez suddenly came in front of them. Appellant ordered beer. Then he calmly approached Jojo hitting him on the right side of the body just below the ribs (pp. 6-11, tsn, supra).<br><br>"3.&nbsp; Jojo Alkuino was brought to the Ormoc District Hospital and was examined and treated by Dr. Kierulf who issued the medical certificate (Exhibit A) with the following findings:<br><br>`The stab wound that hit the victim was at his right anterior chest wall, at the level of 4th ICS penetrating thoracic abdominal cavity, incising the right lobe of the liner with massive hemothorax and hemoperit[o]neum"<br><br>"Although the victim was conscious and alive when he was admitted on May 21, 1993 at around 9:55 in the evening, he, however, died the following day at about 5:30 in the afternoon due to hypovolemic shock or massive blood loss (p. 24, tsn, July 17, 1998)."</blockquote><br><i>Version of the Defense</i><br><br>In his Brief, appellant presents the following statement of facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> "The first witness, Remegio Montalban, testified that he [was] a resident and farmer of Brgy. Sta. Cruz, San Francisco, Camotes, Cebu, and a neighbor of Pedro Ramirez, the accused. On May 21, 1993, he remembered he and Pedro Ramirez were working on his farm in said barangay.&nbsp; They had been working on the farm since 1991.&nbsp; He knows that the accused went to Ormoc City in 1986 but he returned in 1990 and since then he never left their barangay.&nbsp; On cross examination, the witness admit[ed] there [was] a regular trip from San Francisco, Camotes to Ormoc City and the trip would take only more than an hour to negotiate.&nbsp; When asked, however, as to the birth dates of his 8 children, he could not tell all.&nbsp; Even on the date of the arrest of the accused, his testimony falter[ed] (TSN of July 29, 1998, pp. 6-21).<br><br><blockquote>"The second witness was the accused himself.&nbsp; His line of testimony corroborate[d] the testimonies of his first and third witnesses. Accused admit[ted] having gone to Ormoc City and that was in the year 1986 when he was hired by Poten Larrazabal to harvest his sugarcane plantation.&nbsp; He stayed there for four (4) years, up to 1990, in Laray, Valencia together with his wife and two children (TSN of September 2, 1998, p. 9, p. 44).&nbsp; He testified that on May 21, 1993 he was at Barangay Santa Cruz, Camotes, Cebu working.&nbsp; He even denie[d] knowing where Barangay San Jose, Ormoc City, [was][;] in short, he denie[d] the charge against him.<br><br>"On cross examination, the accused testified that he did not go out too often while he was living in Sitio Laray, Valencia; that he did not even hear of Barangay San Jose (TSN of September 2, 1996. Pp. 22-23).<br><br>"The last witness, Eduardo Austria, corroborate[d] the line of theory of the accused and the first witness. They had a kind of cooperative work, Ramirez, he, and Montalban.&nbsp; It was an inconsequential routine work and a passing of day that occurred on May 21, 1993 and the following day (TSN of October 5, 1998, pp. 7-14)<br><br>"On cross examination, the witness testified there was no cooperative work with Ramirez around in May of 1994, 1995 and 1996; that the witness [did] not even know the date of the incident involved in this case. (TSN, pp. 20-31)"</blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Trial Court's Ruling<br></div><br>In convicting appellant, the trial court gave credence to the prosecution witnesses' testimonies.&nbsp; It ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"We can notice that from the testimony of Montano Bañez up to the last witness Amelito Biyu, there was positive identification of the assailant, the one who stabbed Jonathan Alkuino; there was knowledge about the accused and the victim.&nbsp; The testimonies of the witnesses were in details, not in generalities, and [the] testimony of the father, Milchisedeck Alkuino relate[d] x x x the dying declaration of his son, the victim in this case.&nbsp; The evidence so far adduced by the prosecution established the elements of the crime of murder: the killing of an individual [did] not [fall] under parricide and the killing was attended by treachery, the fact that the stabbing was sudden and the victim was sitting while the assailant was standing and there was therefore no means for the victim to defend himself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </blockquote><br>On the other hand, the RTC rejected the defense witnesses' testimonies for being "weak, unreliable and full of uncertainties."&nbsp; It concluded that the prosecution evidence "was not substantially overcome or overwhelmed by the defense's own proof or evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></div><br>In his Brief, appellant cites the following alleged errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>The Court a quo erred in giving credence to the witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>The Court a quo erred in appreciating treachery notwithstanding the failure of the prosecution to prove the same.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>The Court a quo erred in convicting the accused notwithstanding the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."</blockquote><br>In the main, the Court will resolve the following matters:&nbsp; (1) sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and (2) presence of treachery.&nbsp; In addition, it&nbsp; will also determine the propriety of appellant's penalty and civil liability.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">This Court's Ruling<br></div><br>The appeal is devoid of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">First Issue:<br><i>Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</i><br></div><br>The conviction of appellant was based on the eyewitness accounts of Montano Bañez and Amelito Biyu.&nbsp; Bañez testified that he was with the victim when the crime was committed.
