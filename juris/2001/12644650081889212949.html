Mendoza and Marichu S. Camiguing, who are residents of barangay Quibaol of the said municipality.(p.4, February 8, 1996, TSN) Her paternal grandmother, Lourdes Mendoza, owns a house in the same barangay which is about 120 meters away from their house. Living in the same house with her grandmother were Sandra Tejada, her first cousin on her paternal side, the latter's husband, Allan, who was a member of the Region I PNP Mobile Force stationed in San Fernando, La Union, and their two (2) children, namely Tonton and Celi. (pp. 4-7, February 1, 1996, TSN).<br><br>"Her grandmother thought that Allan, who left for barangay Namolan, would not be coming home on April 2, 1995, so she asked Charisse to spend the night in her house to accompany her cousin Sandra. In the evening of the said date, Charisse, who would be turning 13 years old the following month, went to her grandmother's place with the permission of her father. After watching TV with her grandmother until 8:30 p.m., Charisse went to sleep on the sofa in the sala of the ground floor of the two-storey house of her grandmother. The sofa where she slept was about 3 meters away from her grandparents' bed, with some chairs separating them. Sandra and her children slept in a room upstairs. (pp. 7-9, Ibid.)<br><br>"At around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, Charisse was awakened by the sound of the tricycle arriving at their place. Shortly afterwards, she heard Allan calling for his wife who then went down and opened the door for him. Allan took his supper and after which, he went upstairs while Charisse went back to sleep.(pp. 9-10, <u>Ibid</u>.)<br><br>"At dawn of the following day, Charisse woke up when she felt that her legs were being pinned against the sofa and when she opened her eyes, she saw Allan sitting on the sofa. She asked Allan what he was doing but the latter told her instead to keep quiet. He then held her hands, covered her mouth and warned her not to shout, or else he will shoot her and her father. Allan's threat frightened her and made her feel nervous. (pp.10-11, <u>Ibid</u>.)<br><br>"After releasing her hands and uncovering her mouth, Allan went on top of her, removed her short pants and underwear and after removing his shorts and brief, repeated his earlier threat on her. Thereafter Allan inserted his penis into her vagina and made coitus movements which, in the process, caused her to feel some pains in her vagina. She could not shout because her mouth was covered by Allan's hand. After ejaculating, Allan pulled out his penis and with his hands covering Charisse's mouth, warned the latter not to reveal the incident to anyone, otherwise he will shoot her and her father. (pp. 11-12, <u>Ibid</u>.)<br><br>"After putting on his brief and shorts, Allan went up to their room, while Charisse put on her underwear and short pants, As it was still dark outside, she opted to stay in the sofa where she wept until 6:00 o'clock in the morning. She then woke up her grandmother and sought her permission to go home. She did not report the incident to her grandparents as she was frightened by the long firearm of Allan which was being kept in the kitchen, for it reminded her of Allan's threat. (pp. 12-13, <u>Ibid</u>.)<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>"On May 15, 1995, Charisse her two sisters, Jill and Candice, and brother George, were brought by their father to their grandmother to spend the night there as he was leaving then for Manila to follow his wife who was there working on his papers relative to his application for a job abroad. (Ibid.)<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>"Between 10:00 and 11:00 in the evening, Allan came home from La Union where he was assigned. George switch on the light while Sandra opened the door for him. Charisse and George then went back to sleep. At early dawn of the following day, Charisse was awakened when she felt that Allan was near her feet and pulling her blanket. She wanted to shout but Allan held her hands and covered her mouth and told her not to shout. (p. 17, Ibid)<br><br>"Allan then removed her pants and underwear and after removing his shorts and brief, went on top of her, inserted his penis into her vagina and made coitus movements. While she was being sexually abused by Allan, the latter told her not to shout or else, he will kill her and her father. Although she pulled the clothes of her brother and sister and tried to kick them, she was not able to wake them up. (p. 18, Ibid.)<br><br>"After the sexual abuse, Allan told her that should she reveal the incident to anybody, he would tell her father that they were having an affair even if it were not true. Allan put on his pants and brief and went up to their room. Charisse embraced her brother and cried. She had wanted to kick Allan but could not do so because he was much stronger and stouter than her and was on top of her and holding her hands which were pinned against her breasts. (pp.18-19, <u>Ibid</u>.)<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>"On October 25, 1995, Charisse complained to her mother that she was having some pains in her stomach. Her mother brought her to the Sto. Niño Clinic in Lingayen, Pangasinan where she was examined by a certain Dr. Casipit who advised her mother that she should undergo an ultra sound examination. On the following day, Charisse was taken by her mother to the Nazareth General Hospital where she was examined by Dr. Ricky Querubin with the use of ultra sound machine. Dr. Querubin issued a medical report on the result of the ultra sound examination of Charisse showing that she was 20 weeks and 4 days pregnant. (pp. 22-23, <u>Ibid</u>.)<br><br>"Stunned by the said medical result, the mother of Charisse confronted her as to who was the father of the child in her womb. She told her mother that she would make the revelation at home but when they were in the restaurant, her mother kept crying, thus, forcing her, in the presence of her cousin Sandra, to reveal that Allan was the one responsible for her pregnancy. Surprised&nbsp; by Charisse's revelation, Sandra borrowed her watch and hurriedly left for San Fernando, La Union to see her husband. (p. 27 <u>Ibid</u>.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 26, 1995, Charisse and her mother went to the PNP Regional Office in San Fernando, La Union and lodged an administrative complaint against the accused. After investigation, the latter was discharged from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On February 23, 1996, complainant gave birth to a baby boy who was named "James Mendoza."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Accused Tejada did not deny that he had sexual contact with the complainant. In defense, however, he asserted that complainant was his sweetheart and that it was she who initiated the said act which happened thrice, i.e., November 10, 1994, December, 1994 and June 29, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He narrated that in July 1995, he and complainant talked about the latter's condition. When informed about her pregnancy, he advised her to take a rest. He further alleged that every time he visited his parents in Avenida Rizal West, complainant would always ask for "<i>pasalubong,</i>" so he would give her chocolate, sometimes chico and biscuits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> They even addressed each other as "darling," especially when nobody heard them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The accused vehemently denied having raped complainant on April 3, 1995 and May 15, 1995. According to him, in April 1995, he was stationed in Laoag, Ilocos Norte, and in May, 1995, in Bulag, Bantay, Ilocos Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> His assignment in said places is evidenced by the&nbsp; "Disposition and Location of Troops"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and "Roster of Troops"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and by the testimonies of his Platoon Leaders, Lt. Ismael Atluna and Sgt.Espiritu Dulatre.<br><br>Sandra Tejada, wife of the accused, corroborated the claim of her husband. She presented his letter, personally delivered to her on March 29, 1995 by one Sgt. Del Rosario, informing her that he (her husband) would not be able to attend her birthday on April 2, 1995. Her husband did not arrive home in the evening of May 15, 1995 because he was then assigned in Bulag Bantay, Ilocus Sur.<br><br>To further bolster accused's alibi, the defense offered the testimonies of PNP Capt/ Sr. Inspector Deguillo Godoy, Police Inspector Ismael Atluna and Sgt. Espiritu Dulatre.<br><br>Capt./Sr. Inspector Godoy testified that he knows the accused because he was one of his men when he was the Company Commander at the Regional Mobile Force, Regional Office, San Fernando, La Union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> he issued, Sr. Insp. Godoy confirmed that in the year 1995, particularly in the months of April and May, the accused was then under his command and was among those on duty as reflected in the Disposition and Location of Troops and Roster of Troops.<br><br>Police Inspector Ismael Atluna declared that he also knows the accused because the latter was one of his men.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He recalled that on the first week of April, 1995, the accused was in Camp 1 Laoag, Ilocos Norte and that after one week, he returned to San Fernando, La Union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Sgt. Espiritu Dulatre testified that he was the platoon sergeant of the company wherein the accused was one of those under his command.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On April 3, 1995, the accused was with him. But on May 16, 1995, he does not know his whereabouts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In convicting the accused, the trial court rationalized as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote>"The court after carefully examining and studying the evidence on record as well as the facts obtaining in these cases, finds it easier to accept the theory of the prosecution for being more credible and in accordance with common sense, logic and promotions of human behaviour. The proposition of the defense that accused and complainant are lovers and that it was Charisse who seduced Allan while the latter was sleeping alone in their room in the afternoon of November 10, 1994 is utterly unnatural and patently a mere concoction and an afterthought of the accused to secure an acquittal of the charges filed against him. The court cannot accept with hospitality the argument of the defense that Charisse Mendoza who was then a little above 12 years old (12 years, 10 months and 14 days) will involve herself in a love affair with the accused who is much older than her (accused was then 26 years old) and the husband of her own first cousin. To the mind of the Court Charisse is too young and ignorant to indulge herself in sexual intercourse, there being no evidence to show that she is a flirt or a girl of loose in rural ways and atmosphere, not affected by the modern and sophisticated ways of urban life. In fact, Charisse does not even know that she had conceived and was already pregnant not until she was subjected to ultrasound examination. The court had occasions to observe the complainant when she testified and found her to be a simple, humble and unassuming barrio lass.<br><br>Taking into consideration the relationship of the accused and complainant, Charisse being the sister-in-law of the accused as well as the physical built, size and age of the parties, the force needed for the accused to be able to commit the sexual attacks need not be so great or of such nature as it could not be resisted. The force or violence employed by the accused upon the victim need not be over powering or irresistible but necessary only to achieve its purpose. In the cases at hand, the accused is stronger and sturdier than the victim and a policeman who has a firearm. The court further observed that the complainant in answering question propounded to her, was sincere and frank and at times shed tears from her eyes as she recalled and narrated the harrowing experiences and tragedy that befell on her, young as she is. The court likewise noted no hesitancy and artificiality on her voice when she testified how she was deflowered by the accused."<br></blockquote>After a meticulous and careful evaluation of the entire records of this case, this Court agrees with the trial court's assessment of accused-appellant's guilt.<br><br>Young as she was, complainant displayed truthfulness in her testimony, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Now, what happened when you proceeded to the house of your grandmother that early afternoon of April 2, 1995?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">While I am already there at the house of my grandmother, sir, Sandra advised me to take care or watch her children and in that instance me and my grandmother were then viewing and watching TV, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td style="text-align: center;"><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;">x x x x x x x x x<br><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now, as you were slept, do you know of anything that woke you up?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When it was already around dawn time, I felt my two (2) legs were pinned because Kuya Allan sat on the sofa, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">You said pinned down or sidewise?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">WITNESS:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">My legs pinned sidewise not downward.

Even on cross-examination, she never wavered in her recollection. Considering her age, it would be improbable for her to fabricate a charge so humiliating to her self and her family had she not been truly subjected to the painful experience of sexual abuse. It is for this reason that testimonies of child-victims are normally given full weight and credence, since when a minor says she was raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>At any rate, the trial court which has the unique opportunity to observe the facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice of a witness while testifying, is competent to&nbsp; determine the testimony will be given credence. As there are many matters which cannot be photographed into the records, the decision of the trial judge, as in this case, will not be disturbed on review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> To be sure, this Court has almost no assistance in the examination of the testimony and must, therefore, rely upon the good judgment of the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The <b>"<i>lovers' theory"</i></b> of appellant must fail for being a flimsy effort on his part to escape culpability. Being a much-abused affirmative defense that rashly derides the intelligence of the Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the allegations of a love affair must be supported by convincing proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Here, complainant vehemently denied that she had an illicit love relationship with the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> She was too young and ignorant to involve herself in sexual acts, there being no evidence on record as would show that she is a flirt or a girl of loose moral character. Other than appellant's assertion, there was no other evidence to show that he and complainant were sweethearts. There were no letters or notes, no photos or mementos, nothing at all to prove that such romantic relationship existed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The complainant was a little over 12 years old then. As properly observed by the trial court, to a young and naive girl like her, it is highly inconceivable to think that she would indulge herself in a love affair with the accused who is 14 years older than she and the husband of her own cousin.<br><br>Appellant initially asserts that the complainant's testimony is tainted with contradictions which clearly indicate that she deliberately distorted the facts. Appellant argues that while in her testimony and sworn declaration dated October 30, 1995, complainant declared that she was raped twice, on April 3 and on May 16, 1995, she, however, stated in her sworn statement dated October 27, 1995 which she executed before SPO2 Romero D. Edrina<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>, that she was abused <i>once</i> by the appellant and that it happened sometime in <i>June 1995</i>. These contradictions in complainant's testimony, according to appellant, engender serious doubts on her credibility.<br><br>The Court is not convinced. It is a settled doctrine that discrepancies in the testimony of a complainant regarding the exact dates she was allegedly raped are inconsequential<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> since the date of the commission is not an essential element of the crime of rape, what is material being the occurrence of the rape, not the time of the commission thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This is especially true in this case where complainant recounted the details of the crimes in a candid and straightforward manner, positively identifying the appellant as her rapist.<br><br>Even so, we agree with the trial court that the imputed discrepancy does not show that complainant perverted the truth.

Jurisprudence abound that inconsistencies between testimony in open court and sworn statement given to investigators do not necessarily discredit a witness since <i>ex-parte</i> affidavits are almost always incomplete<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or inaccurate for lack of or absence of searching inquiries by the investigating officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> More so, sworn statements/affidavits are generally subordinated in importance to open court declarations because the former are often executed when affiant's mental faculties are not in such state as to afford a fair opportunity of narrating in full the incident which has transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In this case, ample margin of error and understanding should be accorded to the young complainant who, naturally would be gripped with tension, certainly much more than adults, when required to relive an experience she would most definitely rather forget.<br><br>We reject appellant's defense of alibi. He was properly identified by the complainant. More importantly, said defense does not preclude his presence at the <i>locus criminis</i>. Appellant claims that he was assigned in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte and Dulag, Bantay, Ilocos Sur. Granting he was in any of these places, however, it was not physically impossible for him to be in Lingayen, Pangasinan at dawn of April 3, and May 16, 1995, since the two places may be travelled in few hours by an ordinary mode of transportation, not to mention the fact that the very unit - Region I PNP Mobile Force - to which appellant belonged, was amply provided with utility vehicles.<br><br>Furthermore, upon careful scrutiny and review of the testimonies of the witnesses for the defense, the <b><i>only evidence</i></b> that would support appellant's claim that he was in Laoag City on April 3, 1995, and in Dulag, Bantay, Ilocos Sur on May 16, 1995, <b><i>is the testimony of his wife</i>.</b><br><br>As observed by the Solicitor General, appellant's alibi was never corroborated by Sgt.

We observe, however, that it committed an error in the imposition of penalty.<br><br>In each count of rape, the trial court imposed upon appellant the penalty of death pursuant to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Sec. 11 of R.A. No. 7659, the pertinent portions of which provide:<br><blockquote>"The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1.

When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency;"<br></blockquote>The trial court appreciated relationship and minority as qualifying circumstances considering that appellant is the cousin-in-law of the complainant, who, at the time of the commission of the crime was under 18 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The trial court also considered that appellant was a member of the PNP at the time of the commission of the crimes, hence it appreciated the same as another qualifying circumstance.<br><br>The fact that complainant was just 13 years old when she was raped is a matter well established by the prosecution. Standing alone, however, said fact would not justify conviction of rape in its qualified form. Not only was there failure in both informations to allege the <i>fact of relationship</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> between appellant and complainant, but more significantly, the appreciation of such relationship is in itself <b><i>legally flawed</i></b><b>.</b> Per express provisions of R.A 7659 quoted above, the required degree of relationship, whether by consanguinity or affinity, is up to <b><i>third civil degree</i></b> only. Here, the degree of relationship between appellant and the complainant, being cousins-in-law, is already in the <b><i>fourth civil degree</i></b>, a reason more than enough to bar its appreciation as a qualifying circumstance for purposes of imposing the death penalty under R.A 7659.<br><br>Likewise, there is substantial error with respect to the trial court's appreciation of appellant's being a member of the PNP as another qualifying circumstance. While the prosecution has proved that he was a member of the PNP when he committed the crimes, however, this fact has not been specifically alleged in both informations. The informations simply describe the appellant as a POI and/or a member of the PNP. There is no allegation that he committed the crimes while he was a member of the PNP. This dialectic defect cannot be considered as mere innocuous error. On the contrary, it is both substantial and procedural. If it is the prosecution's goal to have appellant adjudged guilty of rape in its qualified form, such conviction is manifestly not possible under <b><i>both informations</i></b><i>.</i><br><br>To charge appellant with rape in one of its simple forms and then try and convict him of rape in one of its qualified forms would be a prosecution without a valid accusation. Having been informed only of the elements of simple rape, which crime was duly established by the prosecution, appellant can be convicted only of such crime. It would be a denial of the right of the appellant to be informed of the charges against him, and consequently, a denial of due process, if he is charged with simple rape, on which he was arraigned, and be convicted of qualified rape punishable by death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Accordingly, the penalty of <b><i>reclusion perpetua</i></b><i> </i>should be imposed upon appellant, not death.<br><br>We also note that the trial court only awarded moral damages of P50,000.00 in each case.
