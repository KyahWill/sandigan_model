satisfying his lustful desires on the daughter of his common law wife one
sleepy afternoon, accused Eduardo Añonuevo will spend the longest dark night of
his life behind bars, indeed like a captured beast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On November 5, 1997, an
information was filed against the accused Eduardo Añonuevo y delos Santos, <i>viz</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 12th day of September 1997, in the
municipality of San Jose del Monte, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed
with a bladed instrument, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, by means of force, threat and intimidation, with lewd designs,
have carnal knowledge of the offended party Analyn Evangelista y Gamora, a
thirteen (13) year old girl, against her will and without her consent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law."<a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The accused pleaded not
guilty.  Trial ensued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The prosecution evidence shows
that the victim, Analyn Evangelista, is the daughter of the common law wife of
the accused.  Analyn used to live with
her grandmother in Bicol, but in 1997, her mother took her to live with her,
her three siblings and the accused in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Sometime in September of
that year, she learned that her mother planned to marry the accused.  She strongly opposed the plan as the accused
was, according to her, a "contrabida" in her life.  But she is not angry with the accused.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On September 12, 1997, at around
noon, she was at home, sleeping.  Her
mother and siblings were out.  She was
awakened by the clattering of plates; the accused had arrived home and was
eating.  He smelled of liquor.  She was still in bed when the accused asked
her on the whereabouts of her mother.  She replied that her mother was out.  The accused told her that he would lie beside her, but she answered that
she was getting up.  As she stood up,
the accused approached her, held her hands, and told her not to leave.  He then let go of her hand, but drew a fan
knife.  With the fan knife, he ordered
her not to move and shout and warned her not to tell anybody about what he was
doing, otherwise he would kill her.  The
accused instructed her to lie down again, but she refused.  Failing to make her return to bed, he pulled
her towards a mat and made her sit.  She
cried.  The accused again held her hands
and kissed her nape and cheeks.  He
removed her skirt and panty, and pushed her to lie down.  He also removed his pants, shorts and brief,
did the push and pull movement and inserted his penis into her vagina.  The insertion caused pain in her private
part.  The accused stopped only when she
told him that she wanted to urinate.  He
instructed her to wear her clothes and to urinate just inside the house.  She then confessed that she was not really
going to urinate.  He ordered her to
stop crying and fix herself up so she could borrow a saw from their neighbor as
he was going to mend their dish rack.  Before she went out, he warned her not to reveal the incident to
anybody.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Once out of their home which was
now hell to her, she went to their neighbor, but did not borrow a saw.  Instead, she reported the incident to their
neighbor named Elena.  The latter
accompanied her to the municipal building.  Along the way, they met Analyn's mother to whom Analyn revealed what the
accused did to her.  But her mother
dissuaded her from proceeding to the municipal building and told her that she
would first talk to the accused.  Elena
warned Analyn's mother not to go home as the accused had a fan knife.  Despite her mother's plea, Analyn, along
with Elena, went to the municipal building and reported the rape incident to
the police.  Analyn executed a sworn
statement narrating her father's dastardly act.  The following day, Analyn went to the doctor with her mother and
neighbor and had herself examined.  A
medical certificate was issued to her by the examining doctor.</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dr. Romeo Salen, medico-legal
officer, took the witness stand.  He
examined Analyn from September 12, 1997 to September 15, 1997 upon the request
of the San Jose del Monte Police Station.  She was accompanied by her mother during the examination.  Dr. Salen found that Analyn did not bear any
external sign of injury.  Upon
examination of the victim's genitalia, however, his findings showed that there
were congestion and abrasion of the vestibules, and the hymen was congested but
intact.  He explained that the vestibule
is a part of the female genital organ adjacent to the hymen or vaginal
orifice.  Congestion means that there is
reddish discoloration secondary to diffusion of blood in the tissue while abrasion
means that the superficial skin was destroyed.  He opined that the congestion could be caused by trauma, manipulation,
infection or irritation.  Irritation
could be caused by manual manipulation.  He further opined that the irritation may have started within 24 to 36
hours from the examination.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The lone witness for the defense
was the accused.  He testified that the
victim is the daughter of his common law wife, Merlina Gamora.  He has three children with Merlina aged ten,
six, and one.  Analyn is the eldest
among Merlina's and their own children and he treats her like his own
daughter.  He spent for her sustenance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The accused started living with
Merlina in Bicol when Analyn was still three years old.  In 1987, the family moved to San Jose del
Monte, Bulacan.  According to the
accused, Merlina's sibling was against his living in with Merlina and taught
Analyn not to respect him.  Thus, since
Analyn was four years old, she has been disrespectful towards the accused, but
the accused has only once scolded her since she was four years old.  The accused and Merlina were planning to tie
the knot on September 15, 1997.  Analyn
got mad when she learned of their plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The accused denied raping
Analyn.  He was a truck helper of a
certain Victorino Gerona and on September 12, 1997, he was at work from 7:00
a.m. up to 11:00 a.m.  He arrived home
at 12:00 noon.  Analyn was home,
sleeping.  He awakened her and shouted
at her to borrow a saw from the neighbor as he was fixing their dish rack.  Crying, Analyn went out to their neighbor
Elena, but did not borrow a saw.  At
about 2:00 that afternoon, while the accused was eating inside the house,
policemen arrived and arrested him.  He
inquired why he was being arrested, and they replied that he committed an
offense.  He went with the police to the
police station and there he was told that a child was complaining against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The accused denied owning a fan
knife or <i>bolo</i>.  He surmised that
Analyn filed a complaint against him because she was mad at him for ordering
her to borrow a saw from their neighbor and because Merlina's sibling
instructed her not to respect him.  She
was also mad at him because of his plan to marry her mother.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The trial court found for the
prosecution and convicted the accused, <i>viz</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

crime of Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and hereby sentences him to suffer
the penalty of DEATH, and to pay private complainant Analyn Evangelista the
amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages."<a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the following assignment of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.</p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED
IN NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE COMPLAINT WAS DEFECTIVE FOR FAILURE
TO STATE THAT THE ACCUSED IS THE COMMON LAW HUSBAND OF THE VICTIM'S MOTHER.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The law applicable to the case at
bar is Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659.  It provides in relevant part, <i>viz</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed
by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">a) By using force or intimidation;</p>

<p class="2Q">b) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
and</p>

<p class="2Q">c) When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.</p>

<p class="2Q">The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.</p>

<p class="2Q">Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or
by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to
death."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The pieces of evidence presented
by the prosecution show that the accused had carnal knowledge of Analyn through
force and intimidation.  The accused
ordered her to lie down, but she refused.  Thus, the accused had to pull her to a mat to make her sit and push her
knees so she would lie down.  While the
records do not show much physical struggle on Analyn's part to resist the
advances of the accused, this is understandable as she was intimidated by the
accused with a fan knife.  He warned her
not to shout nor to reveal the incident to anybody, otherwise he would kill
her.  In rape through intimidation, it
is sufficient that the intimidation produces fear in the mind of the victim
that if she did not submit to the bestial demands of the accused, something far
worse would befall her at the time she was being molested.  As ruled by the Court, “(i)f resistance
would nevertheless be futile because of intimidation, then offering none at all
does not mean consent to the assault so as to make the victim’s submission to
the sexual act voluntary.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> In several rape cases, the
Court has held that threatening the victim with bodily injury while holding a
knife or a <i>bolo</i> constitutes intimidation sufficient to bring a woman to
submission to the lustful desires of the molester.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The defense also makes much of the
fact that Analyn's hymen remained intact even after the alleged rape and
asserts that this medical finding does not support conviction for rape.  Accused's argument deserves scant
consideration.  We have many times ruled
that the fact that the victim's hymen is intact does not negate a finding that
rape was committed as mere entry by the penis into the lips of the female
genital organ, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, suffices for
conviction of rape.</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While not adhering to the
accused's conclusion of non-commission of rape because of the finding of an
intact hymen, plaintiff-appellee also gives much attention to this medical
finding.  The Solicitor General points
out that this finding, coupled with the absence of a positive testimony of even
a slight penetration of the victim's organ, should urge the Court to convict
the accused of only attempted, and not consummated, rape.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> We disagree.  The above-quoted portions of Analyn's
testimony and sworn statement, taken together, clearly show that the accused
inserted his penis into the victim's genitalia, although not sufficient to
break her hymen.  Even assuming that the
accused's penis fully penetrated the victim's genitalia, it is still possible
that her hymen would remain intact.  The
strength and dilability of the hymen may vary from one woman to another as we
stated in <b><i>People v. Aguinaldo,</i></b><i> </i></span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span class="ss"><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></sup></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">viz</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x. The strength and dilability of the hymen are
invariable; it may be so elastic as to stretch without laceration during intercourse,
or on the other hand, may be so resistant that its surgical removal is
necessary before intercourse can ensue.  Conception does not always imply penetration of the hymen, since
pregnancies have been reported in women in whom the hymen was intact or had
merely a pinpoint aperture in the membrane."<a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Analyn positively identified the
accused as the culprit.  The accused's
defense of denial thus deserves little attention since it is well-settled in
jurisprudence that denial as a negative and self-serving evidence does not
deserve as much weight in law as positive and affirmative testimony.</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Appellant's contention that the
complaint is defective as it fails to state that the accused is the common-law
husband of Analyn's mother, is immaterial to the case as the special
circumstance that qualified the rape committed by the accused is not
relationship but the use of a deadly weapon as alleged in the information.  But, while the use of a deadly weapon was
sufficiently alleged and proved, the trial court was in error when it sentenced
the accused to the supreme penalty of death.  In <b><i>People v. Sabredo</i>,</b></span><a style="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> we ruled <i>viz</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"The imposable penalty for
rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659,
is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  But where
the rape is committed with the use of deadly weapon or by two or more persons,
the imposable penalty ranges from <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.  The use of the bladed weapon already
qualified the rape (People v. De Leon, G.R. No. 128436, December 10, 1999, p.
11, 320 SCRA 495).  Under Article 63 of
the Revised Penal Code, the crucial factor in determining whether appellant
should be meted the death penalty is the presence of an aggravating
circumstance which attended the commission of the crime (People v. Bacule, G.R.
No. 127568, January 28, 2000, p. 17, 323 SCRA 734).  A perusal of the record shows that none of the aggravating
circumstances enumerated in Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code was alleged
and proven by the prosecution.  Where
there is no aggravating circumstance proved in the commission of the offense,
the lesser penalty shall be imposed."</span><a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Similarly,
in the present case, no other aggravating circumstance was alleged and proved
by the prosecution.  While we can gather
from the evidence that the crime was committed in the dwelling of the victim
and the accused, such aggravating circumstance was not alleged in the
information and, thus, cannot be appreciated in accord with the Revised Rules
of Criminal Procedure</span><a style="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and prevailing

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Anent the award of damages, the
trial court was correct in ordering the accused to pay moral damages in the
amount of P50,000.00.  In addition to
this, however, the accused is ordered to pay the victim P50,000.00 as civil indemnity
and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, the aggravating circumstance of use of a
