				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The two consolidated cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> are here decided jointly. Both cases seek review of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Sandiganbayan finding petitioner guilty of violation of Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3 (e), as amended, in each of the cases, and sentencing him to suffer:<br><br><blockquote>(A) G.

In a set of 64 related cases (Criminal Cases Nos. 2562-2624 and 2990) and 143 related cases (Criminal Cases Nos. 4277-4413; 4415-4420), the prosecutor (Tanodbayan) charged petitioner acting in conspiracy with several other public officers of the Ministry of Public Highways, assigned at MPH, Region VII and MPH, Central Office, Manila with causing undue injury to the Philippine government by causing, allowing, approving and receiving the illegal, irregular and unauthorized disbursement and expenditure of public funds, out of the National Treasury, from the period April 1, 1977 to May 31, 1977, in the amount of P 47,583.31 through the issuance of General Voucher No. 0105 and Treasury Check No. SN-3 2402412,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and the period August to November 30, 1977, in the amount of P49,725.00 through the issuance of General Voucher No. 2517 and Treasury Check No. 7933671.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>When arraigned on June 18, 1980<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and on December 14, 1981,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> petitioner Sayson pleaded not guilty to all charges.<br><br>On June 21, 1978, Ruth Paredes y Inting, supervising auditor of the Commission on Audit (COA) received an office memorandum from COA Region VII Director Sofronio Flores, Jr. directing her and Victoria Quejada to conduct an investigation on the fake letter of advice allotments (LAA) in the four highway engineering districts of Cebu (Cebu City, Cebu 1st, Cebu 2nd and Mandaue City Highway Engineering Districts) and to submit their report thereon.<br><br>Ms. Paredes’ team studied the flow of funds from the Ministry of the Budget down to the district level. They learned that on the basis of the appropriation laws and upon request made by heads of agencies, the Ministry of the Budget (hereafter referred to as the Ministry) released funds to various government agencies by means of an Advice of Allotment (AA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and a Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which were issued together. Upon receipt of the AA and CDC from the Ministry of the Budget, the central office of the Ministry, through its budget office, prepared the Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and the Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceilings (ACDC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for each region in accordance with the disbursement allotment. The SAAs were issued on request for allotment submitted by the District Engineer to the Regional Director in accordance with a program of work. Upon receipt of the SAA, the chief accountant of the central office would draw a journal voucher for each region, a copy of which is sent to the region concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The LAA, which was addressed to the engineer, was prepared by the Regional Office, and transmitted to the district office together with the ACDC. The LAA authorized the Highway Engineering District to incur obligations, such as purchases of supplies and materials for maintenance of national roads and bridges. The district prepared a Requisition for Supplies and Equipment (RSE), which bore the approval of the District Engineer and the Regional Director and certified by the chief accountant as to the availability of funds. A request for obligation allotment was then prepared so that a certain amount of the funds available to the district was set aside for the particular expenditures stated in the RSE. After that, advertisements were made and the bids opened. Once the winning bidder was determined, the purchase order was prepared and served on the winning bidder. Thereafter, deliveries were made, the corresponding delivery receipts and tally sheets were submitted, the inspection conducted and the voucher for the payment of the deliveries prepared. Once the general voucher was approved, a TCAA check was prepared by the disbursing officer and released to the contractor concerned. The Report of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officer (RCIDDO) was then prepared, listing all the checks issued during the period.<br><br>In the course of the investigation, the team of COA auditors led by Ms. Paredes uncovered the issuance of fake allotments. They identified the vouchers, which were charged against fake allotments for the years 1977 and 1978. They examined the SAAs and ACDCs coming from the Ministry of Public Highways Central office, the LAAs released to the different offices in Region VII, the logbook or subsidiary ledgers, the report of checks issued by the deputy disbursing officer, the vouchers and other documents relative to the transactions of the Ministry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On November 7, 1987, the President of the Philippines created a special cabinet committee to investigate alleged irregularities in the disbursement of funds of the public highways. The committee confirmed that the released SACDCs were bogus because they do not appear in the logbook of the Ministry and were not covered by any sub advice of allotment coming from the Ministry. They did not bear the releasing stamp mark on the top portion; the numbers were not in sequence; they did not contain the sub advice of allotment number from which they could have been taken nor the legal basis for taking them from the appropriations. Most of the fake LAAs were signed by accused Rolando Mangubat, chief accountant, MPH, Region VII.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In 1977, in Lapu-Lapu Highway Engineering District, no vouchers were sent to the regional office for counter-signature because all the vouchers were split into amounts of less than P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the Danao City Highway Engineering Office, no voucher exceeded P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Accused Delia Preagido y Comahig, an accountant assigned to the Ministry’s Region VII office, was discharged from the information to be utilized as a State witness. She handled the journal of collections and deposits, as well as the general journal. In the last week of January 1977, accused Mangubat told her to stay after office hours and handed her the sum of P500.00, saying that her salary was too small and that he would need her someday. Sometime February 1977, accused Mangubat again told her to stay after office hours because they would go to a conference at the Town and Country Restaurant in Cebu City.<br><br>It was agreed upon that on Saturdays accused Preagido, Cruz and Sayson would prepare and sell the simulated LAAs at 26% of the gross amount. Accused Cruz and Sayson would be responsible for negotiating the fake LAAs to contractors, district engineers and accountants of different cities. Out of the 26% proceeds, 6% would go to the signatories of the fake LAAs, ¾ of 20% to the regional office and ¼ of 20% to the central office people. The signatories on the fake LAAs were accused Rolando Mangubat, Adventor Fernandez and Heracleo Faelnar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They started selling fake LAAs in February 1977 until June 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the simulated LAAs, accused Mangubat certified the availability of funds but the SACDs were irregular because they did not bear the stamp mark of the releasing and budget section and they did not coincide with the regular CDCs. Accused Preagido identified the signatures on the fake LAAs as those of accused Rolando Mangubat, Adventor Fernandez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and Heracleo Faelnar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In his defense, accused Rolando Mangubat y de la Riarte<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> testified that the LAAs he signed were properly funded by the savings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the region, to wit: 42% of the equipment rental; 5% for the discretionary fund of the director and 2% for administrative expenses. The region saved and retained between 65% to 70% of the allotted fund because 25 to 30% of this was paid out for equipment rental and their projects were undertaken through contracts with private individuals. He insisted that the LAAs were genuine because they were properly funded and he was authorized to sign them. The LAAs were spent for the intended projects. He said that the performance audit team did not find any misuse or misappropriation of funds allotted to the region or any irregularity in the LAAs and CDCs he issued. He denied meeting accused Cruz, Sayson and Preagido in the restaurant to discuss the issuance of fake LAAs and the distribution of the proceeds thereof to different persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Accused Mangubat did not deny his signatures on the LAAs. He admitted that the LAAs were issued on the basis of savings realized by the region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He pleaded guilty to all the informations filed against him, for which the Sandiganbayan convicted him on October 20, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and on November 17, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Accused Jose Sayson y Delarmente was with the Ministry of Public Highways, Region VII, as Budget Examiner III. As such, he pre-audited disbursement of salaries and supplies of the Regional Office in amounts not exceeding P6,000.00. Disbursements in excess of P6,000.00 were forwarded to the COA resident auditor for pre-audit. His duty did not include allocation of amounts to different districts but only to disbursements within the regional office. He had no hand in the preparation of LAAs and CDCs, a task relegated to the accounting and budget section of the ministry where he was not connected. His immediate superior was Angelina Escaño, head of the Accounting and Finance Division. He denied meeting accused Mangubat, Preagido and Cruz at the Town and Country Restaurant or receiving any money in connection with the anomalies. He said that accused Preagido had been convicted in the other highway cases and simply wanted to implicate him and his co-accused to the anomalies.<br><br>On February 15, 1993, the Sandiganbayan promulgated a decision in the Lapu-Lapu City Highway Engineering District cases finding petitioner guilty of the crime charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgement is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>“x x x;<br><br>“In Criminal Cases Nos. 2562 to 2611 and 2613 to 2624, accused JOSE SAYSON is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in the violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019, as amended, for which he is hereby sentenced IN EACH OF THE SAID CASES: to suffer the indeterminate penalty of FOUR (4) years, as minimum, to EIGHT (8) years, as maximum; to pay a fine of P1,500.00; to suffer perpetual special disqualification from public office; to indemnify jointly and severally with the accused who were convicted in Criminal Cases Nos. 790 to 819 and 821 to 832,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the government in the amount stated in each of the said related cases; and to pay the costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>The Sandiganbayan found that since October 1977 chief accountant Rolando Mangubat no longer had authority to approve the LAAs because he was assigned on detail to the MPH central office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In 1977 and 1978, the fake allotments released to MPH Regional Office VII reached the total amount of P60,354,728.21.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The Sandiganbayan was convinced to the point of moral certainty that petitioner Jose Sayson y Delarmente took part in the conspiracy due to the positive testimony of accused Delia Preagido<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and the admission of guilt made by accused Mangubat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On December 13, 1993, the Sandiganbayan promulgated a decision in the Danao City Highway Engineering Office cases finding petitioner guilty of the crime charged, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgement is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>“x x x;<br><br>“In Criminal Cases Nos. 4277 to 4413 and 4415 to 4420 accused JOSE SAYSON is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in the violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019, as amended, for which he is hereby sentenced IN EACH OF THE SAID CASES: to suffer imprisonment for the indeterminate period of Four (4) Years and One (1) Day as minimum, to Eight (8) Years and One (1) Day as Maximum; to suffer perpetual disqualification from public office; to indemnify the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in the amount stated in the judgment in Criminal Cases Nos. 1646 to 1782 and 1784 to 1789,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> jointly and severally with the accused who were convicted in said related cases; and, to pay his proportionate share of the costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, these petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The issue raised is whether petitioner’s guilt of the charges against him has been established on the basis of the lone testimony of Delia Preagido, an accused turned State witness.<br><br>After carefully reviewing the facts of the cases herein involved, the Court is convinced that petitioner had no part in the simulation and negotiation of fake LAAs. The only evidence linking him to a conspiracy to defraud the government was the testimony of Delia Preagido, a previously convicted co-accused, who was discharged from the informations and utilized as State witness.<br><br>Does the fact that she has been convicted of cases involving moral turpitude and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, similar to the instant cases, affect her credibility as a witness?<br><br>We find Delia Preagido not a credible witness. She was convicted of several cases of estafa through falsification of public documents and of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Her discharge as an accused to be utilized as State witness was improper. She was one of the most guilty. In fact, she was given conditional pardon to induce her to testify against her co-accused. The Sandiganbayan itself found her testimony against the other accused to be incredible. How come that she was credible as against the petitioner? The Sandiganbayan erred in giving credence to her testimony against petitioner.<br><br>Indeed, the Sandiganbayan grievously erred in discharging her as an accused and allowing the prosecution to utilize her as a State witness. Rule 119, Section 9 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> as amended, requires that in allowing an accused to be discharged to be a witness for the State, the court must be satisfied that the accused does not appear to be the most guilty and that he has not at any time been convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, the discharge or exclusion of a co-accused from the information in order to utilize him as a prosecution witness rests on the sound discretion of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This discretion shall be exercised strictly on the basis of the conditions set forth in Rule 119, Section 9 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure. The court’s discretion is not absolute or arbitrary. Sound judicial discretion must be exercised with due regard to the proper administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> We consider it unthinkable that the Sandiganbayan can so grossly violate the strict conditions set out in this Rule.<br><br>In the discharge of a co-accused, the trial court may be reasonably expected to err. Where such error is committed, however, the error in discharging such accused cannot affect the legal consequences of his discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Neither may such error affect the quality of his testimony, if otherwise credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>However, as heretofore stated, we find Delia Preagido not a credible witness. She implicated petitioner to give a semblance of truth to her testimony. The Sandiganbayan found her testimony incredible as against the other accused. There is no rhyme or reason to consider the same incredible testimony credible against petitioner Sayson.<br><br>Accused Mangubat, the mastermind of the fraudulent scheme pleaded guilty to all the charges against him. The Sandiganbayan convicted him on October 20, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and November 17, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> His admission is binding only on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In light of the foregoing, the Sandiganbayan erred in finding petitioner Sayson guilty of violation of Republic Act 3019, Section 3(e). The elements of the offense are: (1) <b>that the accused are public officers</b> or private persons charged in conspiracy with them; (2) that said <b>public officers commit the prohibited acts during the performance of their official duties</b> or in relation to their public positions; (3) that <b>they cause undue injury to</b> any party, whether <b>the Government</b> or a private party; (4) that such <b>injury is caused by giving unwarranted benefits</b>, advantage or preference to such parties; and (5) that the <b>public officers have acted with</b> manifest partiality, <b>evident bad faith</b> or gross inexcusable negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The last two elements were not established in the cases at bar.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>REVERSES</b> the decision of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Cases Nos. 2562 to 2564 and 2990 and in Criminal Cases Nos. 4277 to 4413 and 4415 to 4420.
