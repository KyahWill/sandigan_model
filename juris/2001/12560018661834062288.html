Allan and Alberto, together with Antonio Martinez, Ramil Eugenio, Jessie Sambaan, and Jerry Deloso, left for Sitio Ampay, bringing with them a chainsaw, ropes, and other things they needed for cutting and hauling lumber. The group arrived at Sitio Ampay at about 10:00 in the morning of the same day, and started felling a tree and cutting the same into pieces using a chainsaw. At about 2:00 in the afternoon, the group began hauling the lumber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Thirty minutes later, while the members of the group were spread out, Allan Martinez saw four men approaching Alberto Martinez and his son-in-law Ramil Eugenio who were at that time connecting the chain of the chainsaw.

At 5:00 am the next day, Bernarda was presented with the dead bodies of the victims. Three days after the incident, Bernarda was informed by Allan Martinez as to the identities of the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>For their part, the accused-appellants Ronil Abundo and Rolando Bolambot interposed denial and alibi.<br><br>Abundo testified that on August 26, 1996, he was at the CAFGU detachment in Barangay San Antonio, RTR, Agusan del Norte, from 6:00 in the morning until 4:00 in the afternoon when Bernarda Martinez came and asked his assistance in rescuing Alberto Martinez and Ramil Eugenio who were held hostage by unidentified armed men in Sitio Ampay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Abundo told Bernarda that he would just meet her at her house as soon as he is relieved from duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> After Bernarda left, Allan Martinez and Barangay Chairman Virgilio Dawirao arrived and likewise sought Abundo's help in rescuing Alberto and Ramil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The three of them, together with one Rodrigo Calvo, went to the house of Bernarda.

In addition, both accused are hereby ordered to pay <i>in solidum</i> the amount of Sixteen Thousand Pesos (P16,000.00) representing burial expenses and expenses incurred during the 9-day wake as well as the amount of P5,300.00 representing funeral services.<br><br>"The case against accused Henry Ago and Brixcio Calvo are ordered placed in the archives until the above-named accused who are still at large shall have been arrested.

Ronil Abundo's alibi is that on the said date he was at the CAFGU detachment at the poblacion of San Antonio from 6:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. At 4:00 p.m., he was approached by Bernarda Martinez at the detachment and was asked by the latter to help in rescuing her husband and son-in-law in Sitio Ampay. Abundo argues that if he were in Ampay at 2:30 p.m., he cannot possibly be at the CAFGU detachment at 4:00 p.m. as the travel time by foot from Sitio Ampay to the detachment is two and a half (2 ½) hours, not one and a half (1 ½).<br><br>Bolambot, on the other hand, alleges that he was working as a carpenter at the house of Flora Ago from 7:00 to 11:00 a.m. and from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m., hence it was physically impossible for him to be at Sitio Ampay at 2:30 p.m.<br><br>The contentions are untenable.<br><br>For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus delicti</i> or within its immediate vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The contention of Ronil Abundo that he was at the detachment from 6:00 a.m. up to 4:00 p.m., uncorroborated by any witness, is self-serving and unworthy of credence. Even if Abundo were at the detachment at 4:00 p.m. where he was allegedly approached by Bernarda, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene at 2:30 p.m, as it was not sufficiently established that the travel time from Sitio Ampay to the CAFGU detachment at the poblacion of San Antonio is two and a half (2 ½) hours. According to the defense, the testimony of eyewitness Allan Martinez that the crime was committed at 2:30 p.m. and that he reached the house of Bernarda Martinez at 5:00 p.m. proves that the travel time is two and a half hours. We do not agree. Allan saw the four accused approach the victims at 2:30 p.m. Although the crime was carried out immediately, Allan "slowly crawled" out of his hiding place to avoid being seen by the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He then took a different route, that is, "through the thickets and forests" to avoid encountering any person on his way back to the poblacion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> These factors must have considerably slowed down the travel of Allan, thus negating the conclusion that the travel time from Sitio Ampay to the poblacion is two and a half hours. It should likewise be considered, as stated by the accused-appellants themselves in their Brief, that the time as stated by the witnesses was merely an approximation, "not as exact as [that seen] on a time piece,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for most of them, if not all, have no time pieces. Moreover, if we were to believe the testimony of accused Abundo that at 4:00 p.m. he was approached by Bernarda Martinez, and ten minutes later by Allan Martinez at the CAFGU detachment, the travel time from Sitio Ampay to the poblacion would only be about one and a half (1 ½) hours.<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">"Q:</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Was there anyone else who went to that detachment to request assistance in going to Ampay?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">Only Tata [Allan] Martinez and Nanay Narda.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><div align="justify">Who came first Allan Martinez or Bernarda Martinez?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">It was Nanay Bernarda who came first and who told us that Tatay was being held hostage by an unidentified persons (sic) in the mountain of Ampay.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><div align="justify">What time was that?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">About 4:00 o'clock, more or less, in the afternoon.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><div align="justify"><i>So, what time did Allan Martinez go to the detachment?</i></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify"><i>That was about 4:00 o'clock also, more or less, in the afternoon together with Barangay Captain Dawirao.</i></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><div align="justify"><i>If Bernarda Martinez went to that detachment at 4:00 o'clock and Tata also went there with Barangay Captain Dawirao at about 4:00 o'clock they must have seen each other at the detachment, is that correct?</i></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify"><i>No, Sir, that couldn't be because there was a gap of about ten (10) minutes.

[Emphasis supplied]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>If Allan left the crime scene sometime after 2:30 p.m., let us say at about 2:40 p.m., and was already at the detachment at 4:10 p.m., the travel time from Sitio Ampay to the CAFGU detachment would only be one and a half (1 ½) hours.<br><br>Accused-appellants presented witness Flora Ago who testified that Bolambot was doing carpentry work at her house at the time of the commission of the crime. The court <i>a quo </i>did not find Flora Ago to be a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Flora Ago is the mother of Henry Ago, the co-accused of Bolambot. At the time she testified, Henry Ago was at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Flora Ago herself admitted that she received some monetary consideration from the mother of Bolambot in exchange for her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Even if it were true that Bolambot worked as a carpenter at Flora's house on that fateful day, it is entirely possible that Bolambot slipped out at 1:00 p.m., committed the crime at Sitio Ampay at 2:30, and then immediately returned to work at Flora's house. As it is, the defense of alibi of the accused-appellants will not hold water. Alibi, though a weak defense, may occasionally prove to be a good plea; however, if there is even the least chance that the accused was present at the scene of the crime, as in this case, the defense of alibi will not prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We will resolve the second, third, fourth, fifth and eight assignments of error jointly as they involve similar and/or related issues.<br><br>Accused-appellants point out certain inconsistencies in the testimony of eyewitness Allan Martinez, and question his credibility on the ground of the belated disclosure of the identities of the assailants.<br><br>It is well-settled that minor inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> do not detract from its essential credibility as long as it is on the whole coherent and intrinsically believable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Inaccuracies may in fact suggest that the witness is telling the truth and has not been rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The testimony of Allan Martinez as to pertinent matters is clear, coherent and satisfactory. He positively identified the accused-appellants Abundo and Bolambot as the perpetrators of the crime. Hence, we sustain the trial court in giving credence to his testimony.<br><br>The disclosure by Allan Martinez of the identities of the assailants three (3) days after the incident does not diminish the credibility of his testimony. Eyewitnesses have a natural tendency to remain silent rather than imperil their own lives and those of their families.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It is clear from the evidence on record that Allan kept silent for fear of reprisal from the accused. In the testimony of Bernarda Martinez, she disclosed that after Allan told her of the identities of the assailants, he warned her not to divulge the information for the reason that "they might kill all of us".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Two days after the killing, accused Henry Ago asked Allan if he knew who the killer was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thereafter, Allan was "invited" by Ago to go with him to the house of Mayor Soliva where he was again asked to reveal the identity of the killers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In both instances, Allan pretended not to know.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> During the whole period of the wake of the two victims, the four accused were present almost every night, with Ronil Abundo carrying an armalite, while the three others carried double-bladed weapons tucked at their waists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> After the wake, Allan availed of the Witness Protection Program of the Department of Justice. When asked why he did not return anymore to Barangay San Antonio, Allan answered, "I was afraid".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Finding the reluctance of Allan to reveal the identity of the killers justified, the court <i>a quo </i>held thus:<br><blockquote>"It is not difficult to understand why Allan Martinez was afraid to divulge the identities of the suspects for when a person can deliberately kill another whom he affectionately calls "Tatay",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> it cannot be doubted that he can kill with impunity the witnesses to his felonious act. Moreover, Allan Martinez knew that Ronil Abundo was a member of the CAFGU assigned as such in the same Brgy. of San Antonio where Allan Martinez lives. This fact undoubtedly compounded his fear."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>The accused-appellants attribute as ill-motives of Allan Martinez the latter's relationship to the victim Alberto Martinez who was his uncle, and the accused-appellants' being "the bodyguards of Mayor Nilo Soliva of RTR and associated with Nani Abejo with whom the deceased family (sic) including Allan Martinez had allegedly some business differences or account to settle".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>A close relationship of a witness to the victim does not necessarily give rise to a false testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Besides, Allan likewise considers two of the accused, Rolando Bolambot and Henry Ago, as his cousins.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As for the contention that Allan is implicating the accused-appellants for being the bodyguards of the Mayor and associated with a person with whom Allan had some business differences or account to settle, the same fails to convince us, and we find such averment too frivolous to merit an extended discussion. Without any motive to falsely testify, witness Allan Martinez becomes all the more credible.<br><br>Accused-appellants aver that their presence during the entire wake just proves their innocence, as they could have easily fled if they really were the perpetrators of the crime.<br><br>This contention is unmeritorious.<br><br>Although flight of the accused is competent evidence which would tend to establish his guilt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> failure to flee is not a conclusive proof of his innocence. Some culprits remain in the vicinity of the crime scene so as to create a semblance of normalcy, careful not to arouse the suspicion of the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants further claim lack of motive on their part to kill Alberto Martinez and Ramil Eugenio. This argument deserves scant attention in view of the well-settled rule that lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the accused has been positively identified as the author of the crime, considering that nowadays, it is a matter of judicial knowledge that persons have been killed or assaulted for no reason at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Anent the sixth error, we reject the contention of the accused-appellants that the testimony of Rolando Bolambot was not considered by the lower court in making the appealed decision. It is true that the court <i>a quo</i> inadvertently excluded the testimony of Bolambot in writing the decision dated January 6, 1998 due to improper marking of the transcript of stenographic notes. However, upon realizing its mistake, the lower court immediately amended its Decision through an Order dated February 3, 1998 where it evaluated the testimony of Bolambot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Nevertheless, the lower court ruled that the testimony of Bolambot "cannot alter or modify the finding of the Court that the said accused are guilty xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>After a careful and thorough examination of the records of this case, we find the seventh assignment of error completely unmeritorious. Accused-appellants were actually given sufficient time to cross-examine the witnesses of the prosecution. We agree with the statements made by the Solicitor-General in his Brief, to wit:<br><blockquote>"In the case of witness Allan Martinez, appellants' counsel cross-examined him on June 16, 1997. Appellants' counsel requested for continuance on the following day. The following day, counsel was late but when he arrived he was allowed to cross-examine Martinez again for more than an hour (TSN, June 17, 1997, pp. 19-20)<br><br>"In the case of witness Bernarda Martinez, appellants' counsel cross-examined her on June 26, 1997 for more than one (1) hour although the court granted only one (1) hour. Appellants' counsel asked for additional time and the court granted additional 20 minutes (TSN, June 26, 1997, pp. 17-22).<br><br>"It appeared to the trial court that appellants' counsel was delaying the proceedings when after cross-examining the witnesses for more than one (1) hour each, counsel wanted to have more time to ask important questions. The court noted that appellants' counsel consumed his allotted time asking irrelevant questions and only to ask for more time to ask important questions (Ibid.).<br><br>"Appellants have to be aware of the mandate of the trial court judges that they conduct the trial with utmost dispatch, with judicious exercise of the court's power to control the trial to avoid delay (SC Circular No. 1-89, II (b)). This explains why the court was strict about time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote>Considering that strict enforcement by the trial court with time constraints appears to be reasonable, and was applied equally to both the prosecution and the defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> we find no reason to disturb the court's observations.<br><br>The accused-appellants were charged with Homicide in the Information filed against them, but were convicted of Murder by the lower court for lack of evidence to prove the element of robbery. A careful examination of the records of this case yields not even an iota of evidence to prove that robbery was the main purpose of the accused-appellants and that the killings were committed by reason or on the occasion of robbery. Hence, the accused-appellants can only be convicted of either Homicide or Murder.<br><br>As we held in the case of <i>People vs. Pacala</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><blockquote>"It is well-settled that in order to sustain a conviction for the crime of robbery with homicide, it is necessary that the robbery itself be proven as conclusively as any other essential element of a crime. In order for the crime of robbery with homicide to exist, it is necessary that it be clearly established that a robbery has actually taken place, and that, as a consequence or on the occasion of such robbery, a homicide be committed. Where the evidence does not conclusively prove the robbery, the killing of the victim would, therefore, be classified either as a simple homicide or murder, depending upon the absence or presence of any qualifying circumstance, and not the complex offense of robbery with homicide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote>Treachery is one of the circumstances that qualify a simple Homicide to Murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Treachery exists "when the offender commits any of the crimes against person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and especially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from any defense which the offended party might make."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In the case before us, treachery is clearly attendant to the killings. When the accused-appellants came, the victims were busy connecting the chain of their chainsaw. Alberto Martinez was in a squatting position facing Ramil Eugenio who was assisting him in connecting the chain. Accused-appellant Ronil Abundo suddenly shouted "Dapa! Taas ang kamot!" (Drop to the ground! Raise your hands!) and immediately shot Alberto Martinez who was still in a squatting position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Alberto "rolled over" after being hit by the bullet, but Abundo followed and stabbed him. Meanwhile, accused-appellant Bolambot immediately stabbed Ramil Eugenio, who, like his father-in-law Alberto was caught by surprise by the assailants. Bolambot was seen by eyewitness Allan Martinez continuously stab Ramil Eugenio three times. The post-mortem examination of the body of Ramil Eugenio yields a total of seven stab wounds, six of which were located at the back. The suddenness of the attack of the accused-appellants rendered the victims unable to put up a defense. Moreover, such attack was unexpected by the victims from the assailants, one of whom, Ronil Abundo, was intimately known to victim Alberto Martinez, and even calls the latter "Tatay". It is clear, therefore, that treachery attended the commission of the crime, and that the trial court correctly qualified the killings to the crime of murder.<br><br>Accordingly, we find no reversible error on the part of the trial court which would warrant a reversal of the judgment of conviction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned Decision convicting the accused-appellants Ronil Abundo and Rolando Bolambot of the crime of Murder and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to indemnify the heirs of the victims is hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Panganiban,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Cipriano B.
