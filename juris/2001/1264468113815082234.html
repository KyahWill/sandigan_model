ABRIL-PAWANG<br>Assistant City Prosecutor"</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Facts</u><br></div><br>I. The first attempt:<br><br>One night a few weeks after Jenalyn's mother left for London on August 9, 1992, then ten year-old Jenalyn was at home with her father, herein accused, and her brother, Ronald, in a rented house at Block 14, Lot 24, NHA, Barangay Sto. Angel in San Pablo City. While accused was drinking gin, he called both Jenalyn and Ronald and ordered each to drink a glass of gin. Since accused look irritated at them and both were afraid of their father who would spank them for no apparent reason, they drank gin as ordered. Accused then told them to sleep in the<i> "sala."</i> As instructed, they slept on a mat in the <i>"sala."</i> Accused joined them and slept between Jenalyn and Ronald. Jenalyn fell asleep immediately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At ten o'clock later that night, Jenalyn was stirred from her deep slumber by the movements of accused. Jenalyn was shocked to see her father naked. He was kneeling in front of her and his penis was touching her vagina. She no longer wore her panty. Accused's hands were mashing her pre-pubescent breast and he was forcibly introducing his penis in her vagina. Jenalyn struggled hard against accused, trying to remove accused's hands and to move aside his legs. Accused desperately tried to insert his penis into her vagina but could not. Then, accused masturbated. Jenalyn covered herself with a blanket and tried to sleep but was unable to do so at once, not only for fear that accused might rape her but likewise because she felt unbearable pain in her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>At around seven o'clock the next morning, Jenalyn woke up. She saw accused beside her, fast asleep. She got up, went to the toilet and urinated. Her vagina was still painful. She cleaned and washed her vagina. Jenalyn did not tell anybody about what the accused did to her because she was afraid of him since every time accused was drunk, he would warn them that he would kill them next to the others he had killed before.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>II. The second attempt:<br><br>The second attempt occurred in September 1996. At that time, Jenalyn was living with her aunt, Sonia M. Flor, accused's older sister, and her aunt's two children at Block 14, Lot 27, NHA, Barangay Sto. Angel, San Pablo City. Accused was likewise staying there. Accused and Jenalyn occupied the extension room located at the back of Sonia's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>One night in September 1996, at around ten o'clock in the evening, accused, who was very drunk, ordered Jenalyn to sleep in the extension room. Jenalyn obeyed her father as he was drunk and she was afraid to cross him. Accused once again said the names of persons he killed. Jenalyn was half-asleep as she was afraid that accused might attempt to rape her again. Accused took off his pants when he came into the room. Wearing only his brief, he laid down on a folding bed where Jenalyn lay. He smoked a cigarette and placed a knife on a table.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After he smoked one cigarette, accused removed the pillows by Jenalyn's side and entered the mosquito net which covered Jenalyn's side of the bed. Accused took off Jenalyn's <i>"porontong"</i> shorts and panty and placed himself on top of her. Jenalyn wanted to call out for help but accused poked the knife at her. Accused then tried to insert his penis into her vagina. Jenalyn struggled and kicked the accused. She felt accused's penis on her vagina. However, the penis was not able to penetrate Jenalyn's vagina. Accused stood up and masturbated until he ejaculated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>III. The third try:<br><br>On February 2, 1997, accused wanted to rape Jenalyn for the third time. Jenalyn and accused were still staying at the extension room of the same house of Sonia M. Flor in San Pablo City. While Jenalyn and her two cousins, Abigail and Iris, were watching the Sunday noontime show called ASAP, accused came home after a drinking spree and proceeded to the extension room. He summoned Jenalyn by whistling at her. Afraid of her father, Jenalyn went to him. Accused told Jenalyn to lie down on the folding bed and sleep. Jenalyn obeyed him since accused was drunk and she was terrified. Accused took off his trousers and placed his knife on top of the cabinet where he kept his clothes. Jenalyn tried to sleep but could not as accused was talking and telling her that he had already changed his ways and that <i>"malapit na akong mamatay."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Clad in his brief, accused took the knife on top of the cabinet and placed himself on top of Jenalyn. He took off Jenalyn's pants and panty and, with his brief lowered to his knees, tried to insert his penis into her vagina. As accused tried to force his penis into Jenalyn's vagina, she felt "as if something has been broken or turning apart (sic)." Jenalyn struggled against accused and tried to kick him off. Accused's penis was not able to penetrate Jenalyn's vagina, as his sex organ was big. He then stood up and masturbated until he ejaculated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>After the third attempted rape and Jenalyn could no longer stand the acts of her father, Jenalyn went to see her aunt, Rosario Fernandez Concepcion, a sister of her mother, and confided to her aunt what the accused had done to her. When Rosario asked Jenalyn why she divulged the incidents only then, she answered that it was because she was afraid. Jenalyn's aunt brought her to the police, who investigated her and took her statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center><u>The Arraignment and Plea</u><br></center><br>On September 16, 1997, the trial court arraigned the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, he pleaded "not guilty" to each count of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thereafter, a joint trial of the three cases on the merits ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><u>The Trial</u><br></center><br>The prosecution presented evidence, principally the testimony of the victim, Jenalyn F.

The accused did not succeed in inserting his penis into the vagina of his daughter. There was nothing in the victim's testimony that proved that the male penis reached the labia of the <i>pudendum</i> of the victim's vagina. She only said that "his penis was touching my vagina."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> There was no penetration, however slight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The victim said that there was indeed <b>no penetration </b>because the penis of the accused <b>was too big</b>.

The examination revealed that Jenalyn's hymen admitted one finger with ease and that it bore old healed lacerations at 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock. She identified her medico-legal report and declared that the lacerations could have been caused by penetration by the opposite sex, excessive exercises, accident, or trauma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In his defense, accused denied the accusations against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He interposed the defense of <i>alibi</i>.

Campuhan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we held that "a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the <i>mons pubis</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching of either <i>labia </i>of the <i>pudendum</i> by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness." In People v. Bation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we ruled that for consummated rape to be established, "what is essential is that there be penetration of the female organ no matter how slight." In People v. Oliver,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court ruled that rape is consummated "when the penis touches the <i>pudendum, </i>however slightly."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Or, there is "entrance of the male organ within the labia or pudendum of the female organ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Very recently, in People v. Francisco, the Court ruled that "[T]here must be sufficient and convincing proof that the penis indeed touched the <i>labias</i> or slid into the female organ, and not merely stroked the external surface thereof, for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape. As the <i>labias</i>, which are required to be `touched' by the penis, are by their natural <i>situs</i> beneath the <i>mons pubis</i> or the vaginal surface, to touch them with the penis is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface, hence, the conclusion that touching the <i>labia majora</i> or the <i>labia minora</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> constitutes consummated rape.<br><br>"But in the absence of any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching either <i>labia </i>of the <i>pudendum</i> by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In the testimony of Dr. Cerda, she admitted that the old healed lacerations found in Jenalyn's vagina "could have been caused by penetration by the opposite sex, excessive exercises, accident or trauma." In Campuhan, we elaborated on this. We said that "In cases of rape where there is a positive testimony and a medical certificate, both should in all respects complement each other, otherwise, to rely on the testimonial evidence alone, in utter disregard of the manifest variance in the medical certificate, would be productive of unwarranted or even mischievous results. It is necessary to carefully ascertain whether the penis of the accused in reality entered the labial threshold of the female organ to accurately conclude that rape was consummated. Failing this, the thin line that separates attempted rape from consummated rape will significantly disappear."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In Francisco, we further said that "[T]he prosecution has the <i>onus probandi</i> of establishing the precise degree of culpability of the accused. It must demonstrate in sufficient detail the manner by which the crime was perpetrated. Certainly, the testimony of the victim to the effect <b>that the accused repeatedly poked her vagina and that she <u>felt pain</u> as a consequence thereof, would <u>not</u> be enough to warrant the conclusion that a consummated rape had indeed been committed. </b> The quantum of evidence in criminal cases requires more than that. More so in the instant case where even the medico-legal certificate failed to back up the charge of consummated rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Consequently, on reasonable doubt, we cannot convict the accused of consummated rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> He could be guilty only of attempted rape.<br><br>As to the amount of damages, the trial court not only overlooked to impose civil indemnity which is mandatory upon a finding of the fact of attempted rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> but it awarded an excessive sum of P500,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.
