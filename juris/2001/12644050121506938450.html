				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The travails of a deposed President continue.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan reels to start hearing the criminal charges against Mr. Joseph E. Estrada.&nbsp; Media seeks to cover the event via live television and live radio broadcast and endeavors this Court to allow it that kind of access to the proceedings.<br><br>On 13 March 2001, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP), an association representing duly franchised and authorized television and radio networks throughout the country, sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> requesting this Court to allow live media coverage of the anticipated trial of the plunder and other criminal cases filed against former President Joseph E. Estrada before the Sandiganbayan in order "to assure the public of full ransparency in the proceedings of an unprecedented case in our history."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The request was seconded by Mr. Cesar N. Sarino in his letter of 05 April 2001 to the Chief Justice and, still later, by Senator Renato Cayetano and Attorney Ricardo Romulo.<br><br>On 17 April 2001, the Honorable Secretary of Justice Hernando Perez formally filed the instant petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> submitting the following exegesis:<br><br><blockquote>"3. The foregoing criminal cases involve the previous acts of the former highest official of the land, members of his family, his cohorts and, therefore, it cannot be over emphasized that the prosecution thereof, definitely involves a matter of public concern and interest, or a matter over which the entire citizenry has the right to know, be informed and made aware of.<br><br>" 4. There is no gainsaying that the constitutional right of the people to be informed on matters of public concern, as in the instant cases, can best be recognized, served and satisfied by allowing the live radio and television coverage of the concomitant court proceedings.<br><br>"5. Moreover, the live radio and television coverage of the proceedings will also serve the dual purpose of ensuring the desired transparency in the administration of justice in order to disabuse the minds of the supporters of the past regime of any and all unfounded notions, or ill-perceived attempts on the part of the present dispensation, to 'railroad' the instant criminal cases against the Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Public interest, the petition further averred, should be evident bearing in mind the right of the public to vital information affecting the nation.<br><br>In effect, the petition seeks a re-examination of the 23rd October 1991 resolution of this Court in a case for libel filed by then President Corazon C. Aquino.&nbsp; The resolution read:<br><br><blockquote>"The records of the Constitutional Commission are bereft of discussion regarding the subject of cameras in the courtroom.&nbsp; Similarly, Philippine courts have not had the opportunity to rule on the question squarely.<br><br>"While we take notice of the September 1990 report of the United States Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on Cameras in the Courtroom, still the current rule obtaining in the Federal Courts of the United States prohibit the presence of television cameras in criminal trials.&nbsp; Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure forbids the taking of photographs during the progress of judicial proceedings or radio broadcasting of such proceedings from the courtroom.&nbsp; A trial of any kind or in any court is a matter of serious importance to all concerned and should not be treated as a means of entertainment.&nbsp; To so treat it deprives the court of the dignity which pertains to it and departs from the orderly and serious quest for truth for which our judicial proceedings are formulated.<br><br>"Courts do not discriminate against radio and television media by forbidding the broadcasting or televising of a trial while permitting the newspaper reporter access to the courtroom, since a television or news reporter has the same privilege, as the news reporter is not permitted to bring his typewriter or printing press into the courtroom.<br><br>"In Estes vs. Texas, the United States Supreme Court held that television coverage of judicial proceedings involves an inherent denial of the due process rights of a criminal defendant.&nbsp; Voting 5-4, the Court through 'Mr. Justice Clark, identified four (4) areas of potential prejudice which might arise from the impact of the cameras on the jury, witnesses, the trial judge and the defendant.&nbsp; The decision in part pertinently stated:<br><br><blockquote>"'Experience likewise has established the prejudicial effect of telecasting on witnesses.&nbsp; Witnesses might be frightened, play to the camera, or become nervous.&nbsp; They are subject to extraordinary out-of-court influences which might affect their testimony.&nbsp; Also, telecasting not only increases the trial judge's responsibility to avoid actual prejudice to the defendant, it may as well affect his own performance.&nbsp; Judges are human beings also and are subject to the same psychologjcal reactions as laymen.&nbsp; For the defendant, telecasting is a form of mental harassment and subjects him to excessive public exposure and distracts him from the effective presentation of his defense.<br></blockquote><br>'The television camera is a powerful weapon which intentionally or inadvertently can destroy an accused and his case in the eyes of the public.'<br><br>"Representatives of the press have no special standing to apply for a writ of mandate to compel a court to permit them to attend a trial, since within the courtroom, a reporter's constitutional rights are no greater than those of any other member of the public. Massive intrusion of representatives of the news media into the trial itself can so alter or destroy the constitutionally necessary judicial atmosphere and decorum that the requirements of impartiality imposed by due process of law are denied the defendant and a defendant in a criminal proceeding should not be forced to run a gauntlet of reporters and photographers each time he enters or leaves the courtroom.<br><br>"Considering the prejudice it poses to the defendant's right to due process as well as to the fair and orderly administration of justice, and considering further that the freedom of the press and the right of the people to information may be served and satisfied by less distracting, degrading and prejudicial means, live radio and television coverage of court proceedings shall <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be allowed. Video footages of court hearings for news purposes shall be restricted and limited to shots of the courtroom, the judicial officers, the parties and their counsel taken prior to the commencement of official proceedings.&nbsp; No video shots or photographs shall be permitted during the trial proper.<br><br>"Accordingly, in order to protect the parties' right to due process, to prevent the distraction of the participants in the proceedings and in the last analysis, to avoid miscarriage of justice, the Court resolved to PROHIBIT live radio and television coverage of court proceedings.&nbsp; Video footages of court hearings for news purposes shall be limited and restricted as above indicated."<br></blockquote><br>Admittedly, the press is a mighty catalyst in awakening public consciousness, and it has become an important instrument in the quest for truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Recent history exemplifies media's invigorating presence, and its contribution to society is quite impressive.&nbsp; The Court, just recently, has taken judicial notice of the enormous effect of media in stirring public sentience during the impeachment trial, a partly judicial and partly political exercise, indeed the most-watched program in the boob-tubes during those times, that would soon culminate in EDSA II.<br><br>The propriety of granting or denying the instant petition involve the weighing out of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press and the right to public information, on the one hand, and the fundamental rights of the accused, on the other hand, along with the constitutional power of a court to control its proceedings in ensuring a fair and impartial trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>When these rights race against one another, jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> tells us that the right of the accused must be preferred to win.<br><br>With the possibility of losing not only the precious liberty but also the very life of an accused, it behooves all to make absolutely certain that an accused receives a verdict solely on the basis of a just and dispassionate judgment, a verdict that would come only after the presentation of credible evidence testified to by unbiased witnesses unswayed by any kind of pressure, whether open or subtle, in proceedings that are devoid of histrionics that might detract from its basic aim to ferret veritable facts free from improper influence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and decreed by a judge with an unprejudiced mind, unbridled by running emotions or passions.<br><br>Due process guarantees the accused a presumption of innocence until the contrary is proved in a trial that is not lifted above its individual settings nor made an object of public's attention<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and where the conclusions reached are induced not by any outside force or influence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> but only by evidence and argument given in open court, where fitting dignity and calm ambiance is demanded.<br><br>Witnesses and judges may very well be men and women of fortitude, able to thrive in hardy climate, with every reason to presume firmness of mind and resolute endurance, but it must also be conceded that "television can work profound changes in the behavior of the people it focuses on."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Even while it may be difficult to quantify the influence, or pressure that media can bring to bear on them directly and through the shaping of public opinion, it is a fact, nonetheless, that, indeed, it does so in so many ways and in varying degrees.&nbsp; The conscious or unconscious effect that such coverage may have on the testimony of witnesses and the decision of judges cannot be evaluated but, it can likewise be said, it is not at all unlikely for a vote of guilt or innocence to yield to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It might be farcical to build around them an impregnable armor against the influence of the most powerful media of public opinion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>To say that actual prejudice should first be present would leave to near nirvana the subtle threats to justice that a disturbance of the mind so indispensable to the calm and deliberate dispensation of justice can create.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The effect of television may escape the ordinary means of proof, but it is not far-fetched for it to gradually erode our basal conception of a trial such as we know it now.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>An accused has a right to a public trial but it is a right that belongs to him, more than anyone else, where his life or liberty can be held critically in balance.&nbsp; A public trial aims to ensure that he is fairly dealt with and would not be unjustly condemned and that his rights are not compromised in secrete conclaves of long ago.&nbsp; A public trial is not synonymous with publicized trial; it only implies that the court doors must be open to those who wish to come, sit in the available seats, conduct themselves with decorum and observe the trial process.&nbsp; In the constitutional sense, a courtroom should have enough facilities for a reasonable number of the public to observe the proceedings, not too small as to render the openness negligible and not too large as to distract the trial participants from their proper functions, who shall then be totally free to report what they have observed during the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The courts recognize the constitutionally embodied freedom of the press and the right to public information.&nbsp; It also approves of media's exalted power to provide the most accurate and comprehensive means of conveying the proceedings to the public and in acquainting the public with the judicial process in action; nevertheless, within the courthouse, the overriding consideration is still the paramount right of the accused to due process<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which must never be allowed to suffer diminution in its constitutional proportions.&nbsp; Justice Clark thusly pronounced, "while a maximum freedom must be allowed the press in carrying out the important function of informing the public in a democratic society, its exercise must necessarily be subject to the maintenance of absolute fairness in the judicial process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>This Court, in the instance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> already mentioned, citing Estes vs. Texas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the United States Supreme Court holding the television coverage of judicial proceedings as an inherent denial of due process rights of an accused, also identified the following as being likely prejudices:<br><br><blockquote>"1. The potential impact of television x x x is perhaps of the greatest significance. x x x.&nbsp; From the moment the trial judge announces that a case will be televised it becomes a cause celebre.&nbsp; The whole community, x x x becomes interested in all the morbid details surrounding it.&nbsp; The approaching trial immediately assumes an important status in the public press and the accused is highly publicized along with the offense with which he is charged. Every juror carries with him into the jury box these solemn facts and thus increases the chance of prejudice that is present in every criminal case. x x x<br><br>"2. The quality of the testimony in criminal trials will often be impaired.&nbsp; The impact upon a witness of the knowledge that he is being viewed by a vast audience is simply incalculable.&nbsp; Some may be demoralized and frightened, some cocky and given to overstatement; memories may falter, as with anyone speaking publicly, and accuracy of statement may be severely undermined. x x x.&nbsp; Indeed, the mere fact that the trial is to be televised might render witnesses reluctant to appear and thereby impede the trial as well as the discovery of the truth.<br><br>"3. A major aspect of the problem is the additional responsibilities the presence of television places on the trial judge.&nbsp; His job is to make certain that the accused receives a fair trial.&nbsp; This most difficult task requires his undivided attention. x x x<br><br>4. Finally, we cannot ignore the impact of courtroom television on the defendant.&nbsp; Its presence is a form of mental - if not physical-harassment, resembling a police line-up or the third degree.&nbsp; The inevitable close-up of his gestures and expressions during the ordeal of his trial might well transgress his personal sensibilities, his dignity, and his ability to concentrate on the proceedings before him - sometimes the difference between life and death - dispassionately, freely and without the distraction of wide public surveillance.&nbsp; A defendant on trial for a specific crime is entitled to his day in court, not in a stadium, or a city or nationwide arena.&nbsp; The heightened public clamor resulting from radio and television coverage will inevitably result in prejudice."<br></blockquote><br>In his concurring opinion in <span style="font-style: italic;">Estes</span>, Mr. Justice Harlan opined that live television and radio coverage could have mischievous potentialities for intruding upon the detached atmosphere that should always surround the judicial process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Integrated Bar of the Philippines, in its Resolution of 16 April 2001, expressed its own concern on the live television and radio coverage of the criminal trials of Mr. Estrada; to paraphrase: Live television and radio coverage can negate the rule on exclusion of witnesses during the hearings intended to assure a fair trial; at stake in the criminal trial is not only the life and liberty of the accused but the very credibility of the Philippine criminal justice system, and live television and radio coverage of the trial could allow the "hooting throng" to arrogate unto themselves the task of judging the guilt of the accused, such that the verdict of the court will be acceptable only if popular; and live television and radio coverage of the trial will not subserve the ends of justice but will only pander to the desire for publicity of a few grandstanding lawyers.<br><br>It may not be unlikely, if the minority position were to be adopted, to see protracted delays in the prosecution of cases before trial courts brought about by petitions seeking a declaration of mistrial on account of undue publicity and assailing a court a quo's action either allowing or disallowing live media coverage of the court proceedings because of supposed abuse of discretion on the part of the judge.<br><br><i>En passant</i>, the minority would view the <i>ponencia</i> as having modified the case law on the matter. Just to the contrary, the Court effectively reiterated its standing resolution of 23 October 1991.&nbsp; Until 1991, the Court had yet to establish the case law on the matter, and when it did in its 23<sup>rd</sup> October resolution, it confirmed, in disallowing live television and radio coverage of court proceedings, that "the records of the Constitutional Commission (were) bereft of discussion regarding the subject of cameras in the courtroom" and that "Philippine courts (had) not (theretofore) had the opportunity to rule on the question squarely."<br><br>But were the cases decided by the U.S. courts and cited in the minority opinion really in point?<br><br>In <b>Nebraska Press Association <i>vs.</i> Stewart</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Nebraska State trial judge issued an order restraining news media from publishing accounts of confession or admissions made by the accused or facts strongly implicating him.&nbsp; The order was struck down.&nbsp; In <b>Richmond Newspaper, Inc., vs. Virginia</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the trial judge closed the courtroom to the public and all participants except witnesses when they testify.&nbsp; The judge was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that criminal trials were historically open.&nbsp; In <b>Globe Newspaper vs. Superior Court</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the US Supreme Court voided a Massachusetts law that required trial judges to exclude the press and the public from the courtroom during the testimony of a minor victim of certain sexual offenses.<br><br>Justice Stewart, in <b>Chandler vs. Florida</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> where two police officers charged with burglary sought to overturn their conviction before the US Supreme Court upon the ground that the television coverage had infringed their right to fair trial, explained that "the constitutional violation perceived by the Estes Court did not stem from the physical disruption that might one day disappear with technological advances in the television equipment but inhered, rather, in the hypothesis that the mere presence of cameras and recording devices might have an effect on the trial participants prejudicial to the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Parenthetically, the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts do not allow live television and radio coverage of their proceedings.<br><br>The sad reality is that the criminal cases presently involved are of great dimensions so involving as they do a former President of the Republic. It is undeniable that these cases have twice become the nation's focal points in the two conflicting phenomena of EDSA II and EDSA III where the magnitude of the events has left a still divided nation.&nbsp; Must these events be invited anew and risk the relative stability that has thus far been achieved?&nbsp; The transcendental events in our midst do not allow us to, turn a blind eye to yet another possible extraordinary case of mass action being allowed to now creep into even the business of the courts in the dispensation of justice under a rule of law.&nbsp; At the very least, a change in the standing rule of the court contained in its resolution of 23 October 1991 may not appear to be propitious.<br><br>Unlike other government offices, courts do not express the popular will of the people in any sense which, instead, are tasked to only adjudicate justiciable controversies on the basis of what alone is submitted before them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> A trial is not a free trade of ideas.&nbsp; Nor is a competing market of thoughts the known test truth in a courtroom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Court is not all that unmindful of recent technological and scientific advances but to chance forthwith the life or liberty of any person in a hasty to bid to use and apply them, even before ample safety nets are provided and the concerns heretofore expressed are aptly addressed, is a price too high to pay.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">De Leon, Jr., JJ</span>., concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide, Jr., C.J.</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Bellosillo,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Quisumbing, JJ.,</span> joins the dissenting opinion of Puno, J.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, JJ.</span>, see dissenting opinion.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Kapunan,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.</span>, see concurring opinion.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Melo, J.</span>, joins the dissents.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza, J</span>., concur in the majority opinion of Vitug, J., and join the separate opinion of Kapunan, J.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago, J.</span>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">* </span>ON LEAVE<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Signed by KBP President Ruperto S.

On April 3, 2001, the Court, among others, required Presiding Justice Francis E. Garchitorena of the Sandiganbayan to comment on the request.<br><br>On April 5, 2001, Mr. Cesar N. Sarino wrote a similar letter to the Chief Justice requesting "x x x the Supreme Court to allow live television coverage of the trial" of former President Estrada.&nbsp; On April 16, 2001, Senator Renato Cayetano also prayed for the live coverage by media of the said trial subject to the conditions that the Supreme Court may impose.&nbsp; On the same date, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, thru its President, Arthur D. Lim, opposed the live radio-TV coverage of said trial.<br><br>On April 17, 2001, Secretary of Justice Hernando B. Perez also filed a petition "for live radio and television coverage" of the said cases "subject to whatever guidelines the Honorable Supreme Court may provide under the premises."

He alleged that "the communicative effect of live TV and radio coverage is much greater than print coverage" and "the freedom of television and radio broadcasting is somewhat lesser in scope than the freedom accorded in newspaper and print media." The opposition was fortified by a Supplemental Comment filed on May 30, 2001.<br><br><b>The Court's <i>en banc </i>resolution of October 22, 1991 absolutely prohibits live TV and radio coverage of court hearings.&nbsp; Its rationale is explained, thus:</b><br><br><blockquote>"While we take notice of the September 1990 report of the United States Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on Cameras in the Courtroom, still the current rule obtaining in the Federal Courts of the United States prohibits the presence of television cameras in criminal trials.&nbsp; Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure forbids the taking of photographs during the progress of judicial proceedings or radio broadcasting of such proceedings from the courtroom.&nbsp; A trial of any kind or in any court is a matter of serious importance to all concerned and should not be treated as a means of entertainment.&nbsp; To so treat it deprives the court of the dignity which pertains to it and departs from the orderly and serious quest for truth for which our judicial proceedings are formulated.<br><br>Courts do not discriminate against radio and television media by forbidding the broadcasting or televising of a trial while permitting the newspaper reporter access to the courtroom, since a television or news reporter has the same privilege, as the news reporter is not permitted to bring his typewriter or printing press into the courtroom.<br><br>In <b>Estes vs. Texas,</b> the United States Supreme Court held that television coverage of judicial proceedings involves an inherent denial of the due process rights of a criminal defendant.&nbsp; Voting 5-4, the Court through Mr. Justice Clark, identified four (4) areas of potential prejudice which might arise from the impact of the cameras on the jury, witnesses, the trial judge and the defendant.&nbsp; The decision in part pertinently stated:<br><br><blockquote>`Experience likewise has established the prejudicial effect of telecasting on witnesses.&nbsp; Witnesses might be frightened, play to the camera, or become nervous.&nbsp; They are subject to extraordinary out-of-court influences which might affect their testimony.&nbsp; Also, telecasting not only increases the trial judge's responsibility to avoid actual prejudice to the defendant, it may as well affect his own performance. Judges are human beings also and are subject to the same psychological reactions as laymen. For the defendant, telecasting is a form of mental harassment and subjects him to excessive public exposure and distracts him from the effective presentation of his defense.<br><br>The television camera is a powerful weapon which intentionally or inadvertently can destroy an accused and his case in the eyes of the public.'<br></blockquote><br>Representatives of the press have no special standing to apply for a writ of mandate (<i>sic</i>) to compel a court to permit them to attend a trial, since within the courtroom a reporter's constitutional rights are no greater than those of any other member of the public.&nbsp; Massive intrusion of representatives of the news media into the trial itself can so alter or destroy the constitutionally necessary judicial atmosphere and decorum that the requirements of impartiality imposed by due process of law are denied the defendant and a defendant in a criminal proceeding should not be forced to run a gauntlet of reporters and photographers each time he enters or leaves the courtroom.<br><br><b>Considering the prejudice it poses to the defendant's right to due process as well as to the fair and orderly administration of justice, and considering further that the freedom of the press and the right of the people to information may be served and satisfied by less distracting, degrading and prejudicial means, live radio and television coverage of court proceedings shall not be allowed.</b>&nbsp; Video footages of court hearings for news purposes shall be restricted and limited to shots of the courtroom, the judicial officers, the parties and their counsel taken prior to the commencement of official proceedings.&nbsp; No video shots or photographs shall be permitted during the trial proper." (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In banning live radio and television coverage of criminal proceedings, the Court stressed that it weighed "the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press, the right of the public to information and the right to public trial on one hand, and on the other hand, the due process rights of the defendant and the inherent and constitutional power of the courts to control their proceedings in order to permit the fair and impartial administration of justice." It also considered "the nature of media, particularly television and its role in society and of the impact of new technologies on law."<br><br><b>After the lapse of ten (10) years, I respectfully submit that the 1991 resolution of this Court absolutely banning live radio and television coverage of criminal proceedings should be re-examined to re-adjust the balance between a free press and a fair trial in light of the continuing progress in communications technology and to expand the right of access of the press and the public to information without, however, impairing the right of an accused to due process.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>I.</b><br><br><b>Estes case has been modified<br> by subsequent cases</b><br></div><br><b>Estes vs. Texas</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the linchpin of this Court's 1991 resolution is a <b>1965</b> <b>decision</b> where the US Supreme Court <b>first</b> resolved the prejudicial effects of in-court camera to the right of an accused to due process of law.&nbsp; In a 5-4 decision, <b>the conviction of the accused Estes was set aside in light of the factual finding that television coverage infringed his right to fair trial.</b>&nbsp; It found that during the preliminary hearing, "cables and wires were snaked across the courtroom floor, three microphones were on the judge's bench and others were beamed at the jury box and the counsel's table."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Court considered the <b>circus-like atmosphere</b> created by media as incongruous to the due process right of the accused.&nbsp; The <b>Estes</b> decision resulted in most of the states completely banning cameras in the courtroom but a few others experimented with the cameras and subjected their use to strict guidelines.&nbsp; Among the states that experimented was Florida.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><b>In 1981</b>, the Florida rules allowing television coverage of criminal trials were challenged in <b>Chandler v.

Superior Court</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> it was underscored:<br><br><blockquote>"The value of openness lies in the fact that people not actually attending trials can have confidence that standards of fairness are being observed; the sure knowledge that anyone is free to attend gives assurance that established procedures are being followed and that deviations will become known.&nbsp; <b>Openness thus enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system</b>." (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <b>Richmond Newspaper</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> it was rightly out that <b>openness is more important in the trial of high profile cases because of its prophylactic effect</b>, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>"When a shocking crime occurs, a community reaction of outrage and public protest often follows . . . Thereafter, <b>the open processes of justice serve an important prophylactic purpose, providing an outlet for community concern, hostility and emotion.</b>&nbsp; Without an awareness that society's responses to criminal conduct are underway, natural human reactions of outrage and protest are frustrated and may manifest themselves in some form of vengeful "self help," as indeed they did regularly in the activities of vigilante "committees" on our frontiers. . . It is not enough to say that results will alone will satiate the natural community desire for "satisfaction."&nbsp; A result considered untoward may undermine public confidence, and where trial has been concealed from public view an unexpected outcome can cause a reaction that the system at best has failed and at worst has been corrupted.&nbsp; To work effectively, <b>it is important that society's criminal process "satisfy the appearance of justice" . . . and the appearance of justice can best be provided by allowing people to observe it</b>." (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Without doubt, television can convey more completely and accurately the substance and subtleties of judicial proceedings to the public.&nbsp; As pointedly observed by Gardner, "unlike the print medium, television has the capability to cover a trial in its entirety - every word, every sentence and every gesture."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thus, it has been perceptively opined that the "pervasiveness of television makes it a <b>superior device</b> to disseminate information about a trial."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>Second.</b>&nbsp; It is a truism that an educated, enlightened and vigilant citizenry makes democracy works.&nbsp; The need for the citizenry to comprehend how its government fulfills its task of efficiently serving the people cannot be overemphasized. Again, <b>Richmond</b> emphasized the <b>educative effect of televised trials to the people,</b> <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>"When a criminal trial is conducted in the open, there is at least an opportunity both for understanding the system in general and its workings in a particular case.&nbsp; The <b>educative effect</b> of public attendance is a material advantage.&nbsp; <b>Not only is respect for the law increased and intelligent acquaintance acquired with the methods of government, but a strong confidence on judicial remedies is secured which could never have been inspired by a system of secrecy</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Of the three branches of government, <b>the judiciary is the least known to the public because its nature does not allow total transparency</b>. Thus, testimonies which can compromise national security are given in closed sessions, court deliberations are traditionally not open to the public, etc.&nbsp; Public, open trials of criminal cases under regulated conditions furnish rare opportunities for the people to understand and appreciate the business of the courts.&nbsp; In the same vein, they give the courts the chance to gain the people's faith and confidence on the system of justice. As well put by Justice Frankfurter, "the public confidence in the judiciary hinges on the public's perception of it, and that perception necessarily hinges on the media's portrayal of the legal system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>Third</b>.&nbsp; In a very informative article, Lassiter has revealed that empirical studies show that <b>cameras in the courtroom do not have any negative effect on judicial proceedings</b>, <i>viz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"Several states have conducted studies on the potential impact of electronic media coverage on courtroom proceedings, particularly focusing on the effect cameras have upon courtroom decorum and upon witnesses, jurors, attorneys and judges.&nbsp; In all of these states, the courts permitted electronic media coverage in both civil and criminal proceedings, although the majority of coverage was in criminal cases.&nbsp; <b>The results from the state studies were unanimous: the impact of electronic media coverage of courtroom proceedings, whether civil or criminal, shows few side effects.</b><br><br>In September 1990, the Judicial Conference of the United States implemented what was to be a three year pilot program that permitted electronic media coverage in civil proceedings in six federal district courts and two circuit courts.&nbsp; The Federal Evaluation indicated, among other things, that:<br><br><ul><li>&nbsp;overall, attitudes of judges towards electronic media were neutral and became more favorable after experience under the experimental program.<br><br></li><li>generally, judges and attorneys who had experience with electronic media coverage reported observing small or no effects on camera&nbsp; presence on proceedings participants, courtroom decorum, or the administration of justice;<br><br></li><li>overall, judges and court personnel reported that the media were very cooperative and complied with program guidelines and other restrictions that were imposed.</li></ul><br><b>Indeed, the Federal Judicial Center's "Summary of Findings" concluded that no negative impact resulted from having cameras in the courtroom.</b>&nbsp; In 1994, the Federal Judicial Center specifically found that results from state court evaluations of the effects of electronic media on jurors and witnesses indicate that most respondents believe electronic media presence has minimal or no detrimental effects on jurors or witnesses.

His physical demeanor, so important to trial judges to determine his credibility, may become less natural under the klieglight.&nbsp; More importantly, the fear of too much public exposure may cause reticent witnesses not to testify.&nbsp; Any of these circumstances will prejudice the right of an accused to a fair trial just as it will frustrate the discovery of truth which is the objective of judicial trial.&nbsp; <b>But these probable dangers are not insurmountable as other jurisdictions have demonstrated that they can be minimized if not avoided by appropriate rules regulating televised trials.

Perez would want this Court to allow live radio and television coverage of the court hearings on the plunder and other criminal cases filed against Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, et al. pending before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>In support of their request, they invoke the constitutional guarantees on the right of the people to be informed on matters of public concern as well as the freedoms of speech and the press including the right to discuss publicly and truthfully any matter of public concern without censorship:<br><br><blockquote>x x x<br><br>3. The foregoing criminal cases involve the previous acts of the former highest official of the land, members of his family, his cohorts and, therefore, it cannot be over emphasized that the prosecution thereof, definitely involves a matter of public concern and interest, or a matter over which the entire citizenry has the right to know, be informed and made aware of.<br><br>4. There is no gainsaying that the constitutional right of the people to be informed on matters of public concern, as in the instant cases, can best be recognized, served and satisfied by allowing the live radio and television coverage of the concomitant court proceedings.<br><br>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>Mr .Estrada, in his Comment on the petitions, expressed his opposition to the proposed live television and radio coverage of his trial arguing that such coverage would be prejudicial to his right to fair trial because radio and television as media can be easily manipulated for propaganda purposes; such coverage will play to the gallery; it may lead to the possibility that the trial court may be ultimately influenced by what sits well with the public; its rulings and decisions may take into account what will please the crowd; and it would "allow live play-by-play annotation of the hearings by people on radio and television with varying degrees of expertise and biases, in seeming mockery of the <i>sub judice </i>rule";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and that "it was the live TV coverage which ignited EDSA II."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>For its part, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) likewise has taken the stand against the live broadcast coverage of criminal proceedings for the following reasons:<br><br><blockquote>1. Live TV and radio coverage will negate the rule on exclusion of witnesses during the hearings intended to assure a fair trial.<br><br>2. At stake in the criminal trial is not only the life and liberty of the accused but the very credibility of the Philippine criminal justice system. Live TV and radio coverage of the trial will allow the 'hooting throng' to arrogate unto themselves the task of judging the guilt or innocence of the accused, such that the verdict of the court will be acceptable only if popular.<br><br>3. Live TV and radio coverage of the trial will not subserve the ends of justice but will only pander to the desire for publicity of few grandstanding lawyers.&nbsp; Instead of promoting the ends of justice, live TV and radio coverage will become the very instrument to distract litigants and judges, expose the judges to undue public scrutiny and pressure every step of the way, and undermine the integrity of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>I do not find merit in the petitions.</blockquote><br>In a clash between the rights to free speech, free press and of access to information on matters of public concern, and the right to a fair trial, the right of the accused should be the utmost concern of the Court.<br><br>The instant petitions, if granted, would throw overboard a well-established policy that considers such live radio and television coverage not only as prejudicial to the defendant's right to due process, but also as inimical to the fair and orderly administration of justice.&nbsp; In its Resolution, dated October 22, 1991, this Court laid down the guidelines for broadcast media coverage of courtroom trials, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Considering the prejudice it poses to the defendant's right to due process as well as to the fair and orderly administration of justice, and considering further that the freedom of the press and the right of the people to information may be served and satisfied by less distracting, degrading and prejudicial means, live radio and television coverage of court proceedings shall not be allowed.&nbsp; Video footages of court hearings for news purposes shall be restricted and limited to shots of the courtroom, the judicial officers, the parties and their counsel taken prior to the commencement of official proceedings.&nbsp; No video shots or photographs shall be permitted during the trial proper.<br></blockquote><br>The restrictions set forth in our Resolution of October 22, 1991, have remained sound and valid.&nbsp; I cannot find a rational basis to change the rule at this time, simply to suit the prosecution in the cases against Ex-President Estrada.<br><br>While the rights to press freedom and to information on matters of public concern are constitutionally protected<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in acknowledgement of media's role as a potent catalyst in increasing public awareness and interest in governmental affairs as well as other significant events and occurrences, including court proceedings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and of the importance of the free flow of ideas and information in a democracy, these are not absolute and must be taken hand-in-hand with other public interests. In weighing the freedoms of speech and the press and the right to public information, on one hand, and the right of the accused to a fair trial, on the other, the balance is never weighed against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>It must be made clear that there is no curtailment nor substantial diminution of the rights to free press and to information on matters of public concern brought about by the prohibition on live radio and television coverage of court proceedings.&nbsp; These rights remain amply protected even with the existence of such prohibition. In the criminal cases against Mr. Estrada before the Sandiganbayan, the press can still report on the proceedings being conducted therein.&nbsp; Media outfits can send their representatives to the trials and make their reports and comments thereon to their viewers or listeners.&nbsp; What is not allowed is for them to bring inside the courtroom their broadcasting equipment that would tend to hamper the orderly administration of justice.&nbsp; As aptly observed by Chief Justice Warren in his concurring opinion in <i>Estes</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Television is one of the great inventions of all time and can perform a large and useful role in society. But the television camera, like other technological innovations, is not entitled to pervade the lives of everyone in disregard of constitutionally protected rights.&nbsp; The television industry, like other institutions, has a proper area of activities and limitations beyond which it cannot go with its cameras. That area does not extend into an [American] courtroom.&nbsp; On entering that hallowed sanctuary, where the lives, liberty and property of people are in jeopardy, television representatives have only the rights of the general public, namely, to be present, to observe the proceedings, and thereafter, if they choose, to report them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It bears emphasizing that the right to a public trial belongs first and foremost to the accused.&nbsp; Said right requires that proceedings be open to the public to ensure that the accused is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The openness of a trial safeguards against attempts to employ the courts as instruments of persecution since it induces all the participants therein, <i>e.g</i>. judge, lawyers, witnesses, to perform their duties conscientiously, and provides the public with an opportunity to observe the events therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, a public trial is not to be equated with a "publicized trial," one characterized by pervasive adverse publicity that violates the accused's constitutional right to due process.<br><br>That the live broadcast coverage of the criminal proceedings may undermine the right of the accused to a fair trial cannot be ignored. Undoubtedly, television is one of the most powerful sources of information and news in our society. However, it is also one of the most manipulative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It can, intentionally or inadvertently, destroy an accused and his case in the eyes of the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It cannot deny the accused of his right to due process, including the right to a fair trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Television does not simply mirror or reflect events as they unfold.&nbsp; The images transmitted onscreen are the end products of a series of technical modifications employed by television editors and cameramen.&nbsp; Editors may eliminate or cut certain scenes of a trial in order to appeal to a mass audience.&nbsp; Cameramen may also manipulate what the public sees through the use of space, camera angles, lighting, juxtaposition, and editing techniques, thereby limiting the public's perception of the events being covered.&nbsp; Sadly, the public in general lack an understanding of how these tools work and more often than not fail to realize the distorting effects of these devices executed by an experienced cameramen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The negative effects that live television coverage of criminal proceedings may have thereon may even exceed those resulting from the biases created in the mind of the viewers from watching the images appearing onscreen. It is not unlikely that the television stations may decide that the trial itself does not contain sufficient drama to sustain an audience and thus provide "expert commentary" on the proceedings by hiring persons with legal backgrounds to anticipate possible trial strategy, in the same manner as a basketball expert anticipates plays for his audience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Arguably, this may be beneficial in the sense that the viewing public is offered guidance in understanding the events that transpire at a court proceeding. However, it cannot be denied that such live commentaries may intensify the biases shaped by the images of the trial on television, or worse, create wrong impressions in the viewers' minds. The same might also subvert our <i>sub judice </i>rule that media should refrain from publishing or airing comments regarding a pending case.<br><br>The transmission of edited images on television or the accompanying commentaries are not the only possible sources of bias which may unduly influence the outcome of a trial.&nbsp; The mere presence of the television camera inside the courtroom also inevitably affects the proceedings being covered for television can work profound changes in the behavior of the people it focuses on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>A study explained the effects of the presence television cameras inside the courtroom on the witnesses in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>The marketing consciousness of witnesses increases with the awareness of being on national or global television.&nbsp; There is a risk that a witness will alter his story in order to appeal to the television audience instead of fulfilling his evidentiary role.&nbsp; His testimony becomes more important for its entertainment value which may cause embellishment of certain aspects of his testimony.&nbsp; Many people dream of becoming a celebrity, and for many witnesses, this may be their only opportunity to shine in the limelight. This consciousness poses a danger of improper and inaccurate testimony. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Even the behavior of lawyers may be influenced by the fact that their case is being covered by live television:<br><br><blockquote>In addition, cameras pose a risk that lawyers will modify their roles.&nbsp; In a televised trial, the public becomes an extrajudicial audience that they must persuade. Lawyers may become preoccupied with the cameras which interferes with their devoting full attention to the fact- finder at trial. As a result, some lawyers direct at least part of their case to the television viewers instead of fully representing their clients to the presiding judge and the jury.&nbsp; Lawyers are motivated to present themselves well in they eyes of the public.&nbsp; In a highly televised trial, the marketing consciousness of lawyers may be affected. There is a danger that the media's production of the trial may transform into an excellent opportunity for the lawyers to gain free personal advertisement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The presence of television cameras inside the courtroom also places additional responsibilities on the trial judge.&nbsp; In addition to his duties of listening to the testimonies of the witnesses, receiving documentary and object evidence, ruling on motions and objections and ensuring that the accused receives a fair trial, he must also supervise the television crew present in his courtroom<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> to make sure that they do not disrupt the proceedings.&nbsp; Even the behavior of the judges themselves may be unduly influenced by such media presence, for although they are supposed to be more impervious to external pressures with respect to the cases pending before them, they still experience the same psychological reactions as laymen.<br><br>Judges and justices are also human beings.&nbsp; They cannot remain oblivious to the pressures that media can bear on them both directly and in the shaping of public opinion.&nbsp; Thus, any occasion that would give the impression that in rendering judgment, the judge was swayed by public opinion or any other factor extraneous to the evidence at hand should be avoided.&nbsp; As Chief Justice Taft in <i>Tumey vs. Ohio</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>.eloquently put it:<br><br><blockquote>x x x the requirement of due process of law in judicial procedure is not satisfied by the argument that men of the highest honor and the greatest self-sacrifice could carry it on without danger of injustice.&nbsp; Every procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man . . . to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Further, the negative impact of live broadcast media coverage of the trial on the accused is not inconsequential:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Its presence is a form of mental -if not physical - harassment, resembling a police line-up or the third degree.&nbsp; The inevitable close-ups of his gestures and expressions during the ordeal of his trial might well transgress his personal sensibilities, his dignity, and his ability to concentrate on the proceedings before him - sometimes the difference between life and death -dispassionately, freely and without the distraction of wide public surveillance.&nbsp; A defendant on trial for a specific crime is entitled to his day in court, not in a stadium, or a city or nationwide arena.&nbsp; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>There are those who believe that live media coverage would enhance the fair and orderly administration of justice.&nbsp; However, this belief ignores the fact that the behavior of the participants of the proceedings, <i>e.g</i>., lawyers and witnesses, may be unnaturally affected by their knowledge that their actions and testimonies are recorded on live television and radio.&nbsp; This was particularly observed by a law professor in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial in the United States:<br><br><blockquote>Within the Simpson criminal trial, most of the media's participant-observer glitches were attributable to the real-time electronic media broadcast of the proceedings on a gavel-to-gavel basis, especially by television camera.&nbsp; As Ellis Cose opined, "Many journalists and others idealistically believed that televised trials would enhance the quality of justice and increase general knowledge about the courts by providing public oversight not previously available. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Television did not deter lying witnesses; instead it rendered many truthful ones nervous and inarticulate.<br><br>Television provided the temptation, and the opportunity, for media-savvy lawyers and a media-conscious judge to sell their respective cases not merely to the jury , but literally to the world.&nbsp; The camera in this case and in this courtroom proved to be a world class platform for rhetorician, a snare for the unwary, a seducer and mirror to the vain, an indiscriminate and often harsh recorder of humor, wit, guile, trickery, and lies, and the transmitter to the world of both excellent and poor lawyering on both sides.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It is argued that the ruling in <i>Estes vs. Texas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>.that radio and television coverage infringes upon the accused's right to a fair trial has been abandoned in <i>Chandler vs. Florida</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>.where the U.S. Supreme Court said:<br><br><blockquote>An absolute constitutional ban on broadcast coverage of trials cannot be justified simply because there is a danger that, in some cases, prejudicial broadcast accounts of pre-trial and trial events may impair the ability of jurors to decide the issue of guilt or innocence uninfluenced by extraneous matter.&nbsp; The risk of juror prejudice in some cases does not justify an absolute ban on news coverage of trials by the printed media; so also the risk of such prejudice does not warrant an absolute constitutional ban on all broadcast coverage.&nbsp; The appropriate safeguard against such prejudice is the defendant's right to demonstrate that the media's coverage of his case--be it printed or broadcast-- compromised the ability of the particular jury that heard the case to adjudicate fairly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It should be pointed out that there are no television cameras permitted in federal courts in the United States<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> despite experiments with their use. In contrast, there is no constitutional impediment to the use of television cameras in state courts, provided they do not distract the jurors and witnesses, or unduly burden the judge, thereby depriving the defendant of a fair trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>It is evident that our policy banning live radio and television coverage of criminal proceedings is the same as that provided in U.S. federal courts.&nbsp; There is no convincing reason that the practice in some state courts is better than that followed in the federal courts concerning the banning of such radio and television coverage.<br><br>In any event, <i>Chandler</i> would necessarily imply that if the defendant's right to fair trial is compromised by the broadcast coverage, then the ban should be imposed.&nbsp; Here, the fears expressed by Mr. Estrada and the IBP should live radio and television be allowed to cover his trial are not without bases.&nbsp; The pervasive radio and television coverage of Mr. Estrada's impeachment hearing and of his arrest appear to have moved the crowd to march in the so-called EDSA II and EDSA III mass actions that toppled a government and tried to topple another.<br><br>With due respect, I doubt the efficacy of the measures suggested by the dissenting opinions to ensure fair trial in a criminal proceeding covered by live radio and television.&nbsp; These are: (1) no witness can be compelled to have his testimony televised; (2) the cameras and other equipment must be placed in the courtroom in such a manner as to be unobtrusive, possibly only a single fixed camera be installed in the courtroom to feed the broadcast stations; (3) no film, videotape, photography and audio reproductions may be used for advertising and commercial purposes; and (4) the radio and television broadcasters should give a balanced coverage of the prosecution and the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>It is not merely the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">obtrusive</span> location in the courtroom of the cameras or their effects on the decorum, solemnity and dignity of the court that impinges on the accused's right to a fair trial.&nbsp; It is the beaming of or transmission of all events, testimonies and faces inside the courtroom directly to the viewing public, including the milling crowd outside the court's premises, coupled with the running accounts of the proceedings by the radio and television networks, which may be slanted or distorted by bias, self-interests and hate, thus whipping up passion and rage among the viewers, that offends the right of the accused to a fair trial. Depending upon the mood of the crowd, whether approving or threatening, witnesses may exaggerate, hesitate, backtrack or cower.<br><br>The judge has no immediate control over how the film, videotapes, etc. are used, whether for advertising or commercial purposes, although he may later on impose sanctions for their misuse, but then the deleterious effects to a fair trial are beyond recall.<br><br>Further, how can the court enforce guidelines that radio and television broadcasters should give a balanced coverage of the prosecution and the defense?&nbsp; Even if the court's rulings over the proposed guidelines are promptly made, they are subject to appeal, thus possibly delaying the court proceedings over collateral matters. And even if the trial should proceed and the accused convicted pending appeal on the court's rulings, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the accused may seek the reversal of said conviction on the ground of mistrial due to the deprivation of his right to due process</span>.&nbsp; The damage then to all concerned is irreparable.<br><br>I believe that the present prohibition on the live radio and television coverage of court proceedings strikes the balance between the rights to free speech and press and to information on matters of public concern, and the accused's right to a fair trial, and remains to be the practical rule on the matter.<br><br>Finally, as I have earlier stressed, recent history as shown that television broadcasts of significant national events have a strong tendency to incite pent-up emotions and feelings of an emotional populace. Undeniably, the events that occurred on January 16, 2001 which led to the abrupt conclusion of Mr. Estrada's impeachment trial, witnessed by thousands of viewers on their television screens, triggered EDSA II.&nbsp; In the same manner, the broadcast coverage of Mr. Estrada's arrest caused pro-Estrada groups to express their outrage at EDSA III.<br><br>It is not unlikely that the televised coverage of Mr. Estrada's trial would induce either or both of these groups to again resort to demonstrations aimed at pressuring the Sandiganbayan to come up with a verdict favorable to them.&nbsp; Any attempt to pressure or interfere with the judicial process should be avoided, for court proceedings are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting hall, the radio, and the newspaper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The nature of judicial proceedings requires that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence, and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Our nation has only begun the reconciliation process between the pro- and anti-Estrada groups.&nbsp; Broadcasting Mr. Estrada's trial would only ignite the spark that brought forth EDSA II and EDSA III and resurrect the division between these groups.<br><br>I vote to <b>DENY </b>the petitions.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Petition of the Secretary of the Department of Justice, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Supplemental Comment on Petition for Live Radio-TV Coverage, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Comment on Petition for Live Radio-TV Coverage, p.4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Resolution of the Board of Governors of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines dated April 8, 2001, pp. 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Article III of the Constitution provides:<br><br>Section 4.

Vitug, absolutely banning live media coverage of judicial trials.<br><br>In justifying this proscription, the majority relies mainly on an en banc Resolution dated October 22, 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in which this Court resolved to totally prohibit live radio and television coverage of court hearings, mainly because of "the prejudice it poses (1) to defendant's right to due process, (2) and to the fair and orderly administration of justice;" (3) while pointing out, on the other hand, that "the right of the people to information may be served and satisfied by less distracting, degrading and prejudicial means."<br><br>That was in 1991.&nbsp; Today in 2001, I respectfully submit that it is technologically possible to uphold the right of the people to public information without violating the right of the accused to due process and without impeding the orderly administration of justice.&nbsp; It is now feasible to satisfy the people's right to information "by less distracting, degrading and prejudicial means."<br><br>At bottom, I would like to believe that media and the judiciary are natural partners, because they are bound together by the same reasons for being - the search for truth, the protection of the peoples' rights, and the defense of the basic norms of society.&nbsp; By proscribing live coverage of trials and hearings, the Court has lost an indispensible teammate in discovering, processing and reporting the raw, unadulterated and unvarnished truth.&nbsp; Why is the majority afraid of the truth?&nbsp; More pointedly, why is it fearful of the whole truth and nothing but the unedited truth?&nbsp; Does it not believe that the "truth shall set us free?"<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Basic Premise:&nbsp; Free,<br>Open and Public Hearing</i><br><br>The basic premise of this Dissent is that, as a general rule, everyone has a right to attend and witness a trial or hearing, especially if criminal in nature, under the constitutional principles of transparency, and of free, open and public hearings of cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> However, given the limitations of time and space in a courtroom, it is not always possible to physically accommodate all persons interested in witnessing a court hearing.&nbsp; That is why court salas have been enlarged.&nbsp; Moreover, microphones equipped with electronic amplifiers, and sometimes with closed circuit television, have in the past been used to project the proceedings to the immediate vicinity of the courtroom <i>via</i> radio speakers, TV monitors and projection screens.&nbsp; <i>In this manner, people outside have been able to listen to and watch the proceedings, as if they were inside the courtroom.</i><br><br><i>As the 21<sup>st</sup> century dawns, it is now possible to use even more advanced technology to enable more people to watch judicial proceedings in the privacy of their homes and offices without causing prejudice to the rights of the accused or to the integrity of orderly justice.</i><br><br><i style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Mechanics of Opening Court <br>Hearings to Media Coverage</i><br><br>Indeed, a single fixed camera under the control of the court, could catch, live, the incidents in the trial.&nbsp; The audio-video output of the camera could be flashed on big, wide TV monitors or projection screens inside and outside the courtroom.&nbsp; This will also enable TV and radio crews <i>outside the courtroom</i> to beam the output to their respective stations for broadcasting to the public, without the ubiquitous and intimidating wiring, lights or media cameras inside the courthouse.<br><br>The video camera will be placed in the rear of the courtroom and its position shall be locked to wide-angle, so that only a "stationary audience view" is attained.&nbsp; There will be no other cameras, lights or other media equipment, which can cause nervousness or anxiety to witnesses, lawyers and other personalities directly involved in a judicial trial.<br><br><i style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">No Prejudice to<br> the Accused</i><br><br>Needless to state, this method will prevent editorializing or sensationalism, which the Court in 1991 feared.&nbsp; In this manner, there will be no unwelcome camera focusing, probing, angling, panning or other kinds of manipulation.<br><br>Radio and TV reporters, by patching their connectors to the distribution amplifiers, will be able to do live broadcasts of the proceedings without hustling the judges, lawyers, parties or witnesses.&nbsp; They will be able to broadcast only such matters as a spectator in the courtroom can see and hear.<br><br>After a long and serious reflection on this matter, I think that the setting up of a single fixed camera inside the courtroom, to which broadcast stations could connect, is the answer to the opposing positions of the parties and the intervenors in the present matter.&nbsp; To repeat, <i>this single fixed camera will give its viewers the chance to be similarly situated as a spectator inside the court who can see, watch and hear the unfolding drama of the court proceedings.&nbsp; </i>Surely, the recipients of the TV signals beamed by broadcast stations cannot interfere and prejudice the fair and orderly administration of justice, for the simple reason that they are outside the vicinity of the courtroom. Thus, they cannot by any means be the "hooting throng" that the IBP scorns and fears, thinking they would destroy the constitutionally recognized judicial atmosphere and decorum.<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Proper Balancing of<br> Conflicting Interests</i><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br>A trial must be public and transparent, because openness is vital to the effective administration of criminal justice in a democracy.&nbsp; Not only does it safeguard the rights of the accused; it likewise ensures public trust in the conduct of the trial.<br><br>Therefore, after balancing the interests of the parties concerned -- the constitutional rights of the accused and the requirements of orderly procedures vis-à-vis the people's fundamental freedom of expression and right to information on matters of public concern -- I respectfully submit that live coverage <i>via</i> a single fixed camera inside the courtroom, through which the media can access and therefore broadcast the proceedings to the entire nation and to the world, is the best technological and legal solution to the concerns raised by the Court in 1991 and to the objections now aired by the accused (former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada) and the IBP.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><i>Epilogue</i><br></div><br>A new world order brought about by the information highway and the influx of new technology in communications is dawning.&nbsp; And yet the Court, by its Decision today, has turned its back and refused to march in cadence with the music created by the chimes of changing technology.&nbsp; Our people, long awakened from the dark ages in Philippine history, are now clamoring to be veritable witnesses to the truth, and this clamor can be answered technologically by giving them a firsthand view of how the justice system operates.&nbsp; To keep public trust and esteem, transparency and accountability were cornerstones of this Court's avowed policies as it celebrated its centenary on June 11, 2001.&nbsp; What better proof that it is sincere in realizing its goal of judicial renaissance than by opening up its proceedings without, however, compromising the rights of the accused and the integrity of orderly justice.<br><br>Indeed, in a free society where transparency and accountability are the desirable standards of public office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> this Court can no longer totally prohibit live media coverage of trials and hearings, given the reality that the technology of modern communications has adequately overcome the obsolete reasons for the ban.<br><br>These advances in communication facilities have now made it possible to satisfy the people's constitutional right to information without violating the constitutional right of the accused to a fair trial and without subverting the orderly administration of justice.&nbsp; <i>Indeed, it is now technologically feasible to give people in their homes and offices the same access to trials as spectators inside the courthouse.</i><br><br>Let the light of truth be beamed to all the people through the advances of science and technology in the 21<sup>st</sup> century!<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to <i style="font-weight: bold;">GRANT</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>the request of the KBP and the Petition of the justice secretary, subject to the safeguards prescribed above.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In Re:&nbsp; Live TV and Radio Coverage of the Hearing of President Corazon C.

But I am convinced that such right cannot be given preference over the right of an accused to a fair and impartial trial.&nbsp; To my mind, the fair administration of criminal justice cannot be subordinated to the people's right to information, particularly in the present case, where what at stake is the life of an individual.<br><br><b>The job of the judiciary is not to teach the public of its inner workings but to preserve fairness within the system</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> No empirical evidence exists which indicates that televised criminal proceedings broaden the public's understanding of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The New York University conducted a study following an enactment of legislation prescribing an eighteen-month experimental period of televising criminal trials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The results indicated that viewing criminal trials had virtually no effect on the level of the public understanding of even the most rudimentary aspects of court proceedings.<br><br>The fact that the accused held the highest position in the land is significant.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, his stature strongly justifies the denial of the request for a televised trial.&nbsp; To be sure, even before the camera starts moving, the case would have already achieved a sensational status.&nbsp; When a case is sensationalized, there is a greater difficulty in safeguarding the rights of the accused, particularly, his right to due process, which basically requires that the court trying the case should be impartial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> free from outside pressure and interference.&nbsp; The presence of news media can deny a defendant that "<i>judicial serenity and calm" </i>which due process of law guarantees.&nbsp; This should not be allowed.&nbsp; Every person accused of a crime is entitled to a fair and impartial trial in which his legal rights are protected,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> that is, a trial of facts, in accordance with the law and the evidence before an unbiased tribunal, in an atmosphere free from harmful error and from any extraneous influence that might be to his prejudice. The Supreme Court of the United States gives this right a ringing tone of support in its numerous decisions. Thus, in <i>Irvin v. Dowd,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the defendant was convicted of murder following intensive and hostile news coverage.&nbsp; On review, the Court vacated the conviction and death sentence and remanded the case to the court <b><i>a quo</i></b> to allow a new trial for <b>"<i>[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much that petitioner be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so huge a wave of public passion</i>....."</b> Similarly, in <i>Rideau v. Lousiana</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>,the Court reversed the conviction of a defendant whose staged, highly emotional confession had been filmed with the cooperation of local police and later broadcast on television for three days while he was awaiting trial, holding: <b><i>"[a]ny subsequent court proceedings in </i>a <i>community so pervasively exposed to such </i>a <i>spectacle could be but </i>a <i>hallow formality."</i></b><br><br>In <i>Estes v. Texas,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court ruled that the defendant had not been afforded due process where the volume of trial publicity, the judge's failure to control the proceedings, the telecast of the hearing and the trial itself "<b><i>inherently prevented </i>a <i>sober search for the truth</i></b><i>." </i>It was further held that the televising of <b>"notorious"</b> criminal trials is prohibited by the "due process of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Justice Harlan, supplying the winning vote, agreed but only because the Estes trial was one of "<b>great notoriety.</b>"&nbsp; He made clear that he would reserve judgment on more routine cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In <i>Sheppard v. Maxwell,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> with only Mr. Justice Black dissenting, the Court ordered a new trial for the petitioner, even though the first trial had occurred 12 years before.&nbsp; The Court noted that, <i>"unfair and prejudicial news comment on pending trial has become increasingly prevalent" </i>and issued a strong warning, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"X x x. Due process requires that the accused receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside influences.&nbsp; Given the pervasiveness of modern communications and the difficulty of effacing prejudicial publicity from the minds of the jurors, the trial courts must take strong measures to ensure that the balance is never weighed against the accused.&nbsp; X x x.&nbsp; <b>If publicity during the proceedings threatens the fairness of the trial, a new trial should be ordered.&nbsp; But we must remember that reversals are but palliatives; the cure lies in those remedial measures that will prevent the prejudice at its inception. The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their processes from prejudicial outside interferences.</b>&nbsp; Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense, the accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the court should be permitted to frustrate its function.&nbsp; Collaboration between the counsel and the press as to information affecting the fairness of a criminal trial is not only subject to regulation, but is highly censurable and worthy of disciplinary measures." (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>KPNX Broadcasting Co. v. Arizona Superior Court,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the said US Supreme Court ruled that courts "may insist that the only performance which goes on in the courtroom is the trial of the case at hand." The Court said further that <i>"<b>the fact that media coverage has transformed events such as professional sports contests into a framework designed to accommodate that coverage does not mean that the First Amendment requires criminal trials to undergo the same transformation</b>.<b>"</b> </i>In reaching these conclusions, the Court addressed the importance of a trial with no outside distractions.&nbsp; While the Court recognizes the media's right to freedom of the press within the First Amendment, it also recognizes the right of a court to close its doors.&nbsp; The Court condemns the transformation of a criminal trial into a spectacle created by intense media coverage.<br><br>In the Philippines, the legal aspect of prejudicial publicity through television has not yet been fully considered.&nbsp; To reiterate, the last time this Court directly came across with such an issue was on October 22, 1991, in <i>"Re:Live TV and Radio Coverage of the Hearing of President Corazon C. Aquino's Libel Case.&nbsp; "</i>Relying on Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the case of <i>Estes v. Texas, </i>this Court issued an <b><i>En Banc</i></b> Resolution on the said date prohibiting the live radio and television coverage of court proceedings.<br><br>I see no justification to modify the said Resolution.&nbsp; It was relevant then as it is now.<br><br>Moreover, to allow media coverage of the Estrada trial would be to open a veritable Pandora's box of afflictions which will stymie the judiciary's efforts to make certain that the administration of justice is effected with equanimity, speed, and judiciousness.&nbsp; To be sure, our ruling will apply to all lower courts, including the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Therefore, we should not be overly swayed by the passing passions generated by the Estrada cases into promulgating a doctrine which this Court will rue in its supervision of lower courts and in the exercise of its own original and appellate jurisdiction.<br><br>Assuming that this Court authorizes the desired media coverage, will it be fair to the Sandiganbayan Justices concerned to subject them to the massive and unfair scolding of what Estrada's counsel calls " a by and large hostile and at times cruel media?" Criticism and ridicule will likely arise from members of the media unfamiliar with the technical rules of the legal profession.<br><br>I submit that live TV coverage will not assist the Sandiganbayan in its duty to be temperate, attentive and impartial during the proceedings.&nbsp; Quite the contrary, live TV coverage will divert the attention of the Sandiganbayan from the testimonies of witnesses and serious arguments of counsel, thus affecting the court's understanding of the case.<br><br>The same adverse effects are true insofar as the lawyers are concerned. The Integrated Bar of the Philippines states that live coverage will only pander to the desire for publicity of a few grandstanding lawyers.&nbsp; Ever conscious of the instant public reaction, the Sandiganbayan may hesitate to correct the highly unprofessional conduct of a popular attorney.<br><br>More importantly, the general public is unaware of procedural rules. If the Sandiganbayan's rulings are adverse to their expectations, this may start another massive action which may culminate to an "EDSA IV."&nbsp; Needless to state, the effects are disastrous to the nation.<br><br>In sum, the theory that televising the trial ensures that justice is served is not true.&nbsp; With intense coverage, the media becomes less of a defensive force against injustice and more of an offensive force by intimidating witnesses, distracting the lawyers and distorting the unfolding drama in the courtroom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It gives rise to prejudiced opinion and publicity and creates bias and sometimes confusion among the people.&nbsp; All these factors definitely render the accused's right to a fair and impartial trial illusory.&nbsp; Thus, until and unless the media can secure the rights of the accused and eliminate all the adverse effects, specifically on the general public, the television should remain outside the courtroom.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As Justice Harlan of the US Supreme Court decreed: "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerated classes among citizens.
