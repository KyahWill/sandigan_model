Pursuant thereto, the branch clerk of court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> issued an "Execution Foreclosing Mortgage" dated December 9, 1992, and scheduled the auction sale of the foreclosed properties on January 14, 1993.<br><br>On January 11, 1993, a Petition for Prohibition with a prayer for a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction was filed before the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Through this Petition, the alleged owners/buyers of the mortgaged properties sought to restrain the trial court from proceeding with the auction on the ground that the mortgage was void.&nbsp; The case was docketed as GR No. 108285 and assigned to this Court's Second Division which subsequently issued on January 13, 1993, a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) barring the auction sale scheduled on January 14, 1993.<br><br>On January 8, 1993, Oakland filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Relief from Judgment with Preliminary Injunction and Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order.&nbsp; It likewise filed a Very Urgent Ex Parte Motion to Defer the public auction sale scheduled on January 14, 1993.&nbsp; However, the CA denied the Petition through a Resolution dated January 25, 1993.<br><br>Dissatisfied with the CA Resolution, Oakland filed before this Court a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibitory Injunction, docketed as GR No. 109967.&nbsp; In its Resolution dated June 2, 1993, this Court's Second Division dismissed it for having been filed beyond the reglementary period.<br><br>With respect to GR No. 108285, this Court's Third Division, to which the case was reassigned, issued a Resolution, dated May 5, 1993, referring the case to the Court of Appeals for disposition.&nbsp; The former Special First Division of the CA subsequently dissolved the Supreme Court's TRO and dismissed the Petition in a Decision dated February 3, 1994.&nbsp; It affirmed the validity of the mortgage and declared Oakland liable to Genato.&nbsp; The separate Motions for Reconsideration filed by Oakland were denied by the CA through a Resolution dated July 21, 1994.&nbsp; For its nonpayment of the prescribed docket fees, its appeal to this Court was likewise denied. Also denied with finality on December 12, 1994 was the Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Due to the finality of the Resolution dated December 12, 1994, Genato filed before the RTC an Ex Parte Motion for Execution of Judgment. Oakland opposed the Motion, while the intervenors in the case (herein petitioners) filed an Urgent Manifestation with Motion to Intervene and an Opposition to Herein Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Execution.&nbsp; Both Oakland and herein petitioners based their opposition on a Decision dated March 20, 1995 issued by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) in HLRC Case No. REM A-940322-0060.&nbsp; This case, entitled "Cristilyn Castilla et al. v. Oakland Development Resources Corporation, Prater Espana &amp; William Ong Genato," declared the mortgage between Genato and Oakland void insofar as third parties were concerned.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the HLURB Decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>``WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered SETTING ASIDE the Judgment Upon Compromise dated 23 June 1993 and a new judgment is hereby set:<br><br>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaring the Mortgage between Oakland Resources Development Corporation and William Ong Genato as null and void at least insofar as third parties are concerned in the absence of the written approval of the Board for the same pursuant to Section 18 of P.D. 957; however, it remains valid as a contract of indebtedness between the parties;<br><br>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaring the buyers to have a superior right over the lots in question as against the mortgage, and enjoining the la[t]ter from foreclosing the properties or consolidating its title or performing x x x any act that would disturb complainants['] rights over the property in question;<br><br>"3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondents Oakland Development Resources Corporation and Prater Esplana are directed to:<br><br>a.&nbsp; Register with the Register of Deeds the Deeds of Absolute Sale executed by and between aforesaid respondents and the following complainants:<br><br><ol type="i"><li>Cristilyn Castilla<br></li><li>Andronico and Minverval<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> delos Reyes<br></li><li>Tomas Vergara and Merlinda Lozana<br></li><li>Wilfredo and Elizabeth Maneois<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></li><li>Catalin and Mercedes Pigao<br></li><li>Crisanto and Corazon Robles<br></li><li>Lourdes Yuranasiri &amp; Antonio Hufana<br></li><li>Vincent and Emiliana Shwalbe</li></ol><br>and Contracts to Sell executed by and between aforesaid respondents and complainants:<br><br><ol type="i"><li>Antonio and Fermina Bucad<br><br></li><li>Ma.

Thus, it enjoined respondent from foreclosing the properties and then resolved that the sale of the lot covered by TCT No. 366380 be confined only to those portions that had not been bought or occupied by herein petitioners/intervenors.&nbsp; Moreover, it precluded respondent from foreclosing the property covered by TCT No. 356315.<br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>In the assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals stated that it had already ruled upon the validity of the mortgage.&nbsp; Since validity was the primary issue raised in a previous case filed before it, the said ruling is already conclusive upon the same issue raised by the same parties before the HLURB.&nbsp; The CA Decision cannot be contravened by a subsequent ruling of the HLURB.&nbsp; It was therefore erroneous for the trial court to ignore the Decision of a higher court.<br><br>Hence, this recourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>In their Memorandum, petitioners raise the following issues for this Court's consideration:<br><br><blockquote>"Whether or not the remedy taken by herein respondent in appealing to the Court of Appeals the Resolution issued by the lower court on July 1, 1997, involving the issuance of an alias writ of execution pursuant to [Rule] 41 and/or 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, was proper, instead of a Petition for Review by way of Certiorari under [Rule] 45 or 65 of said Rules, directly before this Honorable Court.<br><br>"Whether or not, assuming the remedy taken by respondent is permitted, matters pertaining to a writ of execution that has been partially executed, may still be appealed.<br><br>"Whether or not respondent is already estopped from questioning the effects or consequences of such writ of execution that has already been partially executed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Basically, the issues raised by petitioners boil down to whether the appeal to the CA of the July 1, 1997 RTC Resolution is proper, considering that the Resolution purports to be merely an order of execution which is allegedly interlocutory in nature.<br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">This Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Basic Issue</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><i>Propriety of Appeal</i></span><br></div><br>The main issue raised by petitioners revolves on the propriety of respondent's appeal of the RTC Resolution dated July 1, 1997. Petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals erred in taking cognizance of the appeal, the subject of which was in fact a trial court order partially granting respondent's motion for execution.<br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the subject matter of the questioned RTC Resolution was a final order and, hence, appealable to the CA under Section 1 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>We agree with respondent.&nbsp; Normally, decisions and final orders of regional trial courts are appealable to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Section 1 of Rule 41, however, enumerates the following RTC orders that may not be appealed:<br><br><blockquote>"SECTION 1.&nbsp; <i>Subject of appeal. </i>- An appeal may be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by these Rules to be appealable.<br><br>"No appeal may be taken from:<br><br>(a) An order denying a motion for new&nbsp; trial or reconsideration;<br><br>(b) An order denying a petition for relief or any similar motion seeking relief from judgment;<br><br>(c) An interlocutory order;<br><br>(d) An order disallowing or dismissing an appeal;<br><br>(e) An order denying a motion to set aside a judgment by consent, confession or compromise on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress, or any other ground vitiating consent;<br><br>(f) An order of execution;<br><br>(g) A judgment or final order for or against one or more of several parties or in separate claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party complaints, while the main case is pending, unless the court allows an appeal therefrom; and<br><br>(h) An order dismissing an action without prejudice.<br><br>In all the above instances where the judgment or final order is not appealable, the aggrieved party may file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65. (n)"</blockquote><br><br>The last paragraph of the above rule provides a remedy for non-appealable orders -- certiorari under Rule 65.&nbsp; Grave abuse of discretion, upon which certiorari is based, refers to such "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Clearly, under Section 1(f) of Rule 41, an order of execution issued by a trial court is not appealable.<br><br>In this case, the RTC Resolution dated July 1, 1997 resolved, among others, to grant in part, as well as deny in part, the Motion for an Alias Writ of Execution filed by respondent.&nbsp; The net result of the trial court's Resolution was that Genato was precluded from foreclosing the mortgage on the property covered by TCT No. 356315. Note, however, that he was allowed to foreclose the lot covered by TCT No. 366380, which consisted of around 4,334 square meters, but not the portions already purchased by petitioners pursuant to the Agreement he had entered into with petitioners.<br><br>It must, at this point, be stressed that the Resolution to grant partial execution was based on the HLURB Decision involving the same parties and subject matter.&nbsp; In fact, the trial court itself stated that its Resolution was anchored on a supervening event, the said HLURB ruling.&nbsp; The RTC Resolution stated thus:<br><br><blockquote>"This court would like to impress upon the parties that [in] consonance to its Resolution issued on August 18, 1995 in relation to its Resolution issued on May 14, 1995, vis-à-vis the Decision rendered by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board in HLRB Case No. REM A-940322-0060, promulgated on March 20, 1995 [--] which has become final and executory on June 27, 1995 after William Ong Genato's motion for reconsideration was denied [--] the sheriff shall confine the sale to the parcel of land covered and embraced in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 366380 and shall see to it that no portion or lots bought and occupied by the intervenors shall be included nor shall be the subject of the auction sale."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>It is clear therefore, that the trial court did not merely grant execution. Rather, it also resolved matters that delved on the merits of the claims of both parties.&nbsp; It did not merely order something to be done pursuant to a previous final decision, but resolved issues determinative of the final outcome of the case.&nbsp; As such, the Resolution is in effect a final order that may be appealed to the CA under the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Precedence of the CA Decision </i></span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>over the HLURB Decision</i></span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>The CA did not err in invalidating the HLURB ruling in Case No. REM A-940322-0060 voiding the mortgage over the land covered by TCT No. 356315/PR-10397. Certainly, the ruling cannot take precedence over the February 3, 1994 CA Decision upholding the validity of the subject&nbsp; mortgage.<br><br><i>First,</i> the CA Decision has already become final and executory.&nbsp; A final decision rendered by a competent court can no longer be relitigated, as held by this Court in <i>De Villa v. Jacob,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><i> </i>a portion of which we quote:<br><br><blockquote>"It is well established that when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, so long as it remains unreversed, it should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them.&nbsp; The dictum therein laid down became the law of the case and what was once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision, continues to be binding between the same parties as long as the facts on which the decision was predicated, continue to be the facts of the case before the court.&nbsp; Hence, the binding effect and enforceability of that dictum can no longer be relitigated anew since said issue had already been resolved and finally laid to rest in that aforementioned case (Miranda v. CA, 141 SCRA 306 [1986]), if not by the principle of <i>res judicata</i>, but at least by conclusiveness of judgment (Vda. de Sta. Romana v. PCIB 118 SCRA 335 [1982])."</blockquote><br><i>Second</i>, a decision rendered by the Court of Appeals should take precedence over that of the HLURB, since the former is definitely a higher tribunal.&nbsp; There is such a thing as a hierarchy of courts in this country. HLURB decisions are in fact reviewable by the CA.<br><br><i>Third</i>, petitioners failed to raise the alleged impropriety of respondent's appeal before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Doctrinally settled is the rule that issues not raised below cannot be taken up on appeal.<br><br><blockquote>"It is well-settled that points of law, theories, and arguments not brought to the attention of the trial court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as they cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; Allowing petitioner to change horses in midstream, as it were, is to run roughshod over the basic principles of fair play, justice and due process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>On the other hand, the July 1, 1997 Resolution of the trial court has long become final and executory in regard to petitioners, who failed to appeal within the reglementary period.&nbsp; Hence, this Court can no longer grant them any relief.&nbsp; They are estopped from questioning the effects or consequences emanating from the partial execution of the questioned Writ. In this Court's words: "The rule is clear that no modification of judgment could be granted to a party who did not appeal.&nbsp; It is enshrined as one of the basic principles in our rules of procedure, specifically to avoid ambiguity in the presentation of issues, facilitate the setting forth of arguments by the parties, and aid the court in making its determinations.&nbsp; It is not installed in the rules merely to make litigations laborious and tedious for the parties.&nbsp; It is there for a reason."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision <b>AFFIRMED.</b>&nbsp; Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Gonzaga-Reyes,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 8-23.
