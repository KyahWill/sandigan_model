				<BR><BR><div align="justify">To sanction disrespect and disregard for the Constitution in the name of protecting the society from lawbreakers is to make the government itself lawless and to subvert those values upon which our ultimate freedom and liberty depend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>For automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 17, in Criminal Case No. 37,264-96, finding accused-appellants Nasario Molina y Manamat <i>alias</i> "Bobong" and Gregorio Mula y Malagura <i>alias</i> "Boboy," guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 8,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 (Republic Act No. 6425), as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and sentencing them to suffer the supreme penalty of death.<br><br>The information against accused-appellants reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about August 8, 1996, in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, in conspiracy with each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously was found in their possession 946.9 grams of dried marijuana which are prohibited.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>Upon arraignment on September 4, 1996, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty to the accusation against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Trial ensued, wherein the prosecution presented Police Superintendent Eriel Mallorca, SPO1 Leonardo Y. Pamplona, Jr., and SPO1 Marino S. Paguidopon, Jr. as witnesses.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>Sometime in June 1996, SPO1 Marino Paguidopon, then a member of the Philippine National Police detailed at Precinct No. 3, Matina, Davao City, received an information regarding the presence of an alleged marijuana pusher in Davao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The first time he came to see the said marijuana pusher in person was during the first week of July 1996. SPO1 Paguidopon was then with his informer when a motorcycle passed by. His informer pointed to the motorcycle driver, accused-appellant Mula, as the pusher. As to accused-appellant Molina, SPO1 Paguidopon had no occasion to see him before the arrest. Moreover, the names and addresses of the accused-appellants came to the knowledge of SPO1 Paguidopon only after they were arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At about 7:30 in the morning of August 8, 1996, SPO1 Paguidopon received an information that the alleged pusher will be passing at NHA, Ma-a, Davao City any time that morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Consequently, at around 8:00 A.M. of the same day, he called for assistance at the PNP, Precinct No. 3, Matina, Davao City, which immediately dispatched the team of SPO4 Dionisio Cloribel (team leader), SPO2 Paguidopon (brother of SPO1 Marino Paguidopon), and SPO1 Pamplona, to proceed to the house of SPO1 Marino Paguidopon where they would wait for the alleged pusher to pass by.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>At around 9:30 in the morning of August 8, 1996, while the team were positioned in the house of SPO1 Paguidopon, a "trisikad" carrying the accused-appellants passed by. At that instance, SPO1 Paguidopon pointed to the accused-appellants as the pushers. Thereupon, the team boarded their vehicle and overtook the "trisikad."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> SPO1 Paguidopon was left in his house, thirty meters from where the accused-appellants were accosted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The police officers then ordered the "trisikad" to stop. At that point, accused-appellant Mula who was holding a black bag handed the same to accused-appellant Molina. Subsequently, SPO1 Pamplona introduced himself as a police officer and asked accused-appellant Molina to open the bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Molina replied, "<i>Boss, if possible we will settle this</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> SPO1 Pamplona insisted on opening the bag, which revealed dried marijuana leaves inside. Thereafter, accused-appellants Mula and Molina were handcuffed by the police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On December 6, 1996, accused-appellants, through counsel, jointly filed a Demurrer to Evidence, contending that the marijuana allegedly seized from them is inadmissible as evidence for having been obtained in violation of their constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The demurrer was denied by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> A motion for reconsideration was filed by accused-appellants, but this was likewise denied. Accused-appellants waived presentation of evidence and opted to file a joint memorandum.<br><br>On April 25, 1997, the trial court rendered the assailed decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of the prosecution alone without any evidence from both accused who waived presentation of their own evidence through their counsels, more than sufficient to prove the guilt of both accused of the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt, pursuant to Sec. 20, sub. par. 5 of Republic Act 7659, accused NASARIO MOLINA and GREGORIO MULA, are sentenced to suffer a SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH through lethal injection under Republic Act 8176, to be effected and implemented as therein provided for by law, in relation to Sec. 24 of Rep. Act 7659.<br><br>The Branch Clerk of Court of this court, is ordered to immediately elevate the entire records of this case with the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court, Manila, for the automatic review of their case by the Supreme Court and its appropriate action as the case may be.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>Pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code and Rule 122, Section 10 of the Rules of Court, the case was elevated to this Court on automatic review. Accused-appellants contend:<br><br><center>I.</center><blockquote>THAT THE MARIJUANA IS INADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE FOR HAVING BEEN SEIZED IN VIOLATION OF APPELLANTS' CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AGAINST UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES;<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THAT ASSUMING IT IS ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT OTHERWISE PROVED THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT; AND<br><br><center>III.</center><br>THAT, FINALLY, ASSUMING THEIR GUILT HAS BEEN PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT, THE IMPOSABLE PENALTY FOR VIOLATION OF SEC. 8 OF RA No. 7659 <i>(sic)</i>, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE, IS LIFE IMPRISONMENT, NOT DEATH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>The Solicitor General filed a Manifestation and Motion (In Lieu of Brief), wherein he prayed for the acquittal of both accused-appellants.<br><br>The fundamental law of the land mandates that searches and seizures be carried out in a reasonable fashion, that is, by virtue or on the strength of a search warrant predicated upon the existence of a probable cause. The pertinent provision of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Complementary to the foregoing provision is the exclusionary rule enshrined under Article III, Section 3, paragraph 2, which bolsters and solidifies the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>Any evidence obtained in violation of this or the preceding section shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding.</blockquote>Without this rule, the right to privacy would be a form of words, valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties; so too, without this rule, the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court's high regard as a freedom implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The foregoing constitutional proscription, however, is not without exceptions. Search and seizure may be made without a warrant and the evidence obtained therefrom may be admissible in the following instances: (1) search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) search of a moving motor vehicle; (3) search in violation of customs laws; (4) seizure of evidence in plain view; (5) when the accused himself waives his right against unreasonable searches and seizures;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and (6) stop and frisk situations (Terry search).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The first exception (search incidental to a lawful arrest) includes a valid warrantless search and seizure pursuant to an equally valid warrantless arrest which must precede the search. In this instance, the law requires that there be first a lawful arrest before a search can be made --- the process cannot be reversed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As a rule, an arrest is considered legitimate if effected with a valid warrant of arrest. The Rules of Court, however, recognizes permissible warrantless arrests. Thus, a peace officer or a private person may, without warrant, arrest a person: (a) when, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense (arrest <i>in flagrante delicto</i>); (b) when an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it (arrest effected in hot pursuit); and (c) when the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or a place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another (arrest of escaped prisoners).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the court <i>a quo</i> anchored its judgment of conviction on a finding that the warrantless arrest of accused-appellants, and the subsequent search conducted by the peace officers, are valid because accused-appellants were caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> in possession of prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This brings us to the issue of whether or not the warrantless arrest, search and seizure in the present case fall within the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.<br><br>In <i>People v. Chua Ho San</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court held that in cases of <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrests, a peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person when, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense. The arresting officer, therefore, must have personal knowledge of such fact or, as recent case law adverts to, personal knowledge of facts or circumstances convincingly indicative or constitutive of probable cause. As discussed in <i>People v. Doria</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> probable cause means an actual belief or reasonable grounds of suspicion. The grounds of suspicion are reasonable when, in the absence of actual belief of the arresting officers, the suspicion that the person to be arrested is probably guilty of committing the offense, is based on actual facts, <i>i.e.,</i> supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to create the probable cause of guilt of the person to be arrested. A reasonable suspicion therefore must be founded on probable cause, coupled with good faith on the part of the peace officers making the arrest.<br><br>As applied to <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrests, it is settled that "reliable information" alone, absent any overt act indicative of a felonious enterprise in the presence and within the view of the arresting officers, are not sufficient to constitute probable cause that would justify an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest. Thus, in <i>People v. Aminnudin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it was held that "the accused-appellant was not, at the moment of his arrest, committing a crime nor was it shown that he was about to do so or that he had just done so. What he was doing was descending the gangplank of the M/V Wilcon 9 and there was no outward indication that called for his arrest. To all appearances, he was like any of the other passengers innocently disembarking from the vessel. It was only when the informer pointed to him as the carrier of the marijuana that he suddenly became suspect and so subject to apprehension."<br><br>Likewise, in <i>People v. Mengote</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court did not consider "eyes... darting from side to side ... [while] holding ... [one's] abdomen", in a crowded street at 11:30 in the morning, as overt acts and circumstances sufficient to arouse suspicion and indicative of probable cause. According to the Court, "[b]y no stretch of the imagination could it have been inferred from these acts that an offense had just been committed, or was actually being committed, or was at least being attempted in [the arresting officers'] presence." So also, in <i>People v. Encinada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court ruled that no probable cause is gleanable from the act of riding a <i>motorela</i> while holding two plastic baby chairs.<br><br>Then, too, in <i>Malacat v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the trial court concluded that petitioner was attempting to commit a crime as he was "`standing at the corner of Plaza Miranda and Quezon Boulevard' with his eyes `moving very fast' and `looking at every person that come (sic) nearer (sic) to them.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In declaring the warrantless arrest therein illegal, the Court said:<br><blockquote>Here, there could have been no valid in <i>flagrante delicto</i> ... arrest preceding the search in light of the lack of personal knowledge on the part of Yu, the arresting officer, or an overt physical act, on the part of petitioner, indicating that a crime had just been committed, was being committed or was going to be committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>It went on to state that -<br><blockquote>Second, there was nothing in petitioner's behavior or conduct which could have reasonably elicited even mere suspicion other than that his eyes were "moving very fast" - an observation which leaves us incredulous since Yu and his teammates were nowhere near petitioner and it was already 6:30 p.m., thus presumably dusk. Petitioner and his companions were merely standing at the corner and were not creating any commotion or trouble...<br><br>Third, there was at all no ground, probable or otherwise, to believe that petitioner was armed with a deadly weapon. None was visible to Yu, for as he admitted, the alleged grenade was "discovered" "inside the front waistline" of petitioner, and from all indications as to the distance between Yu and petitioner, any telltale bulge, assuming that petitioner was indeed hiding a grenade, could not have been visible to Yu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>Clearly, to constitute a valid <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, accused-appellants manifested no outward indication that would justify their arrest. In holding a bag on board a <i>trisikad</i>, accused-appellants could not be said to be committing, attempting to commit or have committed a crime. It matters not that accused-appellant Molina responded "Boss, if possible we will settle this" to the request of SPO1 Pamplona to open the bag. Such response which allegedly reinforced the "suspicion" of the arresting officers that accused-appellants were committing a crime, is an equivocal statement which standing alone will not constitute probable cause to effect an inflagrante delicto arrest. Note that were it not for SPO1 Marino Paguidopon (who did not participate in the arrest but merely pointed accused-appellants to the arresting officers), accused-appellants could not be the subject of any suspicion, reasonable or otherwise.<br><br>While SPO1 Paguidopon claimed that he and his informer conducted a surveillance of accused-appellant Mula, SPO1 Paguidopon, however, admitted that he only learned Mula's name and address after the arrest. What is more, it is doubtful if SPO1 Paguidopon indeed recognized accused-appellant Mula. It is worthy to note that, before the arrest, he was able to see Mula in person only once, pinpointed to him by his informer while they were on the side of the road. These circumstances could not have afforded SPO1 Paguidopon a closer look at accused-appellant Mula, considering that the latter was then driving a motorcycle when SPO1 Paguidopon caught a glimpse of him. With respect to accused-appellant Molina, SPO1 Paguidopon admitted that he had never seen him before the arrest.<br><br>This belies the claim of SPO1 Pamplona that he knew the name of accused-appellants even before the arrest, to wit -<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">"Q-</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you said that certain Mula handed a black bag to another person and how did you know that it was Mula who handed the black bag to another person?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A-</td><td><div align="justify">Because I have already information from Paguidopon, regarding Mula and Molina, when they pass by through the street near the residence of Paguidopon. He told that the one who is big one that is Gregorio Mula and the thin one is Nazario Molina"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The aforecited testimony of SPO1 Pamplona, therefore, is entirely baseless. SPO1 Pamplona could not have learned the name of accused-appellants from SPO1 Paguipodon because Paguipodon himself, who allegedly conducted the surveillance, was not even aware of accused-appellants' name and address prior to the arrest.<br><br>Evidently, SPO1 Paguidopon, who acted as informer of the arresting officers, more so the arresting officers themselves, could not have been certain of accused-appellants' identity, and were, from all indications, merely fishing for evidence at the time of the arrest.<br><br>Compared to <i>People v. Encinada</i>, the arresting officer in the said case knew appellant Encinada even before the arrest because of the latter's illegal gambling activities, thus, lending at least a semblance of validity on the arrest effected by the peace officers. Nevertheless, the Court declared in said case that the warrantless arrest and the consequent search were illegal, holding that "[t]he prosecution's evidence did not show any suspicious behavior when the appellant disembarked from the ship or while he rode the <i>motorela</i>. No act or fact demonstrating a felonious enterprise could be ascribed to appellant under such bare circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it could not be said that accused-appellants waived their right against unreasonable searches and seizure. Implied acquiescence to the search, if there was any, could not have been more than mere passive conformity given under intimidating or coercive circumstances and is thus considered no consent at all within the purview of the constitutional guarantee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Withal, the Court holds that the arrest of accused-appellants does not fall under the exceptions allowed by the rules. Hence, the search conducted on their person was likewise illegal. Consequently, the marijuana seized by the peace officers could not be admitted as evidence against accused-appellants, and the Court is thus, left with no choice but to find in favor of accused-appellants.<br><br>While the Court strongly supports the campaign of the government against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law-enforcement officers towards this drive, all efforts for the achievement of a drug-free society must not encroach on the fundamental rights and liberties of individuals as guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, which protection extends even to the basest of criminals.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 17, in Criminal Case No. 37, 264-96, is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE.</b> For lack of evidence to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellants Nasario Molina y Manamat <i>alias</i> "Bobong" and Gregorio Mula y Malagura <i>alias</i> "Boboy", are <b>ACQUITTED</b> and ordered <b>RELEASED</b> from confinement unless they are validly detained for other offenses.
