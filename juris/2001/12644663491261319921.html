				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The case is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 114, Pasay City, finding accused Manolito Felizar y Capuli<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the complainant Gina Teoxon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in the amount of P150,000.00 and to pay a fine of P20,000.00, and the costs.<br><br>On December 4, 1995, asst. city prosecutor of Pasay City Leopoldo C. Lluz filed with the Regional Trial Court, Pasay City, an information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> charging accused Manolito Felizar y Capuli with rape, reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 26<sup>th</sup> day of November 1995, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Manolito Felizar y Capuli, by means of force and intimidation employed upon the person of Gina Tiozon y Fernandez, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the said complainant Gina Tiozon y Fernandez against her will and consent.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<br></blockquote>On December 14, 1995, the trial court arraigned the accused. He pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial ensued.<br><br>Complainant Gina F. Teoxon hails from Panuto, Pandan, Catanduanes. She came to Manila on October 30, 1995, to enroll in college, but she was late for the second semester. She lived with her maternal aunt Divina Custodio in Bacoor, Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Divina has a canteen in the Paliparan Bus Terminal, in Tambo, Parañaque, and a dry goods stall in Baclaran. Gina, while waiting to enroll for the next semester, helped in the household chores, acted as cashier and saleslady in the canteen and in the stall of her aunt Divina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On November 3, 1995, Gina started working in the canteen. She noticed accused Manolito Felizar (or Chito), a jeepney driver who used to eat in the canteen of her aunt Divina everyday. Initially, she said that she did not know him, but she later retracted and stated that she knew accused Felizar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On November 26, 1995, at around 6:45 in the evening, Gina was waiting for a ride going to her aunt Divina's store in Baclaran. Accused Felizar passed by in front of her and told her that he was also on his way to Baclaran. Gina, therefore, boarded his jeepney. She sat in the front seat. There were no other passengers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Accused Felizar did not stop the jeepney in front of Divina's store at Baclaran. Gina became frightened. She could not shout for help because accused Felizar was driving fast and there were not many people around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Accused Felizar brought Gina to the Blue Marlin Hotel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> a motel in Pasay City. Accused Felizar asked her to alight from the jeepney, and when she refused to do so, he poked a knife ("balisong") at her side and threatened her. A room boy led them to a room upstairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>When the room boy left, accused Felizar turned off the lights and started to caress Gina. Gina tried to ward him off by slapping him, but he overpowered her and she got frightened because he was still holding the "balisong." Accused Felizar succeeded in having coitus with her three times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In his defense, accused Felizar claimed that the intercourse was consensual and voluntary. Gina became his sweetheart about two weeks prior to the incident on November 26, 1995. He never intended to sleep with her, but Gina, after they heard the evening mass, asked him to prove his love for her. He asked her if she was willing to go with him. She answered that she would go with him anywhere. Taking that as a cue, he brought her to a motel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Accused Felizar likewise denied having threatened Gina with a "balisong" from the moment she alighted from the jeepney until the consummation of the sexual act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> To support his claim, he presented the Administrative Assistant of Blue Marlin Hotel, Mr. Jose Lim. Mr. Lim testified that it is part of the Standard Operating Procedure of the hotel not to let hesitant guests in, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">What is your SOP?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Our SOP is, we will establish if the guests or customers who enter our premises, if there is a sign of resistance from the guests, automatically, the guests will not be allowed to enter the room.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Aside from that [what] else?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">If there is also a harassment or take advantage to the other customers, the same SOP will follow, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Under this circumstances you do not permit any guest/s to enter your motel?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><p align="center">xxx xxx xxx<br><br></p></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When a guest arrived and check-in your motel, what do you usually do, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">We assist them to go to the room, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who assist the guest?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Our room boys, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Is it possible for the guest to enter the room without the assistance of a room boy?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">No sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>To bolster his claim that there was no rape, accused offered the testimony of Ms. Irene Pador, a vendor at the Paliparan Terminal, who happened to see him and Gina in the wee hours of November 27, 1995, just a few hours after the alleged rape. Ms. Pador testified, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td

the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused MANOLITO FELIZAR y CAPULI GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as principal for the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify private complainant Gina Teoxon the amount of P150,000.00 pesos and to pay a fine of P20,000.00 and the costs.<br><br>"SO ORDERED.<br><br>"GIVEN, this 29<sup>th</sup> day of January, 1997, Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">"(Sgd.) VICENTE L. YAP<br>"Judge"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant claimed that the trial court erred in giving full credence to the testimony of the complainant and in not holding that the sexual accord between him and complainant was voluntary and consensual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>We find the appeal meritorious.<br><br>There is sufficient evidence which belie complainant's claim that she was raped. The allegation that accused-appellant used force to satisfy his lust is unsubstantiated.<br><br>Firstly, complainant voluntarily rode in accused-appellant's jeepney. The jeepney had no passengers and it did not carry any signboard at that time to indicate that it was plying its regular route,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> yet she boarded it and even chose to sit in front.<br><br>Secondly, it was improbable that accused-appellant poked a knife at her side from the moment she alighted from the jeepney when they were at the motel. They were assisted by a room boy until they reached the room, and it would have been readily noticed if accused-appellant was employing force on complainant. If so, they would not have been allowed to enter the motel in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Thirdly, it is also incredible that accused-appellant used the balisong even during the sexual intercourse. The Medico Legal Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> showed that complainant had no extra-genital injuries. There was only a love bite (contusion on the antero-lateral aspect) on her neck which, according to the testimony of the expert witness Dr. Aurea Villena, could not have been caused by a blunt object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The claim of accused-appellant that the sexual congress was between two consenting adults acquires credence.<br><br>The trial court relied so much on the fact that complainant came from a remote area in the province of Catanduanes, and was thus naïve on the ways of the world. However, "in this age of permissiveness, the virtuous Maria Claras who need only to shout rape to get a conviction are now rare breeds"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and courts must regard with utmost caution and not just accept with precipitate credulity the testimony of complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In rape cases, conviction hinges solely on the testimony of the complainant, and evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Proof beyond reasonable doubt acquires more relevance since rape charges are easy to concoct and difficult to defend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> When there are material improbabilities in complainant's testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> an accused's constitutional presumption of innocence is not overcome.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the decision of the trial court is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
