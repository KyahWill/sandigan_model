				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the Decision, dated April 26, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay, City, Branch 118, in Criminal Case Nos. 92-2107<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and 92-2108<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> finding accused-appellant Manzanza Nzenza and accused Austin Williams guilty beyond reasonable doubt of unlawfully transporting prohibited drugs in violation of Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> as amended.<br><br>Only accused Manzanza Nzenza appealed from the aforesaid decision.<br><br>On December 23, 1992, two separate informations were filed against accused-appellant Manzanza Nzenza in Criminal Case No. 92-2107 and accused Austin Williams in Criminal Case No. 92-2108.<br><br>The information against Nzenza reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 19th day of December 1992 at about 1:30 in the afternoon at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused MANZANZA NZENZA did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously transport without authority 11.15 kilograms, more or less of Heroine (sic), a prohibited drug, without the corresponding license or prescription.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>The information against accused Williams similarly charged him, thus:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 19th day of December 1992 at about 1:30 in the afternoon at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Pasay City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused WILLIAM AUSTIN, (sic) did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously transport, without lawful authority 22.547 kilograms, more or less of heroin a prohibited drug, without the corresponding license or prescription.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote><br>Upon motion by the prosecution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the two cases were consolidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> During the arraignment, both Nzenza<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and Williams<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> pleaded not guilty to the charges against them and thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>Seven witnesses were presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; SPO4 Roberto Medrano and Customs Examiner Gil Calixihan testified against Williams, while Customs Police Captain Juanito Algenio and Ninoy Aquino International airport (NAIA) Police Officer Gregorio Mendiola testified against accused- appellant Nzenza.<br><br>Three other witnesses, namely, Customs Examiner Leopoldo Quisto, NAIA Police Captain Rodolfo Samala, Jr. and Philippine National Police (PNP) Forensic Chemist Noemi Austero also testified against both Williams and Nzenza.<br><br>The prosecution presented the following version of the facts:<br><br>On December 19, 1992, at about 1:30 in the afternoon, SPO4 Roberto Medrano, supervisor of the First Aviation District of the NAIA, was at the lobby of the NAIA Departure Area looking at the baggage x-ray machine monitor. At around that time,&nbsp; he noticed some rectangular objects inside two suitcases which were passing through.&nbsp; He inquired from a tall, dark man entering the walk-through if the latter owned the two pieces of luggage.&nbsp; The man, who identified himself as Austin Williams, nodded and acknowledged ownership of the said two suitcases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Medrano then requested Williams to allow his two suitcases to be examined by Customs Examiner Gil Calixihan, who also caught sight of the rectangular objects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Williams obliged and proceeded to open the first suitcase which had combination locks.&nbsp; After removing William's clothes therefrom, Medrano and Calixihan noticed that the suitcase had a shallow base and a false bottom.&nbsp; Suspicious of its contents, Medrano requested for a re-examination of the suitcase.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [12]</sup><br><br>Calixihan likewise testified that while he was on duty at the NAIA departure area on December 19, 1992, at about 1:30 p.m., he also saw Williams pick up the two suitcases which just rolled out from the luggage x-ray area and place them on top of a pushcart.&nbsp; Upon reaching the Customs area, Calixihan requested Williams to open said pieces of luggage, which the latter acknowledged as his, for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>Leopoldo Quisto, another Customs Examiner, testified that when he was inspecting the suitcases passing through the x-ray machine, he saw some blurred rectangular objects inside the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited for somebody to lift the suitcases.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, he saw a black man, who was later identified as the accused Williams, lifting the same.&nbsp; Quisto asked the latter if he owned the suitcases and Williams answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; When Williams was ordered to open the suitcases, he voluntarily opened the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Quisto assisted Calixihan in examining the suitcases and saw Williams' photo albums and other personal belongings.&nbsp; Since the suitcases remained heavy after the contents were removed, they became suspicious and they reported the matter to Mrs. Tablante, their supervisor, who ordered them to break open the suitcases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> At the departure lobby, the suitcases were again opened before Calixihan, Medrano, NAIA police agents Gregorio Mendiola, Leoncio De la Cruz, Rodolfo Samala, Jr. and Customs Narcotics Interjection Unit (CNIU) agents surnamed Biteng and Bese.&nbsp; The suitcases were again carried back to the examining table when Medrano asked Williams to slash the side of one of the suitcases showing a false bottom. Williams consented, but it was Calixihan and Quisto who slashed the sides thereof with a fan knife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Calixihan continued to remove the plywood covering the false bottom and found rectangular objects wrapped in white plastic pack covered with Chinese characters.&nbsp; Each of the rectangular objects contained a white powdery substance, which turned out to be heroin when field-tested by CNIU agents Biteng and Bese.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Medrano and Calixihan affixed their respective signatures on both sides of the slashed luggage and Williams did the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In accordance with their supervisor's instructions, the rectangular objects found inside the luggage were brought to the office of the Collector of Customs.&nbsp; Williams also informed the persons examining his luggage that he had a companion, a black man, who was also transporting prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br>Williams' second suitcase was also subjected to examination.&nbsp; Both sides showing false bottoms were slashed, revealing rectangular objects identical to those found in the first luggage. The objects also contained a white powdery substance, which turned out to be heroin.<br><br>A total of sixty-three (63) rectangular objects were confiscated from Williams.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <br><br>Williams denied the charges against him and presented a different story to the trial court.&nbsp; He claimed that on December 13, 1992, he arrived in the country to do research on Philippine traditions and culture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup> <br><br>He denied having any companion in coming to the Philippines. He likewise denied that he knew his co-accused Nzenza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He stated further that on December 19, 1992, he went to the NAIA since he was leaving for Bangkok.&nbsp; He had four (4) pieces of luggage with him: one suit carrier, two slim bags and one duty-free plastic bag. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In compliance with standard operating procedure, he placed his bags on the baggage conveyor which moved the bags through the x-ray machine monitor.&nbsp; Thereafter, he collected the bags and placed these at the Customs desk for marking. He arranged them in a pushcart and was heading towards the check-in counter of his airline when his attention was caught by a gentleman who was pointing at the x-ray machine and telling him that he forgot one of his bags. Williams replied that the bag was not his, since all his bags were inside the pushcart.&nbsp; When the gentleman insisted that the bag was Williams', the latter said "Don't kid me, that is not my bag."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> He then noticed one black bag being brought to the customs desk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [25]</sup> He told the NAIA personnel that the identification tag and initials seen in the handle of the black bag differed from what was written on his identification card.&nbsp; He was then ordered to place this black bag at the counter's desk and to open the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Williams was taken to the Lost and Found Section where he was asked to admit ownership of a brown bag.&nbsp; Pictures of him beside the brown bag were then taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He identified himself before the NAIA personnel when he was requested to do so.&nbsp; The group then asked him to do them a favor by signing a statement with the name "Antonio Navarro" written on it.&nbsp; Williams claimed that when he refused to sign the same, Captain Algenio of the Customs Police ordered his men to beat him.&nbsp; They tied his legs, handcuffed him and hit him with a 3"x4" piece of wood. After this ordeal, Williams was ordered at gunpoint to affix his signature on the black and brown bags. His pleas for legal assistance were not heeded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Williams was subsequently taken outside the airport to an office where he met a man who asked him if he knew the penalty for the offense of carrying prohibited drugs. Another group of men then took him to the office of Captain Samala.&nbsp; The latter frisked Williams and then took the 150 dollars and 75 pesos which were found in his pocket.<br><br>The 150 dollars were not returned to Williams but the 75 pesos were given back to him to spend for his food. Thereafter, he was transferred to the Narcotics Command (Narcom) and then to a hospital for check-up of the injuries which he suffered as a result of the beatings but he was not attended to therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Williams also testified that under duress and without the assistance of counsel, he signed a receipt of property seized from him indicating that 63 packs of more or less 22.547 kilograms of heroin were found in one of his bags.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <br><br>The 63 packs which were found in the black and brown bags allegedly owned by Williams were examined by PNP Crime Laboratory Forensic Chemist Noemi Austero who testified that after taking representative samples from each of these packs and subjecting the same to a qualitative examination, all 63 packs tested positive for heroin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31] </sup> The heroin discovered in Williams' suitcases weighed 22.547 kilograms.<br><br>As regards accused-appellant Manzanza Nzenza, Captain Algenio testified that after the arrest of accused Williams at the Departure Area, a follow-up team<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was formed by NAIA District Commander, Major De la Cuesta, for the capture of another black man who, according to Williams, was also transporting prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Upon orders of Major De la Cuesta, the team proceeded to the satellite area located within the NAIA departure area where they found a black man, who was later identified as the accused- appellant Manzanza Nzenza carrying a bag similar to that carried by Williams.&nbsp; Strongly suspecting that this was the other black man to whom Williams was referring, they asked him whether he had any checked-in luggage.&nbsp; He replied that he had none.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Unconvinced by Nzenza's reply, the team sought the assistance of a Philippine Airlines employee who furnished them a passenger manifest which indicated that Manzanza Nzenza is passenger number 37 of Swiss Air Flight Number SR 177, and beside his name was the sequence number 85 YO3048569A and the information that he had checked-in three bags.&nbsp; Sequence number 85 was also handwritten on the face of his baggage identification tags numbered SR 450229 and SR 450246 hence, they were able to identify the baggage containing the white powdery substance with baggage identification tag number SR 91 2058 because sequence number 85 was also handwritten on it. Sequence number 85 also appeared in his ticket.&nbsp; Forthwith, the team asked Station Manager Orosa to defer the outbound flight, and the latter agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35] </sup><br><br>The team then brought Nzenza and the three bags to the x-ray area for examination by PNP officers. The x-ray machine did not show any hidden objects.&nbsp; Thereafter, Nzenza and the bags were brought to the departure area for a second x-ray examination because the machine in said area was more sensitive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> After this second x-ray examination yielded a negative result, Nzenza and the bags were brought to the Inbound area for physical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In Nzenza's presence, and with the permission of Customs Collector Marquez, the team opened the third suitcase with baggage identification number SR 91 2058.&nbsp; After taking out the personal effects, photo albums and children's dresses contained therein, they noticed that the suitcase was still heavy.&nbsp; The examiner then slashed the velvet lining at the lower portion of the suitcase, resulting in their discovery of white powdery substance well-spread in a wax paper-like container. The powdered substance was then field-tested and was declared positive for heroin.&nbsp; Nzenza was brought to the investigation division while the white powdery substance was deposited with the Cash Division Vault of the Bureau of Customs for safekeeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Captain Rodolfo Samala, Jr., a police agent assigned at the NAIA, testified that after the discovery of heroin in the bags belonging to Williams and Nzenza, the two men were turned over to his office by the Bureau of Customs on December 19, 1992 for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Samala prepared the Booking Sheet and Arrest Report for both Williams and Nzenza together with the receipts of property seized from them. He likewise requested the PNP Crime Laboratory to examine the subject specimen.&nbsp; It was he who delivered the substances to the PNP Crime Laboratory on December 23, 1992 for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The white powdery substance found in the bag with baggage identification tag number SR 91 2058 which allegedly belonged to Nzenza was also examined by Ms. Austero.&nbsp; The substance was placed in two bags when delivered to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.&nbsp; Austero testified that she took representative samples from the two bags and subjected the same to qualitative examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Both samples tested positive for heroin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The heroin confiscated from the said bag weighed 11.15 kilograms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Nzenza denied the charges against him.&nbsp; He testified that he was working for Kobeleske G. Nzenza Enterprises<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and that he was in the country on December 17, 1992 because it was difficult to get a confirmation of his ticket.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> On December 19, 1992 while he was at the NAIA departure area waiting for his plane bound for Zurich, Switzerland, a policeman approached him and asked for his passport.&nbsp; After Nzenza gave his passport to said policeman, the latter walked off.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the policeman apologized and returned Nzenza's passport.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Nzenza was then invited by the customs personnel to an office containing numerous pieces of luggage and was asked whether he was travelling alone, to which he replied in the affirmative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> They later took him to Camp Crame where attempts were made to lock him up inside a cell and where some policemen took his ticket, passport and other documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [48]</sup> When he was shown a photocopy of Swiss Air Ticket No. 2421431-046-6, he identified it to be the same ticket he was holding onto on December 19, 1992.&nbsp; This plane ticket contained his baggage identification numbers SR 450229 and SR 450246 for his two pieces of luggage which he checked-in, as well the sequence number 85.&nbsp; He also testified that he had a hand- carried bag<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> containing his trousers, t-shirts and photo albums, which items were allegedly taken by the police and transferred to the suitcase containing heroin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>When Nzenza was confronted with the receipt of property indicating that 11.15 kilograms of heroin were found in his luggage, he said he signed the same because he was told by the police that it was the receipt for his luggage which he wanted returned to him.&nbsp; He claimed that the receipt was in "blank form" and he was not allowed to read it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51] </sup><br><br>When asked if he carried heroin in his bag, he replied in the negative, that he did not own the bag containing said substance and that he was only charged for said offense because he was an African, and the airport police was tipped off that the carrier of the prohibited drug was a black man.&nbsp; In fact, the baggage identification numbers of his luggage were written by a customs personnel in his ticket, and SR 91 2058, referring to the identification number of the baggage containing the heroin, was not indicated in his plane ticket.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>He further testified that the two bags which he checked-in and his hand-carried bag had been examined and cleared by Customs authorities, so he proceeded to the Immigration Stamp-Out then proceeded to the&nbsp; Boarding Area.&nbsp; Nzenza contradicted the testimonies of Captain Samala and Captain Algenio that he denied having checked-in any luggage.&nbsp; He averred that when he was asked if he had any check-in luggage, he said "yes," thus he was taken to the tarmac to identify his luggage. He identified it in the presence of the police.<br><br>Nzenza was consistent in his testimony that he checked-in only two pieces of luggage as shown in his ticket and passport.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> He denied that his photo albums were taken from the luggage containing the heroin, and insisted that the two bags which he checked-in or his hand-carried bag did not contain heroin or any other prohibited drug. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> He denied being present when his two suitcases were opened,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and remained firm in his assertion that he signed the receipt involuntarily<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56] </sup> and without the assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57] </sup><br><br>On April 26, 1996, the trial court rendered its judgment convicting both Williams and Nzenza.&nbsp; The dispositive portion thereof states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, and based on the foregoing considerations, the court finds accused Austin Williams and Manzanza Nzenza both GUILTY of the crime charged in the Information respectively filed against them and barely sentences them:<br><br>for AUSTIN WILLIAMS in Criminal Case No. 92-2108, to suffer the PENALTY of IMPRISONMENT OF RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the amount of P30,000.00 as fine;<br><br>for MANZANZA NZENZA in Criminal Case No. 92-2107 to suffer the PENALTY OF IMPRISONMENT OF RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the amount of P30,000.00 as fine;<br><br>The penalty of Reclusion Perpetua is being imposed pursuant to Republic Act 7659 while the fine of P30,000.00 for each accused is imposed pursuant to Republic Act 6425.<br><br>The subjects of indictment consisting of 22.547 kilograms of heroin with respect to Austin Williams and 11.15 kilograms of heroin with respect to Manzanza Nzenza are hereby ordered disposed of in accordance with law.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>Nzenza appeals his conviction to this Court, raising the following errors:<br><br><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>IN NOT CONSIDERING THE TESTIMONY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT THAT HIS PIECES OF LUGGAGE ARE ONLY THOSE HANDWRITTEN IN HIS SWISSAIR PLANE TICKET WITH TAG NOS. SR 450229 AND SR 450246;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>IN ADMITTING AN ALLEGED COMPUTER PRINT-OUT OF PASSENGER MANIFEST (EXHIBIT "1") WITHOUT HAVING TESTIFIED TO BY THE ALLEGED PHILIPPINE AIRLINE (PAL) EMPLOYEE WHO ENCODED AND PRINTED THE SAME.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>The issue thus presented for this Court's resolution is whether the evidence presented before the trial court was sufficient to warrant accused-appellant's conviction.<br><br>The trial court correctly pointed out that there is no improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to testify against Nzenza,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and that their testimonies should be given full faith and credence since they are presumed to be in the regular performance of their official duties as police and customs officers of the NAIA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> However, to support a finding that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, the testimonies should not only be credible and positive, but also sufficient to establish guilt.&nbsp; We are mindful that in our criminal justice system, the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [62]</sup> Thus, to overcome the presumption of innocence of the accused, proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact essential to constitute the offense charged must be clearly established by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In the absence of direct proof that Nzenza transported heroin on December 19, 1992, the prosecution attempted to establish his guilt on the basis of circumstantial evidence.<br><br>The prosecution relied upon the following: <i>First, </i>accused Williams tipped off the Customs and police authorities at the NAIA that he had a companion, another black man carrying prohibited drugs in his bag.&nbsp; Acting on this information, the team organized to capture this second black man searched and apprehended Nzenza.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, when the team saw Nzenza at the departure area and after they asked him whether he was travelling with a companion, they saw that he had a hand-carried bag similar to that of Williams, prompting them to ask if he had checked-in any luggage.&nbsp; <i>Third, </i>to verify whether Nzenza had any checked-in luggage, the team requested a PAL employee to furnish them with a passenger manifest. The manifest provided by the PAL employee indicated that Nzenza was passenger number 37 of Swiss Air Flight Number SR 177.

In contrast, the other two baggage identification numbers had six consecutive numbers and were not very far in sequence from each other.&nbsp; If it were true that the bag containing the heroin was his, the same would have a baggage identification number similar to the numbers of his two pieces of luggage which were checked-in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>It must also be considered that Nzenza had consistently denied ownership of the bag tag numbered SR 91 2058 which was found to contain 11.15 kilograms of heroin.&nbsp; He maintained that he only had three pieces of luggage: the bag which he hand-carried, and the two pieces of luggage which were tag numbered SR 450229 and SR 450246:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY.
