After a few more months, Tercenio could not anymore locate accused Chua.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accused Chua used the same <i>modus operandi</i> on the other private complainants. After requiring each complainant to pay a placement fee of P15,000.00 each, to secure NBI clearances and to undergo medical examinations, she would go in hiding.<br><br>In time, complainants inquired from the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) about accused Chua's activities.
