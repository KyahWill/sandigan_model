SCC-2854</u></b></center><blockquote>"That sometime in the month of April, 1998, at Zone VII, municipality of Bayambang, province of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a knife, by means of force or intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with <b>STACY CZYRL P.

PAGDANGANAN, a minor of 13 years old, against her will and consent and to her damage and prejudice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned in open court, Rolando Santos pled "not guilty" to the indictments.<br><br>The prosecution formally presented its evidence on the indictments at the trial held by the court a quo.<br><br>Private complainant Stacy Czyrl Pagdanganan, a thirteen-year old lass, decided to spend her summer months in Bayombong, Pangasinan, at the house of her uncle Dante Pagdanganan. Looking forward to her vacation, she finally left for Bayombong on 01 April 1998.<br><br>A month later, on 04 May 1998, about 8:30 in the evening, Stacy was inside the bathroom of her uncle's house when the accused suddenly barged into the bathroom, poked a knife at her and then started kissing her. Moments later, the accused removed Stacy's underwear and ordered her to sit on the toilet bowl. He fingered her private part, then undressed himself and inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt pain. Just at about this time, she heard her uncle Dante calling for her. She was about to respond when the accused promptly covered her mouth, held her hands, and instructed her to wait until after he would have been able to leave the toilet using the rear door. Stacy dressed up and went out of the front door of the comfort room. Her uncle Dante asked why she was with the accused. Stacy, crying, said that she was sexually abused by him.<br><br>Dante accompanied Stacy to the Barangay Captain and later to the police station where their statements were taken.<br><br>During the investigation, Stacy stated that even prior to the 04th May incident she had likewise been ravished by the accused once during the second week of April 1998 under similar circumstances. Stacy said that she did not reveal the matter to anyone because she was threatened with death, if she did, by the accused. Stacy was brought to the Bayombong District Hospital for medical and physical examination but the laboratory room being already closed by then, she was examined only the following morning.<br><br>The accused, in his defense, denying the accusation leveled at him, claimed that in the evening of 04 May 1998, he was, in fact, watching television inside his house together with the family. He admitted that he went out of the house for a little while in order to rub and caress his three fighting cocks following which he forthwith returned passing by the comfort room where the victim said she was abused. He heard Dante then calling for his niece Stacy. The accused asserted that the charges against him were merely concocted by Dante who had an old grudge against him.<br><br>On 21 October 1998, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 57, of San Carlos City, Pangasinan, rendered its decision finding the accused guilty of rape, on two counts, committed in the months of April and May 1998. The trial court held:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>"1. In Criminal Case No. SCC-2854, the Court finds the accused ROLANDO SANTOS @ 'Galman' guilty beyond reasonable doubt with the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659. Forthwith, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is ordered to indemnify the offended party in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00). The accused is further ordered to pay the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages and Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages.<br><br>"2. In Criminal Case No. SCC-2855, the Court likewise finds the accused ROLANDO SANTOS @ 'Galman' guilty beyond reasonable doubt with the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659, and is hereby ordered to serve the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the offended party the sum of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00). The accused is further ordered to pay the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages and Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>In his appeal to this Court, accused-appellant asseverated, in his assignment of errors, that -<br><blockquote>"1. The trial court erred in not finding that the testimony of private complainant was punctured with material improbabilities, inconsistency and unimaginable situation thereby casting grave doubt on the criminal culpability of the accused-appellant.<br><br>"2. The trial court erred in not acquitting accused-appellant of the crime charged notwithstanding the presence of exculpatory physical evidence supporting the same.<br><br>"3. The trial court erred in convicting accused-appellant of the crime charged by relying on the weakness of defense evidence rather than on the strength of its evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>This Court finds no reversible error in the judgment of the trial court appealed from.<br><br>Contrary to the claim of accused-appellant, the testimony of Stacy, a girl still in her early teens, has not been punctured with material improbability or inconsistency. The plain and straightforward account given by the private complainant of her harrowing experience can only be but truly reflective of an honest and unrehearsed testimony.

desire for revenge is simply too flimsy to be believed or yet belabored.<br><br>The defense argues that complainant's claim of penile penetration implies that there should have been fresh laceration of her organ coupled with the presence of spermatozoa thereon, a matter which is negated by the medical and physical examination conducted by Dr. Macrina Iglesias of the Bayambang District Hospital. It is well-settled in our jurisprudence that neither the absence of spermatozoa in the vagina nor the lack of complete penetration or rupture of the hymen would necessarily deny the commission of rape. Instead, what might be considered essential is the penetration of the female organ no matter how slight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> A negative sperm-detection test is immaterial to the crime of rape.<br><br>The medical finding that there was healed laceration on the vagina of the victim would serve to support the victim's testimony that she was twice raped by accused-appellant, the first being in the second week of April 1998, that would account for the presence of the healed laceration.<br><br>The delay in reporting the first sexual abuse would not tell negatively on her credibility. The initial reluctance of a rape victim to make public the attack on her virtue is neither unknown nor uncommon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Nor would the failure of complainant to immediately mention the rape even to the immediate members of her family detract from her credibility.
