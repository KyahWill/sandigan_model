They had just come from the house of Aurelio Barcena to inquire whether the latter knew of Christopher’s whereabouts; they were told that Aurelio was outside the house searching for spiders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The two were heading home when Marcelina saw Aurelio being chased by Reynaldo Molina, Tony Molina, Arnulfo Medrano, Ramil Castillo, Arnold Rebamonte and Arnold Pablo. Reynaldo and Tony held Aurelio’s long hair, causing Aurelio to slow down. Seizing the opportunity, Arnulfo and Ramil then held both hands of Aurelio and twisting his arms backward. Arnold also held Aurelio’s feet to stop him from kicking. Accused Raul Pablo and his companions finally pressed Aurelio’s head towards the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, accused Raul Pablo poked a gun at the mouth of Aurelio and pulled the trigger, which caused Aurelio to fall, face down. From a distance of about eight (8) meters, Marcelina saw the malefactors committing the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witness Menardo Barcena testified that in the evening of August 6, 1990, at around 10:30, he was in his house conversing with Alvin Barcena, Jose Puerto and other members of his family, when he heard three (3) gunshot sounds. He immediately rushed outside the house to get a glimpse of what was happening. While in front of the gate, Menardo saw accused Arnold Rebomante, Ramil Castillo, Tony Molina, Arnulfo Medrano, and Reynaldo Molina running away. He also saw accused Raul Pablo holding a .45 caliber gun standing in front of a person sprawled on the ground, bathed with his own blood. When Raul walked away, Menardo went near the person whom he immediately recognized as his brother Aurelio. He asked his brother who was responsible for the shooting. Aurelio mentioned the names of the accused Raul Pablo and his companions as his assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After due trial, on January 14, 1994, in a joint decision, the trial court convicted accused Raul Pablo y Lazaro and Ramil Castillo. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the court finds:<br><br>“In Criminal Case No. U-5818, the accused RAUL PABLO y Lazaro GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunitions and hereby sentences him to suffer imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay costs.<br><br>“In Criminal Case No. U-6262, the accused RAUL PABLO y Lazaro and RAMIL CASTILLO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and hereby sentences them to suffer imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA each and to pay jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Aurelio Barcena, the following amount:<br><br>“1.

P20,000.00 as moral damages and to pay costs.<br><br>“With respect to accused REYNALDO A. MOLINA, being a youthful offender in accordance with Section 1, Presidential Decree No. 1179, he was sixteen (16) years old, six (6) months and twenty (20 days at the time of the commission of the offense and nineteen (19) years, eleven (11) months and ten (10) days old today January 14, 1994 having been born on February 4, 1974 (Exhibit 14, Case No. U-6262) this Court finds the said youthful offender Reynaldo A. Molina has committed in conspiracy with the accused Raul Pablo and Ramil Castillo, the crime of murder which has the same imposable penalty including civil liability imposed on the accused Pablo and Castillo, however, instead of pronouncing judgment of conviction, this Court gives the youthful offender Reynaldo A. Molina a period of five (5) days from today within which to apply for the suspension of his sentence in accordance with Section 2 of P.D. 1179, otherwise, this Court shall pronounce judgment upon said youthful offender Reynaldo Molina.<br><br>“On the other hand, the accused Raul Pablo and Ramil Castillo are hereby ordered committed to the Provincial jail of Lingayen, Pangasinan, for their immediate transfer or delivery to the Bureau of Prisons, Muntinlupa, Rizal, pursuant to law, as said accused are no longer entitled to bail as enunciated in the recent case of People vs. Divina, G.R. No. 93805-09, April 7, 1993, and other related cases.<br><br>“In connection with the remaining accused Tony Molina and Arnold Rebamonte who are still at-large, let alias warrants of arrest be issued for their apprehension to be served by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Criminal Investigation Service (CIS) and to the Philippine National Police (PNP).

However, they raised similar issues and impute the same errors to the trial court.<br><br>Accused-appellant Raul Pablo doubted the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Menardo and Marcelina Barcena. According to accused-appellant Raul Pablo, Menardo Barcena, had a conversation with the victim after he saw the victim sprawled on the ground in the evening of August 6, 1990, and that the latter revealed the names of his assailants. Accused assails this testimony as improbable if not impossible considering the nature of the wounds Aurelio suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Accused-appellant presented the expert testimony of Dr. Bernardo Macaraeg, the doctor who attended to the victim when he was brought to the hospital. He testified that with the nature of the wound inflicted on the deceased, which was on the head, he would immediately or in just a few seconds after being shot be unable to talk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also presented an expert witness in the person of Dr. Ferdinand Florendo, who testified that “the injury sustained by the victim will immediately cause loss of consciousness and comatose. And comatose patients cannot move or utter any word or sound, much less enumerate names of persons who allegedly shot him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Ergo, according to accused-appellant Raul Pablo, it is obvious that witness Menardo Barcena was making up stories and lying during his testimony in open court.<br><br>As to the testimony of witness Marcelina Barcena Rebugio, the same can only be fabricated. In her testimony she could not make up her mind whether the gun was placed inside the mouth of the victim or pressed on the mouth or the right side of the mouth of the victim Aurelio. The inconsistencies can only be explained by one singular conclusion, that Marcelina was not at the scene of the crime. She did not witness the shooting of the victim Aurelio, and that she was just fabricating lies to support the statement of Menardo Barcena.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>As to accused-appellant Ramil Castillo, first, according to him there was nothing in the evidence that would show that he acted in concert with Raul Pablo in killing the victim Aurelio. What Ramil Castillo did was simply to hold the hand of the victim. He did not have any knowledge that Raul Pablo was going to kill Aurelio. The fact of conspiracy was not proved, hence, accused-appellant Castillo could not be held liable for the killing of Aurelio. It was accused-appellant Raul Pablo who pulled the trigger of the gun that killed Aurelio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Ramil Castillo raised as error the fact of the dying declaration of the victim Aurelio considered by the trial court as part of res <i>gestae</i>, hence, exempted from the hearsay rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>According to accused-appellant Ramil Castillo, in order that a dying declaration may be considered admissible in evidence, it must be shown that: a) the declaration concerned the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death; b) that at the time the declaration was made, the declarant was under a consciousness of an impending death;<br><br>c) that the declaration is offered in a criminal case for murder, homicide, or parricide, in which the declarant is the victim. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Ramil Castillo submits that the evidence does not justify the finding of the lower court that the statement of Aurelio Barcena can be considered as dying declaration. The prosecution failed to establish that Aurelio Barcena made the declaration with full knowledge of an impending death. The mention of his name as one of the companions of Raul Pablo certainly did not prove that he was one of the assailants, absent any express mention of his participation. Neither would the declaration be legally considered as part of <i style="text-decoration: underline;">res gestae</i>. It lacked the necessary ingredients to make it admissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant submits that the trial court erred when it considered the testimonies of Menardo Barcena and Marcelina Rebugio as gospel truths when in fact these witnesses had executed an affidavit of desistance claiming that there was no sufficient evidence to prove or establish the guilt of the accused-appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The issues raised are as follows:<br><ol><li>Whether the testimonies of Menardo Barcena and Marcelina Barcena are entitled to full credence;</li><li>Whether the defense of the accused is one of <i>alibi</i>;</li><li>Whether the accused acted in conspiracy in causing the death of the victim, Aurelio Barcena; and</li><li>Whether the deceased’s declaration naming Ramil Castillo and the other accused as his assailants could be taken as a dying declaration, or as part of the <i>res gestae</i>.</li></ol><br>The Solicitor General points to what it termed as the very basic issue in this case which is credibility of witnesses. According to the Solicitor General, the long-standing principle in our jurisdiction is that when an appealed conviction hinges on the credibility of witnesses, the assessment of the trial court is accorded the highest degree of respect. The findings of the trial judge who heard the witnesses, would not be disturbed on appeal and would be given considerable weight and respect especially in regard to the credibility of witnesses, since he was in a better position to observe the conduct and deportment of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>We find the appeal without merit.<br><br>First, accused-appellants argue that prosecution witnesses Menardo and Marcelina were perjured witnesses. This is untenable. It is an accepted principle that absent the most compelling reason or motive, it is inconceivable why witnesses would openly and publicly lie or concoct a story which would send an innocent man to jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Accused-appellants failed to show any animosity or ill-feeling on the part of the prosecution witnesses which could have motivated them to falsely accuse him of a serious crime as murder. No evil or improper motive on their part in testifying against accused-appellants having been shown, the presumption is that the witnesses do not have ill motive and that their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The relationship of the witnesses to the victim may not be taken as an indicium of bias. On the contrary, the witnesses’ relationship to the victim would render their testimonies more credible as it would be unnatural for relatives, who are particularly interested in vindicating the crime, to accuse somebody else other than the real culprits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Second, accused-appellants allege that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are replete with material inconsistencies. They maintain that the injury sustained by the victim does not conform to the declaration of Marcelina that the muzzle of the gun was "placed" inside the victim's mouth. From the vantage view, Marcelina testified that she saw accused-appellant Raul Pablo poke a gun at the mouth of Aurelio. The fact that the point of entry was in the midparietal area (top of the head) does not in any manner imply that the witness lied. The discrepancy may be explained by the fact that at the time Aurelio was shot, he was moving and struggling, trying to free himself from the hold of his assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Solicitor General submits that, where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the witness and the autopsy report of the medico legal officer, such discrepancy has to give way to the positive identification of the accused-appellants as the ones who killed Aurelio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the witness did not categorically state that the muzzle of the gun was placed inside the mouth of the victim. The discrepancies pointed out by the accused-appellants is on minor details that may be explained as lapses in memory and can not be considered as a deliberate attempt to state a falsehood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants also harped on the one (1) year delay that took Marcelina to execute a written declaration pointing to them as the perpetrators of the crime. It is plain from the record that Marcelina executed a joint affidavit with Darwin Barcena on August 10, 1990, to the effect that it was accused-appellant Raul Pablo who shot Aurelio with a .45 caliber gun. Marcelina also satisfactorily explained her failure to appear before the local authorities and the Municipal Circuit Trial Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> “Prosecution witness Marcelina positively identified accused-appellant Raul Pablo as the gunman. Her testimony was corroborated by Menardo who declared that he saw accused-appellant in front of a person lying on the ground, holding a .45 caliber gun.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Third, accused-appellants lament the inability of Marcelina and members of the victim’s family to come to the aid of Aurelio during and subsequent to the attack. There is nothing wrong or reprehensible with this seeming inaction of the victim’s family especially so when accused-appellant Raul Pablo made an ominous warning for them “to stay home because he (Aurelio) is already dead.” It is also a settled doctrine in our behavioral response that when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience, one’s actions and reactions cannot be stereotyped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Fourth, accused-appellants contend that it was physically impossible for the victim to name his assailants after sustaining a serious injury in his head. Dr. Bernard Macaraeg, the attending physician who treated the victim, admitted that there was a possibility that Aurelio could have made a dying declaration immediately after the shooting. Likewise, Dr. Ferdinand Florendo, an expert witness for the defense, did not foreclose any chance that the victim was able to mention the names of his attackers despite the fatal injuries he sustained in his head. Aurelio did not die instantly after the shooting; he expired two (2) hours later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Fifth, accused-appellant Raul Pablo faulted the trial court for considering his denial as one of <i>alibi</i>, maintaining that he was in his house and never heard a gunfire. Such denial, uncorroborated as it is by any reliable evidence, can not in any manner overcome the clear and convincing testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that he was the gunman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>After a piece by piece analysis and consideration of the issues, arguments and allegations raised by accused-appellants, we find that the trial court committed no error in convicting them of the crime charged.<br><br>“The probative value of the testimonies of eyewitnesses is not diminished by the mere fact that they are the brothers of the victim. Indeed, relatives are interested in vindicating the crime, and it would be unnatural for them to accuse someone other than the real culprit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>As to the accused-appellants’ defense of denial the same is untenable. “It is a well-settled rule that positive identification of the accused, where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, prevails over <i>alibi</i> and denial which if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5818, the court found accused-appellant Raul Pablo y Lazaro guilty of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition punished under P. D. No. 1866 and sentenced him to the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the costs. His separate indictment was on account of an unlicensed firearm used in the killing. “Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 8294, if homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance. Although the crime in this case was committed in 1990, the amendatory law (R. A.
