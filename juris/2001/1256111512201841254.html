				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 14, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 95, in Criminal Case No. Q-98-77588, finding accused Rolando Magabo y Magarte guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua.<br><br>On July 2, 1998, accused Rolando Magabo y Magarte was charged with the crime of Rape in an Information which reads, to wit:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of June, 1998, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, to wit: by then and there wilfully (sic), unlawfully and feloniously by undressing the undersigned and put himself on top of her and thereafter have carnal knowledge with the undersigned complainant, a mental retardate, against her will and without her consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>Originally, this case was raffled off and assigned to Branch 103 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, presided by Judge Jaime Salazar. But before the accused could be arraigned, Judge Salazar voluntarily inhibited himself from trying the case, and the same was re-raffled to Branch 95. On October 1, 1998, the accused was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Trial ensued.<br><br>The facts according to the prosecution, are as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On June 23, 1998, at about 1:00 in the afternoon, Noemi Dacanay, a mental retardate, was selling fried bananas at the Frisco Market in Quezon City when Rolando Magabo, known to Noemi as "Lanie", approached her and invited her to go with him to his house. Noemi immediately acceded. The two went to Magabo's house which was empty as Magabo's mother who was living with him was not around. Accused-appellant then seized the opportunity and began kissing Noemi on the lips and fondling her breasts. He made Noemi lie down on the floor, and had sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, accused-appellant rested on the floor and embraced Noemi. Later, Noemi left and went home. She told her mother of what happened, and they went to the police to report the incident. Noemi was examined by Dr. Ma. Christina Freyra, the Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, who found healed lacerations at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions on the victim's hymen, and abrasions on her labia minora. This was later confirmed by Dr. Freyra who was presented as a witness for the prosecution.<br><br>For his part, accused-appellant Rolando Magabo denied the rape and testified that between 1:00 and 2:00 in the afternoon of June 23, 1998, he was at the corner of Roosevelt Avenue and San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City selling short pants and t-shirts by the sidewalk. He admitted knowing the victim Noemi Dacanay and her parents,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and seeing Noemi and her mother sell fruits at the Munoz market, but said he could not recall seeing Noemi at the market in June 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Magabo alleges that a certain Freddie Buenaflor, with whom he had some altercations, informed Noemi's father of the alleged rape to get back at him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After trial, the court a quo rendered a judgment dated May 14, 1999, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Rolando Magabo y Magarte GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE defined and penalized by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659 and further amended by Article 266-A and Article 266-B, Republic Act No. 8353, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i>. The accused is further ordered to indemnify the private complainant the amounts of P50,000.00 as compensatory damages; P50,000.00 as moral damages; and P25,000 as exemplary damages.<br><br>"The period during which the accused was detained at the City Jail of Quezon City shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees in writing to abide by and follow strictly the rules and regulations of the said institution.<br><br>"The accused is ordered to pay the costs.<br><br>"IT IS SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Hence this appeal where the accused-appellant raises a lone assignment of error:<br><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED, ROLANDO MAGABO, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME OF RAPE, WITH PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br>The accused-appellant contends that the case at bar involves rape under the fourth circumstance of Article 266-A, paragraph 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and therefore, mental retardation of the alleged rape victim must be proven as an essential element of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> As the prosecution failed to prove that rape victim Noemi Dacanay is a mental retardate and that her mental age is no better than a twelve year old child, no rape has been committed, and the accused-appellant should not have been convicted by the trial court.<br><br>The contention is unmeritorious.<br><br>Carnal knowledge of a woman who is a mental retardate is rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 8353.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Proof of force or intimidation is not necessary as a mental retardate is not capable of giving consent to a sexual act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> What needs to be proven are the facts of sexual congress between the accused and the victim, and the mental retardation of the latter.<br><br>That the victim, Noemi Dacanay, had sexual intercourse with the accused-appellant Rolando Magabo was sufficiently established by her testimony, corroborated by the testimony of the medico-legal officer, Dr. Ma. Christina Freyra, to the effect that there were lacerations and abrasion on the victim's private parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As regards the mental retardation of the victim, the trial court likewise found the same to have been sufficiently proven, as set forth in its Decision, to wit:<br><blockquote>"The Court is more than convinced that the private complainant is a mental retardate not only based from her physical appearance as shown from the picture (Exh. `B') but also from the behavior and actuations she showed during the trial. The medico-legal officer who conducted the medical examination, in fact, concluded that the private complainant is a mental retardate. Besides, the mental condition of the private complainant was not raised or objected to by the accused. With the earlier findings of the Court that carnal knowledge of the private complainant by the accused was consummated and the fact that the words "mental retardate" are alleged in the complaint thru the timely amendment (before arraignment) by the public prosecutor, it is clear that the crime of rape was committed although the prosecution offered none to establish that carnal knowledge was without consent of the private complainant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>The physical appearance of the victim Noemi Dacanay, and the manner by which she testified persuaded the trial court that she indeed is a mental retardate. Mental deficiency is apparent from the halting and abbreviated answers given by Dacanay during her testimony, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">"Q:</td><td width="90%">And when you were selling Banana Que at Frisco Market what happened if any?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">Sama ako.

In fact, as correctly observed by the lower court, the mental condition of the complainant was not at all objected to by the accused-appellant during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Accordingly, it is too late for the accused-appellant to raise such factual issue before this tribunal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <br><br>It should likewise be noted that the accused-appellant himself acknowledged such mental retardation during his cross-examination, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">"Q:</td><td width="90%">And you know for a fact that Noemi Dacanay looks like a mongoloid or mentally retarded?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td>Yes, ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>You are aware of that?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td>Yes, ma'am."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Knowledge of the offender of the mental disability of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime of rape qualifies the crime and makes it punishable by death under Article 266-B, paragraph 10 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R. A. 8353.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> An allegation in the information of such knowledge of the offender is necessary as a crime can only be qualified by circumstances pleaded in the indictment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> A contrary ruling would result to a denial of the right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him, and hence a denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In the case before us, there was no allegation in the information that the accused had knowledge of the mental disability of the victim at the time rape was committed. Thus, notwithstanding proof of such knowledge, the accused can only be held liable for simple rape.<br><br>Qualifying circumstances not alleged in the Information but duly proven without objection during the trial may be considered as aggravating circumstances. However, in this case, knowledge of the accused of the mental retardation of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime of rape does not fall under any of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code, and hence cannot be appreciated as such. In view of the absence of aggravating circumstances, we find the grant of exemplary or corrective damages by the court <i>a quo</i> unwarranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned Decision is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the award of Exemplary Damages in the amount of P25,000.00 is deleted.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Panganiban,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Diosdado Madarang Peralta.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> RTC Decision, p. 1; <i>Rollo</i>, p. 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Appellee's Brief, pp. 3 to 4; <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 70 to 71.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN dated January 15, 1999, pp. 5 and 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> RTC Decision, p. 11; <i>Rollo</i>, p. 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, otherwise known as "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997", provides:<br><blockquote>"ART. 266-A.

Subparagraph b) thereof refers to rape of a person "deprived of reason", while subparagraph d) refers to rape of a "demented" person. Being "deprived of reason" means to suffer from mental abnormality, deficiency or retardation. [People vs. Reyes, 315 SCRA 563 (1999), at p. 577, citing People vs. Andaya, G.R. 126545, April 21, 1999, at p. 11, 306 SCRA 202, citing <i>People vs. Guerrero</i>, 242 SCRA 606 (1995). See also <i>People vs. Nguyen Dinh Nhan</i>, 200 SCRA 292 (1991)] On the other hand, being "demented" means having "<i>dementia</i>", defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a "form of mental disorder in which cognitive and intellectual functions of the mind are prominently affected; xxx xxx total recovery not possible since cerebral disease is involved." [5th ed., p. 387] "Demented" also refers to madness or insanity. [<i>People vs. Burgos</i>, 115 SCRA 767 (1982), at p. 774.] A mental retardate, therefore, can be classified as a person "deprived of reason", not one who is "demented", and carnal knowledge of a mental retardate is considered rape under subparagraph b), not subparagraph d) of Article 266-A (1). Hence, it is error for the court <i>a quo</i> to categorize the rape in this case under subparagraph d). However, such innocuous mistake will not carry the effect of negativing the criminal liability of the accused-appellant, especially in light of the fact that the latter was convicted of rape by the trial court under the general terms "RAPE defined and penalized by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659 and further amended by Article 266-A and 266-B, Republic Act No. 8353 xxx"[RTC Decision, <i>supra</i>.], without specific reference to any of the subparagraphs thereof.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>People vs. Padilla,</i> 301 SCRA 265 (1999), at p. 273.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> TSN dated November 3, 1998, pp. 5 to 6, 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> RTC Decision, p. 8; <i>Rollo</i>, p. 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> TSN dated October 1, 1998, pp. 4 to 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> TSN dated November 3, 1998, pp. 6 to 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> TSN dated November 10, 1998, p. 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> RTC Decision, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>People vs. Romua,</i> 272 SCRA 818 (1997), at p. 825; <i>People vs. Almacin,</i> 303 SCRA 399 (1999), at p. 408.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TSN dated January 15, 1999, at p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.
