				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><u>The Case</u><br></center><br>Submitted to the Court for consideration is a resolution of the Board of Governors, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (hereafter, the IBP) recommending an inquiry into the causes of delays in the resolution of incidents and motions and in the decision of cases pending before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br><center><u>The Antecedents</u><br></center><br>On July 31, 2000, the IBP, through its National President, Arthur D.

Garchitorena to comment on the letter of the IBP and to submit a list of all Sandiganbayan cases pending decision, or with motion for reconsideration pending resolution, indicating the dates they were deemed submitted for decision or resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On September 27, 2000, complying with the order, Presiding Justice Francis E. Garchitorena submitted a report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (hereafter, the compliance) admitting a number of cases submitted for decision and motion for reconsideration pending resolution before its divisions.

Garchitorena submitted a "schedule of cases submitted for decision, the schedule indicating the number of detained prisoners, of which there are (were) none."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On October 26, 2000, the IBP submitted its reply to the compliance stating: <u><b>First</b></u>, that it was not in a position to comment on the accuracy of the compliance; nonetheless, it showed that there was much to be desired with regard to the expeditious disposition of cases, particularly in the Sandiganbayan's First Division, where cases submitted for decision since 1990 remained unresolved. <u><b>Second</b></u>, the compliance did not include pending motions, and it is a fact that motions not resolved over a long period of time would suspend and delay the disposition of a case. <u><b>Third</b></u>, since the Sandiganbayan is a trial court, it is required to submit the same reports required of Regional Trial Courts. <u><b>Fourth</b></u>, the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>states that, "all lower collegiate courts" must decide or resolve cases or matters before it within twelve (12) months "from date of submission"; however, the Sandiganbayan, as a trial court, is required to resolve and decide cases within a reduced period of three (3) months like regional trial courts, or at the most, six (6) months from date of submission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On November 21, 2000, the Court resolved to direct then Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo (hereafter, the OCA) "to conduct a judicial audit of the Sandiganbayan, especially on the cases subject of this administrative matter, and to submit a report thereon not later than 31 December 2000."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On December 4, 2000, in a letter addressed to the Chief Justice, Presiding Justice Francis E. Garchitorena admitted that the First Division of the Sandiganbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> has a backlog of cases; that one case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> alone made the backlog of the First Division so large, involving 156 cases but the same has been set for promulgation of decision on December 8, 2000, which would reduce the backlog by at least fifty percent (50%).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On January 26, 2001, the Court Administrator submitted a memorandum to the Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> stating that the causes of delay in the disposition of cases before the Sandiganbayan are:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Failure of the Office of the Special Prosecutor to submit reinvestigation report despite the lapse of several years;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Filing of numerous incidents such as Motion to Dismiss, Motion to Quash, Demurrer to Evidence, etc. that remain unresolved for years;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Suspension of proceedings because of a pending petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Cases remain unacted upon or have no further settings despite the lapse of considerable length of time; and<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Unloading of cases already submitted for decision even if the ponente is still in service.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>We consider <i>ex mero motu</i> the Resolution of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) as an administrative complaint against Presiding Justice Francis E. Garchitorena for "serious delays in the decision of cases and in the resolution of motions and other pending incidents before the different divisions of the Sandiganbayan," amounting to incompetence, inefficiency, gross neglect of duty and misconduct in office.<br><br>We find no need to conduct a formal investigation of the charges in view of the admission of Justice Francis E. Garchitorena in his compliance of October 20, 2000, that there are indeed hundreds of cases pending decision beyond the reglementary period of ninety (90) days from their submission. In one case, he not only admitted the delay in deciding the case but took sole responsibility for such inaction for more than ten (10) years that constrained this Court to grant mandamus to dismiss the case against an accused to give substance and meaning to his constitutional right to speedy trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><u>The Issues<br></u></center><br>The issues presented are the following: (1) What is the reglementary period within which the Sandiganbayan must decide/resolve cases falling within its jurisdiction? (2) Are there cases submitted for decision remaining undecided by the Sandiganbayan or any of its divisions beyond the afore-stated reglementary period? (3) Is Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1094 applicable to the Sandiganbayan?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><u>The Court's Ruling</u><br></center><br>We resolve the issues presented <i>in</i> <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br><b>1. Period To Decide/Resolve Cases.--</b>There are two views. The first view is that from the time a case is submitted for decision or resolution, the Sandiganbayan has twelve (12) months to decide or resolve it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The second view is that as a court with trial function, the Sandiganbayan has three (3) months to decide the case from the date of submission for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Article VIII, Section 15 (1) and (2), of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 15. (1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission to the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.<br><br>"(2) A case or matter shall be deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief or memorandum required by the Rules of Court or by the court itself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The above provision does not apply to the Sandiganbayan. The provision refers to regular courts of lower collegiate level that in the present hierarchy applies only to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan is a special court of the same level as the Court of Appeals and possessing all the inherent powers of a court of justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> with functions of a trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Sandiganbayan is not a regular court but a special one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The Sandiganbayan was originally empowered to promulgate its own rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, on March 30, 1995, Congress repealed the Sandiganbayan's power to promulgate its own rules of procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and instead prescribed that the Rules of Court promulgated by the Supreme Court shall apply to all cases and proceedings filed with the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>"Special courts are judicial tribunals exercising limited jurisdiction over particular or specialized categories of actions. They are the Court of Tax Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, and the Shari'a Courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Under Article VIII, Section 5 (5) of the Constitution "Rules of procedure of <b>special courts </b>and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court."<br><br>In his report, the Court Administrator would distinguish between cases which the Sandiganbayan has cognizance of in its original jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and cases which fall within the appellate jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Court Administrator posits that since in the first class of cases, the Sandiganbayan acts more as a trial court, then for that classification of cases, the three (3) month reglementary period applies. For the second class of cases, the Sandiganbayan has the twelve-month reglementary period for collegiate courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> We do not agree.<br><br>The law creating the Sandiganbayan, P.D. No. 1606<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> is clear on this issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 6. Maximum period for termination of cases - As far as practicable, the trial of cases before the Sandiganbayan once commenced shall be continuous until terminated and the judgment shall be rendered within three (3) months from the date the case was submitted for decision."<br></blockquote>On September 18, 1984, the Sandiganbayan promulgated its own rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote>"Sec. 3 <i>Maximum Period to Decide Cases</i> - The judgment or final order of a division of the Sandiganbayan shall be rendered <u>within three (3) months from the date the case was submitted for decision</u> (<i>underscoring ours</i>)."<br></blockquote>Given the clarity of the rule that does not distinguish, we hold that the three (3) month period, not the twelve (12) month period, to decide cases applies to the Sandiganbayan. Furthermore, the Sandiganbayan presently sitting in five (5) divisions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> functions as a trial court. The term "trial" is used in its broad sense, meaning, it allows introduction of evidence by the parties in the cases before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The Sandiganbayan, in original cases within its jurisdiction, conducts trials, has the discretion to weigh the evidence of the parties, admit the evidence it regards as credible and reject that which they consider perjurious or fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><center><u>Compliance with its Own Rules<br></u></center><br>In <i>Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court faulted the DARAB for <i>violating</i> its own rules of procedure. We reasoned that the DARAB does not have unfettered discretion to suspend its own rules. We stated that the DARAB "should have set the example of observance of orderly procedure." Otherwise, it would render its own Revised Rules of Procedure uncertain and whose permanence would be dependent upon the instability of its own whims and caprices.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>Cabagnot v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this Court held that the Commission on Elections ought to be the first one to observe its own Rules. Its departure from its own rules constitutes "arrogance of power" tantamount to abuse. Such inconsistency denigrates public trust in its objectivity and dependability. The Court reminded the Comelec to be more judicious in its actions and decisions and avoid imprudent <i>volte-face </i>moves that undermine the public's faith and confidence in it.<br><br>The <i>ratio decidendi</i> in the afore-cited cases applies <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to the Sandiganbayan<i>. </i> The Sandiganbayan ought to be the first to observe its own rules. It cannot suspend its rules, or except a case from its operation.<br><br><b>2. Undecided Cases Beyond the Reglementary Period.--</b>We find that the Sandiganbayan has several cases undecided beyond the reglementary period set by the statutes and its own rules, some as long as more than ten (10) years ago.<br><br>According to the compliance submitted by the Sandiganbayan, three hundred and forty one (341) cases were submitted for decision but were undecided as of September 15, 2000. A number of the cases were submitted for decision as <b>far back as more than ten (10) years ago</b>.

Decision making is the primordial and most important duty of the member of the bench.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Hence, judges are enjoined to decide cases with dispatch. Their failure to do so constitutes gross inefficiency<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> that warrants disciplinary sanction, including fine,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> suspension<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and even dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The rule particularly applies to justices of the Sandiganbayan.

We stated that the Sandiganbayan has the inherent power to amend and control its processes and orders to make them conformable to law and justice.

Due to a finding of lack of bad faith on the part of respondent justice, we issued only a warning.

At least seventy-three cases have been unassigned for the writing of the extended opinion, though submitted for decision. It may be the thinking of the Presiding Justice, Sandiganbayan that an unassigned case is not counted in its backlog of undecided cases. This is not correct. It is the duty of the Presiding Justice and the Chairmen of divisions to assign the <i>ponente</i> as soon as the case is declared submitted for decision, if not earlier.

No. 1606 which requires that the judgment of the Sandiganbayan "shall be rendered within three (3) months from the date the case was submitted for decision". The said provision was apparently adopted by the Sandiganbayan in Section 3 Rule XVIII of its Revised Rules of Procedure which was issued pursuant to P.D. No. 1606. The resolution also cites Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 10-94, dated June 25, 1994 which is addressed "To: All <u>Trial Court Judges</u> and Clerks of Courts, Branch Clerks of Courts but not to <u>Sandiganbayan Justices</u> or the Clerk of Court and Division Clerk of Courts of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Section 15 (1) and (2) Article VII of the 1997 Constitution, however, provides that:<br><blockquote>Sec. 15 (1). All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.<br><br>(2) A case or matter shall be deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief or memorandum required by the Rules of Court or by the court itself.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; xxx<br></div></blockquote>The Supreme Court in Administrative Circular No. 10-94 has not reduced the 12-month period mentioned in the above-quoted constitutional provision insofar as the Sandiganbayan, a collegiate court, is concerned. It is basic that in case of conflict between a constitutional provision on one hand and a statute or an internal rule of procedure of a court on the other, the former, being a part of the fundamental law of the land, must prevail. Also pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 8245 (approved on February 5, 1997) the Sandiganbayan has also exclusive appellate jurisdiction "over final judgments, resolutions or orders of the regional trial courts whether in the exercise of their original jurisdiction or of their appellate jurisdiction as herein provided."<br><br>In this connection, be it noted that section 1 of R.A. No. 8249 further amending P.D. No. 1606, as amended, provides that:<br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Sandiganbayan; Composition; Qualification; Tenure; Removal and Compensation</i> - A special court, of the <b>same level as the Court of Appeals and possessing all the inherent powers of a court of justice, to be known as the Sandiganbayan</b> is hereby created composed of a presiding justice and fourteen associate justices who shall be appointed by the President.<br></blockquote>Incidentally, per the Rules of Procedure of the Sandiganbayan, each division is composed of three (3) justices whose unanimous vote is required to render a decision, resolution or order. In the event there is a dissent, a special division is formed whereby two (2) justices who shall be chosen by raffle and added to the division concerned, in which event, the majority rule shall prevail. For that reason and considering also that appeals from the decisions of the Sandiganbayan are to be filed directly with the Supreme Court, the Sandiganbayan as a collegiate trial court, is significantly different from the one-man regional trial court.<br><br>Subject to the foregoing observations and partial dissent, I concur with the rest of the resolution.</div>
