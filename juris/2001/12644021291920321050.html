				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The case is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Pangasinan, Branch 46, Urdaneta finding accused Alberto Pasudag y Bokang guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal cultivation of marijuana<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; a&nbsp; fine of&nbsp; P500,000.00, without subsidiary penalty and other accessories of the law.<br><br>On December 17, 1996, 4<sup>th</sup> Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Pangasinan Emiliano M. Matro filed with the Regional Trial Court, Pangasinan, Urdaneta an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> charging accused Alberto Pasudag y Bokang with violation of R.A. No. 6425, Sec. 9, reading as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about September 26, 1995 and prior dates thereto at barangay Artacho, municipality of Sison, province of Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously plant, cultivate, and culture seven (7) hills of marijuana in the land tilled by him and situated beside the house of the accused, without authority or permit to do so.<br><br>"Contrary to Sec. 9 of R.A. 6425 as amended."</blockquote><br>On February 10, 1997, the trial court arraigned the accused.&nbsp; He pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial ensued.<br><br>On September 26, 1995, at around 1:30 in the afternoon, SPO2 Pepito Calip of the PNP Sison, Pangasinan, went to Brgy. Artacho to conduct anti-jueteng operations.&nbsp; He urinated at a bushy bamboo fence behind the public school.&nbsp; About five (5) meters away, he saw a garden of about 70 square meters.&nbsp; There were marijuana plants in between corn plants and camote tops.&nbsp; He inquired from a storekeeper nearby as to who owned the house with the garden.&nbsp; The storeowner told him that Alberto Pasudag owned it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>SPO2 Calip went to the Police Station and reported to Chief of Police Romeo C. Astrero.&nbsp; The latter dispatched a team (composed of SPO2 Calip, SPO3 Fajarito, SPO3 Alcantara and PO3 Rasca) to conduct an investigation.&nbsp; At around 2:30 in that same afternoon, the team arrived at Brgy. Artacho and went straight to the house of accused Pasudag.&nbsp; SPO3 Fajarito looked for accused Pasudag and asked him to bring the team to his backyard garden which was about five (5) meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Upon seeing the marijuana plants, the policemen called for a photographer, who took pictures of accused Pasudag standing beside one of the marijuana plants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They uprooted seven (7) marijuana plants.&nbsp; The team brought accused Pasudag and the marijuana plants to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At the police station, accused Pasudag admitted, in the presence of Chief of Police Astrero, that he owned the marijuana plants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> SPO3 Fajarito prepared a confiscation report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which accused Pasudag signed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He kept the six marijuana plants inside the cabinet in the office of the Chief of Police and brought the tallest plant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Major Theresa Ann Bugayong Cid, a forensic chemist at the PNP Crime Laboratory, received the specimen<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>"&nbsp; (brown&nbsp; envelope con-containing leaves taken from Exh. "B").14 on October 11, 1995.&nbsp; She testified that she took some leaves from the marijuana plant because the leaves had the most concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol.&nbsp; As per her Chemistry Report No. D-087-95,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the examination was positive for marijuana (tetrahydrocannabinol).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On March 18, 1997, the trial court rendered a decision finding the accused guilty as charged and, taking into consideration his educational attainment (he reached only grade IV), imposed the minimum of the imposable penalty, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT is rendered CONVICTING ALBERTO PASUDAG of the crime charged in the information and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 without subsidiary penalty and other accessories of the law.<br><br>"The 7 fully grown marijuana plants are confiscated in favor of the government.<br><br>"The Warden of Urdaneta, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, is hereby ordered to commit the body of Alberto Pasudag to the National Bilibid Prison immediately upon receipt hereof.<br><br>"SO ORDERED.<br><br>"Done this 17<sup>th</sup> day of March, 1997, at Urdaneta, Pangasinan.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(Sgd.)

(emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>After the interrogation, SPO3 Fajarito prepared a confiscation report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which was part of the investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Accused-appellant signed the confiscation report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In both the interrogation and the signing of the confiscation receipt, no counsel assisted accused-appellant.&nbsp; He was the only civilian present in the Office of the Chief of Police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>We do not agree with the Solicitor General that accused-appellant was not under custodial investigation when he signed the confiscation receipt. It has been held repeatedly that custodial investigation commences when a person is taken into custody and is singled out as a suspect in the commission of a crime under investigation and the police officers begin to ask questions on the suspect's participation therein and which tend to elicit an admission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Obviously, accused-appellant was a suspect from the moment the police team went to his house and ordered the uprooting of the marijuana plants in his backyard garden.<br><br>"The implied acquiescence to the search, if there was any, could not have been more that mere passive conformity given under intimidating or coercive circumstances and is thus considered no consent at all within the purview of the constitutional guarantee."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Even if the confession or admission were "gospel truth", if it was made without assistance of counsel and without a valid waiver of such assistance, the confession is inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In light of the foregoing, we uphold the constitutional right of accused-appellant to a presumption of innocence.&nbsp; The prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; Accused-appellant <b>ALBERTO PASUDAG y BOKANG</b> is <b>ACQUITTED </b>of the crime charged for lack of&nbsp; proof&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt.
