				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Spouses Enrique R. Camacho and Angelina M. Camacho appeal <i>via certiorari</i> from the decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that denied their petition for prohibition to enjoin the Regional Trial Court, Leyte, Tacloban City, Branch 7 from enforcing its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> granting the issuance of a writ of possession after the respondent Philippine National Bank (hereafter, PNB) posted a bond in the amount of five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) in favor of petitioners.<br><br>The facts are not disputed.<br><br>On May 25, 1995, for failure of petitioners to pay their mortgage indebtedness with PNB, the Provincial Sheriff of Leyte extra-judicially foreclosed the mortgage constituted on petitioners' property covered by TCT Nos. T-33726, T-30578, T-29142, T-33725, and T-31058. At the foreclosure sale, PNB was the highest bidder.&nbsp; The Sheriff's Certificate of Sale, dated June 2, 1995, was duly registered with the Register of Deeds, Tacloban City, on June 16, 1995, so that petitioners had one (1) year therefrom, or until June 16, 1966, within which to redeem the foreclosed property.<br><br>On October 30, 1995, PNB, as purchaser in the foreclosure sale, filed with the Regional Trial Court, Tacloban City, Branch 7 a verified <i>ex-parte</i> petition for "a writ of possession" to enable it to gain possession of the property subject of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 1996, the trial court issued summons requiring petitioners to file their answer to the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On April 16, 1996, petitioners filed their answer with counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On September 10, 1996, the trial court issued a notice setting the hearing of the case on September 20, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On September 10, 1996, petitioners filed a Motion to Transfer date of hearing from September 20, 1996, to October 18, 1996, alleging that their counsel had a prior commitment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On October 15, 1996, the trial court issued an order that decreed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Considering that the applicable law on the matter renders the issuance of a Writ of Possession ministerial and imperative, the Ex-Parte Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession is hereby GRANTED upon posting of a bond of P500,000.00 in favor of Spouses Camacho."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On November 21, 1996, petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for prohibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to enjoin the enforcement of the writ of possession and to declare the order as null and void for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to depriving petitioners of their day in court.<br><br>After due proceedings, on March 25, 1998, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision&nbsp; that&nbsp; denied the petition for prohibition, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the present petition for prohibition is hereby DENIED.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>In denying the petition, the Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners were not denied due process because PNB's motion for issuance of writ of possession was to be heard on two (2) dates, September 10, 1996 and October 10, 1996, but on these dates petitioners chose not to attend the hearing; that even assuming that there was denial of due process, the same was cured by the filing of a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that the right of PNB to have possession of the subject property would not be defeated notwithstanding the pendency of a case questioning the validity of the foreclosure sale, citing Zaballero vs. Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The issues raised are:<br><br><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Whether the decision of the Court of Appeals had attained finality, and therefore, can no longer be appealed to the Supreme Court; and </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether PNB, after its incorporation as a private bank is entitled to a writ of possession on the property which it extra-judicially foreclosed under Act 3135, as amended, and Presidential Decree (P.

Alfredo C. Verona as counsel for petitioners is noted.<br><br>"In view of the Resolution of June 2, 1998, petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the decision dated March 25, 1998, is hereby noted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>On November 3, 1998, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution that denied due course to petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the foregoing facts, the questioned decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on March 25, 1998 and received by petitioner on April 1, 1998, became final and executory on April 17, 1998.&nbsp; It is no longer appealable to the Supreme Court <i>via </i>certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In De Gracia v. San Jose,19 we ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"As may be seen, the law expressly authorizes the purchaser to petition for a writ of possession during the redemption period by filing an ex parte motion under oath for that purpose in the corresponding registration or cadastral proceeding in the case of property with Torrens title; and upon the filing of such motion and approval of the corresponding bond, the law also in express terms directs the court to issue the order for a writ of possession. Under the legal provisions above copied, the order for a writ of possession issues as a matter of course upon filing of the proper motion and approval of the corresponding bond.&nbsp; No discretion is left to the court.&nbsp; And any question regarding the regularity and validity of the sale (and the consequent cancellation of the writ) is left to be determined in a subsequent proceeding as outlined in Section 8.&nbsp; Such question is not to be raised as a justification for opposing the issuance of the writ of possession, since, under the Act, the proceeding is ex parte."<br></blockquote><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, we dismiss the appeal.&nbsp; We declare the decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on March 25, 1998, in CA-G.
