Labatete and her sister Mary Grace, a mental retardate, were at home in Sampaloc, Tanay, Rizal.&nbsp; At around five o'clock in the afternoon, Werlinia's driver, Fernan Pervera, arrived.&nbsp; The latter asked Werlinia for his money in the amount of P700.00 because he will stop working for a while as driver of Werlinia.&nbsp; While they were talking, Werlinia saw her sister Mary Grace peep. When Mary Grace saw Fernan, she suddenly retreated to the kitchen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After Fernan left, Werlinia called Mary Grace and asked her why she was frightened upon seeing Fernan.&nbsp; Mary Grace just said "No."&nbsp; Werlinia persistently asked Mary Grace the same question until she answered, "<i>Iniyot</i> <i>ako ni Mario, Fernan and Dondon.</i>" (Literally translated: "I was fucked by Mario, Fernan and Dondon.")&nbsp; The persons mentioned by Mary Grace were workers in her stall in Nepa Q-Mart in Cubao, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Werlinia was in the business of selling vegetables, rice and fruits at the Nepa Q-Mart in Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; She owned 2 passenger jeepneys, a nine-seater single-tire jeepney and a fifteen-seater double-tire jeepney, which she used in going to Baguio City or Pangasinan two to three times a week to buy goods for her business.&nbsp; Mario Hamto and Fernan Pervera were employed by Werlinia as drivers while Ronald Cuesta, nicknamed Dondon, was hired as conductor.<br><br>Werlinia brought Mary Grace to the police station in Sampaloc, Tanay, Rizal and filed a complaint which was entered in the police blotter.&nbsp; She likewise brought Mary Grace to the National Center for Mental Health for psychiatric examination.&nbsp; At the Criminal Investigation Section in Camp Crame, Mary Grace, with the assistance of her sister, gave a statement on the alleged rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Mary Grace testified that Fernan, Mario and Ronald raped her in the fifteen-seater double-tire jeepney.&nbsp; They all smelled of liquor at that time, according to her.&nbsp; It was Mario who raped her first, she said.&nbsp; Mario boxed her on the chest, covered her mouth and held her hands.&nbsp; Mario then removed her panty.&nbsp; Ronald prevented her from going out of the jeepney.&nbsp; Mario removed his pants and raped her.&nbsp; Afterwards, Mary Grace said "<i>Ayaw ko nang magpaiyot</i>".<b><sup> </sup></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The three refused to let her go and raped her again one after another.&nbsp; She felt pain.&nbsp; She did not tell her Ate Lina (Werlinia) about the incident because she forgot to do so.<br><br>Dr. Ma. Cristina Freyra, Medico-legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory, also testified for the prosecution.&nbsp; In her report, she confirmed that Mary Grace had deep-healed lacerations at 3:00 o'clock and 6:00 o'clock positions indicating that she is no longer a virgin and that the deep-healed lacerations were inflicted more than seven (7) days prior to the examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Dr. Celeste Peña-Vista, a resident physician at the National Center for Mental Health, conducted a psychiatric examination of Mary Grace and found that Mary Grace was retarded with a mental age of a seven-year-old.&nbsp; It was also established that she had an IQ level of 35-42 and had "diminutive deficit in adoptive functioning."&nbsp; She was perceptive but had difficulty in interpretation.&nbsp; She could tell what happened but found it difficult to know the meaning of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The version of the defense, presented to the trial court, is as follows:<br><br>Appellant Hamto was a stay-in mechanic at the Dominguez Motors shop located at Purdue Street, corner Ermin Garcia, Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; On April 27, 1994, he agreed to work as driver of Werlinia's double-tire jeepney upon their agreement that they would share the profit under a 40-60% sharing arrangement after all the goods have been sold.&nbsp; In the meantime he stopped working at Dominguez Motors though he regularly went there to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On May 2, 1994, his sister Ligaya Santos came to see him at Dominguez Motors and informed him that their mother died on April 30, 1994 in Atimonan, Quezon. The next day, he went to Atimonan. On May 7, 1994, his mother was buried. He continued to stay there until after the "pasiyam" (nine days' wake), for he had to take care of the expenses of the funeral.&nbsp; He returned to the repair shop in the evening of May 14, 1994.&nbsp; He returned to work for Werlinia on May 15, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On May 17, 1994, they went to Tanay and proceeded to Baguio to buy vegetables for the market stall.&nbsp; After the vegetables were sold, Werlinia gave him P1,000.00.&nbsp; To prove that he was in Atimonan, Quezon, he presented an affidavit executed by the Barangay Secretary and attested to by the Mayor and the Barangay Captain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On May 22, 1994, he decided to stop working for Werlinia.&nbsp; He told her that his children were going to enroll in school.&nbsp; He never returned to work after this date.&nbsp; He was told by friends that Werlinia went to the shop angry and said something bad might happen to him.&nbsp; He testified that Werlinia charged him for rape because he failed to work for her starting May 22, 1994, which he purposely did because Werlinia failed to give him his share per their profit agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>For his part, co-accused Ronald Cuesta denied the accusation against him. He claimed that on May 7, 1994 he decided to quit working for Werlinia because of his small salary and his difficulty in sleeping at night on the floor of the jeepney as ordered by Werlinia. He denied raping Mary Grace and denied having seen her in the double-tire jeepney.&nbsp; He also testified that he did not know whether someone was sleeping in the double-tire jeepney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After a meticulous examination of the evidence on record, the trial court rendered its decision, holding that appellant indeed raped Mary Grace. Her narration as to how the rape was committed, in the court's view, was straightforward, despite her mental weakness.&nbsp; The trial court found her testimony worthy of belief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> As to the appellant's defense of alibi, the trial court found it lacking merit because he failed to establish that he could not have been physically present at the place of the crime at the time of its commission.&nbsp; Except for the penalty imposed, we are in agreement with the trial court's judgment.<br><br>Although Mary Grace was mentally retarded, her testimony cannot be discredited. All persons who can perceive, and perceiving can make known their perception to others, may be witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Mere intellectual weakness of a witness is not a ground to disqualify, or at the very least discredit, a witness.&nbsp; The intellectual weakness of Mary Grace does not make her incompetent as a witness if, at the time she testified, she had the mental capacity to distinguish between right and wrong, understand the nature and obligation of an oath, and give a fairly intelligent and reasonable narrative of the matters about which she testifies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the witness stand, Mary Grace testified as follows:<br><br><b>A.

The psychiatrist who examined her testified that Mary Grace was capable of being receptive and perceptive.&nbsp; She could tell what happened but found difficulty in interpreting things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Hence, we agree with the trial court's finding that Mary Grace's credibility commands great weight and respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Worth stressing, if the mental age of woman above twelve years is that of a child below twelve years, even if she voluntarily submitted to the bestial desires of the accused, or even if the circumstances of force, intimidation, mental weakness or consciousness of the victim were absent, the offender would still be liable for rape under the third circumstance of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>ART. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed.</i> - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br>1.&nbsp; By using force or intimidation.<br>2.&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br>3.&nbsp; When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center></blockquote><br>Considering the statutory rule that sexual intercourse with a victim under twelve years of age is rape, then it should follow that carnal knowledge of a woman whose <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mental</span> age is that of a child below twelve years would also constitute rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Appellant's claim of ill motive on the part of the victim's sister in filing the instant case lacks evidentiary weight.&nbsp; No sister would expose her sibling to the ignominy of a rape trial merely to satisfy her alleged motive.&nbsp; Moreover, no family member would expose a fellow family member to the shame and scandal of having to undergo such a debasing ordeal if the charge were not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Concerning appellant's defense of alibi, it is also a well-settled rule that for alibi to prevail, it must be established by positive, clear and satisfactory proof that it was physically impossible for the accused to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission, and not merely that the accused was somewhere else.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Appellant's claim of being at another place, even if true, did not preclude the possibility of his coming to the scene of the crime.&nbsp; Noteworthy, appellant failed to establish that he did not leave Atimonan, Quezon during the period of May 3, 1994 to May 14, 1994.&nbsp; To prosper, alibi must meet the requirements of time and place strictly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Appellant's defense of bare denial and alibi could not compel credence in the face of his positive and unwavering identification by the private complainant as one of the rapists.&nbsp; Positive identification, where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive, prevails over alibi and denial which, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative allegations and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Nor could his contention, that it was highly improbable for him to commit the crime considering that he drove everyday to Baguio, be given credence. As pointed out by the Solicitor General, even assuming that the trip to Baguio was daily, appellant could not have been dead tired upon reaching Manila that he could not have raped Mary Grace.&nbsp; Appellant's empty reasoning merely betrays his hopeless defensive position.<br><br>The penalty imposed by the trial court, however, should be modified. Pursuant to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the penalty for rape is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, a single and indivisible penalty, which under the first paragraph of Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, must be imposed upon a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <i>Reclusion perpetua</i> is imposed in its entirety regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Hence in this case, the imposable penalty should be modified to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.
