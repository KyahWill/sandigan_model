Remigio Gregorio for a briefing.<br><br>During the briefing, they were instructed to conduct a buy-bust operation at No. 54 Mustang Street, Fairview, Quezon City (hereafter "the house"). After the meeting, they left Camp Karingal in three (3) motor vehicles and proceeded to Regalado Street in Fairview where they waited for each other.&nbsp; They proceeded to Mustang Street.&nbsp; From a distance of about 30 to 35 meters, SPO3 Noguera observed SPO1 Allan de la Cruz.&nbsp; He saw SPO1 Vizcarra run into the house and he followed him.&nbsp; When he entered, members of the team had accosted Jun and several persons around a table were engaged in a pot session.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><b>SPO1 Allan de la Cruz</b> (hereafter, "SPO1 de la Cruz") testified that their unit received numerous complaints from the residents of Fairview, Quezon City of "pot sessions" going on in their subdivision.&nbsp; Because of this, Chief Officer P/Sr. Insp.

He also testified that when the policemen searched the rooms of the house, they found nothing illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b>Joselito Galon</b> testified that while he was at the house, Jun instructed him to accompany a certain Maureen to the tricycle terminal at Regalado Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> When he got to the terminal, five (5) men flagged him whom he later learned were police officers. The police officers frisked him, searched his car and inquired about Jun and where the house was located.&nbsp; The police officers recovered a plastic bag containing shabu from the car.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the house where the police officers instructed him "not to make any sign or signal and just to knock on the gate."<br><br>Clarissa Espectacion opened the gate.&nbsp; The police officers ran into the house and instructed the persons inside to sit in the living room.&nbsp; The policemen searched the rooms.&nbsp; Joselito Galon testified that when the policemen came out from one of the rooms they were carrying several plastic bags of shabu.&nbsp; He further testified that when the policemen entered the house, Jun was playing darts and there was no "buy-bust operation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><b>Clarissa Espectacion</b> corroborated their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>SPO1 Alfredo Vizcarra</b> (hereafter, "SPO1 Vizcarra") summoned by compulsory process by the defense testified as a hostile witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He testified that first, there was no buy - bust operation conducted by the police.&nbsp; That at around six o'clock in the evening of January 18, 1998, SPO1 de la Cruz was at Regalado Street in Fairview and called the office at Camp Karingal requesting for "back-up." Responding to the call, he, together with police officers Salito Uy and Velasquez went to Regalado Street and arrived there at eight thirty in the evening.&nbsp; When they arrived, SPO1 dela Cruz was with Joselito Galon.&nbsp; They proceeded to the house at Mustang Street in three (3) vehicles - an owner jeep, a taxicab and the vehicle used by Joselito Galon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>Second</b>, when they got to the house, Clarissa Espectacion opened the gate.&nbsp; When they entered the house, five (5) to six (6) persons were inside eating.&nbsp; Jun was among them.&nbsp; They searched the house without a warrant.&nbsp; He testified that Velasquez found shabu in the house and that he himself found a short firearm<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on the sofa. While shabu was found inside the house, SPO1 Vizcarra testified that shabu was not found in Jun's possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b>Third</b>, Vizcarra testified that SPO1 dela Cruz caused the arrest of Jun because he had a personal grudge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> against him. When the police officers returned to the Camp Karingal station, SPO1 dela Cruz commented to him, "<i>nakabawi na raw sila kay Ruiz</i>."

Other than a desire to tell the truth, the records are bereft of any motive for his hostile and unwilling support of the defense.<br><br>He did not personally know Jun prior to the incident of January 18, 1998. He was not a family friend of the Ruizes.&nbsp; He did not owe the Ruiz family any debt of gratitude.&nbsp; When he entered the police service in 1996, Jun's father had already retired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Vizcarra's testimony was straightforward.&nbsp; When asked whether he saw Jun outside the house before they entered it, he categorically answered that he did not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> When asked if there was a buy-bust operation, SPO1 Vizcarra's answer was clear, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"ATTY. TICMAN:<br><br>Q-:&nbsp;&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses particularly dela Cruz and Noguera testified that immediately before you entered that house a buy-bust operation was conducted against Godofredo Ruiz, Jr., is that statement of the witnesses are correct or not (sic)?<br><br>"WITNESS:<br><br>A-:&nbsp;&nbsp; No, that is not true.<br><br>"ATTY.

He did not see Jun frisked.&nbsp; He did not see the buy-bust operation conducted.&nbsp; In fact, he testified that his view of SPO1 dela Cruz as the buy-bust operation was being conducted was blocked by another vehicle also on Mustang Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> When SPO1 Noguera arrived at the house, Jun was already arrested.&nbsp; So while SPO1 Noguera testified that they were instructed to hold a buy-bust operation, he did not testify that it was actually conducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>We agree with Jun that,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"the only narration in court which could have corroborated the buy bust tale was that of prosecution witness SPO3 Noguera.&nbsp; His statement as regards said aspect however left much to be desired as there was not mention as to such operation nor that he witnessed the same."</blockquote><br><br>The rule is that conviction must rest not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>We also find peculiar the fact that SPO1 Noguera testified that they converged on Regalado Street at a place where there were many tricycles before proceeding to Mustang Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> This corroborates SPO1 Vizcarra's and Joselito Galon's testimony as to their presence at the tricycle terminal.<br><br>Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt<br><br>While the trial court found that the defense's version is shot with holes and ridden with inconsistencies, we view that the prosecution likewise failed to establish a strong case against Jun.&nbsp; Accusations are not proof.&nbsp; There must be corroborative evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The prosecution failed to rebut the testimony of SPO1 Vizcarra that was very damaging to it. First, the cross-examination failed to expose any selfish motive SPO1 Vizcarra may have had for testifying against the interests of his fellow police officers.&nbsp; Second, the cross-examination failed to question SPO1 Vizcarra with respect to his allegation that SPO1 dela Cruz was motivated by a personal vendetta against Jun.&nbsp; Thus unchallenged, the veracity of the statement stands.<br><br>We reiterate the rule that in this jurisdiction the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> To justify a conviction there must be moral certainty of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In this case, there is none.<br><br>Neither can the Court use as basis for affirming Jun's conviction the "presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions." The reason is two-fold.&nbsp; First, the presumption is precisely just that - a mere presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Once it is challenged by evidence, as in this case, SPO1 Vizcarra's testimony cannot be regarded as binding truth.&nbsp; Second, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot preponderate over the presumption of innocence that prevails if not overthrown by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Fallo<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we REVERSE the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City dated September 12, 1998 in Criminal Cases Nos.
