decision</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the Court of Appeals dated July 25, 1995
in CA-G.R. CV No. 36546, affirming the decision dated September 4, 1991 of the
Regional Trial Court of Balayan, Batangas, Branch 10 in Civil Case No. 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts, as found by
the trial court and by the Court of Appeals, are not disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The spouses Antonio M.
Chua and Asuncion M. Chua were the owners of a parcel of land covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title No. P-142 and registered in their names.  Upon Antonio’s death, the probate court
appointed his son, private respondent Allan M. Chua, special administrator of
Antonio’s intestate estate.  The court
also authorized Allan to obtain a loan accommodation of five hundred fifty
thousand (P550,000.00) pesos from petitioner Philippine National Bank to be
secured by a real estate mortgage over the above-mentioned parcel of land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 29, 1989, Allan
obtained a loan of P450,000.00 from petitioner PNB evidenced by a promissory
note, payable on June 29, 1990, with interest at 18.8 percent per annum. To
secure the loan, Allan executed a deed of real estate mortgage on the aforesaid
parcel of land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 27, 1990, for
failure to pay the loan in full, the bank extrajudicially foreclosed the real
estate mortgage, through the <i>Ex-Officio </i>Sheriff, who conducted a public
auction of the mortgaged property pursuant to the authority provided for in the
deed of real estate mortgage.  During
the auction, PNB was the highest bidder with a bid price P306,360.00.  Since PNB’s total claim as of the date of
the auction sale was P679,185.63, the loan had a payable balance of
P372,825.63.  To claim this deficiency,
PNB instituted an action with the RTC, Balayan, Batangas, Branch 10, docketed
as Civil Case No. 1988, against both Mrs. Asuncion M. Chua and Allan Chua in
his capacity as special administrator of his father’s intestate estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Despite summons duly
served, private respondents did not answer the complaint. The trial court
declared them in default and received evidence <i>ex parte</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 4, 1991, the
RTC rendered its decision, ordering the dismissal of PNB’s complaint.</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal, the Court of
Appeals affirmed the RTC decision by dismissing PNB’s appeal for lack of merit.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari under
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.  Petitioner cites two grounds:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE CA ERRED IN
HOLDING THAT PNB CAN NO LONGER PURSUE ITS DEFICIENCY CLAIM AGAINST THE ESTATE
OF DECEASED ANTONIO M. CHUA, HAVING ELECTED ONE OF ITS ALTERNATIVE RIGHT
PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 RULE 86 OF THE RULES OF COURT DESPITE A SPECIAL ENACTMENT
(ACT. NO. 3135) COVERING EXTRAJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE SALE ALLOWING RECOURSE FOR A
DEFICIENCY CLAIM AS SUPPORTED BY CONTEMPORARY JURISPRUDENCE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE CA ERRED IN
HOLDING THAT ALLAN M. CHUA, AS SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF
HIS DECEASED FATHER ANTONIO M. CHUA ON ONE HAND, AND HIM AND HIS MOTHER
ASUNCION CHUA AS HEIRS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE NO LONGER LIABLE FOR THE DEBTS OF
THE ESTATE.<a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The primary issue posed
before us is whether or not it was error for the Court of Appeals to rule that
petitioner may no longer pursue by civil action the recovery of the balance of
indebtedness after having foreclosed the property securing the same.  A resolution of this issue will also resolve
the secondary issue concerning any further liability of respondents and of the
decedent’s estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner contends that
under prevailing jurisprudence, when the proceeds of the sale are insufficient
to pay the debt, the mortgagee has the right to recover the deficiency from the
debtor.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It also contends that Act 3135, otherwise
known as “An Act to Regulate the Sale of Property under Special Powers Inserted
in or Annexed to Real Estate Mortgages,” is the law applicable to this case of
foreclosure sale and not Section 7 of Rule 86 of the Revised Rules of Court</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as held by the Court of Appeals.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondents argue
that having chosen the remedy of extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgaged
property of the deceased, petitioner is precluded from pursuing its deficiency
claim against the estate of Antonio M. Chua.  This they say is pursuant to Section 7, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court,
which states that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 7. Rule 86. <i>Mortgage debt due from estate.</i> — A creditor
holding a claim against the deceased secured by mortgage or other collateral
security, may abandon the security and prosecute his claim in the manner
provided in this rule, and share in the general distribution of the assets of
the estate; or he may foreclose his mortgage or realize upon his security, by
action in court, making the executor or administrator a party defendant, and if
there is a judgment for a deficiency, after the sale of the mortgaged premises,
or the property pledged, in the foreclosure or other proceeding to realize upon
the security, he may claim his deficiency judgment in the manner provided in
the preceding section; or he may rely upon his mortgage or other security alone
and foreclose the same at any time within the period of the statute of
limitations, and <i>in that event he shall not be admitted as a creditor, and
shall receive no share in the distribution of the other assets of the estate</i>;
but nothing herein contained shall prohibit the executor or administrator from
redeeming the property mortgaged or pledged by paying the debt for which it is
hold as security, under the direction of the court if the court shall adjudge
it to be for the interest of the estate that such redemption shall be made.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pertinent to the issue at
bar, according to petitioner, are our decisions he cited.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <i>Prudential Bank v. Martinez, </i>189 SCRA
612, 615 (1990)<i>,</i> is particularly cited by petitioner as precedent for
holding that in extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage, when the proceeds of the
sale are insufficient to pay the debt, the mortgagee has the right to recover
the deficiency from the mortgagor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, it must be
pointed out that petitioner’s cited cases involve ordinary debts secured by a
mortgage. The case at bar, we must stress, involves a foreclosure of mortgage
arising out of a settlement of estate, wherein the administrator mortgaged a
property belonging to the estate of the decedent, pursuant to an authority given
by the probate court.  As the Court of
Appeals correctly stated, the Rules of Court on Special Proceedings comes into
play decisively. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To begin with, it is
clear from the text of Section 7, Rule 89, that once the deed of real estate
mortgage is recorded in the proper Registry of Deeds, together with the
corresponding court order authorizing the administrator to mortgage the
property, said deed shall be valid as if it has been executed by the deceased
himself. Section 7 provides in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 7. Rule 89. <i>Regulations for granting authority to sell,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber estate</i> – The court having jurisdiction of
the estate of the deceased may authorize the executor or administrator to sell
personal estate, or to sell, mortgage, or otherwise encumber real estate, in
cases provided by these rules when it appears necessary or beneficial under the
following regulations:</blockquote>

<p class="XXX"><span style="">x x x<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(f) There shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of the
province in which the real estate thus sold, mortgaged, or otherwise encumbered
is situated, a certified copy of the order of the court, together with the deed
of the executor or administrator for such real estate, <i>which shall be valid
as if the deed had been executed by the deceased in his lifetime.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present case, it
is undisputed that the conditions under the aforecited rule have been complied
with.  It follows that we must consider
Sec. 7 of Rule 86, appropriately applicable to the controversy at hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Case law now holds that
this rule grants to the mortgagee three distinct, independent and mutually
exclusive remedies that can be alternatively pursued by the mortgage creditor
for the satisfaction of his credit in case the mortgagor dies, among them:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(1) to waive the mortgage and claim the entire debt from the
estate of the mortgagor as an ordinary claim; </p>

<p class="NUM">(2) to foreclose the mortgage judicially and prove any deficiency
as an ordinary claim; and </p>

<p class="NUM">(3) to rely on the mortgage exclusively, foreclosing the same at
any time before it  is barred by
prescription <i>without right to file a claim for any deficiency</i>.<a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <i>Perez v. Philippine
National Bank,</i></span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> reversing <i>Pasno vs. Ravina</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The ruling in <i>Pasno vs. Ravina</i> not having been reiterated in
any other case, we have carefully reexamined the same, and after mature
deliberation have reached the conclusion that the dissenting opinion is more in
conformity with reason and law. Of the three alternative courses that section
7, Rule 87 (now Rule 86), offers the mortgage creditor, to wit, (1) to waive
the mortgage and claim the entire debt from the estate of the mortgagor as an
ordinary claim; (2) foreclose the mortgage judicially and prove any deficiency
as an ordinary claim; and (3) to rely on the mortgage exclusively, foreclosing
the same at any time before it is barred by prescription, <i>without right to
file a claim for any deficiency</i>, the majority opinion in <i>Pasno vs.
Ravina</i>, in requiring a judicial foreclosure, virtually wipes out the third
alternative conceded by the Rules to the mortgage creditor, and <i>which would
precisely include extra-judicial foreclosures</i> by contrast with the second
alternative.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plain result of
adopting the last mode of foreclosure is that the creditor waives his right to
recover any deficiency from the estate.</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Following the <i>Perez</i> ruling that the
third mode includes extrajudicial foreclosure sales, the result of
extrajudicial foreclosure is that the creditor waives any further deficiency
claim. The dissent in <i>Pasno, </i>as adopted in <i>Perez</i>, supports this
conclusion, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>When account is further taken of the fact that <i>a creditor who
elects to foreclose by extrajudicial sale</i> <i>waives all right to recover against
the estate of the deceased debtor for any deficiency remaining unpaid after the
sale</i> it will be readily seen that the decision in this case (referring to
the majority opinion<i>)</i> will impose a burden upon the estates of deceased
persons who have mortgaged real property for the security of debts, without any
compensatory advantage.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Clearly, in our view,
petitioner herein has chosen the mortgage-creditor’s option of extrajudicially
foreclosing the mortgaged property of the Chuas.  This choice now bars any subsequent deficiency claim against the
estate of the deceased, Antonio M. Chua. Petitioner may no longer avail of the
complaint for the recovery of the balance of indebtedness against said estate,
after petitioner foreclosed the property securing the mortgage in its
favor.  It follows that in this case no
further liability remains on the part of respondents and the late Antonio M.
Chua’s estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, finding no reversible error committed by
respondent Court of Appeals, the instant petition is hereby DENIED. The
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 36546 is
