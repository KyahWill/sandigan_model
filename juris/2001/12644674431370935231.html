After they had left, at about 10:30 p.m., Mrs. Asada closed the store, and proceeded to her room while Rommel went to the living room adjacent to the store to watch television (TSN, pp. 16-17, May 5, 1993).&nbsp; Mrs. Asada noted that when the four men arrived at her store, they reeked of liquor and were sniffing a white substance while they drank beer (TSN, p. 15, May 5, 1993).<br><br>"At about 11:00 o'clock that same night, a commotion broke the peace in the apartment compound of Mrs. Fe Asada.&nbsp; A loud thud emanating near the store stirred up the apartment residents (TSN, pp. 50-51, April 3, 1995). Then, Rommel Pagui went out of the apartment through the main gate.&nbsp; A few seconds later, he was seen running towards the interior of the driveway stretched along the length of the apartment compound (TSN, p. 59, April 3, 1995).&nbsp; There were four men chasing Rommel at the time, namely: appellants, Bernabe de Guzman, Jr., Reynaldo de Guzman, Gilbert Dolores and Russel Abad (TSN, p. 37, May 4, 1993). Before he retreated to the rear of the driveway, Rommel shouted, <i>`Bakit ninyo ako sinaksak?' </i>(TSN, p. 50, May 3, 1995).&nbsp; The group caught up with Rommel at the rear end of the apartment compound where he was cornered.&nbsp; A few moments later, the same group composed of appellants, Bernabe de Guzman, Jr., Reynaldo de Guzman, Gilbert Dolores and Russel Abad rushed towards the gate of the apartment and out into the street. Gilbert Dolores was seen holding a bloodied knife and as he swung it, blood streaked from it onto the concrete fence of the apartment, (TSN, pp. 39-40, May 4, 1993).<br><br>"Thereafter, Mrs. Fe Asada, Rommel's aunt and a boarder of Mrs. Asada, Elizabeth Cataniag, sought out Rommel in his room located in front of Mrs. Asada's bedroom. Failing to find him there and noting that appellant's group had already left, the two went to the rear portion of the apartment driveway (TSN, pp. 71-75, April 3, 1995).<br><br>"Medico-Legal findings on the cadaver of Rommel reveal that the victim sustained nine stab wounds, four of which were fatal in character (TSN, pp. 34-39, April 3, 1995)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Defense's Version</i></span><br></div><br>In their Briefs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the De Guzman brothers gave the following version of the facts:<br><br><blockquote>"7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant Bernabe de Guzman, Jr., then 23 years old, denied the accusation against him and testified before the trial court that: since he was a little boy his nickname was `Junior' and that he was known by such appellation; that at about 7:30 in the evening of July 22, 1992 he was at his neighbor's (i.e., Alice Rodriguez) place located above his residence at 295 Ermin Garcia Street, Cubao, Quezon City watching television with `Ate Alice (i.e., Alice Rodriguez), Ate Miriam (i.e., Cynthia Kolong), Manang Itchang (i.e. Sonia Kolong), Ate Manlik (i.e., Lanilyn Kolong), Lenlen, Kuya Alex (i.e. Alex Anaban), Bebe (i.e., Amado Alauig) and my mother and my father'; that he fell asleep watching television; he was awakened later by one of his parents and was very sleepy when he transferred to the room of Amado Alauig (or Alaoig) which was beside the room of Alice Rodriguez; the next thing he knew was that he woke up at about 7:00 o'clock the next day (i.e., July 23, 1992) and was told of the death of Rommel Pagul by his Aunt Saling (i.e., Rosalina Querobin); he went outside and even joined the people `kibitsing around . . . in the scene' at 283 Ermin Garcia Street, Cubao, Quezon City; in the process he saw policemen and x x x Police Officer Pasco and further, with his brother, conversed with the people milling around the scene; thereafter, he returned to his house, prepared for work and proceeded to the security agency where he was employed (i.e., Citizen Protective Agency); he was later assigned to a post at the corner of Aurora Boulevard and 20th Avenue were he was on duty from 7:00 in the evening of July 23, 1992 to 9:00 a.m. of July 24, 1992 (pp. 8-52, t.s.n. May 23, 1994).<br><br>"8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant Bernabe de Guzman, Jr. further testified that he later learned of the arrest of his brother Reynaldo de Guzman when he went home the morning of July 24, 1992 and later on joined his brother, who was with a Police Officer, and accompanied him to the Police Station where he stayed until 10:00 the morning of July 25, 1992.&nbsp; He even saw the father of the victim at the police station on July 25, 1992 and told the lat[t]er that he was not present in the incident whe[n] the victim died.&nbsp; He was told by the victim's father to `help him to locate Hill' which appellant tried to do by getting the address of appellant Gil Dolores from the same security agency where he was working at that time and eventually gave the same to x x x Police Officer Pasco. Thereafter, appellant Bernabe de Guzman, Jr. continued residing at his given address at Ermin Garcia and even attended the preliminary investigation hearings which followed before the Quezon City Prosecutor's Office sometime November and December, 1992 (Exhibits `3', `3-A', `3-D').&nbsp; Sometime May, 1993, upon learning of a warrant of arrest having been issued against him he voluntarily surrendered before the police station at Kamuning but he was not detained as the warrant bore a different name (Bernardo de Guzman, Jr.). Eventually, however, he surrendered himself anew to the police sometime July 2, 1993 and has been detained since then (pp. 53-91, t.s.n. of May 23, 1994).<br><br>"9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his part, Reynaldo de Guzman testified that about 6:00 p.m. of July 22, 1992, he ate his dinner at his house at 295 Ermin Garcia Street, Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; He was [fetched] by a friend, Nicasio Upao a known resident of 274 Ermin Garcia Street, Cubao, Quezon City, whom he accompanied to watch a movie at about 6:30 p.m. at the Coronet I Theatre in Cubao (i.e., `Lucio Margallo by Philip Salvador') and came back at about 9:00 in the evening.&nbsp; Upon their return they met appellant Gilbert Dolores who `was already drunk, his face was red' who insisted that they accompany him to drink. Nicasio Upao was able to decline but appellant was `forced' by Gilbert Dolores to accompany him to the store of Azada which was still open at that time (pp. 3 to 7, t.s.n. of September 12, 1994).<br><br>"10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Azada store, Gilbert Dolores ordered three (3) bottles of beer from `Manang Fe' (i.e., Maria Fe Azada) and ordered Reynaldo's cousin to call Russel Abad who was staying with his (i.e., Abad's) cousin nearby (i.e., 279 Ermin Garcia Street, Cubao, Quezon City[)].&nbsp; Soon thereafter, an acquaintance named `Totoy', who also resided at Ermin Garcia Street, arrived.&nbsp; Gilbert Dolores then invited appellant, Russel Abad, and Totoy to go for a stroll using Totoy's vehicle.&nbsp; They went to Kamuning then to a certain Jerry also in Kamuning and then back to Ermin Garcia at Totoy's place. They left Totoy thereat and the three, Dolores, Abad, and appellant parted ways in front of the house of Russel Abad.&nbsp; Appellant thereafter went home at about 10:30 in the evening and slept straight until 6:00 in the morning of July 23, 1992 (pp. 7 to 16, t.s.n. of September 12, 1994)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant Abad denied the accusations against him and set up the defense of alibi.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Trial Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>Because of several inconsistencies and significant lapses in the testimonies of the four accused, the trial court gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and dismissed those of the defense as totally unbelievable.<br><br>The RTC ruled that the flight of Dolores and Abad right after the incident had been prodded by a guilty conscience.<br><br>It appreciated the qualifiying circumstance of abuse of superior strength and explained as follows: "[Although] Elizabeth did not see who actually stabbed Rommel, the evidence shows some kind of a struggle because Rommel had several bruises in addition to nine (9) major stab wounds, four (4) of which were fatal wounds.&nbsp; All [of these show] that there was employment of grave abuse of superior strength as to render the victim helpless in fighting off his attackers as they ganged up on him."<br><br>Finally, the testimony of the victim's father on the expenses he had incurred in connection with his son's death was given full credit by the trial court, which awarded to the victim's heirs P50,000 as actual damages and P100,000 as moral damages.<br><br>Hence, these appeals by the De Guzman brothers and Abad only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In their respective Briefs, appellants contend that the court <i>a</i> <i>quo </i>erred in finding (1) that conspiracy attended the killing of Rommel Pagui, (2) that abuse of superior strength aggravated the crime, and (3) that the prosecution evidence was sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The appeals have no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">First Issue: <br><i>Conspiracy</i><br></div><br>The trial court correctly ruled that appellants conspired to commit murder.

Alone and unarmed, he tried to run for cover towards the Royal Espiritu compound.&nbsp; But he was overtaken and thus assaulted individually and concertedly by the four accused.&nbsp; The manner in which they attacked him ensured the complete execution of their nefarious deed without incurring any risk to themselves and without affording him any chance to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Even if the attack was frontal, the victim had no time to prepare any defense and was therefore left with no option but to run for his life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Treachery is essentially a swift and an unexpected attack on an unarmed and unsuspecting victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In this case, the victim was deprived of any defense, because of the sudden and unexpected attack by the four accused who, irked by his refusal to serve them more beer, decided to get back at him.<br><br>Third Issue: <i>Credibility and Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</i><br><br>When the issue involved is the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, it is well-settled that findings of trial courts deserve the highest degree of respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Their assessment may be disregarded only if they have committed substantial errors or overlooked determinative facts that would have otherwise dictated a different conclusion or verdict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> We find no cogent reason to depart from this doctrine.<br><br>The evidence supports the findings of the RTC.&nbsp; The three vital eyewitnesses, who had no ill motive to testify against appellants, clearly pointed to them as the culprits.&nbsp; They positively and unequivocally testified that they saw appellants before, during, and immediately after the mauling and the killing of the victim that fateful night.<br><br>Appellants put up the defenses of denial and alibi.&nbsp; Such defenses, however, cannot prevail over the prosecution witnesses' positive testimonies, detailing how appellants collectively and individually perpetrated the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Their alibi cannot prosper, because they failed to prove the physical impossibility of their presence at the scene of the crime around the time of the stabbing incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Undisputed is the fact that they and their co-accused, who were residents of Ermin Garcia Street, drank beer at the <i>sari-sari </i>store that night, contrary to their protestations that they were then at home sleeping.&nbsp; Clearly, in the case at bar, the defense miserably failed to negate their presence at the situs of the crime or its immediate vicinity during its commission.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeals are DENIED and the assailed Decision is <i>AFFIRMED </i>with the modification that the heirs of Rommel Pagui are granted indemnity <i>ex delicto </i>in the sum of P50,000.
