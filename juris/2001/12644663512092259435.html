				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused Joel Bragat y Abaquita was indicted before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 4, of Panabo, Davao, for the crime of robbery with homicide.&nbsp; The information, docketed Criminal Case No. 96-94 in that court, was to the following effect; <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about April 21, 1996, in the Municipality of Kaputian, Province of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to gain, armed with a handgun, and by means of force and intimidation of persons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take and rob cash money in the amount of P200.00 belonging to the spouses Jose Mamac and Lucia Mamac, and on the occasion of the said robbery, the said accused, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one Jose Mamac y Garbo, thereby inflicting upon him wounds which caused his death, and further causing actual, moral and compensatory damage to the heirs of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>The accused, when arraigned, pled "not guilty" to the crime charged; trial thusly ensued.<br><br>The factual antecedents submitted to the trial court by the prosecution were summed up by the Office of the Solicitor General in the People's Brief.<br><br><blockquote>"In the evening of April 21, 1996, prosecution witness Lucia Mamac and her husband, Jose Mamac (herein deceased victim), were alone inside their house situated at Sitio Guadalupe, Barangay San Remigio, Kaputian, Province of Davao (TSN 12 December 1996, p. 6, Testimony of Lucia Mamac).&nbsp; Between the hours of 6:30 and 7:00 o'clock that same evening, Lucia and Jose were in the kitchen on the first floor of the house.&nbsp; Lucia was washing the dishes while Jose was slicing tobacco (pp. 7, 10, 22, <i>id.</i>).&nbsp; All of a sudden, Joel Bragat (herein appellant), who was wearing a black bath robe, entered the house through an open door in the kitchen, and immediately put off the light by stepping on the improvised kerosene lamps (pp. 7, 9, 16, 20, <i>id.</i>).<br><br>"Thereafter, appellant pointed a flashlight on the eyes of Lucia and Jose, and then poked a gun at Jose, and at the same time announced a robbery, saying `way lihok, tulis ni' (`Don't move, this is a robbery') (pp, 9, 10, 20-21, <i>id.</i>).&nbsp; Appellant repeatedly told the couple to lie down on a prone position and demanded money from them.&nbsp; While lying down, Lucia heard her husband Jose who kept on uttering `Help me, Sing.&nbsp; Help me, Sing.'&nbsp; The couple pleaded to appellant, telling him that they did not have any money.&nbsp; But, appellant did not heed their cries, and instead he reiterated his demand of money.&nbsp; Lucia and Jose went to the second floor of the house to get the money kept inside a cabinet.&nbsp; Appellant followed them (pp. 9-11, <i>id.</i>).&nbsp; Lucia took the money worth P200.00 from a cabinet and gave it to appellant. Appellant grudgingly received the money, complaining `Is this the only proceeds of your sale of the copra?' (pp. 11-12, <i>id.</i>).&nbsp; Incidentally, Lucia and Jose Mamac were able to sell their copra in the amount of more or less P10,000.00 [a] few days before the incident, which, apparently, appellant knew about.&nbsp; Appellant again ordered the victims to lie down on the floor.&nbsp; Jose still kept on asking help from his wife.&nbsp; At this juncture, Lucia helped her husband by pulling the bathrobe at the back of appellant in order to separate him from Jose. Then, Lucia heard appellant fire three (3) successive shots at her husband who got hit on the right portion of the abdomen, right arm, and left leg.&nbsp; After the shooting, appellant went down the stairs and left, bringing with him the P200.00 he earlier got from the victims (pp. 12-14, <i>id.</i>).<br><br>"On the other hand, Lucia tried to move her wounded husband, already unconscious and appeared to be dead at that time.&nbsp; She went downstairs to shout for help from their neighbors.&nbsp; Some neighbors came to help but her husband was already dead. So, the neighbors went to the police authorities to report the incident (pp. 14-15, <i>id.</i>).<br><br>"The post-mortem examination conducted on the body of victim Jose Mamac revealed that the immediate cause of his death was cardio-respiratory arrest due to hemorrhage or massive bleeding brought about by the three (3) gunshot wounds (TSN dated 12 February 1997, pp. 7-8, Testimony of Dr. Carlos Flores; Exhibit B, Certificate of Death)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>The accused proffered the defense of denial and <i>alibi</i>; he contended that the evidence given by the prosecution was inadequate to satisfy the required proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>After assessing the evidence submitted to it, the trial court gave a verdict of guilt in its decision of 02 April 1998; the court concluded:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance to the commission thereof, said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and indemnify the next of kin of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, P200.00 as actual damages, and P15,000.00 as attorney's fees, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.&nbsp; No further costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>On 13 April 1998, the trial court issued an order deleting the subsidiary imprisonment imposed in its above sentence in view of paragraph 3 of Article 39<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code; hence:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance to the commission thereof, said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and indemnify the next of kin of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, P200.00 as actual damages and P15,000.00 as attorney's fees. No further costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Assailing his conviction, appellant in the instant appeal would now claim that -<br><br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in giving weight and credence to the testimony of alleged lone eyewitness Lucia Mamac.<br><br>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court<i> a quo</i> erred in finding accused-appellant guilty of the crime charged despite failure of the prosecution to prove positive identification."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Pointed out by appellant were supposed inconsistencies in the eyewitness account of Lucia Mamac.&nbsp; Initially, according to appellant, Lucia claimed that as the malefactor had entered the house, he immediately put off the lamp; on cross-examination, however, she said that before extinguishing the light, the malefactor first focused a flashlight and poked a gun.&nbsp; Lucia's failure to mention the "flashlight" in her direct examination, he averred, was a fatal omission in her testimony.<br><br>The asseveration is hardly persuasive.<br><br>In countless instances, the Court has counseled that minor lapses in the testimony of a witness are to be expected when the person is made to recount in detail a traumatic experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Quite often, the most candid witnesses make mistakes and fall into confused and inconsistent statements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> but, as long as the mass of testimony jibes on material points, slight clashing statements dilute neither their credibility nor the truthfulness of the testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Court sees no cogent reasons to doubt the identification unhesitatingly made by Lucia of the accused.&nbsp; Indeed, the evident effort to mislead her on cross-examination has but provided the prosecution with a rare opportunity to elicit added details for a positive identification.&nbsp; Verily, the most natural reaction of victims of criminal violence would be to strive to see the looks and the faces of the malefactors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The stressful condition of the witness, not infrequently, can even serve to be a catalyst to memory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Lucia could not have erred in identifying Bragat as her husband's killer.&nbsp; No ill-motive is shown that could have urged her to falsely point an accusing finger at the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In <i>People vs. Penillos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court has observed that an illumination produced by kerosene lamps (<i>gasera</i>) is sufficient to permit identification of persons.&nbsp; Where conditions of visibility are favorable, coupled with the fact that the eyewitness does not appear to be biased, the assertion on the identity of the malefactor can very well be accepted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The courts do take judicial notice that people generally know one another quite well in the barrios.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>It was not inapt at all for the court a <i>quo</i> to give this observation -<br><br><blockquote>"x x x Her identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime is unassailable; she knows the accused because he is a co-resident of the same barangay; she knows the accused because she knows even his wife Tessie and the latter's mother is even her `comare;' she knows the accused because 3 to 4 weeks before the incident said accused came to her at her house to ask for herbal medicine (matan-og leaves) to treat his baby; she knows the accused because she saw him, by the light of kerosene lamps, enter her dwelling in the fateful night of April 21, 1996, announce a hold-up, poke a gun, heard him order them to lie down, demand money and to whom she gave P200.00 and not satisfied, demanded for more money and in the course of the hold-up, also saw and hear him fire three gunshots to her husband which caused the latter's death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant broadly assails the findings of fact made by the trial court. It is a vain proposition. Engraved in our jurisprudence is the doctrine that findings of fact of the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal.&nbsp; The matter of assigning values to the declarations given at the stand by a witness is best performed by the trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can gauge such testimony in the light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The narration made by Lucia was straightforward.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Court:</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Who is this Joel Bragat that entered your house?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">He is a long time acquaintance for he is also a resident in our barangay.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Atty.
