				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These are consolidated cases involving a religious corporation whose Board of Directors had expelled certain members thereof on purely spiritual or religious grounds since they refused to follow its teachings and doctrines. The controversy here centers on the legality of the expulsion.<br><br>The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals and as culled from the voluminous records of these cases, may be stated as follows:<br><br>In 1973, a religious group known as&nbsp; "The Church In Quezon City (Church Assembly Hall), Incorporated" ("CHURCH"&nbsp; for brevity), located at 140 Talayan St., Talayan Village, Quezon City,&nbsp; was organized as "an entity of the brotherhood in Christ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>It was registered in the same year with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a non-stock, non-profit religious corporation for the administration of its temporalities or the management of its properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the CHURCH decree that its affairs and operation shall be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of six (6) members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> who shall be members of the CHURCH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>As a&nbsp; "brotherhood in Christ," the CHURCH embraced the&nbsp; "Principles of Faith"&nbsp; that "every member or officer" thereof "shall, without mental reservation, adhere strictly to the doctrine, teaching and faith being observed by the (CHURCH) in proclaiming the Gospel of Christ, to save lost souls, to lead men in worshipping the true God, in accordance with the Holy Bible and to believe:<br><br><blockquote>(a&nbsp; The Old and the New Testaments comprising the Holy Bible as inspired by God;<br><br>(b&nbsp; The Trinity of the God-Head, which is God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.<br><br>(c) That Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of the Living God, conceived by the Virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit, and possessing the nature of both God and man, and who died on the cross to save mankind, was buried, rose again on the third day, has ascended up to heaven, and will come back to reign as King someday.<br><br>(d) That the only way to salvation is solely by trusting on the shed blood of Jesus and the conviction of&nbsp;

Thus, further proceedings were conducted which culminated in the issuance of the Hearing Panel's Omnibus Orders dated October 2, 1995 and January 19, 1996, which were elevated, this time by the herein petitioners (now respondents), to the SEC <i>en banc </i>in a petition for review on certiorari docketed as SEC EB Case No. 484</b>. It was in this latter case that the SEC <i>en banc</i> handed down its assailed order of July 31, 1996 <b>in violation of the law of the case that was earlier laid down with finality in SEC EB Case No. 389</b>.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br><b>"Thusly, the question on the validity of the expulsion of some of the members of the CHURCH was squarely raised and frontally resolved in the decision rendered in SEC EB Case No. 389</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Clearly, the issuance by the SEC <i>en banc</i> of its July 31, 1996 order in<i> </i>SEC EB Case No. 484, which <b>reopened</b> the very same issue of the validity of the expulsion proceedings, <b>completely reversing its final and executory <i>en banc</i> decision of July 11, 1994&nbsp; (SEC EB Case No. 389)</b>, is certainly in gross disregard of the rules and basic legal precept that accord finality to administrative, quasi-judicial and judicial determinations.<br><br>The Court of Appeals is, therefore, correct in voiding the SEC <i>en banc</i> orders dated July 31, 1996 and January 29, 1997 in SEC EB Case No. 484, thereby upholding the expulsion of petitioners and others by the Board of Directors on August 30, 1993.<br><br>In this regard, what we said in <b><i>Fortich vs. Corona, et al</i>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> bears repeating: "The orderly administration of justice requires that the judgments/resolutions of a court or quasi-judicial body <b>must reach a point of finality set by the law, rules and regulations</b>.&nbsp; The noble purpose is to write <i>finis</i> to disputes once and for all.&nbsp; <b>This is a fundamental principle in our justice system</b>, without which there would be no end to litigations.&nbsp; <b>Utmost respect and adherence to this principle must always be maintained by those who wield the power of adjudication.&nbsp; Any act which violates such principle must immediately be struck down."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Let it not be said that the denial of the present petitions, even on this ground alone, is a mere technicality.&nbsp; In the aforecited case of <b><i>Fortich vs. Corona</i></b><i>,</i> we held that once a case had been resolved with finality, vested rights were acquired by the winning party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Consequently, the rule on finality of decisions, orders or resolutions of a judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative body is <b>"not a question of technicality but of substance and merit,"</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the underlying consideration therefor being the protection of the substantive rights of the winning party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In the succinct words of Mr. Justice Artemio V. Panganiban in the case of <b><i>Videogram Regulatory Board vs. Court of Appeals, et al</i></b><b>.,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> "Just as a losing party has the right to file an appeal within the prescribed period, <b>the winning party also has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the resolution of his/her case.''</b><br><br>Be that as it may, we find baseless petitioners' claim that their expulsion was executed without prior notice or due process.<br><br>In the first place, the By-laws of the CHURCH, which the members have expressly adhered to, does not require the Board of Directors to give prior notice to the erring or dissident members in cases of expulsion.&nbsp; This is evident from the procedure for expulsion prescribed in Article VII (paragraph 4) of the By-laws, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>"4.&nbsp; If it is brought to the notice of the Board of Directors that any member has failed to observe any regulations and By-laws of the Institution (CHURCH) or the conduct of any member has been dishonorable or improper or otherwise injurious to the character and interest of the Institution, the Board of Directors may b(y) resolution without assigning any reason therefor expel such member from such Institution and he shall then forfeit his interest, rights and privileges in the Institution." (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>From the above-quoted By-law provision, the only requirements before a member can be expelled or removed from the membership of the CHURCH are: <b>(a)</b> the Board of Directors has been notified that a member has failed to observe any regulations and By-laws of the CHURCH, or the conduct of any member has been dishonorable or improper or otherwise injurious to the character and interest of the CHURCH, and <b>(b)</b> a resolution is passed by the Board expelling the member concerned, without assigning any reason therefor.<br><br>It is thus clear that a member who commits any of the causes for expulsion enumerated in paragraph 4 of Article VII may be expelled by the Board of Directors, through a resolution, without giving that erring member any notice prior to his expulsion.&nbsp; The resolution need not even state the reason for such action.<br><br>The CHURCH By-law provision on expulsion, as phrased, may sound unusual and objectionable to petitioners as there is no requirement of prior notice to be given to an erring member before he can be expelled.&nbsp; But that is how peculiar the nature of a religious corporation is <i>vis-à-vis</i> an ordinary corporation organized for profit.&nbsp; It must be stressed that the basis of the relationship between a religious corporation and its members is the latter's absolute adherence to a <b>common religious or spiritual belief</b>.&nbsp; Once this basis ceases, membership in the religious corporation must also cease.&nbsp; Thus, generally, there is no room for dissension in a religious corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And where, as here, any member of a religious corporation is expelled from the membership for espousing doctrines and teachings contrary to that of his church, the established doctrine in this jurisdiction is that such action from the church authorities is <b>conclusive</b> upon the civil courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far back in 1918, we held in <b>United <i>States vs. Canete</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>"...in matters purely ecclesiastical the decisions of the proper church tribunals are conclusive upon the civil tribunals.&nbsp; A church member who is expelled from the membership by the church authorities, or a priest or minister who is by them deprived of his sacred office, is without remedy in the civil courts, which will not inquire into the correctness of the decisions of the ecclesiastical tribunals."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Obviously recognizing the peculiarity of a religious corporation, the Corporation Code leaves the matter of ecclesiastical discipline to the religious group concerned.<br><br>Section 91 of the Corporation Code, which has been made explicitly applicable&nbsp; to religious corporations by the second paragraph of Section 109 of the same Code, states:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 91.&nbsp; <i>Termination of membership</i>.-&nbsp; Membership shall be terminated in the manner and for the causes provided in the articles of incorporation or the by-laws. Termination of membership shall have the effect of extinguishing all rights of a member in the corporation or in its property, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or the by-laws." (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Moreover, the petitioners really have no reason to bewail the lack of prior notice in the By-laws.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals, they have <b>waived</b> such notice by adhering to those By-laws.&nbsp; They became members of the CHURCH <b>voluntarily.&nbsp; They entered into its covenant and subscribed to its rules.&nbsp; By doing so, they are bound by their consent.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that petitioners' expulsion falls within the Constitutional provisions on "prior notice" or "due process," still we can not conclude that respondents committed a constitutional infraction.&nbsp; It bears emphasis that petitioners were given more than sufficient&nbsp; notice of their impending expulsion, as shown by the records.<br><br>We have narrated earlier the events which led to the questioned expulsion. From the undisputed testimony of Director Anthony Sayheeliam (now respondent), it is clear that, as early as 1988, the respondents-Board of Directors patiently and persistently reminded, advised and exhorted the erring members, including herein petitioners, to stop espousing doctrines, teachings and religious belief diametrically opposed to the Principles of Faith embraced by the CHURCH.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondents-Board of Directors further warned them during Sunday worship gatherings, in small group meetings and one-on-one talk, that they would face disciplinary action and be dropped from the membership roll should they continue to exhibit acts inimical and injurious to the teachings of the Holy Bible which the CHURCH so zealously upholds.<br><br>When they ignored petitioners' exhortations and warnings, the erring members should not now complain about their expulsion from the membership of the CHURCH by the Board of Directors on August 30, 9193.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, whose findings of fact is accorded great respect as the same is conclusive on us, made a precise observation on this matter:<br><br><blockquote>"....the petitioners (now respondents) further state that the Board of Directors, before deciding to purge their list of membership, gave the erring members sufficient warning of their impending ouster.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>`... </i>the records of the instant case indisputably show that the erring members of the corporation, including respondents (now petitioners) Lim Che Boon, Joseph Lim, Tan Hon Joc, Liu Yek See, Felix Almeria and Alfredo Long, were given more than sufficient notice that the perpetration of acts inimical to and inconsistent with the Articles of Faith of the Corporation will be subject to disciplinary authority of the Board of Directors:<br><br>(Testimony of Anthony Sayheeliam, member of the Board of Directors)<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%">Q. </td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">You mentioned that former members of the Corporation were dropped or expelled due to violations of the principles of faith under the Articles of Incorporation and the By-laws, as well as for conduct which was dishonorable, improper and injurious to the character and interest of the corporation.

SP No. 41551, pp. 46-48.<br><br>"We find the stance of the petitioners (now respondents) more persuasive as it is more in accord with Section 91 of the Corporation Code which mandates that membership in a no-stock corporation and, for that matter, in a religious corporation `shall be terminated in the manner and for the causes enumerated in the articles of incorporation or by-laws.'

Acting on the application, this Court required the respondents to comment thereon.&nbsp; In the meantime, it issued a Special Order on December 18, 1998 enjoining the respondents from enforcing the Court of Appeals' decision <b>"insofar as petitioners' rights and privileges as members of the CHURCH are concerned."</b>&nbsp; Accordingly, petitioners were allowed "entry into the CHURCH building of worship and <b>participate in its religious and social activities."</b><br><br>On January 29, 1999, petitioners Lim Che Boon, Tan Hon Koc, Joseph Lim and Liu Yek See filed a petition to cite respondents in contempt for refusing to comply with the Special Order of this Court.&nbsp; This was docketed as G.R.

Thus, respondents assert that they did not violate the Special Order of this Court.<br><br>We agree with the respondents.&nbsp; The Special Order allows petitioners entry into the CHURCH building to "participate in worship or other religious activities" "as members of the CHURCH".&nbsp; Clearly, the Special Order does not allow petitioners unlimited or unrestrained access or use of the premises and properties of the CHURCH.&nbsp; The intended special conference to be conducted by petitioners is not a CHURCH activity and the participants therein are not members of the CHURCH.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present consolidated petitions are DENIED.&nbsp;

This general rule, however, is admittedly subject to certain exceptions, and I submit that the instant case is one such instance.<br><br>In Romero vs. De los Reyes (14 Phil. 115 [1965]), we upheld the general rule that:<br><br><blockquote>The amendment of the constitution, restatement of articles of religion and abandonment of faith or abjuration alleged by appellant, having to do with faith, practice, doctrine, from or worship, ecclesiastical law, custom and rule of a church and <i>having reference to the power of excluding from the church those allegedly unworthy of membership,</i> are unquestionably ecclesiatical matters which are outside the province of civil courts.<br><br>(p.128.)</blockquote><br>But, in <i>Lions Club International vs. Amores</i> (121 SCRA 621 [1983]), we defined certain exceptions to this general rule, holding thus:<br><br><blockquote>... the courts will not interfere with the internal affairs of an unincorporated association so as to settle disputes between the members or questions of policy, discipline or internal government, <i>so long as the government of the society is fairly and honestly administered in conformity with its laws and the laws of the land, and no property or civil rights are invaded.&nbsp; </i>Under such circumstances, the decision of the association is binding and conclusive and is not subject to review or collateral attacks in the courts.<br><br>The general rule of non-interference in the internal affairs of associations is, however, subject to exceptions, but the power of review is extremely limited.&nbsp; Accordingly, <i>the courts have and will exercise the power to interfere in the internal affairs of an association where law and justice so require,</i> <i>and the proceedings of the association are subject to judicial review where there is fraud, oppression, or bad faith, or where the action complained of is capricious, arbitrary, or unjustly discriminatory.&nbsp; </i>Also, the courts will usually entertain jurisdiction to grant relief <i>in case property or civil rights are invaded, </i>although it has also been held that the involvement of property rights does not necessarily authorize judicial intervention, in the absence of arbitrariness, fraud or collusion.&nbsp; Moreover, the courts will intervene where <i>the proceedings in question are violative of the laws of the society, or the law of the land, as by <b>depriving a person of due process of law.</b></i>&nbsp; Similarly, judicial intervention is warranted where there is lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal conducting the proceedings, where the organization exceeds its powers, or where the proceedings are otherwise illegal.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(p.628)</div></blockquote><br>What is in issue in the present consolidated petitions is whether or not the expulsion of some of the members of the religious community called "The Church in Quezon City" (CQC), contravene the laws of the land or are violative of the civil rights of the members thereof.<br><br>I vote in the affirmative.<br><br>As clearly stated in <i>Lions Club International</i>, the general rule of non-interference admits of certain exception:&nbsp; The civil courts can review proceedings undertaken by religious organizations and may interfere, so to speak, with the internal affairs thereof, as law and justice so require, when the acts complained of contravene the basic law of the land and violate the civil rights of its members.&nbsp; More specifically, where there is fraud, oppression, or bad faith, and where the action of the leaders of the organization is capricious, arbitrary, and unjustly discriminatory, the civil courts may exercise judicial power.&nbsp; The courts will likewise exercise jurisdiction to grant relief in case property or civil rights are invaded, although it has also been held that involvement of property rights does not necessarily authorize judicial intervention, in the absence of arbitrariness, fraud, and collusion.&nbsp; Another specific instance when intervention by the courts becomes warranted is when the proceedings in question are violative of either the by-laws of the society itself or the basic law of the land, such as when there is a violation of the fundamental right to due process of law.&nbsp; Similarly, judicial intervention is warranted where there is lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal conducting the proceedings, where the organization exceeds its powers, or where the proceedings are otherwise illegal.<br><br>The factual antecedents of the present case bring it squarely within the exception to the general rule of non-interference or non-intervention. It must be underscored that the issue does not merely involve the right to use the property of CQC in the present case, but more importantly that the expulsion from CQC does constitute a serious emotional deprivation on the part of each of petitioners which, when compared to losses of property or contractual rights, can be far more damaging and prejudicial.&nbsp; Further, the loss of the opportunity to worship in familiar surroundings is a valuable right, which deserves the protection of the law where no constitutional barrier exists (<i>Baugh v. Thomas</i>, 265 A. 2d 675).<br><br>In this regard, I do not think that it would be proper for the Court to dismiss the issue on mere technicalities, ruling that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) erred in re-opening the case which had previously become final and executory.&nbsp; The <i>Perea case </i>had indeed become final and executory but it pertained only to the preliminary remedy sought by petitioners.&nbsp; As correctly pointed out in the majority opinion, the hearing panel conducted further proceedings to decide the permissive counterclaim and third-party complaint incorporated in respondents' supplemental answer, including their prayer for injunctive relief to prevent petitioners from interfering and usurping functions of the Board of Directors.&nbsp; Petitioners filed motions to dismiss/strike out the counterclaim and third-party complaint.&nbsp; These motions were denied by the hearing panel in an Omnibus Order date October 2, 1995.<br><br>The motions for reconsideration of both parties were subsequently denied. Thereafter, respondents (not petitioners), filed a petition for review with the SEC <i>En Banc</i> which was docketed therein as SEC EB Case No. 484.&nbsp; This certiorari proceeding where the SEC <i>En Banc</i> issued the Order dated July 31, 1996 gave rise to the instant review.&nbsp; In other words, respondents were the ones who invoked the certiorari powers of the SEC <i>En Banc </i>which took cognizance of the issue if the propriety of the expulsion of the complaining members of the CQC. It would not be fair for respondents to now turn around and say that the SEC is guilty of gross disregard of the rules and basic legal precepts that accord finality to administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial determination, or <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br>It is, thus, essential for us to determine whether respondents complied with the requirements of CQC's By-Laws before they expelled petitioners. The applicable provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>4.

American Society of Travel Agents, Inc, 28 Misc 2d 291, 211 NY S2d 655 cited in Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporation, Vol. 12 A, 803, 810).&nbsp; This is in accord with the principles established in Article 19 of the Civil Code, enjoining every person to act with justice, to give every one his due, and to observe honesty and good faith.<br><br>As specifically applied to religious organizations, we have ruled in <i>United States vs. Cañete</i> (38 Phil. 253 [1918]):<br><br><blockquote>... Thus the general cause of public morality which under lies all good government, an which every good citizen, be he priest or layman, is bound to promote, is affected by the fidelity with which ministers of the gospel discharge the high trust of their appointment. In order to be successful public teachers of morality, they must be unspotted public exemplars of it. Hence, if it be suspected that a wolf in sheep's clothing has invaded their rank, and sits at their counsel board, it is not only for the interest of all the members of the association to know the fact, but it is their imperative duty to make inquiry and ascertain the fact. They owe such duty to the plaintiff as a brother member, if he is charged with scandalous conduct, to the end that his innocence may be established.&nbsp; They owe it to themselves, lest by indifference they give apparent approval to his conduct.&nbsp; Their intimate official relation to the plaintiff in the cause of their common work leaves them no alternative; and if, in making such inquiry and in acting upon the subject matter of it, they proceed with honesty of purpose and act from a sense of duty, the law protects them.<br><br>(p. 263.)</blockquote><br>It is a matter of public policy that the charges against the members of the CQC be investigated with a specific obligation to the member that he be given an opportunity to establish his innocence.&nbsp; And this can only be done if he is given "a chance to be heard."&nbsp; The due process clause of the Constitution requires notice and opportunity to be heard before any person can lawfully be deprived of his rights.<br><br>In addition to the foregoing, I also believe that the resolution of respondents approving the August 30, 1993 list of membership in the Church is void. Respondents failed to comply with Section 53 of the Corporation Code that requires that notices of meetings of the board of directors should be given at least one day prior to the meeting. Respondents failed to establish that petitioners Lim Che Boon and Tan Hon Koc were duly notified of the meeting of the Board of Directors during which the August 30, 1993 list of members was adopted.&nbsp; There was no "duly assembled" quorum at the time the resolution was discussed and voted upon as required under Article IV, Paragraph E of the CQC's By-Laws.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I believe that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing petitioners' petition in SEC Case No. 02-95-49949.&nbsp; The exclusion of petitioners being null and void, their standing as <i>bona fide </i>members of the CQC continues.&nbsp; Thus, the election among the majority of the members of the CQC, including petitioners herein who are deemed not to have been excluded therefrom, conducted on June 20, 1994 was in accordance with the By-Laws and should be considered valid, together with all other acts emanating therefrom.&nbsp; The list of members indicated in the Church's Membership Book (Annex Q in G.R. No. 134963-64) should be the complete list of the membership of the CQC.<br><br>It is unrebutted that respondents' group comprises merely the minority in the CQC.&nbsp; The meeting called by private respondents on February 12, 1995, which excluded petitioners' group, was not valid considering that it was called by a person who is not a member of the CQC or a director thereof.&nbsp; The acts then of respondents as a result of their meeting are void as they were conducted without notice to or in the absence of the other members of the CQC. The members of the Board, duly elected by the majority as determined from the Membership Book are deemed valid.<br><br>Finally, the charges between the parties that the other has diverted from the faith and principles of their organization are purely ecclesiastical matters and the Court should refrain from ruling thereon.&nbsp; It may be noted, however, that it is undisputed that the CQC was founded by Witness Lee.&nbsp; It is thus a matter to be resolved by the members of the institution whether those who continue to look at Witness Lee should be deemed to have diverted from their faith (as claimed by respondents), or it is respondents who have diverted their faith by their denial of the role of Witness Lee in the CQC (as claimed by petitioners).<br><br>Under the foregoing premises, I, therefore, register my dissent and vote to grant the petition for certiorari.&nbsp; The decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 29, 1998 in C.A. G.R. SP No. 31551 and 43389, and their Resolution dated August 18, 1998, which denied petitioners Almeri's and Long's motion for reconsideration, should be REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the Order of the SEC dated July 31, 1996, be REINSTATED.<br></div>
