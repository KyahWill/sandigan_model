				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For automatic review is the September 30, 1997 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 128, of Caloocan City, rendered in Crim. Case No. C-51046, convicting accused-appellant Alfredo Alvero y Tarado of the rape of a four-year old child and imposing upon him the death penalty.<br><br>In an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 14, 1996, appellant was charged, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 7th day of October, 1996, in Area D, Camarin, Novaliches, Caloocan City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused ALFREDO ALVERO y TARADO with lewd designs, and by means of threat or violence, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, lie and succeeded in having sexual intercourse with minor Ameerah Abu-Hanieh, a four-year old child.</blockquote><br>On November 6, 1996, accused-appellant was arraigned and, through the assistance of his counsel de oficio, Atty. Ojer Pacis of the Public Attorneys Office, entered a plea of "not guilty." Trial on the merits thereafter ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented three witnesses: the four-year-old victim Ameerah Abu-Hanieh, her mother Josephine and Dr. Aurea Villena, medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Their testimonies are summarized by the Solicitor General in the Appellee's Brief, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><blockquote>At around 1:00 p.m. of October 7, 1996, 4 year old Ameerah Abu-Hamieh was lying on her bed when appellant, a houseboy in the Abu Hamieh household, barged into her room. Appellant then kissed Ameerah and forced his penis into her vagina (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, pp. 5 and 9; TSN, Feb. 4, 1997, p. 3).<br><br>Ameerah's private parts subsequently bled, which prompted appellant to wash it with water. Moments after the rape, the victim's aunt Evy arrived to replace appellant in taking care of Ameerah and the other children, causing appellant to suddenly leave (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, pp. 9-10).<br><br>After two (2) days, or on October 9, 1996, Ameerah confided to her mother Josephine Abu-Hamieh about the incident. The latter was naturally shocked by such revelation. She promptly brought Ameerah to the NBI the following morning for medical examination (TSN, Feb. 4, 1997, pp. 5-6).<br><br>Dr. Aurea Villena of the NBI Medico Legal Division, after conducting a genital examination on Ameerah, found a hymenal laceration on the victim's genitals, which is normally caused by sexual intercourse (TSN, Jan. 29, 1997, p. 4).</blockquote><br><br>On the other hand, according to the sole defense witness, appellant Alvero himself, the pertinent facts are the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><blockquote>ALFREDO ALVERO accused in the case at bar testified that on October 7, 1996 while he was at the store of the Abu-Hanieh's, he was fetched by Mrs. Abu-Hanieh and brought to their house. She (Mrs. Abu-Hanieh) requested the accused to take care of the children while she is attending to some important matters. After Mrs. Abu-Hanieh left, he watched television while the three (3) children of Mrs. Abu-Hanieh (Ameerah, Aizor and Amir) were sleeping in their room. After a while, Ameerah came out of her room and told him she wanted to urinate. He led her outside the house and after Ameerah was able to relieve herself, he washed her vagina with water then carried her back to her room and he resumed watching television.&nbsp; He left the house when Ameerah's aunt, Tita Evy, came to take his place.</blockquote><br><br>After both parties rested their case, the court a quo convicted appellant as charged. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the accused Alfredo Alvero y Tarado is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and the penalty of DEATH is hereby imposed upon him and to pay the amount of P50,000.00 to the victim as for moral damages.<br><br>Let the entire records of this case be elevated to the Supreme Court for review.</blockquote><br><br>In convicting accused-appellant, the trial judge explained:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In statutory rape cases where the victim is below 12 years old, the circumstances of force, intimidation or that the victim was deprived of reason or was rendered unconscious need not be proven. Proof that sexual intercourse had indeed taken place is sufficient to convict.&nbsp; There are three vital witnesses for the prosecution: First, the testimony of the victim herself Ameera, who unequivocally stated in the witness stand that the accused inserted his penis into her vagina (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, p. 9); second, the testimony of the Medico-legal Officer that there was hymenal laceration on the vagina of the victim which is normally caused by sexual intercourse (TSN, Jan. 29, 1997, p. 6); and last, the testimony of the mother of Ameerah the victim of what her daughter confided to her of the rape committed by the accused against her (TSN, Feb. 4, 1997, pp. 5 &amp; 6).<br><br>Furthermore, the Court noted how the victim demonstrated on the witness stand how she was raped by the accused with the use of two dolls, one representing male and the other female and then putting the male doll on top of the female doll and demonstrating by a pumping motion with the&nbsp; aid of the dolls (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, p. 11).<br><br>To this Court, the foregoing testimonial and illustrative evidence constitute proof that coitus had indeed taken place between the accused and victim Ameerah. The victim who is such a tender age and absent any evidence that she was coached as there was no evidence to show she was taught or induced to say that she was raped when in fact she was not, for her to fabricate the facts of rape thus charging the accused falsely of the crime of rape is to the mind of the Court certainly beyond her mental capacity. To invent the idea of charging the accused for the crime of rape is simply beyond the mental capacity of this child who was only 4-years old if she was not a victim of the lustful act of rape committed against her.&nbsp; At this point, it is stressed, that the narration of how the rape was committed was delivered by the victim in a straight forward manner. She did not hesitate in her answers to preposterous questions propounded by the defense counsel. The Court debunks the insinuation by the defense of the possibility of coaching by the mother of the victim. The Court believes that no mother of sound mind would expose her child to the possibility of public ridicule and trauma of such a demeaning experience that she will live with throughout her life.</blockquote><br>In his Brief, accused-appellant assigns a single error in the RTC Decision, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote><br>In reviewing trial court convictions for rape, this Court has generally been guided by the following principles: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility and while it is difficult to prove, it is more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Guided by these principles, we examined closely the evidence for the prosecution. The principal complainant is an innocent four-year-old child, Ameerah. She described her ordeal in a clear, straightforward and categorical manner, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Ameera[h], do you know Jonjon Alvero y Tarado? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">If you will see him again in this Court room, will you be able to identify him?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Will you point to this Honorable Court Jonjon Alvero?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Witness</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.

Without being substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, his defense deserves no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value than the testimony of Ameerah, whom we find to be a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In any event, appellant failed to satisfactorily rebut or discredit the prosecution evidence.<br><br>Based on the foregoing discussion, the Court finds no reason to overturn the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. As a general rule, the trial judge's evaluation of the witnesses is binding upon the appellate court. Judges, having the advantage of directly observing the witnesses' demeanor and manner of testifying, can be expected to have determined reasonably whose testimony to accept and which witness to disbelieve. Thus, as long as there is no showing that their assessment was made arbitrarily, or that they overlooked or misinterpreted certain significant facts which, if considered, could materially affect the result of the case, their factual findings should not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the instant case, we find no reason to deviate from these principles.<br><br>Under Article 335<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the penalty of death shall be imposed when the rape victim is a child below seven.&nbsp; Ameerah's mother positively declared in court that her child was only four years old when the appellant defiled her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> To substantiate her testimony, she submitted to the court Ameerah's birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> showing that she was born on March 23, 1992.<br><br>In order to avoid the supreme penalty, the appellant claimed that he was only seventeen (17) years old during the alleged incident.&nbsp; He, however, failed to show any proof to corroborate his bare statement.&nbsp; Instead, he even unwittingly admitted that he has a voter's <b>ID </b>and has been able to vote in the past.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Under the law, however, only citizens aged eighteen (18) years or more are qualified to vote.&nbsp; Significantly, in his Appeal Brief, appellant no longer pursued the defense of minority in his attempt to evade death.<br><br>Being a single indivisible penalty, death is mandatorily imposed in the light of Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, regardless of the attendance of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Court notes that the assailed Decision, while granting moral damages, failed to award civil indemnity to the private complainant. It is now well settled that moral damages is separate and distinct from indemnity ex delicto, which is in the nature of actual or compensatory damages automatically awarded to rape victims. While the award of moral damages is discretionary on the part of the court, the imposition of civil indemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Indemnification is in the amount of 75.000.00, if the rape is qualified by any of the circumstances under which the death penalty is imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Hence, in addition to the P50,000.00 moral damages, Appellant Alvero should pay his victim P75,000.00 by way of civil indemnity.<br><br>Four (4) Justices of the Court however continue to maintain the unconstitutionality of R.A. No. 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 128, of Caloocan City is hereby AFFIRMED.&nbsp; In addition, the appellant is ORDRED to pay the victim indemnity ex delicto in the amount of P75,000.00, consistent with current jurisprudence.<br><br>In accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this Decision, let the records of the case be forwarded to Her Excellency, the President, for the possible exercise of her pardoning power.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., CJ., Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes , Ynares-Santaigo, De Leon, Jr.,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Bellosillo, Melo,</i> and <i>Kapunan, JJ., </i>on leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 12-15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Brief for the Appellee, pp. 3-4; <i>rollo</i>, pp. 102-103.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Brief for the Accused-Appellant, pp. 4-5; <i>rollo</i>, pp. 35-36.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Assailed Decision, pp. 2-3; <i>rollo</i>, pp. 84-85.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 32.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> People <i>v</i>.
