				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At about 10:00 p.m. of May 22, 1994, Antonio Altarejos and his girlfriend Antonia Eluzon with a few other friends were having a drinking spree beside the chapel along Laura Calderon St., Purok 2, Barangay Old Balara, Quezon City. Antonio and Antonia noticed the van of their neighbor Alejandro Patungan parked in front of the chapel and saw two men seated inside, one is the accused Elmerto Pulga at the driver's seat and the other is the accused Edgar Acebuche.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Sometime that evening<i> </i>Elmerto Pulga drove the van away from the chapel and towards a vacant<b> </b>lot near Commonwealth Avenue to allow another car to park right in front of the chapel. After the drinking spree, at about 3:00 to 3:30 a.m., the following morning, the lovers Antonio and Antonia went to the basketball court to talk. Moments later they saw Alejandro Patungan and his wife Marietta come out of their house and walk toward the road. Marietta however, went back to their house while Alejandro proceeded without her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>At about 3:45 p.m. of May 24, 1994, the decomposing body of Alejandro Patungan was found inside his van parked along Don Quixote St. Sampaloc, Manila. At 7:00 p.m. that day the cadaver was autopsied at the WPD-PNP Medico-Legal Section. The report states as follows:<br><blockquote>"The body was bloated and in the state of decomposition. The face was dark colored, eyeballs, bulging, tongue half protruding and thick upper and lower lips.

Pedro Rudio, who allegedly assisted the accused Elmerto Pulga during the custodial investigation and of the medico-legal officer who conducted the autopsy. The extra-judicial confession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of accused Elmerto Pulga dated August 11, 1994 linked Marietta to the killing of her husband.

Thus, witness stated that she saw the two eating together from the same plate and that she caught them holding hands. One time she saw Jun kiss Marietta. Her brother allegedly found out about the affair and dismissed Jun from work but he forgave Marietta for the sake of their children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The mother of the victim testified to establish the amount of funeral expenses incurred at P80,000.00, which amount the defense admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>For the defense, accused Marietta Patungan admitted in court that she was with her husband at early dawn of May 23, 1994 and were on their way to buy flowers for their flower shop but she went back to their house to get a betamax tape and that her husband proceeded without her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On August 9, 1994 she was invited by the police for questioning and that she was in fact questioned about her complicity in her husband's death at the police station without the assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The other accused Edgar Acebuche denied participation in the murder of the victim and stated that sometime on August 8, 1994 he went to his cousin Marietta's flower shop in Cubao to look for a job when the police mistook him for Jun Acebuche and arrested him. He was also subjected to custodial investigation without the assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In court, accused Elmerto Pulga repudiated his extra-judicial confession and stated that he was coerced by the police to admit participation in the murder of Alejandro Patungan and to implicate his sister Marietta as mastermind and cousin Edgar as co-conspirator. He narrated that he was arrested at around 9 a.m., August 9, 1994 and that he was detained and tortured by electrocution by the police until the following day, August 10, 1994, when he agreed to sign a prepared document. On August 11, 1994 he was brought to the IBP office where he met Atty. Rudio who signed the prepared extra-judicial confession as counsel for the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> A motion to withdraw the plea of "not guilty" to the offense charged to a plea of "guilty" to a lesser offense i.e., homicide, was filed by counsel for the accused. The trial court denied the motion and treated it instead as a motion to recall the accused Elmerto Pulga for further testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On recall, accused Elmerto Pulga, admitted stabbing the deceased three times until he fell unconscious, after which he lost control of himself and stabbed the victim some more. He found a rope and pulled the victim by the neck to the back of the van. He stated that he alone was responsible for the death of his brother-in-law.<br><br>The trial court upheld the validity of the extra-judicial confession and rendered judgment convicting the three accused guilty of the crime charged. The March 16, 1999 decision of the trial court reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court renders judgment finding all accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime as charged, that is PARRICIDE for MARIETTA PATUNGAN and MURDER for accused ELMERTO PULGA and EDGAR ACEBUCHE, defined and penalized in Article 146 and Article 248, respectively, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, with the attendant circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation alleged in the Information, sentencing them therefor to death, and ordering them to pay jointly and severally to the heirs of Alejandro Patungan the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as indemnity for death, Eighty Thousand (P80,000.00) Pesos as actual damages, and P50,000.00 as moral damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>The case is before us on automatic review.<br><br>Counsel for the appellants assigns as error the trial court's appreciation of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and its finding in favor of the validity of the extra-judicial confession executed by Elmerto Pulga.<br><br>The Medico-legal officer who conducted the autopsy on the victim at 7:00 p.m. of May 24, 1994 stated that considering the advanced stage of decomposition of the cadaver the victim must have been dead for thirty-six hours. Based on such findings it is submitted by the appellants that witnesses Antonio and Antonia could not have seen the deceased at 3:30 a.m. of May 23, 1994. The medical findings as to the approximate time of death and the injuries sustained by the victim are in accord with the testimony of Elmerto Pulga who admitted that he killed the victim at around 10:00 p.m. of May 22, 1994 and that he stabbed him thrice while he was seated at the driver's seat. In assailing the validity of the extra-judicial confession, the appellants contend that the trial court failed to appreciate the underlying admissions in the testimonies of SPO3 Villacorte and Atty. Rudio that the accused Pulga was in fact denied the assistance of counsel during custodial investigation. The appellants pray for the acquittal of accused Marietta Patungan and Edgar Acebuche and the conviction of accused Elmerto Pulga for the lesser offense of homicide.<br><br>The Solicitor-General filed appellee's brief praying for the affirmance of the decision of the trial court. It is maintained that the exact time of death of the victim is immaterial in view of the extra-judicial confession of Elmerto Pulga which dovetails with the findings in the autopsy report. What the appellee considers material is the timing when Marietta lured her husband into the van where the two co-conspirators were waiting to execute their murderous scheme. Appellee maintains that Elmerto Pulga's belated repudiation of his extra-judicial confession, his failure to present any evidence to support his claim of torture in the hands of his investigators and his apparent unwillingness to file any administrative charge against them militates against his claim that his extra-judicial confession was obtained through violence. The appellee asserts that confessions are presumed valid unless proven to have been obtained through violence, intimidation, threat or reward and that in view of the appellants' failure to prove any of the aforementioned circumstances that vitiate consent, the trial court did not err in upholding the validity of Pulga's extra-judicial confession.<br><br>Considering the totality of the evidence, it appears that the principal evidence presented by the prosecution to establish the alleged conspiracy among the appellants to commit murder is the extra-judicial confession of accused Elmerto Pulga. The rest of the evidence presented is at most circumstantial to establish motive and the presence of the appellants at or near the place of the commission of the crime.<br><br>Section 12 (1), Article III of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 12(1) Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">(1)</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">No torture, force violence threat, intimidation or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used against him.

The assistance of counsel must be independent and competent that is, providing full protection to the constitutional rights of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A lawyer who simply goes through the motion of reciting the rights of the accused, or acts as a witness to a pre-prepared document containing the extra-judicial confession of the accused or holds an interest contrary to that of the accused does not qualify as independent and competent counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>To establish the validity of Pulga's extra-judicial confession, the police investigator PO3 Jovencio Villacorte testified that appellant Pulga voluntarily surrendered to the police and told them the whole story of how his younger sister appellant Marietta Patungan masterminded the murder of her husband to be able to marry her lover, and how he and his cousin appellant Edgar Acebuche accomplished Marietta's bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Atty. Pedro Rudio of the IBP, Quezon City Chapter, who supposedly assisted Pulga during the taking of the extra-judicial confession, testified that Pulga expressed his consent to be assisted by said counsel and signified that his confession is voluntary. Atty. Rudio stated that he even raised Pulga's shirt to check if he had been subjected to physical violence and found none.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>However, a closer examination of the transcript of stenographic notes regarding Pulga's extra-judicial confession is rather disturbing.

Villacorte himself admitted that Pulga at first did not want to confess and pointed to another suspect as the perpetrator of the crime. This statement negates the police's claim of voluntary surrender and places in serious doubt the voluntariness of Pulga's extra-judicial confession.<br><br>Pulga testified that he was arrested on August 9, 1994. He narrated in court that during custodial investigation he was blindfolded with hands tied behind him and was electrocuted by the police investigators while he was either sitting on a steel bar or had a piece of wet cloth placed on his feet, to compel him to admit commission of the crime charged. He simply cried and could not do anything else but to accede to his tormentors' demand. He stated that he signed a pre-prepared document at the precinct before he was taken to the IBP office near the Sulo Restaurant in Quezon City on August 11, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He explained that he narrated his ordeal only for the first time in court because he could not complain to the IBP lawyer, the fiscal nor to the medical officer out of fear of his police investigators and when he was taken to a medical officer for examination, the police escort answered the questions for him. None of his relatives visited him in jail and he only saw his lawyer in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Until he was brought to court he had no one to confide to and he was at the mercy of the police investigators while he was detained at the Quezon City Jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As a detention prisoner he was always escorted by the police when he was before the IBP lawyer, the fiscal and the medical officer and Pulga did not find the opportunity to complain to the authorities. To our mind, appellant Pulga's fear of his police escorts is well founded and his delay in revealing what he underwent during custodial investigation does not cast doubt on its veracity, as the prosecution suggests.<br><br>We also note from the above testimonies that it was only after appellant Pulga verbally confessed at the police precinct, without the assistance of counsel, when he was brought to the IBP office allegedly for the actual transcription of his confession in writing in the presence of a lawyer. It would appear to us that whatever statement Pulga allegedly gave to the police for transcription in the presence of counsel is the product of two and a half days of coercive and uncounselled custodial investigation. We are inclined to believe that when he was brought to the IBP office his body and his will were in no position to raise any objection much less to complain to the IBP lawyer about what he has gone through. The situation was not at all alleviated by the counsel who was supposed to assist Pulga at the taking of the extra-judicial confession. Said lawyer admitted that he was working on an appeal in another case two to three meters away from the police investigator who was then taking Pulga's statement. He stated that he was "not totally concentrated on the appealed case because he could still hear the investigation being conducted then."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Villacorte testified that while he was taking Pulga's statement the IBP lawyer was working on something else using two other tables four meters apart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The mere presence of a lawyer is not sufficient compliance with the constitutional requirement of assistance of counsel. Assistance of counsel must be effective, vigilant and independent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> A counsel who could just hear the investigation going on while working on another case hardly satisfies the minimum requirements of effective assistance of counsel. Not only was Pulga subjected to custodial investigation without counsel, he was likewise denied effective assistance of counsel during the actual taking of his extra-judicial confession.<br><br>For the reasons above stated, We find that the extra-judicial confession of appellant Elmerto Pulga is inadmissible in evidence for having been obtained without effective assistance of counsel.<br><br>The other pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution fail to establish the charge of conspiracy among the appellants to murder the deceased. The prosecution relied heavily on Pulga's extra-judicial confession but the rest of the evidence presented fail to satisfy the required quantum of proof to establish conspiracy. The prosecution evidence simply establishes the presence of Pulga and Acebuche near or at the place where the victim was last seen alive. It is observed that Antonio and Antonia allegedly saw Pulga and Acebuche inside the van at around 10:00 p.m. and that the victim was last seen with Marietta at around 3:30 a.m. the following morning. There is no proof that Pulga and Acebuche were still inside the van at 3:30 a.m. and the only circumstance that might indicate that Marietta may have lured her husband to go inside the van to enable Pulga and Acebuche to kill him that morning was her alleged motive to get rid of her husband to marry her lover. It is on record that Marietta and her husband run a flower shop and it is not uncommon, much less suspicious, for them to buy flowers before dawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The estimated time of death of the victim is nothing but such, an estimate. Due to the advanced stage of decomposition of the body of the victim when it was autopsied at around 7:00 p.m. of May 24, 1994, the medico-legal officer who conducted the autopsy testified that the victim must have been dead for about thirty-six hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In an apparent attempt to show Marietta's implied admission of guilt, the prosecution presented one of the police officers who "invited" the appellants for questioning who testified that appellant Marietta tried to commit suicide after the investigation, i.e., that Marietta stabbed herself with a Batangas knife in the bathroom at the police precinct when she found out that her brother Elmerto pointed to her as the mastermind of the murder of her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, no medical record was presented to substantiate this testimony and we note that the police officer did not testify that he saw Marietta stab herself. Marietta denied that she tried to commit suicide and testified that she woke up in the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Whether or not she stabbed herself is not proven by the prosecution and can by no means be considered as an implied admission of guilt of appellant Marietta. We may add that even if she did attempt to commit suicide a female suspect under custodial investigation in a police-dominated atmosphere and without the assistance of counsel, Marietta cannot be expected to act rationally.<br><br>The evidence as it stands, without the extra-judicial confession of appellant Pulga, is not sufficient to support conviction for parricide against appellant Marietta nor for murder against appellant Acebuche. For this reason we are constrained to acquit them of the crimes charged.<br><br>Only the judicial admission of Elmerto Pulga remains on record for consideration of the court.

Pulga's statement that he was seated at the driver's seat while the victim sat at the passenger's seat which means that Pulga was at the left side of the victim also coincides with the medical finding which states that the stab wounds, except those on the victim's abdomen, were all on the left side of the body of the victim. The prosecution tried to establish the impossibility of Pulga pulling the victim by himself to the back of the van but no competent evidence was presented to prove the theory. The autopsy report reveals that the victim was 63 inches tall<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and Pulga testified that he stands 5 feet 4 inches tall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The alleged impossibility was not proven by the prosecution with moral certainty. At any rate, we hold that there is no other evidence on record to show that Pulga was not alone in the commission of the crime.<br><br>Pulga's admission can be sustained but he cannot be convicted for murder in the absence of proof of any of the qualifying circumstances alleged in the information, i.e., treachery and evident premeditation. The number of stab wounds sustained by the victim, fifty-one in the abdomen and three in the upper part of his body, by itself is not aggravating unless it was shown, and it was not herein shown, to have been intentionally inflicted to add suffering to the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> On the contrary, Pulga testified that he countlessly stabbed the victim after he fell unconscious. Accordingly, Pulga is hereby convicted of homicide and to suffer the penalty of reclusion temporal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the said penalty is to be imposed in its medium period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months.<br><br>This court is not blind to the suffering of the victim's family arising from his untimely death, but we are bound to uphold the constitutional rights of the accused. Let this be a stern lesson to the police authorities and to the prosecution to perform their sworn tasks with utmost regard to the mandates of the Constitution. Criminals cannot be apprehended, prosecuted and punished under the law by resorting to non-legal means.<br><br>WHEREFORE, appellants Marietta Patungan and Edgar Acebuche are acquitted of the crimes charged against them and the judgment of conviction rendered by the trial court is hereby reversed and set aside. The judgment of conviction for murder against appellant Elmerto Pulga is hereby likewise set aside and a new one entered convicting him of the crime of homicide, and imposing the indeterminate penalty of 10 years of prision mayor in its medium period, as minimum to 17 years and 4 months of reclusion temporal in its medium period, as maximum. This Court affirms the pecuniary awards given by the trial court and orders the appellant Pulga to pay the heirs of the victim the sum of P50,000.00 as indemnity for death, P80,000.00 for actual damages and P50,000.00 for moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr.,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Eluzon, tsn., pp. 22-26, October 10, 1994; Altarejos, tsn., pp. 5-10, October 11, 1994.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Eluzon, ibid., pp. 31-34; Altarejos, ibid., pp. 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit "E", p. 7, Folder of Exhibits; Dr. Lagonera, tsn., pp. 3-6, October 10, 1994.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Rollo, p. 53.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rollo, p. 23-24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Folder of Exhibits, p. 4, marked as "Exh. 1".<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Folder of Exhibits, pp. 3-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Tsn., November 14, 1994, pp. 13-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Tsn., September 26, 1994, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Tsn., October 7, 1996, p. 28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., pp. 34-38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Tsn., October 13, 1997, p. 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Tsn., July 17, 1995, pp. 10-17; March 18, 1996, pp. 7-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Tsn., November 4, 1997, p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Rollo, p. 53.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> People vs. Calvo, Jr., 269 SCRA 676.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> People vs. Dela Cruz, 279 SCRA 245.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> People vs. Andal, 279 SCRA 474.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> People vs. Januario, 267 SCRA 608.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> People vs. Binamira, 277 SCRA 232; People vs. Dela Cruz, <i>supra</i>.,; People vs. Espanola, 271, SCRA 689.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Tsn., October 3, 1994, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Tsn., September 27, 1994, pp. 7-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Tsn., October 3, 1994, pp. 22-27.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Tsn., September 26, 1994, pp. 5-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Tsn., March 18, 1996, pp. 9-10; October 7, 1996, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Tsn, August 1, 1995, pp. 4-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Appellant Pulga was later transferred to MMRC in Bicutan, p. 81, OR.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Tsn., September 27, 1994, pp. 8, 49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Tsn, October 3, 1994, pp. 49-50.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> People vs. Sahagun, June 19, 1997.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Tsn., October 17, 1994, pp. 7-8; November 14, 1994, p. 7; October 7, 1996, pp. 26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Tsn., October, 10, 1994, p.11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Tsn., September 26, 1994, pp. 5-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Tsn., October 7, 1996, pp. 39-40.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Tsn., December 15, 1997, pp. 9-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Tsn., January 12, 1998, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Folder of Exhibits, p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Tsn., January 12, 1998, p. 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Reyes, Revised Penal Code, Book I, pp. 456-457, 1998 ed.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Art. 248, RPC.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Art. 64, (1), RPC.</div>
