				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">To justify the imposition of the capital punishment on a father accused of raping his own minor daughter, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt, not only that he committed the heinous act, but also that the victim was indeed below eighteen years of age when the dastardly deed took place.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>For automatic review by this Court is the Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated June 4, 1998, promulgated by the Regional Trial Court of Ligao, Albay, Branch 13. The Decision found Dionisio Bataller <i>y </i>Vargas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of twice raping his 17-year-old daughter, acts for which the supreme penalty of death was meted out to him twice also. The decretal portion of the Decision is worded as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration and finding the accused Dionisio Bataller y Vargas guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of the crime of rape against his 17-year old daughter, Precila B. Bataller, the Court hereby:<br><br>"(a) In Criminal Case No. 3577 sentences said accused to suffer the penalty of DEATH; and<br><br>"(b) In Criminal Case No. 3578 sentences said accused to suffer the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>"The accused is ordered to inde[m]nify the offended party [in] the amount of P100,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>"In compliance with the existing constitutional provision the records of these cases together with all the exhibits and stenographic notes are hereby ordered immediately elevated to the Honorable Supreme Court for automatic review.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>On the basis of a Complaint subscribed to by his daughter Precila Bataller, appellant was charged before the court <i>a quo</i> with two (2) counts of rape in two separate Informations (Criminal Case Nos. 3577 and 3578)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> both dated June 25, 1997. Except as to the date of the commission of the crimes, both Informations are similarly worded as follows:<br><blockquote>"That at or about 12:00 o'clock midnight of March 2, 1997 at Sta. Ana Street, Barangay Tinago, Municipality of Ligao, Province of Albay, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, and with grave abuse of his parental authority, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously ha[ve] sexual intercourse with his daughter, Precila B.

She was single, an out of school youth and a resident of Sta. Ana, Tinago, Ligao[,] Albay. Her highest educational attainment then was Grade IV. She did not know the date [on which] she was born or the number of months in a year. She did not also know the age of her brother Freddie.<br><br>"On March 1, 1997, at about 12:00 o'clock in the evening, Precila Bataller was in their house sleeping together with her brothers Benedict and Jomar and sister Miche[l]le. Their bedroom was about 2½ meters in width and 7 meters in length. Their sleeping arrangement that night starting from her was as follows: Benedict to her right and to her left was Michel[l]e followed by Jomar. Her mother and her eldest brother Freddie were then in Manila. Appellant slept in the balcony, four (4) meters away from their room.<br><br>"On said date and time, while they were sleeping, appellant [turned] off the light in their bedroom. Appellant then went up to their bedroom, ordered her to remove her clothes. Appellant also removed his clothes and then [lay] on top of her. He inserted his organ [into] her private part and had carnal knowledge [of] her. She felt pain. She cried but she did not shout or do anything because appellant threatened to kill them all. After[wards], appellant went to the toilet to urinate. She then put on her clothes.<br><br>"The following day, March 2, 1997, at about 12:00 o'clock in the evening, the same thing happened. After [turning] off the light, appellant went to their bedroom. He ordered her to undress. Appellant also removed his clothes. After undressing, appellant had carnal knowledge [of] her. It was also painful. She cried but she did not shout because appellant threatened to kill them. After having carnal knowledge [of] her, appellant went to the comfort room. She put on her clothes and cried.<br><br>"She revealed what happened to her Tia Glo who then informed her Tia Azon.<br><br>"Her Tia Azon accompanied her to the police station where she prepared her criminal complaint. After going to the police station, they went to a doctor for medical examination.<br><br>"Jomar Bataller, the nine (9) year old son of the appellant and a Grade II pupil corroborated his sister's story that at about midnight of March 1, 1997, he was suffering from asthma when his father [turned] off the light. His mother and elder brother were in Manila. Aside from him, the members of the family who were left at home were the appellant, his Ate Precila, Benedict and Michele.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After [turning] off the light, appellant removed his clothes. He told x x x Precila to undress too. After[wards], appellant had carnal knowledge [of] her x x x. [Jomar] heard a creaking sound in the bedroom and heard his sister crying.<br><br>"The same incident happened on March 2, 1997 at about the same time. He was sleeping with his brother Benedict and sisters Precila and Michele. As in the previous night he slept beside his sister Precila. Appellant again [turned] off the light. He removed his clothes and made x x x Precila undress also. [Jomar] heard a creaking sound and his Ate Precila crying. Later, appellant went down.<br><br>"Dr. Maria Nimfa Joji Quinones examined Precila. She found that Precila's labia majora was slightly gaping. The labia minora [had a] whitish discharge [and was] slightly gaping[,] exposing partly the hymenal caruncle, hymen healed, and la[c]erations at 11:00 and 6:00 o'clock with slight redness on both sides." (citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></b><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant's version of the incident is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>"<b>DIONISIO BATALLER</b> the accused-appellant in the case at bar admitted that he is the father of the private complainant[,] however, he denied the accusation that he raped his daughter, Precila Bataller on March 1 and 2, 1997. He submitted that the accusation was hurled against him because his sister-in-law, Corazon Omanga, who ha[d] a personal grudge [against] him, used her niece (Precila) and fabricated the stories of rape. Also, his son Jomar testified against him because he was instructed by the fiscal.<br><br>"<b>DOMINGO QUITO</b>, testified that on September 8, 1997, Marta, accused-appellant's wife, went to his house and told him that she (Marta) wanted to reinvestigate Precila whether it was her father or another man who abused her. When Precila was asked whether it was her father or another man who abused her, Precila remained silent to the question which was posed [to] her thrice. However, after a while, Precila broke her silence and said that it was her brother (`Si Kuya man sana'), referring to Freddie. He (Domingo) told Marta he could not believe what Precila said but he [could] not do anything about it." (citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b><br></div><br>After a full-blown trial, the court <i>a quo </i>found appellant guilty of incestuous rape on two (2) counts, for each of which he was sentenced to death. Wrote the trial judge:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the prosecution there is not an iota of doubt that Dionisio Bataller as charged sexually abused his own 17-year old daughter, Precila Bataller, in the evening about midnight successively on March 1 &amp; 2, 1997, when his wife Marta was in Metro Manila employed as household help. Only 46 years old and deprived of his conjugal privil[e]ge over his wife who had to work in Manila, the accused went down [to] the level of a beast and turned to his own daughter to satisfy his carnal lust. No child would fabricate a charge so serious against his/her own father especially if that charge carried with it the maximum penalty of death unless such c[ha]rge is true. Against this serious accusation by his own daughter, Dionisio Bataller has only a denial to offer explaining that he cannot do such a thing to his own flesh and blood. Such denial cannot prevail over [or] against the positive testimony of Precila that it was her own father on both occasions who sexually attacked her. Beside[s] this bestial act was witnessed by no less than another child, 9-year old x x x asthmatic son, Jomar, who posit[i]vely declared he heard the bedroom [creak] as his father did the push and pull on his own flesh and blood. The Court can just imagine how pitiable the sight must have been [both] for x x x Jomar [who was] apparently pretending he was asleep and controlling his asthmatic attacks lest his father discover he was awake[;] and for Precila who, could do nothing but only cringe in fear and cry since the very person upon whom they [could] turn to for protection [was] blinded by lust [and had] all of a sudden turned out to be a monster.<br><br>"The accused charges Corazon Omanga, his sister-in-law, [with] having fabricated the charges because they are business competitors. This Court is totally unconvinced. It is simply inconc[ei]vable that Corazon for that reason alone would invent and Precila, already 17 years old would willingly agree to be a party to such trump[ed]-up charges so serious that would merit no less than death [for] her brother-in-law and further x x x. But if Corazon did testify the way she did, it [was] because she found revolting her brother-in-law's acts.<br><br>"Devoid of defense, the accused attempted to show through Domingo Quito's testimony that Precila's attacker was in fact her own brother Freddie. Allegedly Precila told Boy Quito later that it was Freddie who sexually abused her. The testimony of Domingo Quito is total[l]y unreliable to sa[y] the least if not [preposterous]. No less than the accused himself and his wife corroborated Precila's and Jomar's testimon[ies] that on March 1 and 2, 1997 Freddie was in Cavite in the same household working as cook where Marta was herself employed. Twice Jomar was extensively cross-examined by two (2) different lawyers from the Public Attorney's Office, an oversight which x x x escaped the notice of [both] this Court as well as the Public Prosecutors, but on both [occasions] Jomar stuck to his testimony that when his sister was sexually abused by his father both his mother and his eldest brother were in Manila."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x"<br></div></blockquote>Thus, this automatic review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Issue</u></b><br></center><br>In his Brief, appellant submits for our consideration this sole error:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote>"The lower court erred in convicting accused-appellant of the crime charged in the information despite insufficiency of evidence to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The conviction of appellant on two counts of rape is affirmed. However, due to the prosecution's failure to prove sufficiently that the victim was a minor when the rape acts were committed, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, not death, is the proper penalty in each case.<br><br><center><b><u>Sole Issue:<br><i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></u></b><br></center><br>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript of stenographic notes and other records of the case, we are convinced that the court <i>a quo</i> did not err in giving credence to the testimonies of the victim and the other prosecution witnesses.<br><br>In prosecutions for rape, the Court is always guided by the following principles: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility, but to disprove it is difficult though the accused may be innocent; (b) in view of the nature of the crime which usually involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The testimony of the victim, detailing how she was raped by her own father, was clear and convincing.

Elementary is the rule that "a bare denial is a negative declaration which deserves no consideration and cannot prevail over the affirmative testimony of the victim which is corroborated by more evidence. It cannot survive the positive identification of the malefactor by the victim. Affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative one, especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Moreover, in cases of incestuous rape, this Court usually gives more weight to the testimonies of young rape victims, especially a barrio lass like private complainant. No woman would cry rape, undergo a public trial and relate the details of her defilement, unless motivated by her quest to right an injustice done to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Time and time again the Court has held that appellate courts will not disturb the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses by the trial court because, having observed their deportment and manner of testifying, it was in a better position to weigh conflicting testimonies. This rule stands, unless the trial judge overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> We do not find any exceptions here to justify a deviation from the general rule.<br><br><b><u><i>Proper Penalty</i></u></b><br><br>Although the prosecution was able to prove that appellant indeed raped his own daughter, we believe that its failure to prove sufficiently that she was a minor when the rape took place is fatal to the imposition of the capital punishment.<br><br>As held recently in various cases, the age of the victim at the time she was raped needs to be credibly proven with moral certainty. In <i>People v. Javier</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court unanimously held as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x Although the victim's age was not contested by the defense, proof of age of the victim is particularly, necessary in this case considering that the victim's age which was then 16-years old [was] just two years less than the majority age of 18. In this age of modernism, there is hardly any difference between a 16-year old girl and an 18-year old one insofar as physical features and attributes are concerned. A physically developed 16-year old lass may be mistaken for an 18-year old young woman, in the same manner that a frail and young looking 18-year old lady may pass [for] a 16-year old minor. Thus, it is in this context that independent proof of the actual age of a rape victim becomes vital and essential so as to remove an[y] iota of doubt that the victim [was] indeed under 18 years of age as to fall under the qualifying circumstances enumerated in Republic Act No. 7659. In a criminal prosecution especially of cases involving the extreme penalty of death, nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of <i>every fact</i> necessary to constitute the crime with which an accused is charged must be established by the prosecution in order for said penalty to be upheld. x x x. Verily, the minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself. Otherwise, failure to sufficiently establish the victim's age is fatal and consequently bars conviction for rape in its qualified form."<br></blockquote>Ruling that the burden of proving the age of the victim fell on the prosecution, the Court in <i>People v. Cula</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> said:<br><blockquote>"At all events, it is the burden of the prosecution to prove with certainty the fact that the victim was below 18 when the rape was committed in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty. The record of the case is bereft of any independent evidence, such as the victim's duly certified Certificate of Live Birth, accurately showing private complainant's age. The fact that accused-appellant Manuel has not denied the allegation in the complaint that Maricel was 16 years old when the crime was committed cannot make up for the failure of the prosecution to discharge its burden in this regard. Because of this lapse, as well as the corresponding failure of the trial court to make a categorical finding as to the minority of the victim, we hold that the qualifying circumstance of minority under Republic Act No. 7659 cannot be appreciated in this case, and accordingly the death penalty cannot be imposed."<br></blockquote>In <i>People v. Tabanggay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the minority of the victims was not sufficiently proven by the bare testimonies, which they and their mother had given. The Court ruled thus:<br><blockquote>"x x x [W]e find insufficient the bare testimony of private complainants and their mother as to their ages as well as their kinship to the appellant. We note that a photocopy of Genalyn's Birth Certificate is included in the records of the case. But it was neither duly certified nor formally offered in evidence. Therefore, no probative value can be given to it. Furthermore, we cannot agree with the solicitor general that appellant's admission of his relationship with his victims would suffice. Elementary is the rule that the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of a crime, including the qualifying circumstances. In sum, the death penalty cannot be imposed upon appellant."<br></blockquote>In the instant case, the records are bereft of any birth certificate or any other authentic document or record establishing the exact age of the victim. Moreover, the victim herself did not even know the date she was born or the number of months in a year or the age of her eldest brother, Freddie, as shown by her testimony:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"PROSECUTOR VASQUEZ:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know the accused in this case?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> What is the name of the accused in this case?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Dionisio Bataller.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Are you in any way related to him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He is my father.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Your natural father?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Your mother and father are legally married?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Now, when were you born?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> I do not know.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now, how many siblings do you have?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Six (6).<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who is the eldest?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Freddie.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know how old Freddie was?
