Michelle Monsalud told them about her problems with her parents when they learned that he (Reniel Sanahon) is her boyfriend and that they are sweethearts. Michelle asked him to elope. He consented because she (Michelle Monsalud) is his sweetheart whom he loved and he did not went (sic) to abandon her. He has one love letter written by Michelle to him which proved the fact that Michelle was in love with him (Exhibit I). He knows the penmanship of Michelle and that letter (Exh. 1) was in her penmanship. The letter was given to him by Michelle thru her friend Jennifer Macapagal before they went to Calauan, Laguna, on June 23, 1992.<br><br>As Michael Agno and Jennifer Macapagal were also eloping, the four of them rode a tricycle and went to the Rotonda. Upon reaching Rotonda Pasig, they saw their friend Amasio Valderama who advised them not to push through with their plan of eloping for their own good. When she heard this advise, Michelle Monsalud frowned (<i>"Sumimangot"</i>). They then rode a jeep where he (this witness) told Michelle Monsalud that she can still back out of their plan and go home because her mother might sue him. Michelle told him her decision was final and she will go with him as he is her first love. They proceeded to the Crossing Mandaluyong, EDSA.

Lamut at around 4:30 in the afternoon of June 23, 1992 and they proceeded to the house of Ricky Francisco. Francisco told them "You are still young, why did you do that?" He replied that he and Michelle Monsalud honestly love each other. When he said those words, Michelle Monsalud was happy. She pinched him and she was smiling. Then, Michelle Monsalud went up to the room upstairs of the house while, Michael Agno and Jennifer Macapagal remained downstairs and ate dinner.<br><br>At around 8:00 p.m., Michelle Monsalud went upstairs while he watched T.V. up to 11:00 p.m. After watching T.V. he went up to the room given to them by Ricky Francisco and he found Michelle lying in bed. Michelle noticed him enter the room. He laid down on the floor but Michelle Monsalud asked him to sleep beside her. Then, the two of them made love. Michelle Monsalud voluntarily agreed to their sexual intercourse and embraced him while they were having sexual intercourse. After that, they slept. They woke up at 3:00 a.m. and again had sexual intercourse. They then slept again with Michelle sleeping beside him.<br><br>He awoke at 6:00 in the morning of June 24, 1992. Ricky Francisco invited him to play basketball to which request he acceded. He finished playing basketball at 8:00 a.m. and went home to the house of Ricky Francisco. He saw upon his arrival at the said house Michelle Monsalud with two new comers namely, Amboy Celo, their former neighbor in Calawaan and Carlos Padilla, cousin of Michelle. These two men told him that they will take Michelle Monsalud home but the latter (Michelle Monsalud) told him not to give her to Amboy Celo who told him that they can go home because the mother of Michelle Monsalud is in the process of preparing their wedding. He respected the decision of Amboy Celo that they will go with them so he talked to Michelle and told her that they will go with Amboy Celo to Manila.<br><br>On that very day of June 24, 1992, he and Michelle Monsalud together with Michael Agno and Jennifer Macapagal went with Amboy Celo and Carlos Padilla to Manila and they proceeded to the house of Michelle Monsalud's mother at 92 Cuevas St., Calawaan, Pasig, arriving thereat at around 10:00 a.m. When they arrived, Mrs. Magdalena Monsalud, Michelle's mother, saw him and she took the baseball cap from his head and slapped him with it.

It is claimed that in this instance, the <i>ponente</i> was in no better position than the appellate courts to make a determination of the credibility of the witnesses, not having heard the testimonies himself; hence, the finding of guilt is flawed.<br><br>The Court does not agree. The circumstance that the judge who wrote the decision had not heard the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses does not automatically taint his decision. After all, he had all the records of the case at his disposal including the transcript of stenographic notes taken during the hearings of the case. The validity of a decision is not necessarily impaired by the fact that its <i>ponente</i> only took over from a colleague who had earlier presided at the trial. This circumstance alone cannot be the basis of the reversal of the trial court's decision unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation or a misapprehension of the facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>This brings us to the core of the accused-appellant's appeal which is primarily anchored on the trial court's appreciation of the facts especially on the credibility of the testimonies of the witnesses. Accused-appellant particularly harps on the credibility of the testimony of complainant. He points out specific portions in her testimony which are alleged to be inherently improbable and against ordinary credulity. Accused-appellant maintains that complainant's allegation that she was forced to go with Jennifer as she did not know her way home is highly incredulous considering that she was already thirteen years old, born in Pasig as evidenced by her birth certificate, and took the same route to and from school everyday. Moreover, the vicinity of the school was a populous district and there were many passenger vehicles parked and passing in the area, any one of which she could easily board and instruct the driver to bring her to her address. It is also hardly believable that complainant did not know where they were going inasmuch as she knows how to read and could not have missed the signboards in the bus and along the way.<br><br>Accused-appellant also discredits complainant's testimony that she was taken by the three accused to Laguna against her will. He argues that if, indeed, complainant was taken against her will, it is baffling why she did not put up any resistance or make an outcry or seek the help of a co-passenger or anyone near enough to come to her rescue considering that she herself admitted that at a certain point, she realized that they were not on their way home. Accused-appellant also questions the fact that complainant did not tell the owners of the house where she was taken of her predicament considering that she had every opportunity to do so.<br><br>As to the charge of rape, accused-appellant maintains that such allegation is also dubious because complainant 1) voluntarily went up the second floor of the house where she knew she would be all alone; 2) admitted that accused-appellant was not armed with any weapon and did not inflict any violence on her, which fact was borne by the medico-legal report; 3) did not make any commotion to catch the attention of the owners of the house who were staying in a room right below them; and 4) did not attempt to escape or to go down the room to report the matter to anyone while accused-appellant was sleeping. The fact that her parents did not immediately file a complaint but waited for two weeks before filing the same and that accused-appellant voluntarily went with complainant to their house the day after the alleged incident also detract from the veracity of the charge, accused-appellant avers.<br><br>After a careful examination of complainant's testimony during her direct, cross and re-direct examination, as well as the testimonies of the other witnesses, the Court finds that, indeed, the trial court made an erroneous appreciation of the facts.<br><br>Forcible abduction is defined under Article 342 of the Revised Penal Code as the abduction of any woman against her will and with lewd designs. The elements of this crime are: (1) the person abducted is any woman, regardless of her age, civil status, or reputation; (2) the abduction is against her will; and (3) the abduction is with lewd designs.<br><br>We find it difficult to believe complainant's charge that she was forcibly taken against her will by the three accused to Laguna.<br><br><u>First</u>. It is improbable that complainant could not find her way home alone and had to be accompanied by someone. She was already thirteen years old at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> She had taken the same route coming to and from school everyday,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> and did not have to tag along with Jennifer to go home. As pointed out by the defense, there were many passenger vehicles to ride on plying between the school and her house. She could have easily hailed a tricycle to bring her home.<br><br><u>Second</u>. Complainant maintains that she voluntarily went with Jennifer because the latter deceived her into believing that they were going home together and when she realized at a certain point that they were not taking the usual route, but were going somewhere, she pleaded to Jennifer to take her home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> If this was so, why did she continue to walk with Jennifer towards the terminal where they boarded a bus? Upon boarding the bus, she could have aroused the attention of the other passengers of the jeepney. The place where they boarded the bus at the Manuela Crossing, which is very near EDSA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> is a busy intersection where, most likely, there were policemen and traffic aides in the vicinity at the time, not to mention the throng of commuters and pedestrians milling around. It should be noted that from that point when complainant realized that Jennifer was not taking her home, that is, upon alighting from the jeepney at Manuela Crossing, and after they had boarded two more buses, complainant did not do anything to try to free herself from her alleged abductors who had not exerted any force or intimidation on her.<br><br>In <i>People vs. Montez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> where the complainant therein also charged accused of forcible abduction with rape, we ruled that the lack of outcry for help on the part of complainant during the long ride from the place of abduction to the place of destination militates against the charge that there was forcible abduction:<br><blockquote>Appellant and complainant went to Biñan, Laguna taking a jeep ride from Pasay City. This trip could not have taken place if complainant did not voluntarily go along with appellant. The willingness thus shown does not square with her claim of having been forcibly brought to the motel and there raped. The means of travel taken, with so many co-passengers in the jeep used, coupled with the long distance negotiated, afforded complainant easy way of shaking herself off from appellant, or to make known her plight as a captive and get instant rescue therefrom. That complainant did not make use of the clear opportunity to escape from appellant showed her complete willingness to go along with the latter, a feeling utterly incompatible with her claim of having been forcibly brought to the motel where she was allegedly ravished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br></blockquote>Likewise in <i>People vs. Sison</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> where accused was acquitted of the crime of forcible abduction with rape, the Court took into account the fact that all throughout the long trip, the complainant neither screamed for help nor created a commotion to alert the jeepney driver and passengers, considering also that there were numerous people along the way.<br><br><u>Third</u>. When complainant and the three accused reached the house in Calauan, Laguna where she was supposedly taken and kept against her will, complainant did not as much as intimate to the owners of the house that she was being forcibly brought there against her will, notwithstanding that she had every opportunity to do so. Complainant was taken to the house of accused Agno's cousin where among those present were Agno's cousin, his wife and their son.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The behavior of the complainant was not consistent with her claim that she was an unwilling victim. In one case, the Court held that the failure of the offended party to mention or to insinuate to the persons she talked to after the moment the alleged abductor brought her to a house and when she was brought home that she was raped renders the prosecution's case doubtful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>Complainant admitted having voluntarily gone up the second floor of the house after dinner. As accused-appellant never threatened or forced her, she could have chosen to remain downstairs where the owners of the house were staying if it is true as she alleges that she was fearful of the three accused's "evil designs."<br><br><u>Fourth</u>. Complainant's claim that she put up a resistance to accused-appellant's alleged sexual advances by kicking and boxing him and by shouting for help appears to be belied by the fact that no commotion was noticed in the relatively small house where Ricky Francisco and his family at that time were sleeping at the sala which was right below the room where complainant was claimed to have been raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> "It is unbelievable that no one heard complainant's outcries if she indeed shouted for help."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br><u>Fifth</u>. Accused-appellant was not in possession of any weapon at that time. Neither did he inflict or threaten to inflict bodily harm or violence on the person of the complainant, a fact incompatible with the charge of sexual intercourse with an unwilling victim. Complainant herself admitted in her testimony:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">COURT:</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="center">xxx</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Q:</td> <td> Sinaktan ka ba niya?</td> </tr> <tr> <td>A: </td> <td>Hindi po.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>This circumstance is corroborated by the medico-legal examination of complainant which showed the absence of any injury on her body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> While the Court has consistently ruled that absence of injury does not negate the charge of rape, it is also true that "total absence thereof is fatal to complainant's claim considering her testimony that she tried to push and kick the accused and that she struggled to resist the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br><u>Sixth</u>. It is highly improbable that while accused-appellant was allegedly raping her, complainant's primary concern and worry was not about her virtue but her parents who would have been already worried by her absence:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">While he was having carnal knowledge with you, what did you do, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I was crying, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Atty.

We also take note of complainant's behavior after the alleged rape incident. Complainant testified that after accused-appellant succeeded in sexually abusing her, he slept beside her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> This notwithstanding, she did not attempt to flee or to immediately go down the house to report the matter to any one in the house while accused-appellant was sleeping.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">COURT:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">After your sexual intercourse or after the rape, did you go down to report the matter to anyone?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> No, ma'am.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> The following day, did you report the matter to anybody in the house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> No, your honor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>This is not the usual conduct of a woman who had just been raped. In <i>People vs. Sunga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> the Court held that the failure of a woman to run to a nearby house when she had opportunity to do so is not a normal behavior of a woman who had just been raped. In this case, there was opportunity for complainant to have reported the matter to somebody as accused-appellant was sound asleep but she did not do anything. Such conduct on the part of the complainant is highly questionable considering that there was no threat to her life. Complainant even testified that she was not all warned by accused-appellant not to tell anyone about what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>Even when her uncle Claro Padilla and their neighbor arrived to take her home, complainant never breathed a word to them about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> This silence continued up to complainant's arrival at their home in Pasig. She did not immediately tell her mother that she was forcibly abducted and raped by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> In fact, two weeks had passed before they actually filed a complaint directly with the fiscal. The failure of complainant to report that she was raped despite several opportunities to do so renders doubtful her rape charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>The Court is, thus, more inclined to accept accused-appellant's allegation that he and complainant were sweethearts and eloped on the day of the alleged abduction. As previously pointed out, the conduct and behavior of complainant during the entire duration of her alleged abduction is incompatible with her charge against the accused-appellant who was unarmed and did not inflict or threaten to inflict any harm on her. It may be stated that complainant and the three others were only in their teens when the incident took place.<br><br>Accused-appellant's protestation of innocence is supported by a love letter admitted by complainant to have been written by her which referred to accused-appellant as "her first crush" and "her true love."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

Corroborating accused-appellant's claim that he and complainant eloped were the clear and categorical testimonies of the occupants of the house where complainant was allegedly kept against her will.
