				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;">The Case<br></div><br>The case is an appeal <i>via certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> from a decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which reversed and set aside the decision of the Employees' Compensation Commission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (hereafter, "ECC") and the letters-decisions of the Government Service Insurance System<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (hereafter, "GSIS") which denied respondent Gloria A. Barrameda's claim for compensation benefits under P. D. No. 626.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Facts<br></div><br>Gloria A. Barrameda (hereafter, "Gloria") started in the government service on July 1, 1971, as a typist in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On January 3, 1985, she transferred to the Sandiganbayan and held the position of "clerk".&nbsp; On July 1, 1989, she was promoted to the position of Clerk III at the same office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>As Clerk III, Gloria would file and keep the records of Associate Justice Augusto M. Amores.&nbsp; All files were kept in old steel cabinets which would jam from time to time because of rust and misalignment of the cabinet's rollers.&nbsp; Part of Gloria's job was to pull out the drawers of the cabinets where the folders of cases with varying thickness and weight were filed. Because sometimes the cabinets would jam, Gloria would have to exert extra effort in pulling and pushing the cabinets' handles.<br><br>On August 26, 1992, as Gloria was pushing the drawer of one of the steel cabinets, she felt an excruciating pain in her wrists as the drawer unexpectedly jammed midway.&nbsp; She cried out in pain, calling the attention of her officemates, Court Attorney Paulino P. Santiago and Court Stenographer Elenita C. Jasul.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>From then on, Gloria experienced pain in both of her hands and gradually lost grip in both hands and could no longer keep house or carry heavy objects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On September 14, 1992, Gloria consulted Dr. Efren de los Santos of De Los Santos Medical Center, who diagnosed her condition as "TENDONITIS EXTENSOR POLLICE'S (<i>sic</i>) LONGUS THUMB, BILATERAL."&nbsp; Gloria was placed on medication and therapy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On March 23, 1993, Gloria filed a claim for compensation benefits with the GSIS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in the amount of twenty thousand nine hundred twenty two pesos and ninety one centavos (P20,922.91) broken down as follows:&nbsp; seven thousand five hundred pesos and ninety one centavos (P7,500.91) for medicine;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> four&nbsp; thousand eight&nbsp; hundred and seventy pesos (P4,870.00) for physiotherapy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and eight thousand five hundred and fifty two pesos (P8,552.00) for professional fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On April 2, 1993, in a pro-forma letter, the GSIS denied Gloria's claim on the grounds that:&nbsp; <b>First</b>, the ailment is a non-occupational disease, and <b>Second</b>, Gloria did not present any proof that her position as Clerk III at the Sandiganbayan increased the risk of her contracting the disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On April 19, 1993, Gloria filed with the GSIS a letter request for reconsideration of the aforementioned letter-decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On May 20, 1993, the GSIS denied Gloria's letter-request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On June 1, 1993, Gloria filed with the GSIS a notice of appeal signifying her intention to appeal the denial of her claim to the ECC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On September 9, 1993, the ECC board resolved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to affirm the decisions of the GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> According to the ECC, <b>First</b>, there was no proof that the closing of the steel cabinet's drawers on August 26, 1992 triggered Gloria's ailment as Gloria sought medical assistance a month after the incident. <b>Second</b>, medical research reveals that Gloria's ailment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> is seen as the result of trauma, rheumatoid arthritis or infection. It is usually the result of strenuous or unaccustomed use of the adjacent joint. From this the ECC concluded that the ailment could not have been contracted in the course of Gloria's employment, and denied her appeal.&nbsp; We quote the dispositive portion of the decision:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, and the instant case is DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote><br>On November 29, 1993, Gloria appealed from the ECC's dismissal of her claim to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On September 6, 1996, the Court of Appeals promulgated a decision finding that there existed substantial evidence to grant Gloria's claim. The Court of Appeals recalled Gloria's tasks as Clerk III of the Sandiganbayan and concluded that such activities were strenuous enough to cause the ailment complained of. However, while the Court of Appeals ruled that the ailment suffered by Gloria was work related, the Court of Appeals found that the amount claimed by Gloria was more than the amount allowed to be reimbursed under the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation. Thus, the Court of Appeals ruled:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Petition is hereby GRANTED ordering the GSIS to reimburse petitioner of the proper amount compensable under the rules implementing PD 626.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><br>The Issue<br></center><br><br>Whether or not Gloria was entitled to compensation for work related ailment under P.D. No. 626.<br><br><center><br>The Court's Ruling<br></center><br>We rule in the affirmative, and consequently, find the petition without merit.<br><br>Under P. D. No. 626, if an ailment or sickness is not listed as an "occupational disease," the claimant must prove that the risk of contracting the illness suffered was increased by his or her working conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The degree of proof required is "substantial evidence." Jurisprudence defines "substantial evidence" as that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify the conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In the case at bar we find that the evidence met the degree of proof required.<br><br>The affidavits submitted by Gloria as well as certifications with respect to the injuries she suffered and the nature of her work justified her claim.<br><br>The following are Gloria's functions as Clerk III in the Sandiganbayan:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> First, types drafts and final copies of decisions, resolutions, as well as correspondences emanating from the Office of her Justice, and second, files and keeps records of the same.<br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals that it is reasonable to conclude that the aforementioned activities which entail the opening and closing, pushing and pulling of rusty steel drawers, which sometimes jam and misalign; the lifting and filing of voluminous files and expedientes and the typing of various drafts and resolutions caused strain and the overstretching of her wrists' joints and tendons.<br><br>Jurisprudence provides that to establish compensability of a non-occupational disease, reasonable proof and not direct proof of a causal connection between the work and the ailment is required. To require proof of actual causes or factors which lead to the ailment would not be consistent with the liberal interpretation of the social justice guarantee in favor of workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>We thus do not find any error in the Court of Appeals' ruling reversing the decision of the ECC. The ECC, as an agency charged by law to implement social justice must adopt a more liberal attitude in favor of claimants like Gloria when it decided her claim for compensability, especially as in this case, when there was basis for inferring a work-connection to the ailment she suffered. The policy of the State is to give maximum aid and protection to labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">The Fallo<br></div><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> and the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
