Aquino<i>,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> although an extrajudicial confession is admissible only against the confessant, it is admissible as corroborative evidence of other facts that tend to establish the guilt of his co-accused. The implication of this rule is that there must be a finding of other circumstantial evidence which, when taken together with the confession, establishes the guilt of a co-accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The following excerpt taken from accused Francisco's sworn statement (Exh. L) clearly shows the existence of conspiracy among the accused and the vivid details of how the crime was committed contained therein prove the complicity and participation of accused-appellant Romeo

</tbody></table> </blockquote><br>After the execution of his extrajudicial confession, accused Francisco led the police to the lair of his co-accused in Malinta, Valenzuela where the authorities recovered the Betamax (Exh. M) and adaptor (Exh. N) which had been taken from the victim's house. The adaptor contained the name of its owner "Luey,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> whereas a similar label attached to the Betamax was removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Second are the Medico-Legal Report (Exh. C) and the testimony of Dr. Dario Gajardo that the victim died of "cardio-respiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab wounds in the trunk."&nbsp; In his testimony, Dr. Gajardo explained that of the 34 marks found on the victim's body, four were ordinary marks while the rest were stab wounds, six of which were fatal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> He explained that, based on their nature, the wounds were probably inflicted by a pointed instrument, possibly by an ice pick.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The possibility of the use of an ice pick in the stabbing of the victim explains the presence of the two ice pick scabbards at the scene of the crime and corroborates the statement of accused Pedro Francisco that his co-accused used an ice pick in stabbing the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Third is the recovery of accused-appellant's black bullcap, with the letter "E"&nbsp; engraved on it, from the scene of the crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which confirms Pedro Francisco's statement that accused-appellant wore a black cap bearing a red letter marking on it when they went to the Luey residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Fourth is the positive identification of accused-appellant by Carlos Obal, who testified that on October 15, 1991, as he was approaching the residence of the victim, he saw accused-appellant, together with the two other accused, hurriedly coming out of the gate.&nbsp; Positive identification may be provided not only by a witness actually identifying an accused as the one who perpetrated the crime but also by one who has seen the accused at the scene of the crime on or about the time of the alleged incident.&nbsp; As this Court explained in <i>People v. Gallarde</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><blockquote>. . . Positive identification pertains essentially to proof of identity and not <i>per se</i> to that of being an eyewitness to the very act of commission of the crime.&nbsp; There are two types of positive identification.&nbsp; A witness may identify a suspect or accused in a criminal case as the perpetrator of the crime as an eyewitness to the very act of the commission of the crime.&nbsp; This constitutes direct evidence.&nbsp; There may, however, be instances where, although a witness may not have actually seen the very act of commission of a crime, he may still be able to positively identify a suspect or accused as the perpetrator of a crime as for instance when the latter is the person or one of the persons last seen with the victim immediately before and right after the commission of the crime. This is the second type of positive identification, which forms part of circumstantial evidence, which, when taken together with other pieces of evidence constituting an unbroken chain, leads to only fair and reasonable conclusion, which is that the accused is the author of the crime to the exclusion of all others.&nbsp; If the actual eyewitnesses are the only ones allowed to possibly positively identify a suspect or accused to the exclusion of others, then nobody can ever be convicted unless there is an eyewitness, because it is basic and elementary that there can be no conviction until and unless an accused is positively identified.&nbsp; Such a proposition is absolutely absurd, because it is settled that direct evidence of the commission of a crime is not the only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its conclusion and finding of guilt.&nbsp; If resort to circumstantial evidence would not be allowed to prove identity of the accused on the absence of direct evidence, then felons would go free and the community would be denied proper protection.<br><br>In the case at bar, although prosecution witness Carlos Obal did not witness the robbery and the killing of the victim, he saw accused-appellant and the latter's companions leaving the Luey residence in a hurry and carrying a bag<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> on the day the crime was committed.&nbsp; Considering the statement of Pedro Francisco that he and his companions were at the Lueys residence at around 8 o'clock in the morning<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and Obal's testimony that he saw the three as they were leaving the Luey residence at around the same time,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> there is reason to believe that accused-appellant and his companions indeed committed the crime.</blockquote><br>We find no reason to doubt Obal's testimony, absent any showing that he had any motive to testify falsely against accused-appellant.&nbsp; His positive identification of accused-appellant carries greater weight than the latter's bare denial and his self-serving claim that he was in Pilar, Sorsogon at the time of the commission of the crime in Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As we have more than once said, alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It crumbles in the face of clear and positive identification by the prosecution witnesses that the accused was a participant in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> For this reason, it is considered the weakest defense an accused can invoke.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It is noteworthy that no witness was presented by the defense in the case at bar to corroborate accused-appellant's claim that he was in Barangay Del Rosario, Pilar, Sorsogon on October 15, 1991 to attend the barrio fiesta.<br><br>On the other hand, the prosecution presented Telesforo Abogado, Jr. of the PNP of Pilar, who said the barrio fiesta of Barangay Del Rosario is observed on October 6-7 of each year, while the town fiesta of Pilar is observed on October 11-12 each year, and not on October 15, the day the crime was committed.<br><br>It is likewise noteworthy that accused-appellant gave his address as No. 86 Kaingin Road, Balintawak, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This is the same address of accused Pedro Francisco (Exh. L), because in fact the lot, where their houses can be found, is a squatter's area.&nbsp; Accused-appellant's admission tends to confirm the testimony of prosecution witness Carlos Obal that he knew accused-appellant Romeo Romero because he (Obal) had once seen accused-appellant in the house of accused Pedro Francisco. Carlos Obal said the distance between the house of Pedro Francisco and that of Romeo Romero was only about two to three houses away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is not true that, as accused-appellant claims, he came to know Francisco only when he met him in jail.&nbsp; Indeed, the trial court observed in its decision that accused-appellant and Francisco were close and intimate towards each other whenever they were brought to the court for trial.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>We now consider the accused-appellant's civil liability. For the death of Purita Santos Luey (Exh. D), accused-appellant should be ordered to pay her legal heirs the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity and P46,500.00 as expenses for the funeral services and the payment of a burial lot, which were duly proved (Exhs. H to J) by the prosecution. However, the award of actual damages for the alleged loss of jewelry cannot be sustained for lack of competent evidence to prove it. In People v. Oliano,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> it was held:<br><br><blockquote>We cannot, however, sustain the award of actual damages.&nbsp; To seek recovery of actual damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable by the injured party.&nbsp; In this case, we find no such proof to sustain the award of actual damages.&nbsp; The prosecution merely presented a bond paper containing a list of the expenses allegedly incurred from the killing to the burial of Benjamin Matias.&nbsp; They did not present any receipt or other evidence to support the claim.&nbsp; Nonetheless, appellant should pay the heirs of the deceased temperate damages in the amount of P10,000.&nbsp; Under Article 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages "may be recovered when the Court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty."</blockquote><br>In this case, save for the testimony of Ping Yan Luey, Purita's husband, as to the existence and estimated value of the jewelry allegedly owned by the deceased and taken by the accused, no other evidence, such as receipts, was presented by the prosecution to prove that such pieces of jewelry indeed existed and that the same were taken by the accused-appellant and his companions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> As stated before, when the police and investigators arrived at the scene of the crime, there were already several people inside the premises, anyone of whom could have taken the jewelry.&nbsp; Indeed, even Pedro Francisco stated&nbsp; in his extrajudicial confession that he did not know whether such pieces of jewelry actually existed and, if they did, that they were taken by his co-accused.&nbsp; He testified that he saw accused-appellant and Salvador Gregorio going up the second story of the house of the Lueys and, upon coming back, bringing with them items stashed in their bags. Consequently, the amount of&nbsp; P65,000.00 (P75,000.00 minus P10,000.00 representing the value of the Betamax and adaptor) claimed by the prosecution cannot be upheld.<br><br>In lieu of actual damages, temperate damages should be allowed the heirs of Purita Santos Luey, considering that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot be proved with certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The amount of P30,000.00 for temperate damages would be appropriate.
