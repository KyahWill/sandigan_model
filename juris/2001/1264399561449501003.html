Their testimonies established the following facts:<br><br>The victim Joanna Marie Jimenez is the eldest of five children of accused-appellant Jaime Cadag Jimenez, a construction worker, and Nimfa San Pedro Jimenez, housewife.&nbsp; She was born on January 25, 1985 (Exh. F).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Her family resided at Parang, Marikina in a one-bedroom house.&nbsp; At night, the family slept in the sala, which is about three meters wide, Nimfa and accused-appellant lying beside each other, the youngest child sleeping next to Nimfa, the second youngest next to the youngest, and so on.&nbsp; Joanna, being the eldest, was farthest from her parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Several times from August to October 1996, while his family was asleep at night, accused-appellant carried Joanna to the bedroom and there lay on top of her, kissed her, and fondled her breasts.&nbsp; Afterwards, he removed her shorts and panties and inserted his penis inside her vagina.&nbsp; On the sixth time, Joanna told accused-appellant that she had started menstruating on November 5, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> These alleged six instances of abuse are subject of a separate criminal complaint filed by Joanna against accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Sometime in the second week of November 1996, while Joanna, then 11 years old, was asleep at night, she was awakened by accused-appellant who again lay on top of her, caressed her breasts and private parts, and then inserted his finger inside her vagina.&nbsp; She was so afraid of her father that all she could do was to close her eyes, occasionally opening them to see what he was doing to her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant was able to abuse Joanna while her siblings and her mother were asleep beside her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Joanna related the incident to two friends, Roselle and Hazel, who urged her to tell her mother Nimfa, but Joanna was afraid she would not be believed and so did not tell her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Shortly after her 12th birthday on January 25, 1997, at about 7 o'clock, accused-appellant again molested his daughter by inserting his finger inside her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This time Joanna told her classmate and best friend Eunice what her father had been doing to her.&nbsp; Eunice in turn told her aunt about the incident.&nbsp; The latter sought the assistance of the Bantay Bata ABS-CBN Foundation which reported the matter to the principal of the Valeriano Fugoso Memorial School where Joanna was studying.&nbsp; On February 27, 1997, a teacher of the school went to Joanna's house and told Joanna's mother Nimfa about accused-appellant's abuses.&nbsp; The next day, Nimfa reported the matter to the Marikina City police.&nbsp; Joanna was examined by Dr. Dennis Bellin, medico-legal officer of the NPC-PNP Crime Laboratory Group at Camp Crame, whose findings are set forth in a medical certificate he issued, dated February 28, 1997.&nbsp; The report (Exh. A) stated:<br><br><blockquote>FINDINGS:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL:</span><br><br>Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female subject.&nbsp; Breasts are conical with light brown areola and nipples from which no secretions could be pressed out.&nbsp; Abdomen is flat and soft.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENITAL:</span><br><br>There is scanty growth of pubic hair.&nbsp; Labia majora are full, convex and coaptated with the pinkish brown labia minora presenting in between. On separating the same disclosed an elastic, fleshy-type hymen with deep healed lacerations at 3, 6 and 7 o'clock positions.&nbsp; External vaginal orifice offers moderate resistance to the introduction of the examining index finger and the virgin-sized vaginal speculum.&nbsp; Vaginal canal is narrow with prominent rugosities.&nbsp; Cervix is normal in size, color and consistency.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Subject is in non-virgin state physically.<br><br>There are no external signs of application of any form of violence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </blockquote><br>Accused-appellant denied the allegations against him.&nbsp; He contended that he could not have molested his daughter because he and his wife slept in the sala with all their children. According to accused-appellant, he used to leave the house for work at 4:30 every morning and come home at different times of the day, depending on the work at the construction site.&nbsp; But he claimed he was never left alone in the house with his daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Accused-appellant's wife Nimfa, who tried to withdraw the case filed against her husband, testified in his favor.&nbsp; She said that she and accused-appellant had been married for 14 years and that he had been a good father to his children.&nbsp; She said that it was impossible for accused-appellant to have molested their daughter Joanna on February 12, 1997 because she (Nimfa) never left the house on that day.&nbsp; In fact, at no time did she ever leave the house without taking her children with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> After trial, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1)&nbsp; in Crim.

Thus, his findings on their credibility are given the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown that the trial judge overlooked circumstances of substance which might have affected the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Substantial matters, in criminal cases, refer to facts which are constitutive of the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In any event, Joanna was never confronted with her prior inconsistent statements and given a chance to explain the alleged contradictions as required by Rule 132, §13.&nbsp; Thus, accused-appellant should not now be allowed to raise this matter on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Accused-appellant says that Joanna's claim that he abused her in the sala not only once but also on several other occasions is highly improbable because his wife Nimfa and their other children also sleep in the sala. As we have observed, however, lust is no respecter of time and place.&nbsp; If rape can be committed in places where people congregate, even in the same room where other members of the family are sleeping,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> there is less reason to believe that other people sleeping in the same room can serve as a deterrent for the commission of lascivious acts.<br><br>Joanna's failure to raise an alarm cannot be taken against her. As we have said before, the law does not impose upon the victim of sexual assault the burden of proving resistance.&nbsp; Moreover, reactions to such assaults are unpredictable as people respond to violence differently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Although accused-appellant was not armed in committing sexual abuse against his daughter, his moral ascendancy over her was a sufficient substitute for the use of force or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <br><br>Accused-appellant also adverts to the delay of seven months before Joanna reported the numerous incidents of abuse to her relatives and friends, thus allegedly placing her credibility in doubt.&nbsp; Accused-appellant contends that a woman who has been violated would normally do anything in her power to bring the culprit to justice once the threat to her has been removed, but that here, Joanna kept quiet and even refused to tell her mother about the alleged abuses committed against her (Joanna).<br><br>We do not agree with accused-appellant.&nbsp; The delay in reporting of rape and other sexual assaults does not imply that the charge is not true.&nbsp; This Court has taken judicial notice of the fact that most victims of sex crimes, especially Filipinas, are reluctant to reveal to the world their harrowing experiences and prefer to bear the ignominy and pain silently, rather than expose their shame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In addition, although Joanna did not tell her mother her misfortune, she in fact did so to her friends, as a result of which the Bantay Bata ABS-CBN Foundation and Joanna's school prinicipal took a hand in her case, in the process informing her mother of accused-appellant's abuse.&nbsp; If Joanna failed to report the incidents to her mother, it was because she feared she would not be believed.&nbsp; Indeed, as it turned out, instead of supporting her, her mother Nimfa testified in favor of accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Joanna had to rely on the sympathy of other people and live under the protection of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) at Marillac Hills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <br><br>Above all, it is unthinkable for a daughter, especially one so young as Joanna, to falsely accuse her own father if it were not true she has been molested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br><i>Second.</i> Accused-appellant argues that relationship should not be considered a qualifying circumstance as this was never alleged in the informations.&nbsp; Under R.A. No. 7610, §31(c), however, relationship is not a qualifying but only an ordinary generic aggravating circumstances and, therefore, although it was not alleged in the information can nevertheless be taken into account in fixing the penalty for the crime because it was proven. Accused-appellant fails to distinguish a generic aggravating circumstance from a qualifying circumstance. A generic aggravating circumstance provides for the imposition of the prescribed penalty in its maximum period, while a qualifying circumstance changes the nature of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <br><br>Now, the pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 7610 state:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE III<br><br>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse<br><br>SECTION 5.&nbsp; <i>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse</i>. ¾ Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br><br>The penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed upon the following:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse: <i>Provided, </i>that when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: <i>Provided</i> That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period; and<br><br>. . . .<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE XII<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Common Penal Provisions</span><br></div><br>SECTION 31.&nbsp; <i>Common Penal Provisions --</i><br><br>. . . .<br><br>(c) The penalty provided herein shall be imposed in its maximum period when the perpetrator is an ascendant, parent, guardian, stepparent or collateral relative within the second degree of consanguinity or affinity, or a manager or owner of an establishment which has no license to operate or its license has expired or has been revoked;</blockquote><br>It is clear from the above, that the nature of the crime does not change when the circumstance of relationship is present.&nbsp; The law simply provides that the penalty prescribed should be imposed in its maximum period when such circumstance is present, thus making the circumstance of relationship merely a generic aggravating circumstance. The trial court, therefore, correctly sentenced accused-appellant to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of lascivious conduct committed against his daughter.<br><br>The trial court was correct in imposing a fine of P20,000.00 as cash fund to be administered by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for the rehabilitation of Joanna for each count of lascivious act committed by accused-appellant, pursuant to Art. XII, §31(f) of R.A. No. 7610.<br><br>It was also correct in imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in Crim. Case No. 97-1551-MK.&nbsp; However, it erred in imposing the straight penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in Crim. Case No. 97-1577-MK, because the lascivious act in that case was committed in the second week of November 1996 when Joanna was only 11 years old.&nbsp; Pursuant to Art. III, §5(b), as above quoted, the penalty to be imposed should be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.&nbsp; There being one aggravating circumstance, the penalty should be in its maximum period.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, in relation to Art. 65 of the Revised Penal Code, accused-appellant should be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty the minimum of which is within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum and the maximum of which is the maximum of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium.<br><br>Moreover, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 should be awarded to Joanna for the acts committed by accused-appellant in the second week of November 1996 when she was only 11 years old and in February 12, 1997 when she was 12 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 273, Marikina City, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; In Crim.
