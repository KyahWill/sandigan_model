The two cases were consolidated and tried jointly. Thereafter, on May 12, 1998, the trial court rendered its assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court in Criminal Case No. 95-555 finds Eugenio Marquez y Briones guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated robbery with homicide and frustrated homicide punished under Article 297 of the Revised Penal Code and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, with no mitigating or aggravating circumstance present, Eugenio Marquez is sentenced to suffer reclusion perpetua and he is ordered to pay the costs.<br><br>"Eugenio Marquez is ordered to pay the heirs of Joselito Halum P50,000.00 as death indemnity.&nbsp; He is also ordered to reimburse SPO1 Rizaldy Merene the sum of P9,000.00 which he incurred for his medical treatment.<br><br>"The case against Jose Magtibay is dismissed for insufficiency of evidence.&nbsp; His release from detention unless he is being detained for another cause, is ordered.<br><br>"In Criminal Case No. 95-557 the Court finds Eugenio Marquez y Briones guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of illegal possession of firearm punished under Section I of Presidential Decree No. 1866 as amended by Republic Act No. 8294 and, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, [of] the commission of homicide as an aggravating circumstance.&nbsp; Eugenio Marquez is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional as minimum to six (6) years of prision correccional as maximum and he is ordered to pay a fine of P15,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>"The officer-in-charge of this court is directed to deposit the caliber .38 revolver `Smith and Wesson' (Exhibit A in Criminal Case No. 95-555 and Exhibit A in Criminal Case No. 95-557) and the envelope with the three (3) live bullets and one slug (Exhibit A-1 in Criminal Case No. 95-555 and Exhibit A-1 in Criminal Case No. 95-557) with the Philippine National Police at Camp Nakar, Lucena City, in accordance with existing rules."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</span><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Version of the Prosecution</i><br></div><br>The solicitor general summarized the evidence for the prosecution in this wise:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"[O]n the evening of February 17, 1995, a JAC Liner bus driven by Modesto Ferrer with Joselito Halum as conductor was on its way from Metro Manila to Lucena City.&nbsp; Among the passengers was SPO1 Rizaldy Merene of the Southern Police District Command.&nbsp; Merene was seated directly behind the driver (TSN, p. 3, February 9, 1996).&nbsp; Another passenger, Manuel Fleta, occupied the third seat on the left side of the bus. When the bus reached the Mazapan junction in Barangay Santo Cristo, Sariaya, Quezon, four men boarded the bus (TSN, p. 6, September 9, 1996).<br><br>"Two or three kilometers away from the Mazapan junction, two passengers stood up as if to alight from the bus (TSN, PP. 2-4, February 16, 1996[)].&nbsp; When they reached the front portion of the bus, however, one of the men (later found to be appellant Marquez) poked a gun at the driver and announced a `hold-up.'&nbsp; His companion poked a knife at the conductor[.]&nbsp; Merene who was seated right behind quickly drew his firearm, but Marquez was able to fire at him first.&nbsp; Although hit, Merene returned fire.&nbsp; Panicking, Marquez and his companion jumped out of the bus.&nbsp; The conductor, Halum, fell to the floor of the bus, fatally wounded&nbsp; (TSN, pp. 4-7, February 9, 1996; pp. 7-8, September 9, 1996)[.]<br><br>"After the hold-up men left the bus, Merene asked the driver to bring him to the nearest hospital where he was treated for his wound.<br><br>"Manuel Fleta, who witnessed the announcement of the hold-up and the exchange of fire between one of the hold-up men and SPO1 Merene, went to the PNP Sariaya station to report the incident.&nbsp; Chief of Police Concordio Tapulayan and PO3 Enrico Perez accompanied Fleta to the place where the incident happened and later to the Greg Hospital where SPO1 Rizaldy Merene was questioned (TSN, p. 12, December 16, 1996).&nbsp; While they were there, the police officers received a radio message from the Candelaria police station informing them that a wounded man was brought to the Bola√±os Hospital in Candelaria (Ibid., at p. 13).&nbsp; This was followed by another broadcast declaring that the wounded man was transferred to the Quezon Memorial Hospital in Lucena City. With this information, PO3 Perez with two other policemen and Manuel Fleta went to the Quezon Memorial Hospital. At the emergency room there, Manuel Fleta identified the wounded man to the police officers as one of the hold-up men, Eugenio Marquez (TSN, pp. 14-15, December 16, 1996).<br><br>"At the time the hold-up inside the JAC Liner bus was taking place, spouses Mauricio and Zenaida Ilao and their children were watching a movie inside their house at Barangay Sampaloc II, Sariaya, Quezon.&nbsp; Their house was about 30 meters away from the Maharlika Highway and 100 meters away from the Lagnas bridge.&nbsp; A few minutes after the aborted hold-up (which the Ilao family was unaware of), a man suddenly appeared at the door of their house, naked above the waist, bloodied and asking for help (TSN, PP. 1-3, March 12, 1997).&nbsp; Mauricio asked the man if he knew a person in their barangay. The man mentioned the name of Julie Ann Vene√±osa who, the couple knew, was working at the poultry farm nearby. Zenaida Ilao, accompanied by her daughter Irene, went to fetch Julie Ann.&nbsp; They returned with Julie Ann on board a jeep (Ibid., p. 4).&nbsp; When Julie Ann arrived, she recognized him as Eugenio Marquez and immediately brought him to the hospital in Candelaria (Ibid., at p. 5).<br><br>"The next morning, Mauricio Ilao was surprised to find a firearm at the back of their house.&nbsp; He immediately went to the Sariaya police station to report this.&nbsp; Four policemen went with him to his house where the .38 caliber gun with three live bullets was found (TSN, pp. 18-19, March 12, 1997)."</blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Version of the Defense</i><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant's version of the incident is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"On February 17, 1995, herein accused-appellant went to the house of Julie Anne Venenosa, a distant relative and friend, in Montecillo, Sariaya, Quezon.&nbsp; Upon arriving thereat at about 6:00 in the evening, he was informed by Gladys Venenosa, mother of Julie Anne, that the latter was still at her work. After spending some ten (10) minutes in that house, he decided to go to the place of work of Julie Anne in Sampaloc II at Max Tabangcora Poultry, and he went to the junction at Sto. Cristo, Sariaya to wait for any passenger vehicle, and after sometime he hailed and boarded an air-conditioned bus, JAC Liner, with plate No. NYE 839, which was then with many passengers.&nbsp; He boarded said bus alone.&nbsp; After he ha[d] boarded the bus some other six passengers also hailed and boarded said bus.&nbsp; Reaching the place of his destination at Sampaloc II, Sariaya, he stood up and walked towards the conductor to tell the latter that he was unboarding, but when he was barely two seats away from the driver, herein accused-appellant heard some[one] saying `hold-up ito', and saw a man poking his gun at the driver of the bus, and suddenly there was exchange of fire.&nbsp; He was about to go back to his seat but he was hit by a bullet.&nbsp; During the exchange of fire many of the passengers jumped out of the bus, and he also jumped out.&nbsp; After jumping out of the bus he saw a house, some twenty meters away, which [later], turned out to be owned by Zenaida Ilao, from whom he requested that his cousin Julie Anne Venenosa be fetched to take him to a hospital. First he was taken to Bolanos Hospital, then to Quezon Memorial Hospital, then later transferred to Philippine General Hospital, where he was confined for a week.&nbsp; When he was released from the hospital, he was taken by Sariaya Police to the Municipal Jail, and after two (2) months, he was transferred to the Provincial Jail[.] (TSN, Eugenio Marquez y Briones, August 11, 1997, pp. 3-10)<br><br>"When arraigned, he pleaded NOT GUILTY to the two (2) charges.<br><br>"Prosecution presented its witnesses and rested its case, and so with the defense.&nbsp; Herein accused-appellant himself testified in open court."</blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Trial Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>In convicting appellant of frustrated robbery with homicide and frustrated homicide, the court <i>a quo</i> gave full faith and credence to the testimonies of the primary prosecution witnesses, SPO1 Rizaldy Merene and Manuel Fleta.&nbsp; It underscored their straightforward and cohesive identification of appellant as the culprit who had announced the holdup and exchanged gunfire with Merene, resulting in the wounding of the police officer and the killing of the bus conductor.&nbsp; The court <i>a quo</i> debunked the assertion of appellant that he was a mere passenger who had been injured in the crossfire.&nbsp; It was convinced that his actions and the circumstances surrounding the incident indubitably showed his participation in the attempted robbery, as well as in the consequent wounding of Merene and death of the bus conductor.<br><br>The trial court likewise found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal possession of firearm.&nbsp; It stressed the fact that the gun - which was subsequently identified by Merene as the weapon used in the attempted robbery -- was found at the back of Mauricio Ilag's house, the place where appellant had sought solace after being injured.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Assigned Errors</span><br></div><br>In his Brief, appellant bewails the following alleged errors of the trial court:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>In convicting the accused on the basis of the testimonies of SPO1 Rizaldy Merene and Manuel Fleta, despite grave contradictions on material points in their testimonies, and in concluding that appellant was the same person who engaged in fire fight with said police officer, despite absence of any direct evidence, or sufficient circumstantial evidence pointing at him as the person who announced the hold up and as the person who engaged in the exchange of fire with said police officer.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>In convicting the appellant of the crimes charged despite doubt as to his identity and culpability, and in not acquitting him on ground of reasonable doubt; in convicting the appellant under Section 1, PD 1866, despite the fact that the subject .38 revolver was not found in his possession."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue: </span><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br>Credibility of Witnesses </i><br></div><br>In impugning the testimonies of Prosecution Witnesses SPO1 Rizaldy Merene and Manuel Fleta, appellant points out the alleged ambivalence of their testimonies.&nbsp; He contends that these two witnesses differed in their narrations with regard to the positions of the holduppers and the bus conductor during the holdup, even if the two were then seated near them.&nbsp; That Merene admitted during trial that he was not sure if he had shot the holdupper during their gunfight is also stressed by appellant.&nbsp; The latter further avers that, before the holdup was announced, Fleta had been watching a bus movie and, during the gunfight, was crouching to avoid being hit; thus, this witness was not in a position to identify the culprit.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; True, there is a marked discrepancy between the testimonies of Merene and Fleta as regards the whereabouts of the bus conductor before, during and immediately after the holdup.&nbsp; It must be noted, however, that the points of recall of the two witnesses were different. Merene was an active participant in the gunfight; thus, he could not be expected to remember the peripherals of the incident.&nbsp; Fleta was a passive eyewitness; as such, he was able to observe things that the former might have overlooked. Moreover, the Court has held that "[t]otal recall or perfect symmetry is not required as long as witnesses concur on material points."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>It must be emphasized that the above-mentioned testimonial disparity does not negate the fact that appellant was <i>positively identified</i> by both witnesses as the malefactor who had announced the holdup and exchanged gunshots with the police officer.&nbsp; There is no contrariety with regard to this vital fact. Both witnesses consistently, cohesively and certainly identified appellant as the culprit.&nbsp; Merene testified thus:<br><br><blockquote><table ¬†="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Salamillas: </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">SPO1 Merene[,] on February 18, 1995 at about seven o'clock to seven twenty do you [still] recall where you were?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Where were you then?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">I was abroad a bus JAC Liner Bus going to Lucena City from Manila.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">At that time were there other passengers in that JAC Liner bus?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">How many of them if you know?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">More or less fifteen passengers.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">When the bus that you were then boarding was at the vicinity of Sariaya, Quezon can you still recall if some unusual incident occurred during that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir, there was.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">What was that unusual incident that took place when the bus reached Sto.

The robbery was foiled, however, when SPO1 Rizaldy Merene decided to fight back.&nbsp; Were it not for the presence and the bravery of this police officer, appellant and his cohorts would have successfully consummated their original plan.<br><br>In the gunfight that ensued between appellant and Merene, bus conductor Joselito Halum was killed.&nbsp; Clearly, his death occurred by reason or as an incident of the robbery.&nbsp; Even if it was merely incidental (he was caught in the crossfire), still, frustrated robbery with homicide was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> With regard to the charge of frustrated homicide, appellant, in shooting Merene almost pointblank, had performed all the acts necessary to kill the latter, who survived because of timely medical intervention.&nbsp; Thus, appellant's conviction for frustrated robbery with homicide and frustrated homicide must be sustained.<br><br>On the other hand, we agree with the Office of the Solicitor General that the trial court's conviction of appellant for violation of PD 1866 should be reversed; he should be acquitted.&nbsp; In crimes involving illegal possession of firearm, the prosecution has the burden of proving the following: (1) the existence of the subject firearm and (2) the fact that the accused who owns it does not have a license or permit to carry it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the present case, it must be emphasized that the subject gun <i>was not</i> found in the possession of appellant; rather, it was discovered at the back of the house of Mauricio Ilao, from whom the former had sought solace after the holdup incident.&nbsp; While the prosecution, considering the circumstances, assumes that the gun was brought there by appellant, such conjecture does not satisfy the elements of the crime; it is clearly not enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of illegal possession of firearm.<br><br>Furthermore, in <i>People v. Molina</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this Court has ruled that the use of an unlicensed firearm merely aggravates a killing and may no longer be the source of a separate conviction for the crime of illegal possession of a deadly weapon.&nbsp; This doctrine was reiterated in <i>People v.
