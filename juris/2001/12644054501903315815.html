				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Absent any qualifying circumstance, the crime should be merely homicide, not murder.&nbsp; In order to qualify the killing as murder, evident premeditation or treachery must be established as clearly as the killing itself.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case<br></div><br>Before us is an appeal filed by Edmundo Briones Aytalin, assailing the May 13, 1998 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (Branch 97) in Criminal Case No. Q-91-26824. The Decision convicted him of murder, sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua, </i>and ordered him to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P500,000.<br><br>In the Information dated November 25, 1995, Assistant City Prosecutor Nelson E. Kallos charged appellant with murder allegedly committed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of December 1990, in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with evident premeditation and by means of treachery, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and without any justifiable cause, attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of one ELEAZAR AQUINO, by then and there shooting [the victim] with a gun (cal. 22, Rev. SN 683541) several times, hitting him on the different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said victim in such amount as may be awarded under the provisions of the New Civil Code."<br></blockquote><br>Upon his arraignment on September 30, 1992, appellant, assisted by Counsel <i>de Oficio</i> Voltaire Agas, pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Trial ensued and, thereafter, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing facts and considerations, and the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses, this court finds the accused Edmundo Briones Aytalin guilty beyond reasonable doubt as charged in the above information of the crime of murder as defined in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P500,000."<br></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><i style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Version of the Prosecution</i><br></div><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, in its Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> narrates the factual incidents of the case in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>"At around 4:20 o'clock in the afternoon of December 23, 1990, appellant Edmundo Aytalin shot Eleazar Aquino four times along Iba St., Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, Quezon City.&nbsp; After shooting the latter, appellant looked at the crowd and the prostrate victim.&nbsp; He then entered a house, came out with a long gun, and boarded a taxi with his wife.&nbsp; Aquino was rushed to the National Orthopedic Hospital, where he died the following day.<br><br>"After the incident, Captain Philmore Balmaceda brought appellant and his (appellant's) .22 caliber revolver used in the shooting, as well as four (4) empty shells and two live ammunition of the gun to the Quezon City Police.<br><br>"An autopsy (was) conducted on the body of Aquino by Dr. Emmanuel Aranas of the PNP Crime Laboratory. After examining the cadaver, Aranas found a gunshot wound on the left side of the forehead of Aquino, and recovered a deformed caliber .22 slug embedded on the left side of the brain of the deceased, which slug the doctor submitted to the Ballistics Division of the crime laboratory for examination.&nbsp; Aranas concluded that based on his findings, the cause of death of the victim [was] hemorrhage due to the gunshot wound in the head.&nbsp; The ballistics test conducted by the PNP Crime Laboratory revealed that the deformed slug recovered from the brain of the deceased was fired from the gun of the appellant."<br></blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Version of the Defense</i><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant presents this version of the facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"Upon being arraigned, accused entered a plea of `NOT GUILTY'.&nbsp; A trial on the merits was conducted, and after the prosecution ha(d) rested its case, accused, through counsel, and with leave of court, filed a DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE. The same was denied.&nbsp; The accused opted not to present evidence in his defense. Hence, a decision was rendered finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER, for which he was sentenced to suffer a penalty of imprisonment of `reclusion perpetua.'<br><br>"On December 23, 1990, at around 4:20 PM, the alleged victim Eleazar Aquino was shot along Iba Street, Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, Quezon City.&nbsp; Alleged eyewitnesses to the shooting pointed to accused as the person who shot the victim. No motive was established for the shooting.&nbsp; As to the cause of death, the decision assailed relied heavily on the opinion of the prosecution witness Anacleto Reyes, who testified thus: `Ang pagkakaalam ko ho ay yung pagkabaril po sa kanya ni Edmund Aytalin.' (TSN p.12, 1/15/93)"<br></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Trial Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>Finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt, the trial court explained its ruling as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"The Court finds that positive identification of the accused Edmundo Aytalin as the assailant of Eleazar Aquino by witnesses Antonio Ortega and Anacleto Reyes, whose credibility has not been impaired demonstrates the culpability of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>"The cause of death of Eleazar Aquino has been sufficiently established by prosecution evidence other than the autopsy report. Oral testimony linking the death of the victim to the wound inflicted by the firearm which was wielded by the accused is sufficient.&nbsp; The firearm in question appears to be recovered from the accused and linked to him by the testimony of ballistics expert Reynaldo De Guzman.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>"Thus, it appears to this Court that on December 23, 1990, at around 4:20 o'clock in the afternoon, Eleazar Aquino was shot along Iba Street, Brgy. San Isidro Labrador, Quezon City. Being present at the scene of the incident, Antonio Ortega (TSN, October 28, 1992, p.21) [and] Anacleto Reyes (TSN, January 15, 1993, pp.8) have positively identified accused Edmundo Aytalin as the person who shot the victim.&nbsp; Both Anacleto Reyes (TSN, January 15, 1993, pp.3-4) and Antonio Ortega, (TSN, October 28, 1992, pp.16-20) knew the accused Edmundo Aytalin as well as the victim Eleazar Aquino before the shooting incident.&nbsp; Not long after the shooting, on December 24, 1990, the victim, Eleazar Aquino, died at the National Orthopedic Hospital to where he was earlier rushed.&nbsp; The fact of death and identity of the victim is admitted by the defense (TSN, October 28, 1992, pp.3-4). The cause of death is as prosecution witness Anacleto Reyes testified, thus: "Ang pagkakaalam ko, ho, ay yung pagkabaril po sa kanya ni Edmundo Aytalin" (TSN, January 15, 1993, p.12).<br><br>"It appears further that after the shooting incident the Quezon City Police through SPO Rosito Calabucal conducted an investigation, taking the statements of witnesses, one of which is that of Anacleto Reyes (Exh. "B-6"; TSN, November 11, 1992, p.4), and receiving the person of accused Edmundo Aytalin for detention and the recovered firearm used in the shooting incident, .22 Caliber, revolver (Ruby) with serial number 693541, together with four (4) empty shells or fired cartridges and two (2) live ammunition of .22 caliber, both from Capt. Philmore E. Balmaceda, who brought the accused together with the said items to the Quezon City Police on December 24, 1990, (Exh. "C-1", TSN, November 11, 1992, p.18).&nbsp; x x x. On December 25, 1990, an autopsy was conducted on the cadaver of Eleazar Aquino (Exh. "B-7", "B-7-a") by Dr. Emanuel Aranas of the PNP Crime Laboratory (TSN; December 2, 1992, pp.38-40).&nbsp; In the process of examining the cadaver of the victim herein the medico-legal officer found a gunshot wound on the left side of the forehead (TSN, December 2, 1992, p. 40, 42) and recovered a deformed caliber x x x 22 slug (Exh., `G-3-B"), marked in his presence "EA" (Exh. "G-3-c), embedded [i]n the left side of the brain of Eleazar Aquino (TSN, December 2, 1992, p. 46), which he forwarded to the Ballistics Division of the PNP Crime Laboratory for ballistics tests (Exh "N", TSN, December 2, 1992, p.49). Based on his findings, Dr. Aranas concluded that the cause of death of Eleazar Aquino [was] hemorrhage due to gunshot wound in the head (Exh. "B-7", "B-7-a", TSN, December 2, 1992, p.49). x x x<br><br>"The identity and the fact of death of the victim and the identity of the accused as well as the incident being within the jurisdiction of this court have been stipulated in open court, as well as the fact that the incident had been investigated by the police and a report was rendered on the matter, and that the special power of attorney of the brother to represent the wife of the victim is genuine and authentic, (Exhibit "A") including the records of the autopsy, ballistics, hospital, subject to cross-examination.&nbsp; The defense also admitted in open court, without prejudice to the cross examination of the ballistician, that the gun used in the killing of Eleazar Aquino was the same gun which was submitted to the ballistics expert.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The prosecution has proven through the testimony of its witness Antonio Ortega that he used to pass Iba Street while collecting bets for the horse races, and that he often [saw] the accused there, and that on the time and date in question he saw accused and that he knew the face of the accused because he often [saw] him there, and that he saw the accused shoot the victim four times, and that he was at that time only seven meters away from the place of the shooting.&nbsp; He moved back after the shooting, but still looked on and he saw the accused go up the house and go down later with a long gun and that the accused rode in a taxi with a woman.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The court finds the basic testimonies of the above prosecution witnesses as credible and unassailed, and therefore the court takes them as facts, namely that the victim, Eleazar Aquino died of the bullet wound inflicted in his head by the accused Edmundo Briones Aytalin, who wielded the fatal gun, (Exhibit "J") and that the bullet recovered from the head of the victim was indeed fired from said gun. The accused did not present evidence in his defense after all the years, since the prosecution rested its case. The Court further finds nothing in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses that is not factually based and in accordance with common human experience, thus convincing this court of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issue</span><br></div><br>In his Brief, appellant submits a single issue for the determination of this Court:<br><br><blockquote>"Whether or not the accused is guilty of the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><center style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court's Ruling</center><br>Appellant should be convicted only of homicide, not murder, and the indemnity should be reduced to P50,000.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Main Issue<br></div><br><br>In challenging the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence, appellant avers that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are full of inconsistencies and contradictions, particularly with respect to the injury sustained by the victim.&nbsp; Appellant likewise assails the prosecution's supposedly dubious account of how he perpetrated the attack.&nbsp; Furthermore, he alleges that there was no documentary evidence presented to show the cause of the victim's death.&nbsp; Finally, he questions the trial court's admission of ballistic evidence presented by a witness who allegedly did not qualify as an expert.<br><br>Appellant disputes the trial court's appreciation of the prosecution evidence, but his contentions are bereft of merit.&nbsp; Generally accepted is the principle that factual findings and conclusions of the trial court are entitled to great weight and are generally not disturbed on appeal, considering that it had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and assess their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Absent any showing that it failed to appreciate a fact or circumstance that, if considered, would have changed the disposition of the case, its factual findings remain binding upon the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, we shall address the matters raised by appellant, if only to show the futility of his assertions.<br><br><i>First</i>, he alludes to alleged inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses' testimonies pertaining to the number of gunshot wounds sustained by the victim.&nbsp; However, this detail, being collateral, does not affect the undisputed fact that appellant killed the victim.<br><br>We stress that witnesses testifying on the same event do not have to be consistent in every detail.&nbsp; Slight differences in their recollections, viewpoints or impressions are inevitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They are in fact indicative of the truth and the sincerity of their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> So long as the witnesses concur on material points, slight variations in their recollections of minor details and other ancillary matters do not destroy the veracity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> or the probative value<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of their statements.
