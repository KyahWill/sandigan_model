comes to us <i>via</i> the instant Petition for the Issuance of a Writ of
Habeas Corpus to seek his release from imprisonment on the ground that after
giving retroactive application to the provisions of Republic Act No. 8294,</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> we shall find that he has already served more than
the maximum imposable penalty for the crimes he has committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner was indicted for
robbery and illegal possession of the firearm used in the commission of the
robbery before Branch 4 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila.  After trial, petitioner was convicted of both
crimes.  In Criminal Case No. 92-109854
for illegal possession of firearms, petitioner was sentenced to suffer the
indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of eighteen (18) years of <i>reclusion
temporal</i> as minimum to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> as maximum.  On the other hand, the indeterminate penalty
of imprisonment of six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum to
ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum was imposed by the trial
court upon the petitioner in Criminal Case No. 92-109710 for robbery.</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On appeal, the Court of Appeals
affirmed the trial court’s decision with modification, <i>to wit</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, with the modification that the
accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer: (1) an indeterminate penalty
of imprisonment of Four (4) Years, Two (2) Months and One (1) Day of <i>Prision
Correccional</i> as minimum to Six (6) Years and Eight (8) Months of <i>Prision
Mayor</i> as maximum in Criminal Case No. 92-109710, and (2) an indeterminate
penalty of imprisonment of Twelve (12) Years, Five (5) Months and Eleven (11)
days of <i>Prision Mayor</i> as minimum to Seventeen (17) Years, Four (4)
Months and One (1) day of <i>Reclusion Temporal</i> as maximum in Criminal Case
No. 92-109854, the decision being appealed from is AFFIRMED in all other
respects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On July 6, 1997, Republic Act No.
8294 took effect.  The said law
effectively reduced the imposable penalty for the offense of illegal possession
of firearms.  Hence, for the illegal
possession of a low powered firearm such as that of the petitioner’s, the
penalty is now <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period which has a
duration of four (4) years, two (2) months, and one day to six (6) years, and a
fine of not less than Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00).</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> It is the retroactive application of this provision
of law which petitioner seeks to forward his cause.  Thus, petitioner contends that the penalty of imprisonment
imposed upon him by the trial court, as modified by the Court of Appeals, for
the offense of illegal possession of firearms has been lowered to imprisonment
of four (4) years, two (2) months and one day to six (6) years by virtue of
Section 1 of Republic Act No. 8294.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner is of the mistaken
belief that the two terms of imprisonment: [1] four (4) years, two (2) months
and one day of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum to six (6) years and
eight (8) months of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum for the crime of robbery,
and [2] four (4) years, two (2) months and one day to six (6) years for the
offense of illegal possession of firearms, are to be served simultaneously.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Considering that petitioner has already served a
total of nine (9) years and three (3) months (computed with good conduct time
allowance),</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> he contends that he has already served the maximum
period of the two prison terms imposed upon him, and he is, therefore, entitled
to be restored to his liberty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We disagree. Article 70 of the
Revised Penal Code is clear on the matter of service of two or more penalties.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> When the culprit has to serve two or more penalties,
he should serve them simultaneously if the nature of the penalties will so
permit; otherwise said penalties shall be executed successively, following the
order of their respective severity.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Terms of imprisonment must therefore be served
successively.  Thus, we have held that
in the service of two prison terms, the second sentence did not commence to run
until the expiration of the first.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It stands to reason that the
penalty for robbery which is imprisonment of four (4) years, two (2) months and
one day of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum to six (6) years and eight
(8) Months of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum has to be served by petitioner
first before service of the second sentence for illegal possession of a low
powered firearm, which is imprisonment of four (4) years, two (2) months, and
one day to six (6) years, may even commence.  Thus, the maximum period of petitioner’s incarceration is twelve (12)
years and eight (8) months.  Petitioner’s service of nine (9) years and three (3) months of the
prison terms imposed upon him is therefore not sufficient to meet the maximum
period of twelve (12) years and eight (8) months, and he cannot be released
from confinement on this basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fortunately, however, petitioner
can and shall be restored to his liberty in light of recent jurisprudence, specifically
this Court’s ruling in <i>People vs. Walpan Ladjaalam y Mihajil alias “Warpan” </i></span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which shed light on the correct interpretation of the
following provisions of Republic Act No. 8294:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SECTION 1. Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended,
is hereby further amended to read as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“SEC. 1. <i>Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition or
Possession of Firearms or Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used
in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition.</i> – The penalty of <i>prision
correccional</i> in its maximum period and a fine of not less than Fifteen
Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person who shall
unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess, any low powered
firearm, such as rimfire handgun, .380 or .32 and other firearm of similar
firepower, part of firearm, ammunition, or machinery, tool or instrument used
or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition: <i>Provided</i>,
That no other crime was committed.</p>

<p class="2Q">“The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period and a
fine of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) shall be imposed if the firearm is
classified as high powered firearm which includes those with bores bigger in
diameter than .38 caliber and 9 millimeter such as caliber .40, .41, .44, .45
and also lesser calibered firearms but considered powerful such as caliber .357
and caliber .22 center-fire magnum and other firearms with firing capability of
full automatic and by burst of two or three: <i>Provided, however, </i>That no
other crime was committed by the person arrested.</p>

<p class="2Q">“If homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed
firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an
aggravating circumstance.</p>

<p class="2Q">“If the violation of this Section is in furtherance of or incident
to, or in connection with the crime of rebellion or insurrection, sedition, or
attempted <i>coup d’etat</i>, such violation shall be absorbed as an element of
the crime of rebellion, or insurrection, sedition, or attempted <i>coup d’etat.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Office of the Solicitor
General which did not interpose any objection to this petition is correct in
pointing out that should petitioner’s case be reviewed in light of recent
jurisprudence, he may be found guilty only of the crime of robbery.  In other words, he would be exonerated of
the offense of illegal possession of firearm.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The reason for this is our pronouncement in <i>People
vs. Walpan Ladjaalam</i> that the accused can be convicted of simple illegal
possession of firearms, provided that no other crime was committed by the
person arrested.  Conversely stated, if
another crime was committed by the accused, he cannot be convicted of simple
illegal possession of firearms.  Thus,
we ratiocinated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>We cannot accept either of these interpretations because they
ignore the plain language of the statute.  A simple reading thereof shows that if an unlicensed firearm is used in
the commission of any crime, there can be no separate offense of simple illegal
possession of firearms.  Hence, if the
“other crime” is murder of homicide, illegal possession of firearms becomes
merely an aggravating circumstance, not a separate offense.  Since direct assault with multiple attempted
homicide was committed in this case, appellant can no longer be held liable for
illegal possession of firearms.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, penal laws are construed liberally in favor of the
accused.  In this case, the plain
meaning of RA 8294’s simple language is most favorable to herein
appellant.  Verily, no other
interpretation is justified, for the language of the new law demonstrates the
legislative intent to favor the accused.  Accordingly, appellant cannot be convicted of two separate offenses of
illegal possession of firearms and direct assault with attempted homicide.  Moreover, since the crime committed was
direct assault and not homicide or murder, illegal possession of firearms
cannot be deemed an aggravating circumstance.</blockquote>

<p class="XXX"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Just as unacceptable is the interpretation of the trial court.  We find no justification for limiting the proviso
in the second paragraph to murder and homicide.  The law is clear: the accused can be convicted of simple illegal
possession of firearms, provided that “no other crime was committed by the
person arrested.”  If the intention of
the law in the second paragraph were to refer only to homicide and murder, it
should have expressly said so, as it did in the third paragraph.  Verily, where the law does not distinguish,
neither should we.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court is aware that this ruling effectively exonerates
appellant of illegal possession of an M-14 rifle, an offense which normally
carries a penalty heavier than that for direct assault.  While the penalty for the first is <i>prision
mayor</i>, for the second it is only <i>prision correccional.</i>  Indeed, the accused may evade conviction for
illegal possession of firearms by using such weapons in committing an even
lighter offense, like alarm and scandal or slight physical injuries, both of
which are punishable by <i>arresto menor.</i><sup>  </sup>This consequence, however, necessarily arises from the
language of RA 8294, whose wisdom is not subject to the Court’s review.  Any perception that the result reached here
appears unwise should be addressed to Congress.  Indeed, the Court has no discretion to give statutes a new
meaning detached from the manifest intendment and language of the
legislature.  Our task is
constitutionally confined only to applying the law and jurisprudence<sup> </sup>to
the proven facts, and we have so in this case.</blockquote>
