Declared under Tax Declaration No. 3029 in the sum of P710.00."</blockquote>At the time of the sale, there was no cadastral survey in Masantol, Pampanga. Later, the cadastre was conducted, and the property involved in the partition case were specified as Lots 280, 283, 284, 1000-A and 1000-B.

In the unlawful detainer case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court as to possession on the ground that the decision has become final and executory. This means that the petitioners may be evicted. In the <i>accion reinvindicatoria</i>, the Court of Appeals affirmed the ownership of petitioners over the subject land. Hence, the court declared petitioners as the lawful owners of the land.<br><br>Admittedly, the decision in the ejectment case is final and executory. However, the ministerial duty of the court to order execution of a final and executory judgment admits of exceptions. In <i>Lipana vs. Development Bank of Rizal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Supreme Court reiterated the rule "once a decision becomes final and executory, it is the ministerial duty of the court to order its execution, admits of certain exceptions as in cases of special and exceptional nature where it becomes imperative in the higher interest of justice to direct the suspension of its execution (Vecine v. Geronimo, 59 O. G. 579); whenever it is necessary to accomplish the aims of justice (Pascual v. Tan, 85 Phil. 164); or when certain facts and circumstances transpired after the judgment became final which could render the execution of the judgment unjust (Cabrias v. Adil, 135 SCRA 354)."<br><br>In the present case, the stay of execution is warranted by the fact that petitioners are now legal owners of the land in question and are occupants thereof. To execute the judgment by ejecting petitioners from the land that they owned would certainly result in grave injustice. Besides, the issue of possession was rendered moot when the court adjudicated ownership to the spouses Bustos by virtue of a valid deed of sale.<br><br>Placing petitioners in possession of the land in question is the necessary and logical consequence of the decision declaring them as the rightful owners of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> One of the essential attributes of ownership is possession. It follows that as owners of the subject property, petitioners are entitled to possession of the same. "An owner who cannot exercise the seven (7) <i>"juses"</i> or attributes of ownership--the right to possess, to use and enjoy, to abuse or consume, to accessories, to dispose or alienate, to recover or vindicate and to the fruits--is a crippled owner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition.
