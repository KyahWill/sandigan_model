Except with respect to papers emanating from the court, a resort to other modes must be accompanied by a written explanation why the service or filing was not done personally.  A violation of this Rule may be cause to consider the paper as not filed.<br></blockquote>Under the above-quoted provision, service and filing of pleadings and other papers must, whenever practicable, be done personally.  If they are made through other modes, the party concerned must provide a written explanation why the service or filing was not done personally.  If only to underscore the mandatory nature of this innovation to the set of adjective rules requiring personal service whenever practicable, the provision gives the court the discretion to consider a pleading or paper as not filed if the other modes of service or filing were resorted to and no written explanation was made as to why personal service was not done in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Strictest compliance is mandated, lest this provision be rendered meaningless and its sound purpose negated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the merits, respondents’ claim that they are entitled to the protection accorded to purchasers in good faith is well-taken.<br><br>It is a well-established principle that a person dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title issued therefor and the law will in no way oblige him to go behind the certificate to determine the condition of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> He is charged with notice only of such burdens and claims as are annotated on the title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He is considered in law as an innocent purchaser for value or one who buys the property of another without notice that some other person has a right to or interest in such property and pays a full and fair price for the same at the time of such purchase or before he has notice of the claim of another person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>That petitioners did not cause the cancellation of the certificate of title of Mendoza and procure one in their names is not disputed.

Otherwise, public confidence in the certificate of title, and ultimately, the Torrens system, would be impaired, for everyone dealing with registered property would still have to inquire at every instance whether the title has been regularly or irregularly issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>The real purpose of the Torrens system of registration is to quiet title to land and to put a stop to any question of legality of the title except to claims which have been recorded in the certificate of title at the time of registration or which may arise subsequent thereto.  Every registered owner and every subsequent purchaser for value in good faith holds the title to the property free from all encumbrances except those noted in the certificate.  Hence, a purchaser is not required to explore further what the Torrens title on its face indicates in quest for any hidden defect or inchoate right that may subsequently defeat his right thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>In respondents’ case, they did not only rely upon Mendoza’s title.  Rosalia personally inspected the property and verified with the Registry of Deeds of Quezon City if Mendoza was indeed the registered owner.  Given this factual backdrop, respondents did indeed purchase the property in good faith and accordingly acquired valid and indefeasible title thereto.<br><br>The law is thus in respondents’ favor.  Article 1544 of the Civil Code so provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 1544. If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it should be movable property.<br><br>Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property.<br><br>Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to the person who in good faith was first in the possession; and, in the absence thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.<br></blockquote>There being double sale of an immovable property, as the above-quoted provision instructs, ownership shall be transferred (1) to the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property; (2) in default thereof, to the person who in good faith was first in possession; and (3) in default thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The trial and appellate courts thus correctly accorded preferential rights to respondents who had the sale registered in their favor.<br><br>Petitioners claim, however, that the sale between Mendoza and respondents was simulated.<br><br>Simulation occurs when an apparent contract is a declaration of a fictitious will, deliberately made by agreement of the parties, in order to produce, for the purpose of deception, the appearance of a juridical act which does not exist or is different from that which was really executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Its requisites are: a) an outward declaration of will different from the will of the parties; b) the false appearance must have been intended by mutual agreement; and c) the purpose is to deceive third persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The basic characteristic then of a simulated contract is that it is not really desired or intended to produce legal effects or does not in any way alter the juridical situation of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The cancellation of Mendoza’s certificate of title over the property and the procurement of one in its stead in the name of respondents, which acts were directed towards the fulfillment of the purpose of the contract, unmistakably show the parties’ intention to give effect to their agreement.  The claim of simulation does    not thus lie.<br><br>That petitioners and respondents were forced to litigate due to the deceitful acts of the spouses Mendoza, this Court is not unmindful.  It cannot be denied, however, that petitioners’ failure to register the sale in their favor made it possible for the Mendozas to sell the same property to respondents.<br><br>Under the circumstances, this Court cannot come to petitioners’ succor at the expense of respondents-innocent purchasers in good faith.  Petitioners are not without remedy, however.  They may bring an action for damages against the spouses Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Vitug, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez,</i> and<i> Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> At the outset, this Court notes the petitioners’ error in impleading the Court of Appeals as party respondent.
