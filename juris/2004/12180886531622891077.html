Quimbo, Consultant in the Office of the Court Administrator for investigation.&nbsp; Justice Quimbo, however, later voluntarily inhibited himself.&nbsp; Retired Justice Conrado M. Molina, Consultant, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), was designated in his stead in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of September 26, 2001.<br><br><i>A.M. No. MTJ-01-1348<br>Judge Dolores L. Español<br>and Ophelia G. Suluen v.<br>Judge Lorinda T. Mupas<br></i><br>In her Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 24, 1999, Judge Español updated a “confidential report” dated May 15, 1997 complaining of certain irregularities allegedly committed by the respondent judge.&nbsp; The antecedents are summarized by the Court Administrator as follows:<br><blockquote>The complaint of Judge Español stemmed from the dismissal by Judge Mupas of Criminal Case No. 97-0038 entitled “People of the Philippines v. Marcelino Diana” for Violation of Section 16, Article II, Republic Act No. 6425. Diana was apprehended on 16 January 1997 by virtue of Search Warrant No. 334 issued by Judge Español where the search yielded, among others, 249.2 grams of shabu wrapped in twenty-seven (27) plastic sachets, and two (2) decks of shabu wrapped in aluminum foil weighing 1.5 grams.<br><br>On 17 January 1997 a criminal complaint against Diana was filed before the MTC of Dasmariñas. A preliminary investigation was conducted by Judge Mupas on 22 and 30 January 1997 involving prosecution witnesses PO2 Enrico Set, a member of the searching party from the PNP Dasmariñas, Cavite, and Barangay Kagawad Joey Carungcong who was invited to witness the search in the house of Diana.<br><br>On 7 February 1997 Judge Mupas issued a Resolution recommending the dismissal of the case for lack of probable cause. She ruled that there was a clear violation of the constitutional right of the accused against unreasonable searches and seizure; moreover, “glaring irregularities” in the search rendered the prohibited drugs confiscated from the house of Diana totally inadmissible as evidence.&nbsp; The judge pointed out that during the preliminary investigation, Kagawad Joey Carungcong testified that he never actually witnessed the search; as a matter of fact, nobody witnessed it. Carungcong narrated that on 16 January 1997 at about 4:45 in the afternoon, he was fetched from his office by two policemen to assist them in searching the house of Diana.&nbsp; Carungcong said that no illegal drugs were recovered therefrom.&nbsp; He was nevertheless informed that several plastic sachets containing shabu were found in one of the rooms of the house.&nbsp; Carungcong also revealed that he was informed that when he arrived at the place, the police had already conducted the search of the house without witnesses and that he saw Diana outside his house already handcuffed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>In a verified Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated May 27, 1999, Judge Español alleged that the respondent was involved in collecting “premiums” from detention prisoners who apply for bail bonds in her <i>sala</i>. It was also alleged that the respondent judge “readily acted on bailable offenses but would leave out cases where the detention prisoners could not afford to post bail or are charged with non-bailable offenses.”&nbsp; The complainant judge continued, thus:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">… [I]n her own terms, she [Judge Mupas] claimed that detention prisoners left in the cell are those who are already “pigang-piga na” and one way of doing this is to threaten to transfer them to the Provincial Jail in Trece Martires, Cavite.&nbsp; This matter is corroborated when Judge Mupas raised this issue in her letter to me dated April 30, 1999, stating that “In one case, in People vs. Marcel Morales, docketed as Criminal Case No. 98-0726, I ordered his commitment from the Municipal Jail of Dasmariñas, Cavite to the Provincial Jail of Trece Martirez City only to find out later that you have already approved his application for bail and ordered his release from custody;”<br></div><ol start="12"><li>Furthermore, while the above matters were looked into personally by the undersigned and in the presence of Mrs. Ophelia Suluen, Warden Alejandra dela Cruz and JO1 Pabillar begged to be excused from signing their sworn statements for fear of retribution from Judge Mupas, hence, efforts exerted by the undersigned to present their sworn statements failed;<br><br></li><li>Likewise, JO1 Pabillar alleged that they were called by Judge Mupas last Friday, May 21, 1999, and emphasized to them that thenceforth the money for the bailbond (<i>sic</i>) premiums should not be given to Belen [Seperedad Robles], but to one Erlinda Carreon, a civilian employee of the Philippine National Police of Dasmariñas.&nbsp; This is a subtle admission that, indeed, some of her staff were involved in this nefarious activity prohibited under Administrative Circular No. 5, dated October 4, 1998.&nbsp; This could be the reason why Judge Mupas is emboldened to challenge that the undersigned name names because she has already prevailed upon these people not to meddle in this matter and, with her clout and even threats, she may have succeeded; …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Attached to the complaint was an Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> executed by Ophelia G. Suluen, Legal Researcher, Regional Trial Court, Dasmariñas, Cavite, Branch 90, where she alleged that the respondent judge gave her a call and told her “<i>Pakisabi mo kay Judge Español na magkakaproblema siya sa mga nirelease nya, kasi reject sa akin dahil yung iba, maraming pending na kaso</i>,” and “<i>Malaki kasi ang kita sa piyansa</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>According to Suluen, between 10:00 to 10:30 a.m. of April 27, 1999, Ricardo Pabillar, a jail guard at the municipal jail of Dasmariñas, Cavite, came to their court to inquire about the bail bond of one Rogelio Drio, which she had received the day before.&nbsp; Drio was detained for a case pending in the MTC, Dasmariñas, Cavite, in the sala of the respondent judge.&nbsp; She then referred the matter of Drio’s bail bond to Judge Español, who, in turn, called jail guard Pabillar to her chambers.&nbsp; Pabillar then told Judge Español that detention prisoners applying for bail preferred the jailers to process their bail bond papers as the latter charged only 15% of the prescribed bail, whereas the staff of the respondent judge would ask for “processing fees” equivalent to 20% of the recommended bail.&nbsp; Only 10%-11% would go to the bonding company while the rest was pocketed by the respondent’s staff. Judge Español, thereafter, approved the bailbond of Drio in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated April 27, 1999.<br><br>During the hearing of the case, Suluen testified that Judge Español acted on bail bond applications for cases pending in other courts in Cavite, such as Criminal Cases Nos. 99-0435, 01-2020 and 01-2022, all pending in the respondent judge’s <i>sala</i>.&nbsp; Suluen also admitted in open court that persons following up bail bonds used to give them P100 to P200 for snacks for the staff, which included Judge Español.&nbsp; She explained on redirect examination that although Judge Español was also given snacks bought with the money in question, the latter had not known the source of the money.<br><br>Ma. Lourdes M. Sapinoso, Court Clerk III, RTC, Branch 90, in her Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated November 20, 2001, stated that people who come to their court for approval of bail bond applications often complained about employees of other courts, particularly those from the <i>sala</i> of the respondent judge, who asked for amounts equivalent to 30% of the required bond.&nbsp; This was apparently the consideration for the approval of the bond and the issuance of the order of release of the accused.&nbsp; There were also instances when requests for copies of the complaint were denied, allegedly for the purpose of compelling people to post their bail bond before the municipal trial court.&nbsp; Because of this and for “humanitarian considerations,” Judge Español approved bailbond applications of cases pending before the <i>sala</i> of the respondent judge.<br><br>Pilarica Baldejera also testified for the complainant judge.&nbsp; In her Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated April 15, 2002, she deposed that the accused in Criminal Cases Nos. 99-0892, 99-1129 and 02-0609, Rodel Baldejera y Villo, was her son, and that the said cases were pending before the <i>sala</i> of the respondent judge.&nbsp; She testified that on April 14, 2002, she went to the office of Judge Español with a certain Eric from the Governor’s Office.&nbsp; She returned to the complainant judge the next day at about 1:00 to 1:30 p.m. and told her about her son’s bail problem.&nbsp; She was advised to see the respondent judge at her office in Dasmariñas. Baldejera arrived there at about 3:00 p.m., and personally requested the respondent judge to allow her son to post bail.&nbsp; The respondent told her to raise a cash bond of P30,000 and to deliver the money to her (the respondent’s) office.&nbsp; The latter subsequently told her to see one Inday Carreon at the PNP station.&nbsp; The witness waited for two hours but no one came.<br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the respondent judge denied the charges against her, contending that they were malicious imputations, hearsay and without factual and legal basis.&nbsp; She stated that she received two letters from Judge Español dated April 28, 1999 and May 5, 1999, respectively.&nbsp; She then sent her respective replies thereto on April 30, 1999 and on May 12, 1999.&nbsp; The respondent judge stated that she forwarded a query to the Court in a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated April 28, 1999, where she questioned the legality and propriety of the acts of Judge Español in approving bail bonds and releasing the accused under detention whose cases were filed before her (respondent judge’s) sala for preliminary investigation.&nbsp; The respondent claimed that Judge Español did so despite the fact that there was no showing that she (the respondent) was absent or on leave when the applications for bail were approved.&nbsp; The respondent judge listed the cases adverted to, to wit:<br><blockquote>For your reference, hereunder are (<i>sic</i>) the lists (<i>sic</i>) of cases filed before my sala for preliminary investigation whose applications for bail were approved by Judge Español and thereafter, upon her orders, the accused were released from custody.<br><ol><li>Crim.

Clorina-Rentoy to submit a draft decision in Criminal Case No. 99-0840, and that there was no indication that she had any hand in its preparation, or that she made such a request.<br><br><center><b>The Findings of Justice Molina</b><br></center><br>According to Jus tice Molina, none of the employees came forward during the investigation to affirm that the respondent judge had required them to perform domestic chores in her household.&nbsp; The charges of alleged illegal and corrupt practices of the respondent judge, particularly the alleged proclivity to ask for bribe money before deciding cases, were based wholly on incompetent and hearsay evidence.&nbsp; Furthermore, the alleged ownership of the respondent judge of two houses in Silang, Cavite, was not established. Thus:<br><blockquote>Judge Español cited Atty. Estrella O. Laysa as her source of information regarding the alleged proclivity of respondent Judge to ask for “<i>lagay</i>” before deciding her cases. Replying to Judge Español’s letter Atty. Laysa wrote back (Exh. “F,” pp. 116-118, Id.) that as counsel for the plaintiff in an ejectment suit she prepared a decision in favor of her client at the bidding of the respondent Judge but the decision would not come out because, as an employee of the court told her, she has not given something to the judge. Because her client would not agree to bribing or entrapping the respondent she just filed a motion to decide, and within fifteen days the decision was promulgated which was an adoption of the draft that she had prepared.<br><br>Obviously, the foregoing account of Judge Español of the alleged illegal and corrupt practices of the respondent judge is based wholly on incompetent hearsay and double hearsay evidence. It is on record that upon application of the complainant two subpoenas were issued and served on Atty. Laysa but the lawyer shunned the investigation.<br><br>The ownership of Judge Mupas of the two houses in Silang, Cavite, and another in Tagaytay City photographed by SPO4 Rommel G. Macatlang (Exhs. “I-1” to “J-3”) has not been established. Mr. Macatlang did not state his basis for concluding that the houses in Silang are owned by this respondent Judge; as to the Tagaytay City residence, he merely mentioned his interview of people in the vicinity who told him the house belonged to the judge because they used to see her and her husband oversee its construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Justice Molina found that Asst. Provincial Prosecutor Duque was not a totally impartial witness, considering that she and Judge Español had previously worked together and was the latter’s clerk of court for two years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> However, Justice Molina found that the respondent judge had, indeed, attempted to influence Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Duque to resolve Criminal Case No. 98-0681 in favor of the accused, albeit without a direct offer of bribe money.&nbsp; As such, according to Justice Molina, the respondent judge violated Canon 2.04 and Canon 3 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Justice Molina also made a finding that Atty.

While the Court will never tolerate or condone any conduct, act or omission that would violate the norm of public accountability or diminish the people’s faith in the judiciary, nonetheless, we have repeatedly stated that the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt in administrative cases is substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.

She went to the respondent’s court and waited for the respondent and as she was showing the Motion, respondent asked “MAGKANO BA AT PARA SAAN IYAN,” and after reading it, she remarked: “AYON SI INDAY. MAGKANO BA ANG SINABI NI INDAY.” When affiant mentioned “EIGHT FIVE,” respondent accordingly answered, “EIGHT FIVE PALA, MAGKANO BA ANG PERA MO,” and when affiant replied “FIVE LANG,” respondent averred, “DUON NA LAMANG SA IMUS AYUSIN AT ALAM NILA IYON” (Annex “G”);<br><br>h) Magkasamang Sinumpaang Salaysay of Celia Gervacio and Narlyn Reyes, attesting to the fact that they went to the respondent court to inquire as to how much is the bond of Joel Gervacio and Orly Reyes for alleged “Carnapping” and they were told that it was P180,000.00 while, for Robbery it was P100,000.00.&nbsp; Since they could not afford the quoted amounts, they decided to see a friend who advised them to secure the services of a lawyer.

Ignorance of the law, which everyone is bound to know, excuses no one – not even judges – from compliance therewith.&nbsp; …&nbsp; Canon 4 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics requires that the judge should be studious in the principles of law.&nbsp; Canon 18 mandates that he should administer his office with due regard to the integrity of the system of the law itself, remembering that he is not a depository of arbitrary power, but a judge under sanction of law. Indeed, it has been said that when the inefficiency springs from a failure to consider a basic and elementary rule, a law or principle in the discharge of his duties, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the title he holds or is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>Indeed, a judge should so behave at all times as to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Furthermore, a judge should be the embodiment of competence, integrity, and independence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and should uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Clearly then, the respondent judge displayed gross ignorance of the law in failing to observe the requirement of a finding of probable cause before ordering the arrest of the accused in a criminal case.&nbsp; Section 8, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended, classifies administrative charges as serious, less serious, or light.&nbsp; Gross ignorance of the law or procedure and gross misconduct constituting violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct are classified as serious charges.<br><br><i>On the issue of approval<br>of bail bonds</i><br><br>It is apparent from a perusal of the letters, complaints, and the pleadings filed by Judge Español and the respondent judge that the two have had some brewing “personal differences” between them.&nbsp; As observed by the OCA in its Report:<br><blockquote>In her letters to Judge Español dated 30 April 1999 and 12 May 1999 (annexes “H” and “H-I”) Judge Mupas expressed her view on Mupas regarding where the application for bail should be made.&nbsp; According to the judge, the provision of the rules on bail are clear in that the accused can only file bail in a court where the case concerned is pending.&nbsp; The Regional Trial Court is prohibited from acting on applications for bail of detention prisoners whose cases are filed and pending before another court unless the judge thereof is absent or unavailable.&nbsp; Judge Mupas cited as her basis Section 17(a) of Rule 114 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure…<br><br>Judge Mupas counter-charged that Judge Español herself acted on applications for bail and ordered the release of the accused in some cases pending before the sala of Mupas for preliminary investigation although the latter was not on leave of absence.<br><br><center>…<br></center><br>On the matter of where applications for bail should be filed, Judge Español argued that there is no law or rule prohibiting her from approving bail even if the case is already pending in other courts.&nbsp; She cited Section 17(c), Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, which states that “any person in custody who is not yet charged in court may apply for bail with any court in the province, city or municipality where he is held.”<br><br>Judge Español mentioned in the case of <i>People v. Marcel Morales</i> <i>(Criminal Case No. 98-0726)</i> where Judge Mupas was upset when she ordered the release of the accused despite the fact that this case is for violation of anti-drug law, well within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court.

(a) of said Section 17 of Rule 114.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court shall thus settle the matter of the issuance of bail bonds.<br><br>It is settled that a judge who conducted the preliminary investigation, who has jurisdiction over the place where the accused was arrested, has authority to grant bail and to order the release of the accused even if the records of the case had been transmitted for review to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> A municipal judge conducting a preliminary examination and for admission of the accused to bail is tasked to determine whether there is probable cause against the accused and, if so, whether the evidence of guilt is strong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This can, likewise, be gleaned from Section 5, Rule 114 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Duty of investigating judge</i>. – Within ten (10) days after the conclusion of the preliminary investigation, the investigating judge shall transmit to the provincial or city fiscal, for appropriate action, the resolution of the case stating briefly the findings of facts and the law supporting his action, together with the entire records of the case, which shall include: (a) the warrant, if the arrest is by virtue of a warrant; (b) the affidavits and the other supporting evidence of the parties; (c) <i>the undertaking or bail of the accused</i>; (d) <i>the order of release of the accused and cancellation of his bailbond (sic), if the resolution is for the dismissal of the complaint</i>.<br><br>Should the provincial or city fiscal disagree with the findings of the investigating judge on the existence of probable cause, the fiscal’s ruling shall prevail, but he must explain his action in writing furnishing the parties with copies of his resolution, not later than thirty (30) days from receipt of the records from the judge.&nbsp; If the accused is detained, the fiscal shall order his release.<br></blockquote>Furthermore, according to Section 17(a), Rule 114 –<br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Bail where filed</i>.- (a) Bail in the amount fixed may be filed with the court where the case is pending, or, in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with another branch of the same court within the province or city.&nbsp; If the accused is arrested in a province, city or municipality other than where the case is pending, bail may be filed also with any other regional trial court of said place, or, if no judge thereof is available, with any metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge or municipal circuit trial judge therein.<br></blockquote>The scenarios envisioned in this provision were enunciated in <i>De los Santos v. Mangino</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><blockquote>The foregoing provision anticipates two (2) situations. First, the accused is arrested in the same province, city or municipality where his case is pending.&nbsp; Second, the accused is arrested in the province, city or municipality other than where his case is pending.&nbsp; In the first situation, the accused may file bail in the court where his case is pending or, in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with another branch of the same court within the province or city.&nbsp; In the second situation, the accused has two options.&nbsp; First, he may file bail in the court where his case is pending or, second, he may file bail with any regional trial court in the province, city or municipality where he was arrested.&nbsp; When no regional trial court judge is available, he may file bail with any municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit trial judge therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>If it happens for instance, that the accused was in detention during the preliminary investigation conducted by the municipal trial court but wished to put up bail after the records of the investigation had been forwarded to the fiscal, bail may be filed not in the municipal trial court which fixed the amount of his bail but with the Regional Trial Court of the place where he is being held.&nbsp; Also, if no charge has as yet been filed but the person under arrest would wish to go on temporary liberty, he may apply for bail with any court in the province, city or municipality where he is held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> However, when the preliminary investigation has been concluded and the judge has recommended the filing of the corresponding information against the accused and had forwarded the records of the case to the Provincial Prosecutor, the court loses its preliminary jurisdiction over the said case.&nbsp; Having been divested of jurisdiction over the case, the municipal trial court no longer has any authority to issue any order or directive in connection therewith, especially such as would involve the liberty of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Thus, a judge who approves applications for bail of accused whose cases were not only pending in other courts but who were, likewise, arrested and detained outside his territorial jurisdiction is guilty of gross ignorance of the law and violates Rule 3.01 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It must be emphasized that rules of procedure have been formulated and promulgated by this Court to ensure the speedy and efficient administration of justice.&nbsp; Failure to abide by these rules undermines the wisdom behind them and diminishes respect for the law.&nbsp; Judges should ensure strict compliance therewith at all times in their respective jurisdictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>By her own admission, Judge Español acted on bail bond applications of several accused whose cases were pending before the respondent judge, and issued orders of release thereon.&nbsp; The records are unclear, however, as to whether the said accused were arrested within her territorial jurisdiction.&nbsp; We note that in A.M. No. RTJ-04-1850,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Judge Español was found guilty of gross ignorance of the law for granting a hold-departure order in a case not assigned to her <i>sala</i>, and was fined P5,000 therefor.&nbsp; We stated thus:<br><blockquote>The powers of an executive judge relate only to those necessary or incidental to the performance of his/her functions in relation to court administration.<br><br>Time and again the Court has adverted to the solemn obligation of judges to be very zealous in the discharge of their bounden duties. Nonetheless, the earnest efforts of judges to promote a speedy administration of justice must at all times be exercised with due recognition of the boundaries and limits of their jurisdiction or authority.&nbsp; Respondent’s ardent determination to expedite the case and render prompt justice may be a noble objective but she did so in a manner which took away from the complainant MTC judge the initiative which by constitutional and legal mandates properly belongs to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>However, considering that Judge Español compulsorily retired from the service on January 9, 2004 after fourteen (14) years of service in the judiciary, she can no longer be charged for the aforesaid acts.<br><br>Let this be a reminder to judges and executive judges alike not to arrogate upon themselves the authority of issuing orders which do not properly belong to their respective jurisdictions.&nbsp; Such conflicts and hostilities between judges serve no purpose but to put the Court in a bad light, a situation we can ill afford during these difficult and trying times.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, conformably to Section 11(A) of Rule 140<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended, for gross ignorance of the law and violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent Judge Lorinda Mupas is meted a <b>FINE</b> of Twenty-One Thousand Pesos (P21,000).<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Austria-Martinez, (Acting Chairman),</i> and <i>Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Puno, J., (Chairman),</i> on official leave.<br><i>Tinga, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Joint Report and Recommendation, pp. 2-3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 168.&nbsp; (A.M.

Even lawyers are not exempted from her sharp tongue, as she would on occasion utter unsavory words against the lawyers and litigants.<br><br>5.2 In one case (People of the Philippines versus Bienvenido Dimailig, Criminal Case No. 99-0840, For: Violation of BP 22), Judge Mupas sent a note through my client, which reads “draft decision” (A copy of the said note is hereto attached marked as <b>Annex “A”</b> and made an integral part hereof).&nbsp; Since this is unethical, I did not draft the decision.<br><br>5.3 She has referred to me for handling a few cases for annulment.&nbsp; While the said cases were not before her sala, I found out that she was actually charging fees for the said cases, despite having referred them to me, as the client blurted out that the handling of her case was very expensive, when I had not even billed anything for my services!&nbsp; Moreover, she would even remind me to do things for these cases, such as draft, prepare and file pleadings or motions (as shown by a copy of her note dated 30 October 1997 hereto attached marked as <b>Annex “B”</b> and made an integral part hereof), which she referred to me, indicating that she was actually monitoring their development, as if she was supervising the conduct and the handling of the cases.<br><br>In one instance, particularly in the case of “Marissa A. Cabrido-Angeles vs. Ramil M. Angeles,” Civil Case No. 1831-99, unbeknownst to me, she even prepared a motion and signed it for me (a copy of which is hereto attached marked <b>Annex “C”</b> and made an integral part hereof), which I discovered as she had sent it to and was received [by] my office.&nbsp; In other words, if I were the movant, and I had actually made the motion, why would I send a copy and have it received at my office?<br><br>5.4 In a criminal case entitled “People of the Philippine[s] versus Eva Malihan, et al.,” she granted bail to the accused Eva Malihan who is accused of a capital offense of Syndicated Estafa <u>without conducting any hearing</u>.&nbsp; She did this by issuing a resolution downgrading the charge to simple estafa, but which upon review by the Provincial Prosecutor was reversed (A copy of said review resolution dated 10 January 2002 is hereto attached marked as <b>Annex “D”</b> and made an integral part hereof), but unfortunately the respondents were by then able to hide and escape the charges.&nbsp; An administrative case has been filed with the Supreme Court docketed as Administrative Case No. 01-1116-MTJ (Rollo, pp. 126-127).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Joint Report and Recommendation, pp. 33-34; TSN, 9 August 2002, p. 47.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Exhibit “K-10.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Entitled “<i>In Re: Petition for Habeas Corpus of Detention Prisoners Eden Esplago and Rowena Esplago, Cherry Esplago v.
