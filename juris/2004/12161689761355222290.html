				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the July 21, 2000 decision of the Regional Trial Court of Toledo City, Branch 59 finding him guilty of rape, appellant Mario “Bolantoy” Cabalse lodged the present appeal.<br><br>In her complaint dated September 6, 1994, private complainant Milagros E.

Canedo, and Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Hermes L. Labrador were presented by the prosecution.<br><br>Milagros, a house helper and 28 years old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> at the time she testified on June 16, 1998, narrated as follows:<br><br>On June 12, 1994, at around 8:30 in the evening, she and her younger brother Lunecito were on their way to the house of appellant to watch television.<br><br>On their way, they met appellant, his wife Tomasa, and the spouses’ four-year old child Aloy who were near a hut fronting appellant’s house. After seeking permission to watch television, all of them, except appellant’s wife, proceeded to the house of appellant and watched television.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>While they were watching television, appellant sent Lunecito and Aloy on an errand to buy cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> After the Sharon Cuneta show was over, Milagros continued watching television as she awaited her brother.<br><br>When Milagros was about to go out of the house, appellant blocked her way and closed and locked the door.

You are having sexual intercourse, here.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Feeling insulted, she cried and left the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On her way home, she met her brother by the road. She did not, however, disclose the incident to him because she was scared, knowing that appellant had already stabbed a certain Raul, and is known in the place as the “worst person.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>She too did not report the incident to her mother as appellant threatened to kill her if she did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Weeks after the incident or on July 4, 1994, her mother was informed by her aunt (the sister of her mother) that the wife of appellant had been spreading rumors about it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Her mother thus mauled her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> She explained to her mother, however, that she was forced to have sex with appellant. She and her mother thus repaired to the Barangay Captain to file a complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> She later submitted herself to a medical examination by Dr. Labrador of the Toledo City Hospital and to Dr. Grace Nardo of the Southern Island Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Complainant’s brother Lunecito corroborated Milagros’ tale that on the evening of June 12, 1994, he accompanied her sister to watch television at the house of appellant and that he was sent on an errand by appellant to buy cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Lunecito went on to declare that he still had to wake up the owner of the store, hence, it took him forty-five (45) minutes to carry out the errand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Upon his return to the house of appellant, Tomasa who was already there<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> was apparently angry at appellant, she uttering words like “he was not yet closing (sic) the zipper of the pants.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Inside the house, his sister who was crying and standing at the door<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> at once summoned him to leave the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Milagros did not divulge anything to him that night, but he later learned about the rape incident from his mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>At the witness stand, Dr. Labrador testified that upon physical examination of Milagros, he noted old healed lacerations of her hymen at 6 and 9 o’clock positions indicating that she was no longer a virgin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Aside from the healed lacerations, he noted no injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Denying the accusation, appellant gave the following tale:<br><br>On June 12, 1994 at 9:00 o’clock in the evening, while he, his wife and children were asleep, he was awakened by a woman who was uttering outside their house “Bolantoy, Bolantoy w[a]ke up.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Looking out of the window, he saw Milagros who said “Toy, I have to watch your t.v.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He refused to let her in because his children were all asleep and he had to work the next day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In the meantime, his wife who was roused from her sleep admonished Milagros, saying “What’s happening with you woman, why [are] you tempt[ing] my husband, are you itching? [W]hy don’t you look for a bachelor [some]where?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Milagros responded by uttering “You might regret Nang Masing, you might kneel before me someday.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The following morning, his neighbor asked him “What was done (<i>sic</i>) Bolantoy, you were offered to have sex with her in your house?”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It was then that he found out that earlier that morning, his wife had been spreading rumors that Milagros had offered to have sex with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Sometime after the incident, he again met Milagros who, however, made no mention of any complaint against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On July 18, 1994, his aunt having offered him a job, he left for Mindanao.<br><br>On September 27, 1997, he was arrested in Davao, and it was only then that he learned that Milagros had filed a complaint for rape against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>His aunt, whom he requested to go to complainant’s house to    inquire why he was charged of rape, later informed him that the complaint would    only be dropped if he agreed to pay One Hundred Thousand (P100,000) Pesos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s wife Tomasa also took the witness stand for the defense. She corroborated appellant’s account of Milagros’ going to their residence as she wanted to watch television. She went on to declare that she scolded Milagros.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Tomasa further declared that the next day, June 13, 1994, her neighbors asked why they were noisy the previous night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> She found out that her neighbors including Romeo Geralla and Eustaquia Geralla were likewise awakened by the noise created by the incident the previous night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Continuing, Tomasa declared that Milagros is lecherous and was always looking for appellant whenever she was not around,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> drawing her (Tomasa) to at one time tell Milagros that “You have not tempted anybody so now you wanted to tempt my husband;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and that believing that the complaint for rape against appellant was sparked by her alleged defamatory remarks against Milagros, she did not inform appellant, who was then in Davao, that a complaint for rape had been filed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Tomasa furthermore declared that while appellant was in Davao, she came to know that Milagros got pregnant and she in fact noticed that Milagros’ stomach was big.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> She later heard that she (Milagros) had an abortion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Upon the instance of the mother of Milagros, she appeared before the Barangay Captain as it was suspected that she was the source of rumors of Milagros’ alleged pregnancy and abortion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Finding for the prosecution, the trial court convicted appellant by Decision of July 21, 2000, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the accused MARIO CABALSE, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and hereby sentences him to suffer the the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, and to indemnify the private offended party, MILAGROS E. CANEDO, the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00). Costs against accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>In his appeal, appellant raises the following errors of the trial court:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE GLARING INCONSISTENCIES IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<br><center><br>II.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING DUE CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT DESPITE THE UNEXPLAINED DELAY OF THE LATTER IN REPORTING THE ALLEGED RAPE INCIDENT TO THE POLICE AUTHORITIES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court finds that the prosecution has not established the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of appellant.<br><br>The medical evidence which was credited by the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> taken alone, does not prove the commission of rape. By Milagros’ own admission, the incident complained of was not the first time that she had sexual intercourse with a man, she having priorly had sexual congress with her boyfriend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Medical evidence of course is not indispensable. An accused can still be convicted of rape on the basis of the sole testimony of the private complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> if it is clear and free from serious contradictions, and her sincerity and candor is beyond suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>By Milagros’ account, after appellant took his time to engage in foreplay, his penis penetrated her vagina, without her putting up any resistance.<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you were already nude from waist below accused Cabalse lick[ed] your thighs, am I right?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And in fact he even lick[ed] your vagina, is that right?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">He just played with it.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">How did he play with your vagina?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">By using his finger.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When accused lick[ed] your thigh and played with your sex organ with his hand, you were titillated, am I right?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">No, Sir, I did not feel the titillation.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">But you were sexually arouse[d]?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">No sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Can you give an estimate of (sic) how long did accused lick your thigh and played with your sex organ?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">I do not know, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did it continue for a long time?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">After he was satisfied in playing [with] my vagina he even inserted his penis inside my vagina.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When he inserted his penis into your vagina, was your thighs separated from each other?</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><u>He was able to penetrate your vagina with his penis because you did not move your hips in order to avoid being penetrated by his penis, am I right?</u></div></td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><u>Yes, sir.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Such passive act of Milagros negates the commission of rape. For a ravished woman would instinctively call for help or at best flee from her lecherous captor to safer grounds when opportunities present themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>When Milagros was pressed whether she tried to ask for help, she gave conflicting answers.

shouted for help, it is difficult to accord her credence.<br><br>Even Milagros’ claim that appellant employed a knife to intimidate her into total submission and immobility raises nagging doubts.<br><br>Milagros had testified that while she was being raped, appellant, <u>using his left hand, pointed a knife</u> at the right side of her body, as he, <u>with his right hand, removed her shorts and underwear</u>.<br><blockquote><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td

used by appellant, is a material fact to prove the element of force or intimidation, in light of the absence of any showing in the records that Milagros exerted effort to extricate herself from the hands of appellant, or at least to prevent penetration of her vagina. Milagros’ narration on the matter is, however, punctuated with inconsistencies and vagueness. It is apparent that she chose to lie prone and unresisting. Her claim that she struggled to resist the accused came only after appellant’s counsel suggested it to her during cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>More doubts on the credibility of Milagros’ testimony. She narrated that right after she was sexually assaulted, the wife of appellant walked in, saw her putting back her panty and shorts, and insulted her. If this account were true, human nature and experience would have expected her to protest to appellant’s wife and complain to her indignantly. She, however, did not. She instead cried from “embarrassment.”<br><br>In fine, Milagros’ testimony does not pass the test of credibility.<br><br>This leaves it unnecessary to still dwell on the testimony of Milagros’ brother Lunecito. Suffice it to state that his testimony does not even jibe with Milagros’. For example, Milagros claimed that after she left the house of appellant, she met Lunecito by the road. Luncecito, upon the other hand, claimed that on returning to the house of appellant, his sister, who was standing at the door and crying, at once summoned him to leave the house.<br><br>Neither is it still necessary to pass on the merits of the evidence for the defense which is unarguably weak.
