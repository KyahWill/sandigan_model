				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Agrarian laws were enacted to help small farmers uplift their economic status by providing them with a modest standard of living sufficient to meet their needs for food, clothing, shelter and other basic necessities.&nbsp; The law grants them the right to constitute a home lot as their dwelling and subsistence.&nbsp; Because it is intimately connected with the tenancy relationship of the landowner and the agricultural lessee, any dispute regarding its transfer, removal or retention falls within the jurisdiction of the DARAB --the quasi-judicial body specially tasked to hear and adjudicate all agrarian disputes, matters or incidents involved in or related to the implementation of agrarian laws.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the May 29, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the March 13, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 45948.&nbsp; The assailed Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is hereby <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.&nbsp; The Decision appealed from is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span> and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>.&nbsp; The complaint against [respondent] is ordered <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The challenged Resolution denied reconsideration of the Decision.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>The CA narrates the facts in this wise:<br><blockquote>“The agricultural lot in question, designated as Lot No. 26, is situated at Poblacion, San Rafael, Bulacan, and covered by TCT No. RT-6304.&nbsp; Along with another parcel of land with an area of 2½ hectares, it was originally owned by Maria Lopez Caluag (<span style="font-style: italic;">or “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Caluag</span>”</span>), who is now deceased.&nbsp; The original tenant-tiller of this agricultural land was the late Aqui[li]no Villena, husband of [respondent], Susana Mag[-I]sa Villena (<span style="font-style: italic;">or “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Susana</span>”</span>).&nbsp; The tenancy relationship dated back to 1946 and continued even after the demise of Aquilino through his surviving spouse, Susana.<br><br>“In 1957, upon the instruction of Caluag, the house of Susana was transferred to the subject lot, because Caluag had given Susana a portion thereof with an area of 1000 square meters as [home lot] and seedbed.&nbsp; Since then, Susana had been in peaceful possession thereof until 1987 when a case for ejectment was filed against her by [petitioners] Eugenio Bautista, Romeo Cruz and Carmencita B.

IAC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> we explained the reason for this rule:<br><blockquote>“Under Article 428 of the New Civil Code, the owner has the right to dispose of a thing without other limitations than those established by law.&nbsp; As an incident of ownership therefore, there is nothing to prevent a landowner from [transferring] his naked title to the land.&nbsp; However, the new owner must respect the rights of the tenant.&nbsp; Section 7 of R.A. No. 3844, as amended (Code of Agrarian Reforms of the Philippines) gives the agricultural lessee the right to work on the landholding once the leasehold relationship is established.&nbsp; It also entitles him to security of tenure on his landholding.&nbsp; He can only be ejected by the court for cause.&nbsp; Time and again, this Court has guaranteed the continuity and security of tenure of a tenant even in cases of a mere transfer of legal possession.&nbsp; As elucidated in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bernardo v. Court of Appeals</span> (168 SCRA 439 [1988]), security of tenure is a legal concession to agricultural lessees which they value as life itself and deprivation of their landholdings is tantamount to deprivation of their only means of livelihood.&nbsp; Also, under Section 10 of the same Act, the law explicitly provides that the leasehold relation is not extinguished by the alienation or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding.&nbsp; The only instances when the agricultural leasehold relationship is extinguished are found in Sections 8, 28 and 36 of the Code of Agrarian Reforms of the Philippines.&nbsp; x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Tenancy Dispute</span></span><br><br>To justify respondent’s ejectment, petitioners argue that no tenancy relationship exists with respect to the subject lot, since the property is a residential and not an agricultural land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> They further contend that even on the assumption that a tenancy relationship existed, the CA erred in considering the area as respondent’s home lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> According to them, a home lot should be constituted on the farm that the lessee is tilling, not on the residential lot of the landowner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> For these reasons, they claim that jurisdiction lies with the regular courts, not with the DARAB.<br><br>There is no legal basis for petitioners’ restrictive interpretation of the jurisdiction of the DARAB.&nbsp; Its jurisdiction encompasses “all agrarian disputes, cases, controversies, and matters or incidents involving the implementation of all agrarian laws.”&nbsp; A home lot is incident to a tenant’s rights.&nbsp; The right to retain or remove it is therefore an agrarian dispute that should be resolved by the DARAB.<br><br>Not binding on the courts is the Certification issued by the municipal agrarian reform officer of San Rafael, Bulacan, that respondent is “NOT a bonafide tenant of a parcel of land registered in the name of EUGENIO BAUTISTA, et al.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In a given locality, merely preliminary or provisional are the certifications or findings of the secretary of agrarian reform (or of an authorized representative) concerning the presence or the absence of a tenancy relationship between the contending parties; hence, such certifications do not bind the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Moreover, in this case the CA found the Certification to have been issued without any prior investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that even if the tenurial arrangement had been severed, the action still involved an agrarian dispute.&nbsp; On this point, this Court has ruled:<br><blockquote>“x x x.

The same may have arisen, and often times arises, precisely from the previous termination of such relationship. If the same existed immediately, or shortly, before the controversy and the subject-matter thereof is whether or not said relationship has been lawfully terminated, or if the dispute otherwise springs or originates from the relationship of landlord and tenant, the litigation is (then) cognizable only by the [DARAB].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Entitlement to a Home Lot</span></span><br><br>Tenants are entitled to home lots located at a convenient and suitable place within the landholder’s property, where they can construct and maintain their houses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; These home lots will be considered as part of the tenants’ leasehold. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The right to a home lot is provided under the following provision of RA 1199,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> as amended by RA 2263:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><blockquote>"Sec. 22.
