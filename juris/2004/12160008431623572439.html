Adriano P. Damalerio of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO).&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Information was read and translated to him in his own <span style="font-style: italic;">Visayan</span> dialect, he entered <span style="font-weight: bold;">a plea of guilty to the offense charged</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Immediately, in conformity with the procedural rules, the trial judge asked appellant searching questions to determine whether his plea of guilty is voluntary and whether he understands its consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to the questions propounded by the trial judge, appellant declared that his plea is voluntary and that he fully comprehends its consequences.<br><br>The trial judge then directed the prosecution to present evidence to prove appellant’s guilt and the degree of his culpability.<br><br>Francisca Buchan, Odelion Manco and Dr. Francisco D. Villaflor testified for the prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their testimonies show that&nbsp; in the early evening of October 20, 2000, 77-year old Catalina Baluran was alone in her house at Sitio Upper Poblacion I, Sikatuna, Bohol.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her niece, Caridad Baluran living with her, was rushed to the hospital by their neighbors, Francisca Buchan and Odelion Manco, due to an asthma attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before they left, they&nbsp; saw appellant Rey Apatay, their neighbor, standing near the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The following morning, Francisca and Odelion learned from their neighbors that Catalina could not be found in her house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alarmed, Francisca, together with some neighbors, went to Catalina’s house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once inside, they saw drops of blood and a piece of firewood on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, they looked for her.&nbsp; Appellant helped in the search.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On October 22, 2000, the lifeless body of Catalina was found inside the hole of an abandoned toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp; That same day,&nbsp;Dr. Francisco Romulo D. Villaflor, Medical Health Officer of Sikatuna, Bohol, conducted a <span style="font-style: italic;">post-mortem</span> examination on her cadaver and issued a <span style="font-style: italic;">Post Mortem</span> Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> showing the following injuries she sustained:<blockquote>“macerated (L) maxillary area<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extending to zygoma<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (L) lateral priodital area.<br><br>(+) hematoma/ecclymotes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (R) maxillo-zygomatic area<br><br>(+) hematoma area ecchymotes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (L) supraclavicular area<br><br>(+) Ecchymoses ant. neck<br><br>(+) hamatoma (R) supraclavicular area<br><br>(+) hematoma oterral area<br><br>(+) Left first degree burn with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sollae 6 cm ru greatest diameter<br><br>(+) hematoma (L) inquinal area<br><br>(+) hematoma (R) inquinal area<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extending to (R) ASIS<br><br>hymenal laceration at 6 degrees,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at 9 and 12 o’clock positions<br><br>multiple laceration and fracture largest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laceration measuring 4 cm.<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; massive hemmorage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; due to multiple skull fracture.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Dr. Villaflor testified, confirming the above Report.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stressed that Catalina had vaginal lacerations at “6, 9, and 12 o’clock positions,” indicating that she was a victim of a forcible sexual assault; and that she died due to “massive hemorrhage secondary to multiple skull fracture.”<br><br>On October 24, 2000, appellant, overwhelmed by his conscience, surrendered to the Sikatuna Police Station.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the investigation conducted by SPO4 Alfredo G. Luengas, appellant, assisted by his counsel, Atty. Adriano P. Damalerio of the PAO, executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> in the Visayan dialect, which was translated into English, wherein he acknowledged being advised by his counsel of his constitutional rights and voluntarily confessed that he raped and killed his neighbor, Catalina Baluran, in the evening of October 20, 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stated therein that he killed Catalina because she recognized him as the culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then choked her, struck her with a piece of firewood and thereafter threw her body into the hole of an abandoned toilet.<br><br>During the hearing, the trial judge asked appellant searching questions and he confirmed the details of his extra-judicial confession.<br><br>The defense then opted not to present any evidence in view of appellant’s plea of guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 2001, the trial court rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which states:<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 10885, the Court finds accused Rey Apatay guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape with Homicide defined under Article 266-A and penalized under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, and hereby sentences the said accused to suffer the supreme penalty of death, with the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the heirs of Catalina Baluran the sum of <s>P</s>100,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>In assailing the Decision, appellant contends that (a) “the trial court failed to conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension by him of the consequences&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of his plea;” and (b) “the trial court failed to ask him whether he desires to present evidence in his behalf and allow him to do so if he desires.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General, in his Appellee’s Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> vehemently disputes appellant’s contentions, asserting that the trial court did not commit any error in convicting appellant of the crime charged and in imposing upon him the death penalty.<br><br>The procedure for arraignment is provided in Section 1, Rule 116 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended, quoted as follows:<blockquote>“SEC. 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Arraignment and plea; how made. </span>–<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused must be arraigned before the court where the complaint or information was filed or assigned for trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; The arraignment shall be made in open court by the judge or clerk by furnishing the accused with a copy of the complaint or information, <span style="font-weight: bold;">reading the same in the language or dialect known to him, and asking him whether he pleads guilty or not guilty</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prosecution may call at the trial witnesses other than those named in the complaint or information.<br><br>x x x.”&nbsp; (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>When an accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, Section 3 of the same Rule specifies the steps to be followed by the trial court, thus:<blockquote>“SEC. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Plea of guilty to capital offense; reception of evidence</span>. – When the accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court shall conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of his plea and require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of culpability.&nbsp; The accused may present evidence in his behalf. (3a)”</blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Flaviano R. Segnar, Jr</span>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> we ruled that there is no hard and fast rule as to how a judge may conduct a “searching inquiry,” or as to the number and character of questions he may ask the accused, or as to the earnestness with which he may conduct it, since each case must be measured according to its individual merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The singular barometer is that the judge must, in all cases, fully convince himself that: (1) the accused, in pleading guilty, is doing so voluntarily – meaning, he was not coerced or threatened of physical harm, or placed under a state of duress; and (2) that he is truly guilty on the basis of his testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in determining whether an accused’s plea of guilty to a capital offense is improvident, we held that considering their training, we leave to the judges ample discretion, but expect them at the same time that they will be true to their calling and be worthy ministers of the law and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Here, the above jurisprudential guidelines were faithfully complied with by the trial judge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Records show that during the arraignment, the Information was read to appellant in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Visayan</span> dialect which he speaks and understands.&nbsp;&nbsp; After he entered a plea of guilty, the trial judge properly conducted a searching inquiry translated by the court interpreter into his <span style="font-style: italic;">Visayan dialect</span>.<br><br>The proceedings during the arraignment, the trial judge’s searching questions and appellant’s answers thereto are reproduced hereunder:<blockquote>“COURT:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On his contention that the trial court failed to ask him whether he intends to present evidence on his behalf, suffice it to say that the defense “opted not to present any evidence considering the accused’s plea of guilty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, provides:<blockquote>“ART. 266-A. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rape, When and How Committed</span>. – Rape is committed –<ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</span></li><br><ol type="A"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Through force</span>, threat or intimidation;</li><br><li>When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;</li><br><li>By means of fraudulent machinations or grave abuse of authority;</li><br><li>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances above be present;</li><br></ol><li>By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person’s mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.”&nbsp;&nbsp; (Underscoring ours)</li></ol></blockquote>Here, it is clear from the appellant’s extra-judicial confession and the evidence for the prosecution that he had carnal knowledge of Catalina Baluran through force.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Article 266-B of the same law further mandates that “When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The same single and indivisible penalty shall be applied by the courts regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The trial court, therefore, correctly found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape with homicide and properly imposed upon him the death penalty.<br><br>We sustain the trial court’s award to the victim’s heirs of the sum of <s>P</s>100,000.00 as civil indemnity, <s>P</s>50,000.00 for rape and <s>P</s>50,000.00 for the death of the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To be entitled to such damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable to the injured party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Abrazaldo</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> we held that where, as here, the amount of actual damages cannot be determined because no receipts were presented to prove the same, but it is shown that the heirs are entitled thereto, temperate damages may be awarded, fixed at <s>P</s>25,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that funeral expenses were obviously incurred by Catalina’s heirs, an award of <s>P</s>25,000.00 as temperate damages is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Three members of this Court maintain that Republic Act No. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
