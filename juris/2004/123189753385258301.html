				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the June 16, 2003 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 69213, which reversed and set aside the August 28, 2000 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Butuan City, Branch 2, in Civil Case No. 4270.<br><br>The facts as testified to by petitioner Felomina Abellana are as follows:<br><br>On July 15, 1981, Felomina, a spinster, pharmacist and aunt of private respondent Lucila Ponce, purchased from the late Estela Caldoza-Pacres a 44,297<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> square meter agricultural lot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> with the intention of giving said lot to her niece, Lucila.&nbsp; Thus, in the deed of sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the latter was designated as the buyer of Lot 3, Pcs-10-000198, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-27, Homestead Patent No. V-1551 and located at Los Angeles, Butuan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; The total consideration of the sale was P16,500.00, but only P4,500.00 was stated in the deed upon the request of the seller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Felomina applied for the issuance of title in the name of her niece.&nbsp; On April 28, 1992, Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 2874<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> over the subject lot was issued in the name of Lucila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;Said title, however, remained in the possession of Felomina who developed the lot through Juanario Torreon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and paid real property taxes thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The relationship between Felomina and respondent spouses Romeo and Lucila Ponce, however, turned sour.&nbsp; The latter allegedly became disrespectful and ungrateful to the point of hurling her insults and even attempting to hurt her physically.&nbsp; Hence, Felomina filed the instant case for revocation of implied trust to recover legal title over the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Private respondent spouses Lucila, also a pharmacist, and Romeo, a marine engineer, on the other hand, claimed that the purchase price of the lot was only P4,500.00 and that it was them who paid the same.&nbsp; The payment and signing of the deed of sale allegedly took place in the office of Atty. Teodoro Emboy in the presence of the seller and her siblings namely, Aquilino Caldoza and the late Lilia Caldoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>A year later, Juanario approached Lucila and volunteered to till the lot, to which she agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; In 1987, the spouses consented to Felomina’s proposal to develop and lease the lot.&nbsp; They, however, shouldered the real property taxes on the lot, which was paid through Felomina. &nbsp;In 1990, the spouses demanded rental from Felomina but she refused to pay because her agricultural endeavor was allegedly not profitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>When Lucila learned that a certificate of title in her name had already been issued, she confronted Felomina who claimed that she already gave her the title.&nbsp; Thinking that she might have misplaced the title, Lucila executed an affidavit of loss which led to the issuance of another certificate of title in her name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On August 28, 2000, the trial court rendered a decision holding that an implied trust existed between Felomina and Lucila, such that the latter is merely holding the lot for the benefit of the former.&nbsp; It thus ordered the conveyance of the subject lot in favor of Felomina.&nbsp; The dispositive portion thereof, reads:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered declaring, directing and ordering that:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: justify;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%"> <div align="left">a)&nbsp;</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">An implied trust was created with plaintiff as trustor and private defendant Lucila A.

The appellate court further held that even assuming that Felomina paid the purchase price of the lot, the situation falls within the exception stated in Article 1448 of the Civil Code which raises a disputable presumption that the property was purchased by Felomina as a gift to Lucila whom she considered as her own daughter.&nbsp; The decretal portion thereof, states –<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 2, Butuan City, in Civil Case No. 4270, is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE.&nbsp; A new one is heretofore rendered dismissing the complaint below of plaintiff-appellee, F[e]lomina Abellana.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Felomina filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>The issue before us is:&nbsp; Who, as between Felomina and respondent spouses, is the lawful owner of the controverted lot?&nbsp; To resolve this issue, it is necessary to determine who paid the purchase price of the lot.<br><br>After a thorough examination of the records and transcript of stenographic notes, we find that it was Felomina and not Lucila who truly purchased the questioned lot from Estela.&nbsp; The positive and consistent testimony of Felomina alone, that she was the real vendee of the lot, is credible to debunk the contrary claim of respondent spouses.&nbsp; Indeed, the lone testimony of a witness, if credible, is sufficient as in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, Aquilino Caldoza, brother of the vendor and one of the witnesses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the deed of sale, categorically declared that Felomina was the buyer and the one who paid the purchase price to her sister, Estela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Then too, Juanario, who was allegedly hired by Lucila to develop the lot, vehemently denied that he approached and convinced Lucila to let him till the land.&nbsp; According to Juanario, he had never spoken to Lucila about the lot and it was Felomina who recruited him to be the caretaker of the litigated property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The fact that it was Felomina who bought the lot was further bolstered by her possession of the following documents from the time of their issuance up to the present, to wit: (1) the transfer certificate of title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and tax declaration in the name of Lucila;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (2) the receipts of real property taxes in the name of Felomina Abellana for the years 1982-1984, 1992-1994 and 1995;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and (3) the survey plan of the lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Having determined that it was Felomina who paid the purchase price of the subject lot, the next question to resolve is the nature of the transaction between her and Lucila.<br><br>It appears that Felomina, being of advanced age<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> with no family of her own, used to purchase properties and afterwards give them to her nieces.&nbsp; In fact, aside from the lot she bought for Lucila (marked as Exhibit “R-2”), she also purchased 2 lots, one&nbsp; from Aquilino Caldoza (marked as Exhibit “R-1”) and the other from Domiciano Caldoza (marked as Exhibit “R-3”), which she gave to Zaida Bascones (sister of Lucila), thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">I am showing to you again Exhibit R, according to you[,] you bought Exhibits R-1, R-2 and R-3, do you remember that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is clear therefore that Felomina donated the land to Lucila.&nbsp; This is evident from her declarations, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Witness</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">In 1981 there was a riceland offered <span style="font-weight: bold;">so I told her that I will buy that land and I will give to her</span> later <span style="font-style: italic;">(sic)</span>, because since 1981 up to 1992 Mrs. Lucila Ponce has no job.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">Where is the land located?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">In Los Angeles, Butuan City.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">Who was the owner of this land?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">The owner of that land is Mrs. Estela Caldoza-Pacr[e]s.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">The husband is Pacr[e]s. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When, however, the law requires that a contract be in some form in order that it may be valid, that requirement is absolute and indispensable.&nbsp; Its non-observance renders the contract void and of no effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, under Article 749 of the Civil Code –<br><blockquote>Article 749. In order that the donation of an immovable property may be valid, it must be made in a public document, specifying therein the property donated and the value of the charges which the donee must satisfy.<br><br>The acceptance may be made in the same deed of donation or in a separate public document, but it shall not take effect unless it is done during the lifetime of the donor.<br><br>If the acceptance is made in a separate instrument, the donor shall be notified thereof in an authentic form, and this step shall be noted in both instruments.<br></blockquote>In the instant case, what transpired between Felomina and Lucila was a donation of an immovable property which was not embodied in a public instrument as required by the foregoing article.&nbsp; Being an oral donation, the transaction was void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, even if Felomina enjoyed the fruits of the land with the intention of giving effect to the donation after her demise, the conveyance is still a void donation <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>, for non-compliance with the formalities of a will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; No valid title passed regardless of the intention of Felomina to donate the property to Lucila, because the naked intent to convey without the required solemnities does not suffice for gratuitous alienations, even as between the parties <span style="font-style: italic;">inter se</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; At any rate, Felomina now seeks to recover title over the property because of the alleged ingratitude of the respondent spouses.<br><br>Unlike ordinary contracts (which are perfected by the concurrence of the requisites of consent, object and cause pursuant to Article 1318<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the Civil Code), solemn contracts like donations are perfected only upon compliance with the legal formalities under Articles 748<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and 749.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Otherwise stated, absent the solemnity requirements for validity, the mere intention of the parties does not give rise to a contract.&nbsp; The oral donation in the case at bar is therefore legally inexistent and an action for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, Felomina can still recover title from Lucila.<br><br>Article 1448<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the Civil Code on implied trust finds no application in the instant case.&nbsp; The concept of implied trusts is that from the facts and circumstances of a given case, the existence of a trust relationship is inferred in order to effect the presumed intention of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, one of the recognized exceptions to the establishment of an implied trust is where a contrary intention is proved, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> as in the present case.&nbsp; From the testimony of Felomina herself, she wanted to give the lot to Lucila as a gift.&nbsp; To her mind, the execution of a deed with Lucila as the buyer and the subsequent issuance of title in the latter’s name were the acts that would effectuate her generosity.&nbsp; In so carrying out what she conceived, Felomina evidently displayed her unequivocal intention to transfer ownership of the lot to Lucila and not merely to constitute her as a trustee thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was only when their relationship soured that she sought to revoke the donation on the theory of implied trust, though as previously discussed, there is nothing to revoke because the donation was never perfected.<br><br>In declaring Lucila as the owner of the disputed lot, the Court of Appeals applied, among others, the second sentence of Article 1448 which states –<br><blockquote>“x x x However, if the person to whom the title is conveyed is a child, legitimate or illegitimate, of the one paying the price of the sale, no trust is implied by law, it being disputably presumed that there is a gift in favor of the child.”<br></blockquote>Said presumption also arises where the property is given to a person to whom the person paying the price stands <span style="font-style: italic;">in loco parentis</span> or as a substitute parent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The abovecited provision, however, is also not applicable here because, first, it was not established that Felomina stood as a substitute parent of Lucila; and second, even assuming that she did, the donation is still void because the transfer and acceptance was not embodied in a public instrument.&nbsp; We note that said provision merely raised a presumption that the conveyance was a gift but nothing therein exempts the parties from complying with the formalities of a donation.&nbsp; Dispensation of such solemnities would give rise to anomalous situations where the formalities of a donation and a will in donations <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>, and donations <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>, respectively, would be done away with when the transfer of the property is made in favor of a child or one to whom the donor stands <span style="font-style: italic;">in loco parentis</span>.&nbsp; Such a scenario is clearly repugnant to the mandatory nature of the law on donation.<br><br>While Felomina sought to recover the litigated lot on the ground of implied trust and not on the invalidity of donation, the Court is clothed with ample authority to address the latter issue in order to arrive at a just decision that completely disposes of the controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Since rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice, they must be applied in a way that equitably and completely resolve the rights and obligations of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>As to the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees and litigation expenses, the same should be deleted for lack of basis.&nbsp; Aside from the allegations in the complaint, no evidence was presented in support of said claims. The trial court made these awards in the dispositive portion of its decision without stating any justification therefor in the <span style="font-style: italic;">ratio decidendi</span>. &nbsp;Their deletion is therefore proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Finally, in deciding in favor of Felomina, the trial court ordered respondent spouses to execute a deed of sale over the subject lot in favor of Felomina in order to effect the transfer of title to the latter.&nbsp; The proper remedy, however, is provided under Section 10 (a), Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that “x x x [i]f real or personal property is situated within the Philippines, the court in lieu of directing a conveyance thereof may by an order divest the title of any party and vest it in others, which shall have the force and effect of a conveyance executed in due form of law.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, in view of all the foregoing, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span> and the June 16, 2003 decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
