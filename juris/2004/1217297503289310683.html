				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On appeal is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 25) of Cagayan de Oro City finding Paul Tagana, Rodolfo Linanga alias Luis Linanga, and Ruel Bibohan guilty of murder and sentencing each of them to suffer <i>reclusion perpetu</i>a, and ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of Celestino Buoy the amounts of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.<br><br>Paul Tagana surrendered to the police in Talakag, Bukidnon a day after the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>An Amended Information was filed against appellants on October 31, 1995, which reads as follows: <blockquote> The undersigned Asst. City Prosecutor accuses PAUL TAGANA (Detained) RUEL BIBOHAN, CONRADO TAGANA and RODOLFO (LUIS) LINANGA, of the crime of MURDER committed as follows: <blockquote> That on or about September 30, 1995 at more or less 6:00 o’clock in the evening at Upper Brgy. Tignapoloan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with intent to kill conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another and with treachery, <u>evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength, all being then</u> armed with bladed weapons, which they were conveniently provided, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and harm Celestino Buoy, the offended party, <u>who was unarmed, and drunk</u>, by stabbing him several times hitting the latter in different parts of his body and/or inflicting on his <u>person</u> several mortal wounds which <u>are</u> the direct/ immediate cause of his instantaneous death. </blockquote> Contrary to and in violation of Article 248 in relation to Article 14, all of the Revised Penal Code.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </blockquote> Upon arraignment on November 14, 1995, Paul Tagana entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Ruel Bibohan and Rodolfo Linanga were subsequently arrested and upon&nbsp; arraignment&nbsp; on&nbsp; December 11, 1995, they pleaded not guilty to the crime charged against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Conrado Tagana remains at large.<br><br>The prosecution through the testimonies of victim Celestino Buoy’s wife, Helen Buoy; his mother, Marcita Buoy; and brother-in-law, Henry Valencia, sought to establish the following facts:<br><br>In the afternoon of September 30, 1995, at around 2:00 p.m., Celestino, together with his mother Marcita, went to the barangay hall of Tignapoloan to watch a basketball game that was part of the celebration of the town’s Agro Fair. Appellants Ruel Bibohan and Rodolfo Linanga approached Celestino and invited him to drink alcohol with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Appellant Paul Tagana and his co-accused uncle, Conrado Tagana, were already waiting at a table at the barangay hall.&nbsp; The five of them drank Tanduay until around 6:00 p.m..&nbsp; Then they went to the store of Adonis Salas and ordered another bottle of liquor.&nbsp; Marcita followed them and watched her son drink with the four accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At around this time, Helen arrived to fetch her husband who was already very drunk and could no longer walk by himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After they finished drinking, Ruel, Conrado and Paul walked towards the direction of the highway while Celestino, Rodolfo, Helen and Marcita were left at the store.&nbsp; Rodolfo put his left arm around the shoulder of Celestino and led him to the direction where the three were waiting at the road.&nbsp; Rodolfo then stabbed Celestino with his right hand hitting the latter at the right part of his chest just below his breast.&nbsp; The three others followed suit and stabbed Celestino with their knives then dumped the body of Celestino in the canal and ran away.&nbsp; Helen and Marcita were only two meters away from Celestino when the stabbing took place.&nbsp; They shouted for help and Henry Velencia responded.&nbsp; Helen, Marcita and Henry pulled Celestino from the canal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Dr. Amado Piit, who conducted the autopsy on the body of Celestino, certified that the cause of death of Celestino Buoy was “shock due to severe hemothorax and hemoperitoneum due to multiple stab wounds over the anterior and posterior chest wall”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Dr. Piit testified that the victim had seven stab wounds and ten incised wounds; and that he is not sure if the wounds were caused by one or more instruments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The most severe was the stab wound measuring 2.5 cms. located at the right side of the anterior chest a little bit above the right nipple which perforated the upper wall of the right lung, followed by the wound measuring 3 cms. located below the right nipple which penetrated the liver.&nbsp; The third most severe is the wound measuring 1.5 cms. located at the left side of the back near the spine which punctured the lung.&nbsp; Celestino also sustained incised wounds at the left side of his chest and at the left side of his back as well as stab wounds at the lower anterior right arm, at the top of the right shoulder, just below the nose and above the lips, and over the left cheek.&nbsp; In his opinion, the wounds could have been inflicted by more than one person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>For the defense, appellants Paul Tagana and Rodolfo Linanga, as well as Dominga Tagana, wife of accused Conrado Tagana, testified to prove that the death of Celestino Buoy was the sole responsibility of Paul Tagana who acted in self-defense, thus:<br><br>Rodolfo Linanga, Ruel Bibohan, Conrado Tagana and Paul Tagana were in the store of Adonis Salas in the afternoon of September 30, 1995, when Celestino arrived and quickly drank all the beer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Celestino then challenged the group and said, “Who is tough here!”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> To avoid trouble, Rodolfo, Ruel and Conrado left the store together with Paul who followed behind because Paul had a limp and had difficulty walking.&nbsp; Celestino followed Paul and upon catching up with him, Celestino kicked Paul twice on the chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Upon seeing the incident, Rodolfo, Ruel and Conrado ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Paul was able to take hold of Celestino’s leg and they rolled on the ground.&nbsp; Paul pulled out a knife and stabbed Celestino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Celestino then ran towards the canal and Paul chased him.&nbsp; Upon catching up with Celestino, Paul stabbed him several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The defense also presented Aurelio Española who testified that he is not a relative of any of the accused; and that while he was on his way home to San Isidro on September 30, 1995, he saw two persons in a stabbing incident.&nbsp; He identified Paul Tagana as one of the two and averred that there were no other persons in the vicinity at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On July 25, 1997, the trial court rendered a decision and upheld the evidence for the prosecution, as follows: <blockquote> This Court finds the testimony of the prosecution witnesses Marcita Buoy, Helen Buoy, Henry Valencia credible, there being no motive to perjure or fabricate nor they have any evil intent to implicate all the accused in charging them with a heinous crime of Murder.&nbsp; Their testimonies were corroborated by the findings of the doctor, Dr. Amado Piit.<br><br>The prosecution was able to prove by direct, positive, clear and convincing evidence that the four accused Paul Tagana, Rodolfo Linanga, Ruel Bibuhan and Conrado Tagana who is still at large conspired with each other, committed the crime of murder on September 30, 1995, at 6:00 o’clock in the afternoon at Upper Barangay Tignapoloan, Cagayan de Oro City, with treachery and abuse of superior strength, all accused were armed with knives, simultaneously and successively stabbed Celestino Bouy who was drunk and unarmed on the different parts of Celestino Bouy’s body causing his death.<br><br>The evidence shows that the four accused except for Ruel Bibuhan who is a very close friend of the network relationship of all the accused; accused Conrado Tagana and Paul Tagana are brothers and Conrado Tagana is married to Dominga Linanga, sister of accused Rodolfo Linanga alias Luis Linanga.<br><br>The four accused all come from San Isidro, Talakag, Bukidnon, originally although Conrado Tagana and Paul Tagana transferred residence at Impakibil, Tignapoloan, Cagayan de Oro City.<br><br>. . .<br><br>The four accused Paul Tagana, Conrado Tagana, Rodolfo Linanga and Ruel Bibuhan were drinking liquor at the Agro-Fair on September 30, 1995 from two o’clock in the afternoon to four o’clock in the afternoon, together with Celestino Bouy whom they invited to drink liquor.<br><br>The same four accused transferred drinking at the store of Adonis Salac bringing along Celestino Bouy.<br><br>The three accused Paul Tagana, Conrado Tagana and Ruel Bibuhan left the store ahead and waited for accused Rodolfo Linanga who brought Celestino Bouy at the highway where the four accused simultaneously stabbed Celestino Bouy, using knives, on the different parts of his body, causing his death.<br><br>All the four accused headed for the direction of San Isidro, Talakag, Bukidnon, except for Conrado Tagana who remained at large until today.<br><br>These circumstances prior to, during and right after the stabbing of the victim indicate their common intention to commit the crime of murder on the person of Celestino Buoy who is a barrio pest or free loader who drinks their wine without spending any cent.<br><br>Conspiracy having been adequately shown, all the accused are answerable as co-principal regardless of the degree of their participation of each individual conspirator as the applicable rule is that act of one conspirator is the act of all of them<br><br>This Court finds that the killing of Celestino Bouy was qualified by treachery.&nbsp; Celestino Bouy was killed after the four accused made him drunk and unable to defend himself being unarmed from the well planned or pre-arranged mode of attack by Paul Tagana, Conrado Tagana, Ruel Bibuhan who waited for their victim at the highway or road, the victim Celestino Bouy being brought by Rodolfo Linanga with his arm placed on the shoulders of the victim Celestino Bouy who placed also his arm around the shoulder of Rodolfo Linanga on an arm-to-arm basis or position because the victim could hardly stand and kept on staggering and upon reaching the highway the four accused successively stabbed to death the victim Celestino Bouy.<br><br>This Court finds these circumstances are manifestly indicative of the presence of the condition under which the qualifying circumstance of treachery and abuse of superior strength may be appreciated that is the employment of means of execution or mode of attack deliberately and consciously adopted that gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate.<br><br>This Court rejects the theory of the defense that the killing was done only by accused Paul Tagana, a limp who acted in self-defense as this is belied by the prosecution witnesses’ categorical, clear and positive testimonies who have no motive to fabricate the theory of the prosecution.<br><br>This Court does not find the testimonies of the defense witnesses credible.&nbsp; On the contrary, the testimonies of the defense witnesses are unreliable and not true from the contradictions supplied by them.<br><br>Accused Paul Tagana’s testimony that he stabbed Celestino Bouy with the use of a stolen knife after the latter boxed and kicked him without any reason or provocation and after he parried the first blow and kick of a bigger person by holding his leg up in the presence of the companions of the accused who were merely looking at the victim who could barely stand and assaulted him is rather not credible.<br><br>This Court finds that the victim being unarmed and stone drunk being unable to stand without support would be unable to deliver a fist or kick or even if he still has strength to launch an attack against the four accused.<br><br>This Court finds that the theory of self-defense of the accused is belied also by the nature number and location of the stab wounds of the victim as found by Dr. Amado Piit who conducted the autopsy.&nbsp; He found that some of the fatal wounds were launched at the back of the victim, on the arm, chest and nose, indicating that more than one assailant perpetrated the felonious act.&nbsp; The findings of the examining physician is likewise corroborated with the testimony of Marcita Bouy, Helen Bouy and Henry Valencia that the four accused ganged up the victim by stabbing him on the different parts of the body and dumped his body in the canal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </blockquote> the dispositive portion of which reads: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court finds all the three accused PAUL TAGANA, RODOLFO LINANGA alias Luis Linanga and RUEL BIBUHAN,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in conspiracy with one another, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER as principals by direct participation, qualified by treachery which absorbs abuse of superior strength, and applying Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and hereby sentences the three accused PAUL TAGANA, RODOLFO LINANGA alias LUIS LINANGA and RUEL BIBOHAN to each suffer an imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with the accessory penalty and for all the accused to jointly and severally indemnify the surviving spouse and children the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos; and to pay Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages.<br><br>Promulgation is set on August 29, 1997, at 8:30 o’clock in the morning.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </blockquote> Hence, the present appeal.<br><br>In their Brief, appellants Paul Tagana and Ruel Bibohan raise the following assignment of error: <blockquote> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING MORE WEIGHT TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION’S ALLEGED EYE WITNESSES, HELEN BUOY, HENRY VALENCIA AND MARCITA BUOY, THAN THE DEFENSE WITNESSES, AURELIO ESPAÑOLA AND PAUL TAGANA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </blockquote> They argue that: the prosecution’s version of the case is unbelievable and its witnesses are biased since they are all close relatives of the victim; it is unlikely that Marcita Buoy watched her son drink liquor from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. since the victim already had a family of his own and lived in a separate house; Henry Valencia could not have been at the scene of the crime because if he were, he would have defended his brother-in-law from his attackers; it is&nbsp; more probable&nbsp; that&nbsp; Helen and Marcita Buoy&nbsp; were not around during the stabbing incident and were informed only later that Celestino was in the road canal bleeding from stab wounds; after they found the victim severely wounded, they shouted for help and that is when Henry responded and helped the two women pull the victim from the canal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Appellant Paul Tagana insists that he could not have conspired with his co-appellants to kill Celestino because he watched the basketball game and the cockfights that afternoon by himself and only met the three when he was about to go home at around 4 o’clock in the afternoon; that he and his companions decided to stop at the store of Adonis Salas and ordered beer.&nbsp; At that point, Celestino Buoy, a known toughie in the barangay arrived and without being invited, drank all the beer and challenged the bravery of the four accused.&nbsp; Wanting to avoid trouble, the four left the store. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Appellants Paul Tagana and Ruel Bibohan argue that Paul’s admission should be given weight, being adverse to his interest and corroborated by the testimony of Aurelio Española, an unbiased and impartial witness, he not being a relative or friend of any of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Both further contend that the multiple stab wounds sustained by the victim do not negate the possibility of&nbsp; having&nbsp; only&nbsp; one bladed weapon&nbsp; used,&nbsp; as testified by the prosecution’s expert witness, Dr. Amado Piit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In a separate Brief, Rodolfo Linanga assigns the following errors of the trial court: <blockquote> <center>I<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN INCLUDING IN ITS FINDINGS THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT RODOLFO (LUIS) LINANGA ALONG WITH HIS CO-ACCUSED IS LIKEWISE LIABLE FOR MURDER (SIC)<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE EXISTENCE OF TREACHERY AND CONSPIRACY AND THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT LINANGA WAS A PART OF THE SAID CONSPIRACY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </blockquote> Adding to the claims of&nbsp; his co-appellants, appellant Linanga argues that: the trial court committed grave error in rendering a uniform judgment of conviction for all the appellants; it erred in finding that conspiracy existed since mere presence of all the appellants at the scene of the crime does not manifest unity of purpose and action; and no conspiracy can be agreed upon since the wife and the mother of the victim were nearby, looking after him because he was already drunk hours before the stabbing incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellant Linanga further claims that the testimonies of the defense witness were clear, straightforward and more in accord with ordinary human experience than the prosecution’s theory; and that at the very least, the defense effectively showed reasonable doubt which should be appreciated in their favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>For the State, the Solicitor General counters: the testimony of the prosecution witnesses are worthy of full faith and belief; relationship <i>per se</i> does not give rise to a presumption of bias nor does it <i>ipso facto</i> impair the credibility of a witness; appellants have not shown any improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to testify against them; the prosecution witnesses testified in categorical, spontaneous and frank manner; the prosecution witnesses positively identified appellants as the authors of the injuries sustained by the victim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> conspiracy has been established independently and beyond reasonable doubt; the conduct of the appellants before, during and after the commission of the crime may be considered to show conspiracy;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> treachery is present in this case since Celestino was made drunk by the appellants and was unarmed and unprepared when the appellants stabbed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General further contends that the theory of self-defense by&nbsp; appellant Paul Tagana cannot be appreciated since the victim&nbsp; was unarmed and very drunk to launch an attack against the appellants.&nbsp; The nature, number and the location of the stab wounds of the victim belie the theory of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In their Reply, the three appellants reiterate their version of what happened and stand firm in their claim that Paul Tagana merely defended himself from Celestino Buoy.&nbsp; They maintain that it is improbable that Helen and Marcito Buoy were present when the stabbing occurred since their testimonies were not corroborated by a single disinterested witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The following issues need to be resolved: (1) whether or not Paul Tagana acted in self-defense and therefore free from criminal liability; and (2) whether or not the trial court correctly found that the appellants are guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt and that they conspired to commit the same.<br><br><i>First issue.</i>&nbsp; Whether or not Paul Tagana acted in self-defense.<br><br><i>It is settled that where an accused admits killing the victim but invokes self-defense to escape criminal liability, he assumes the burden to establish his plea by credible, clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; Otherwise, conviction would follow from his admission that he killed the victim.&nbsp; Indeed, in invoking self-defense, the burden of evidence is shifted and the person claiming self-defense must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>To be free from liability, the person claiming self-defense must show by sufficient, satisfactory and convincing evidence that: (1) the victim committed unlawful aggression amounting to actual or imminent threat to the life and limb of the person claiming self-defense; (2) there was reasonable necessity in the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression; and (3) there was lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person claiming self-defense or, at least, that any provocation executed by the person claiming self-defense was not the proximate and immediate cause of the victim’s aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Appellant Paul Tagana claims that Celestino Buoy kicked him twice on the chest which prompted him to stab the latter.&nbsp; This contention is belied by the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that Celestino at the time was already very drunk and could no longer walk by himself.<br><br>But even granting <i>arguendo</i> that Celestino did kick Paul Tagana on the chest, that by itself cannot be considered sufficient to exculpate him from criminal liability.&nbsp; For self-defense to prosper, it is most crucial that unlawful aggression was committed by the victim against the accused.&nbsp; Without it, self-defense will not have a leg to stand on and will not be appreciated even if the other elements are present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Unlawful aggression refers to an attack amounting to actual or imminent threat to the life and limb of the person claiming self-defense and not just a threatening or intimidating attitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Mere kicking on the chest cannot be considered as an actual or imminent threat to the life and limb of Paul Tagana, specially considering the testimony of the latter that Celestino Buoy was not armed at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Moreover, appellant Paul Tagana testified that after inflicting one stab wound on Celestino, the latter ran away but he still chased Celestino and upon catching up with him, he stabbed him several times.&nbsp; At this point, Paul Tagana could no longer invoke self-defense in killing the victim because at that moment when Celestino ran away, unlawful aggression on the part of Celestino had already ceased.&nbsp; It is settled that when unlawful aggression ceases, the defender no longer has any right to kill or wound the former aggressor, otherwise retaliation and not self-defense is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Appellants posit that since Aurelio Española is not related to anyone, his testimony is credible and should be believed by the trial court.&nbsp; The Court is not persuaded.&nbsp; A review of his testimony shows that it is vague, evasive and highly questionable.&nbsp; He testified that he only saw two persons involved in the stabbing incident and there were no other persons in the vicinity at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This is belied by the testimony of defense witness Dominga Tagana that she and Helen were at the road when the stabbing incident took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Española further testified that he saw Paul stab the victim only once<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> but the medical report showed that the victim died of multiple stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> On cross-examination, Española admitted that he does not know the value of an oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Appellants also cite the testimony of Dr. Piit in which he admitted on cross-examination that it is possible that all the wounds sustained by the victim were inflicted by one weapon only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, in the same testimony, Dr. Piit likewise asserted that the number of wounds may be inflicted by more than one person.&nbsp; Granting that there is that possibility, that the wounds were inflicted by one weapon only, such is not sufficient to negate the version that is more consistent with the testimony of the prosecution eyewitnesses, i.e., that the appellants simultaneously stabbed the victim.<br><br>Moreover, in the absence of a cogent reason to disturb the findings of the trial court, the Court accords higher respect to the assessment of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses for it is the trial court that observed the demeanor of the witnesses.&nbsp; As the Court held in<i> People vs. Balgos</i>: <blockquote> … we note the well-established rule that the trial court’s evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses is given great respect by the appellate court in the absence of proof that it was arrived at capriciously or that the trial court disregarded material facts which might affect the outcome of the case.&nbsp; The rationale behind this rule is that the credibility of a witness can best be determined by the trial court since it has the opportunity to observe the candor and demeanor of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </blockquote> For the above reasons, we hold that the trial court correctly ruled that appellants failed to prove self-defense on the part of appellant Paul.<br><br><i>Second issue.</i>&nbsp; Whether or not the trial court correctly found that appellants are guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt and that they conspired to commit the same.<br><br>Appellants assail the reliance of the trial court on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as well as in ruling that treachery and conspiracy are present in the case at bar.<br><br>In a long line of cases, the Court has pronounced that the credibility of witnesses as assessed by the trial court will generally not be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This is because the trial court enjoys the unique position of having observed the elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses’ deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied appellate courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As the Court fully explained in <i>People vs. Lachica:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <blockquote> Only the trial judge can observe the furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath – all of which are useful aids for an accurate determination of a witness’ honesty and sincerity.<br><br>. . . . .<br><br>… [T]he trial judge is able to detect that sometimes thin line between fact and prevarication that will determine the guilt and innocence of the accused.&nbsp; That line may not be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the reviewing court.&nbsp; The record will not reveal those tell-tale signs that will affirm the truth or expose the contrivance, like the angry flush of an insistent assertion; or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie; or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer; or the forthright tone of a ready reply.&nbsp; The record will not show if the eyes have darted in evasion, or looked down in confession, or gazed steadily with a serenity that has nothing to distort or conceal.&nbsp; The record will not show if tears were shed in anger, or in shame, or in remembered pain, or in feigned innocence.&nbsp; Only the judge trying the case can see all these and on the basis of his observations arrive at an informed and reasoned verdict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </blockquote> An exception to the general rule is when the trial court ignored, misconstrued or misinterpreted facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would alter the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>After reviewing the records of this case, we find no reason to depart from the general rule.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses, who were straightforward and consistent in their narration, positively identified Rodolfo Linanga, Conrado Tagana, Paul Tagana and Ruel Bibohan as the persons who inflicted multiple stab wounds on Celestino Buoy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Appellants’ claim that Marcita and Helen Buoy were not at the scene of the crime cannot be given credence.&nbsp;

They merely relied on the relationship of said witnesses to the victim as basis for alleging that they are biased.&nbsp; It is settled however that where there is no evidence and nothing to indicate that the principal witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that they were not so actuated and their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded by appellants’ specious argument that prosecution witness HenryValencia could not have been at the scene of the crime for if he were, he would have tried to defend the victim;

This overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime, or by exerting a moral ascendance over the other co-conspirators by moving them to execute or implement the criminal plan.&nbsp; <b>Once conspiracy is established, all the conspirators are answerable as co-principals regardless of their degree of participation, for in the contemplation of the law, the act of one becomes the act of all. It matters not who among the accused inflicted the fatal blow to the victim.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>). </blockquote> The trial court did not err in appreciating the presence of treachery in the fatal stabbing of Celestino.<br><br>Treachery is present when these conditions concur: (1) the means, methods and forms of execution employed gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (2) such means, methods and forms of execution were deliberately and consciously adopted by the accused without danger to his person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Like other circumstances which qualify criminal responsibility, it cannot rest on mere conjecture but must be proved as indubitably as the crime itself.&nbsp; It is not sufficient that the attack was sudden and unexpected.&nbsp; It must also be shown that the aggressor consciously adopted the mode of attack to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In this case, it was established that Ruel, Conrado and Paul went ahead and waited for Rodolfo and Celestino by the road.&nbsp; Conrado at this point was already very drunk and needed assistance in walking.&nbsp; Upon reaching the place where the three were waiting, Rodolfo stabbed Celestino and the others followed suit.&nbsp; Clearly, the manner by which the killing was executed and the viciousness of the assault show that it was deliberately adopted to ensure the accomplishment of the crime without risk to themselves.<br><br>Since treachery attended the killing of Celestino Buoy, the trial court correctly considered abuse of superior strength, which is also alleged in the Information, as already absorbed by said circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The facts also show that the crime was committed by a band since more than three armed persons took part in its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> However, we cannot appreciate such circumstance against the appellants for failure of the prosecution to state the same in the Information as required by Sec. 8, Rule 110 of the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure.&nbsp;

The essence of this circumstance is that the execution of the criminal act was preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.&nbsp;
