				<BR><BR><div align="justify">National Power Corporation (NPC) filed the instant <i>Petition for Review</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 19, 2001, assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals dated May 28, 2001 which affirmed with modification the <i>Order</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and <i>Writ of Execution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> respectively dated May 22, 2000 and June 9, 2000 issued by the Regional Trial Court.&nbsp; In its assailed <i>Decision</i>, the appellate court declared respondent First United Constructors Corporation (FUCC) entitled to just compensation for blasting works it undertook in relation to a contract for the construction of power facilities it entered into with petitioner. The Court of Appeals, however, deleted the award for attorney’s fees having found no basis therefor.<br><br>The facts culled from the <i>Decision</i> of the Court of Appeals are undisputed:<br><blockquote>On April 14, 1992, NPC and FUCC entered into a contract for the construction of power facilities (civil works) – Schedule 1 – 1x20 MW Bacon-Manito II Modular Geothermal Power Plant (Cawayan area) and Schedule 1A – 1x20 MW Bacon-Manito II Modular Geothermal Power Plant (Botong area) in Bacon, Sorsogon (BACMAN II). The total contract price for the two schedules is P108,493,966.30, broken down as follows:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%"><div>SCHEDULE</div></td> <td width="80%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>1 – Cawayan area</td> <td>P52,081,421.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>1A – Botong area&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;">P56,412,545.30</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>P108,493,966.30</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Appended with the Contract is the contract price schedule which was submitted by the respondent FUCC during the bidding. The price for grading excavation was P76.00 per cubic meter.<br><br>Construction activities commenced in August 1992.&nbsp; In the latter part of September 1992 and after excavating 5.0 meters above the plant elevation, FUCC requested NPC that it be allowed to blast to the design grade of 495 meters above sea level as its dozers and rippers could no longer excavate. It further requested that it be paid P1,346.00 per cubic meter similar to the rate of NPC’s project in Palinpinon.<br><br>While blasting commenced on October 6, 1992, NPC and FUCC were discussing the propriety of an extra work order and if such is in order, at what price should FUCC be paid.<br><br>Sometime in March 1993, NPC Vice President for Engineering Construction, Hector Campos, created a task force to review FUCC’s blasting works. The technical task force recommended that FUCC be paid P458.07 per cubic meter as such being the price agreed upon by FUCC.<br><br>The matter was further referred to the Department of Public [W]orks and Highways (DPWH), which in a letter dated May 19, 1993, recommended the price range of P500.00 to P600.00 per cubic meter as reasonable.&nbsp; It further opined that the price of P983.75 per cubic meter proposed by Lauro R. Umali, Project Manager of BACMAN II was high. A copy of the DPWH letter is attached as Annex “C”, FUCC’s Exhibit EEE-Arbitration.<br><br>In a letter dated June 28, 1993, FUCC formally informed NPC that it is accepting the proposed price of P458.07 per cubic meter. A copy of the said letter is attached as Annex “D”, FUCC’s Exhibit L Arbitration.<br><br>In the meantime, by March 1993, the works in Botong area were in considerable delay. By May 1993, civil works in Botong were kept at a minimum until on November 1, 1993, the entire operation in the area completely ceased and FUCC abandoned the project.<br><br>Several written and verbal warnings were given by NPC to FUCC. On March 14, 1994, NPC’s Board of Directors passed Resolution No. 94-63 approving the recommendation of President Francisco L. Viray to take over the contract. President Viray’s recommendation to take over the project was compelled by the need to stave-off huge pecuniary and non-monetary losses, namely:<br><br> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Generation loss estimated to be at P26,546,400/month;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Payment of steam penalties to PNOC-EDC the amount estimated to be at P10,206,048.00/month;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Payment of liquidated damages due to the standby of electromechanical contractor;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Loss of guaranteed protection (warranties) of all delivered plant equipment and accessories as Mitsubishi Corporation, electromechanical contractor, will not be liable after six months of delivery.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>To prevent NPC from taking over the project, on March 28, 1994, FUCC filed an action for Specific Performance and Damages with Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order before Branch 99, Regional Trial Court, Quezon City.<br><br>Under paragraph 19 of its Complaint, FUCC admitted that it agreed to pay the price of P458.07 per cubic meter.<br><br>On April 5, 1994, Judge de Guzman issued a temporary restraining order and on April 21, 1994, the trial court resolved to grant the application for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>On July 7, 1994, NPC filed a Petition for Certiorari with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction before the First Division of the Court of Appeals asserting that no injunction may issue against any government projects pursuant to Presidential Decree 1818.<br><br>On July 8, 1994, the Court of Appeals through then Associate Justice Bernardo Pardo issued a temporary restraining order and on October 20, 1994, the said court rendered a Decision granting NPC’s Petition for Certiorari and setting aside the lower court’s Order dated April 21, 1994 and the Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated May 5, 1994.<br><br>However, notwithstanding the dissolution by the Court of Appeals of the said injunction, on July 15, 1995, FUCC filed a Complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman against several NPC employees for alleged violation of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Together with the complaint was an Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for the issuance of a cease and [d]esist [o]rder to restrain NPC and other NPC officials involved in the BACMAN II project from canceling and/or from taking over FUCC’s contract for civil works of said project.<br><br>Then on November 16, 1994, FUCC filed before the Supreme Court a Petition for Review assailing the Decision of the Court of [A]ppeals dated October 20, 1994. In its Comment, NPC raised the issue that FUCC resorted to forum shopping as it applied for a cease and desist order before the National Ombudsman despite the dissolution of the injunction by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Pending the petition filed by FUCC before the Supreme Court, on April 20, 1995 the NPC and FUCC entered into a Compromise Agreement.<br><br>Under the Compromise Agreement, the parties agreed on the following:<br><ol><li>Defendant shall process and pay the undisputed unpaid billings of Plaintiff in connection with the entire project fifteen (15) days after a reconciliation of accounts by both Plaintiff and Defendant or thirty (30) days from the date of approval of this Compromise Agreement by the Court whichever comes first.

On December 9, 1999 the Arbitration Board rendered its ruling the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, claimant is hereby declared entitled to an award of P118,681,328.28 as just compensation for blasting works, plus ten percent (10%) thereof for attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation.<br><br>Considering that payment in the total amount of P36,550,000.00 had previously been made, respondent is hereby ordered to pay claimant the remaining sum of P82,131,328.28 for attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation.<br><br>Pursuant to the Compromise Agreement approved by this Honorable Court, the parties have agreed that the decision of the Arbitration Board shall be final and executory.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>On December 10, 1999 plaintiff FUCC filed a Motion for Execution while defendant NPC filed a Motion to Vacate Award by the Arbitration Board on December 20, 1999.<br><br>On May 22, 2000 Presiding Judge Rose Marie Alonzo Legasto issued an order the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Arbitration Award issued by the Arbitration Board is hereby APPROVED and the Motion for Execution filed by plaintiff hereby GRANTED. The Motion to Vacate Award filed by defendant is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>Accordingly, let a writ of execution be issued to enforce the Arbitration Award.<br><br>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Bracketed words supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>NPC went to the Court of Appeals on the lone issue of whether respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the <i>Order</i> dated May 22, 2000 and directing the issuance of a <i>Writ of Execution</i>.<br><br>In its assailed <i>Decision</i>, the appellate court declared that the court <i>a quo</i> did not commit grave abuse of discretion considering that the Arbitration Board acted pursuant to its powers under the Compromise Agreement and that its award has factual and legal bases.<br><br>The Court of Appeals gave primacy to the court-approved Compromise Agreement entered into by the parties and concluded that they intended the decision of the arbitration panel to be final and executory.&nbsp; Said the court:<br><blockquote>For one, what the price agreed to be submitted for arbitration are pure issues of fact (<i>i.e.</i>, the price of blasting; both parties’ claims for damages, delay, interests and all other unresolved claims of both parties, including the exact volume of blasted rocks). Also, the manner by which the Arbitration Board was formed and the terms under which the arbitrable issues were referred to said Board are specified in the agreement. Clearly, the parties had left to the Arbitration Board the final adjudication of their remaining claims and waived their right to question said Decision of the Board. Hence, they agreed in clear and unequivocal terms in the Compromise Agreement that said Decision would be immediately final and executory. Plaintiff relied upon this stipulation in complying with its various obligations under the agreement. To allow defendant to now go back on its word and start questioning the Decision would be grossly unfair considering that the latter was also a party to the Compromise Agreement entered into part of which dealt with the creation of the Arbitration Board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court likewise held that petitioner failed to present evidence to prove its claim of bias and partiality on the part of the Chairman of the Arbitration Board, Mr. Carmelo V. Sison (Mr. Sison).<br><br>Further, the Court of Appeals found that blasting is not part of the unit price for grading and structural excavation provided for in the contract for the BACMAN II Project, and that there was no perfected contract between the parties for an extra work order for blasting. Nonetheless, since FUCC relied on the representation of petitioner’s officials that the extra work order would be submitted to its Board of Directors for approval and that the blasting works would be paid, the Court of Appeals ruled that FUCC is entitled to just compensation on grounds of equity and promissory estoppel.<br><br>Anent the issue of just compensation, the appellate court took into account the estimate prepared by a certain Mr. Lauro R. Umali (Mr. Umali), Project Manager of the BACMAN II Project, which itemized the various costs involved in blasting works and came up with P1,310.82 per cubic meter, consisting of the direct cost for drilling, blasting excavation, stockpiling and hauling, and a 30% mark up for overhead, contractor’s tax and contingencies. This estimate was later changed to P983.75 per cubic meter to which FUCC agreed.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals, however, held that just compensation should cover only the direct costs plus 10% for overhead expenses.&nbsp; Thus, it declared that the amount of P763.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> per cubic meter is sufficient.&nbsp; Since the total volume of blasted rocks as computed by Dr. Benjamin Buensuceso, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of the U.P. College of Engineering is 97,032.16 cubic meters, FUCC is entitled to the amount of P74,035,503.50 as just compensation.<br><br>Although the Court of Appeals adjudged FUCC entitled to interest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the dispositive portion of the assailed <i>Decision</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> did not provide for the payment of interest. Moreover, the award of attorney’s fees was deleted as there was no legal and factual ground for its imposition.<br><br>Petitioner, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General in the instant <i>Petition</i>, rehashes its submissions before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It claims that the appellate court failed to pass upon the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The Chairman of the Arbitration Board showed extreme bias in prejudging the case.<br><br></li><li>The Chairman of the Arbitration Board greatly exceeded his powers when he mediated for settlement in the court of arbitration proceedings.<br><br></li><li>The Chairman of the Arbitration Board committed serious irregularity in hastily convening the Board in two days, which thereafter released its report.<br><br></li><li>The Arbitration Board Committed manifest injustice prejudicial to petitioner based on the following:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>It rendered an award based on equity despite the mandatory provision of the law.<br><br></li><li>The Board’s decision to justify that equity applies herein despite the fact that <b>FUCC never submitted its own actual costs for blasting</b> and PHESCO, INC., the succeeding contractor, did not employ blasting but used ordinary excavation method at P75.59 per cubic meter which is approximately the same unit price of plaintiff (FUCC).<br><br></li><li>It gravely erred when the Board claimed that an award of just compensation must be given to respondent FUCC for <u>what it has actually spent</u> and yet instead of using as basis P458.07 which is the price agreed upon by FUCC, it chose an <u>estimate</u> made by an NPC employee.<br><br></li><li>It gravely erred when it relied heavily on the purported letter of NPC Project Manager Lauro R. Umali, when the same has not been identified nor were the handwritten entries in Annex ii established to be made by him.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>The Arbitration Board gravely erred in computing interest at 12% and from the time of plaintiff’s extrajudicial claim despite the fact that herein case is an action for specific performance and not for payment of loan or forbearance of money, and despite the fact that it has resolved that there was no perfected contract and there was no bad faith on the part of defendant.<br><br></li><li><b>On June 25, 2000, NPC discovered the Sub-Contract Agreement of FUCC with a unit price of only P430/per cubic meter.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> [Emphasis in the original]<br></li></ol></blockquote>Specifically, petitioner asserts that Mr. Sison exhibited bias and prejudgment when he exhorted it to pay FUCC for the blasting works after concluding that the latter was allowed to blast. Moreover, Mr. Sison allegedly attempted to mediate the conflict between the parties in violation of Section 20,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> paragraph 2 of Republic Act No. 876 (R.A. 876) otherwise known as the Arbitration Law.&nbsp; Petitioner also questions the abrupt manner by which the decision of the Arbitration Board was released.<br><br>Petitioner avers that FUCC’s claim for blasting works was not approved by authorized officials in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 1594 (P.D. 1594) and its implementing rules which specifically require the approval of the extra work by authorized officials before an extra work order may be issued in favor of the contractor.&nbsp; Thus, it should not be held liable for the claim.&nbsp; If at all, only the erring officials should be held liable.&nbsp; Further, FUCC did not present evidence to prove the actual expenses it incurred for the blasting works. What the Arbitration Board relied upon was the memorandum of Mr. Umali which was neither identified or authenticated during the arbitration proceedings nor marked as evidence for FUCC.&nbsp; Moreover, the figures indicated in Mr. Umali’s memorandum were allegedly mere estimates and were recommendatory at most.<br><br>Petitioner likewise claims that its succeeding contractor, Phesco, Inc. (Phesco), was able to excavate the same rock formation without blasting.<br><br>Finally, it asserts that the award of P763.00 per cubic meter has no factual and legal basis as the sub-contract between FUCC and its blasting sub-contractor, Dynamic Blasting Specialists of the Philippines (Dynamic), was only P430.00 per cubic meter.<br><br>In its <i>Comment</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated October 15, 2001, FUCC points out that petitioner’s arguments are exactly the same as the ones it raised before the Arbitration Board, the trial court and the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Moreover, in the Compromise Agreement between the parties, petitioner committed to abide by the decision of the Arbitration Board.&nbsp; It should not now be allowed to question the decision.<br><br>FUCC likewise notes that Atty. Jose G. Samonte (Atty. Samonte), one of the members of the Arbitration Board, was nominated by petitioner itself.&nbsp; If there was any irregularity in its proceedings such as the bias and prejudgment petitioner imputes upon Mr. Sison, Atty. Samonte would have complained. As it is, Atty. Samonte concurred in the decision of the Arbitration Board and dissented only as to the award of attorney’s fees.<br><br>As regards the issue of interest, FUCC claims that the case involves forbearance of money and not a claim for damages for breach of an obligation in which case interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum.<br><br>Finally, FUCC asserts that its sub-contract agreement with Dynamic is not newly-discovered evidence. Petitioner’s lawyers allegedly had a copy of the sub-contract in their possession.&nbsp; In any event, the unit price of P430.00 per cubic meter appearing in the sub-contract represents only a fraction of the costs incurred by FUCC for the blasting works.<br><br>Petitioner filed a <i>Reply</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 18, 2002 reiterating its earlier submissions.<br><br>The parties in the present case mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the settlement of the price of blasting, the parties’ claims for damages, delay and interests and all other unresolved claims including the exact volume of blasted rocks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> They further mutually agreed that the decision of the Arbitration Board shall be final and immediately executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>A stipulation submitting an ongoing dispute to arbitration is valid.&nbsp; As a rule, the arbitrator’s award cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or as to the facts. Courts are generally without power to amend or overrule merely because of disagreement with matters of law or facts determined by the arbitrators. They will not review the findings of law and fact contained in an award, and will not undertake to substitute their judgment for that of the arbitrators. A contrary rule would make an arbitration award the commencement, not the end, of litigation.&nbsp; Errors of law and fact, or an erroneous decision on matters submitted to the judgment of the arbitrators, are insufficient to invalidate an award fairly and honestly made. Judicial review of an arbitration award is, thus, more limited than judicial review of a trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>However, an arbitration award is not absolute and without exceptions.

In <i>Mendoza v.

Since the case does not involve a loan or forbearance of money, goods or credit and court judgments thereon, the interest due shall be computed at 6% per annum computed from the time the claim was made in 1992 as determined by the Arbitration Board and in accordance with Articles 2209 and 1169 of the Civil Code. The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall be on the amount finally adjudged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Further, when the judgment awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED in part. The appealed decision is MODIFIED in that the amount of P74,035,503.50 shall earn legal interest of six percent (6%) from 1992. &nbsp;A twelve percent (12%) interest, in lieu of six percent (6%), shall be imposed on such amount upon finality of this decision until the payment thereof.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr.,</i> and <i>Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 9-56.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 58-87; Penned by Associate Justice Eugenio S.
