				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Bangued, Abra, Branch 2, convicting the appellant Rodrigo Almazan of murder and sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of fourteen (14) years, ten (10) months and twenty (20) days of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as minimum, to eighteen (18) years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> on February 27, 1998 affirming the decision of the trial court but increasing the penalty to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The CA certified the case to this Court pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The Court accepted the case.<p></p><p>The appellant was charged with murder in an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>That on or about the 14<sup>th</sup> day of May 1989, at around 9:00 o’clock in the morning, at Barangay Calaba, in the municipality of Bangued, province of Abra, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, and while armed with a firearm (unrecovered), did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot one LORETO APOLINAR several times, hitting him on the head and other parts of his body, which caused his death shortly thereafter, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The appellant was duly arraigned, assisted by counsel, and entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p align="center"><em>The Case for the Prosecution</em></p><p>The first witness of the prosecution was Felimar Apolinar who testified that her husband Loreto Apolinar worked as a weaver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In the morning of May 14, 1989, she and Loreto were taking a bath at the Abra River, Barangay Calaba, about 45 meters away from their house. She also washed clothes. By 9:00 a.m., they decided to go home. From the river, they trekked by a narrow trail. She carried a basin by her side full of washed clothes. Loreto, who was naked from waist up, was ahead of her by 9 meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Suddenly, Rodrigo (Odit) Almazan, who was armed with a foot-long firearm,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> jumped from the hill at Loreto’s right side and landed slightly at a distance of about a meter from him. Almazan then aimed his gun at Loreto and shot him. The muzzle of the gun was about 2 feet from Loreto. Although already mortally wounded and bloodied, Loreto instinctively fled towards the house of spouses Eriberto and Francisca Sequerra, which was 45 meters away from the place where the appellant first shot Loreto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Almazan, still armed with his gun, pursued Loreto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Felimar followed the two, shouting and pleading in the Ilocano dialect to Almazan, “<em>Odit, Odit, Odit, don’t shoot my husband!</em>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Almazan ignored her. Loreto managed to enter the house of the Sequerras.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Almazan barged inside the house and saw Loreto crawling toward the <em>sawali</em> wall. Felimar managed to reach the first step of the stairs to the said house but was shocked when Almazan shot Loreto for the second time. Almazan then went out of the house and, upon seeing Felimar at the foot of the stairs, told her, “<em>You are also one (sic), you want that I will kill you!</em>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Before Felimar could reply, Almazan fled from the scene. Felimar ran to the house of their neighbor, Patrolman Juanito Blanes of the Bangued Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She reported the shooting to him and sought help. She then lost consciousness and came to her senses only after about 30 minutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The next day, May 15, 1989, she gave her sworn statement to Pat. Antonio Carpio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p>Patrolman Juanito Blanes testified that on May 14, 1989, between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., he was on board a tricycle on his way to his house at Barangay Calaba when he met Almazan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> When he arrived home, he heard two gunshots. After a couple of minutes, Francisca Sequerra arrived in his house, pleading, “Brother, help us because Loreto Apolinar entered our house and he was shot by Rodrigo Almazan.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Blanes took his pistol and left his house to go to the house of the Sequerras.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On his way, he met Felimar who also pleaded to him saying, “Please brother, help us because Rodrigo Almazan killed my husband.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When he arrived at the Sequerras’ house, Loreto was already dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He sent someone to report the matter to the Bangued Police Station. Momentarily, Corporal Catalino Buenafe and Lt. Esteban Pangda arrived and conducted an on-the-spot investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> They also took pictures of the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> One of the pictures showed Loreto’s head protruding through the <em>sawali </em>wall of the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>Francisca Sequerra testified that on May 14, 1989 at 9:00 a.m., she was washing clothes in the Abra River.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> She was with Monching Bayle, Rening Sequerra and some children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> She also saw Loreto and even joked with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, she did not see Felimar in the river on that occasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As she was climbing up to the trail on her way home, Loreto, who was then behind her, pleaded for her help. She saw Loreto bloodied all over. Afraid for her life, she did not help Loreto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The latter passed by her and ran towards their (Sequerras’) house. Instead of going home, Francisca opted to proceed to the place where there were several people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thereafter, she no longer knew what happened to Loreto.</p><p>On July 11, 1989, or almost two weeks from the killing, Francisca gave a statement to Staff Sergeant (S/Sgt.) Edgardo C. Dacquel of the 123rd PC Company/Police District I, Camp Juan Villamor, Bangued, Abra. In her statement, she stated that when she was about to reach her house from the river, he heard gunfire and heard Loreto pleading to her, “I am shot, please help me, sister!” Loreto repeated his plea to her as he passed by her and fled to her house. She noticed that Loreto was bloodied all over. When she arrived home, her mother-in-law, Maxima Sequerra, instructed her to report the matter and seek help from the police. She left the house to report the matter to Patrolman Juanito Blanes. Aside from her mother-in-law, Francisca’s daughter, Maria Sequerra, and her children were also in the house. She did not know who shot Loreto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> She testified, on cross examination, that when she reported the matter to Blanes, she did not tell the policeman that it was Almazan who shot Loreto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p>The prosecution presented S/Sgt. Dacquel who identified his Report dated August 31, 1989 on the killing of Loreto by Almazan which S/Sgt. Dacquel submitted to the Provincial Commander/Police Superintendent, Abra PC/INP Command. S/Sgt. Dacquel recommended that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>10. … Criminal Complaint for MURDER be filed against C2C Rodrigo Almazan PC before the competent military court.</p><p>11. … C2C Rodrigo Almazan PC be summarily discharged from the military service, effective upon approval so that his case will be tried in the merits of the civil court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The Provincial Commander concurred with the foregoing recommendation. The order discharging Almazan from the service was approved by the appropriate officer of the military on November 23, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>Dr. Herminio B. Venus, Medical Specialist I of the Abra Provincial Hospital, testified that he conducted an autopsy on Loreto’s cadaver. He, thereafter, prepared an Autopsy Report containing the following findings:</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="40%"><tbody><tr><td width="47%">DIAGNOSIS: </td><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="48%">MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUND</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>HEAD AND CHEST THRU</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>AND THRU</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>CADAVER </td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>Lividity and Rigidity</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Length – 160 centimeter</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Weight – 60 kilos</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>EXTERNAL FINDINGS:</p></blockquote><ol>&nbsp; <li>Gunshot wound.

Besides, Felimar’s testimony is incredible and barren of probative weight because it is frontally contradicted by the testimony and sworn statement of Francisca.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Felimar could not have run after Loreto and the appellant and reach the house of the Sequerras in time for her to hear the second gunfire from the appellant’s firearm because she was then around eight months pregnant. The house of the Sequerras was about 247 meters from the Abra River. Felimar could not have negotiated the distance of 200 meters from the Sequerras’ house to the house of Blanes in her physical condition. If she saw the appellant shoot and kill Loreto, certainly, the appellant would have also killed her to eliminate any witness against him. Hence, Felimar’s testimony that the appellant even threatened to shoot her is implausible. The testimony of Felimar is even contradicted by the physical evidence. For, if as claimed by her, Loreto was first shot at around a distance of 2 feet between the gun muzzle and skin, a shotgun blast would have produced a single entry wound although there may be isolated shots causing independent entry. In this case, the first gunshot wound on the chest of the victim produced eight separate and independent entry wounds on the victim’s chest. Such number of entry wounds could only have been caused or produced by a buckshot fired at a muzzle to skin distance of at least ten feet. When police investigators arrived at the scene, they did not even investigate Felimar and did not take her statement thereat. They merely asked her the assailant’s name. The appellant could not have killed Loreto because he was a guard on duty at the PC Camp La Paz, Abra, on May 14, 1989 from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. It was only in November 1989 when he learned, for the first time, that he was a suspect in the killing of Loreto.</p><p>The appeal is dismissed.</p><p>First. Felimar positively identified the appellant as her husband’s assailant.

Dacquel on July 11, 1989 that from the river she was able to reach her house and, upon the instructions of her mother-in-law, she sped to the house of Blanes and sought his help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The second statement of Francisca belies her testimony that instead of proceeding to her house, she went to another house where there were several people. The trial court disbelieved parts and believed the other portions of Francisca’s testimony. The trial court cannot be faulted for so doing. It was its duty to determine which portions of the testimony are credible and which portions are not. In <em>People v. Quilang</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> this Court held that courts may believe one part of the testimony of a witness and disbelieve other parts depending on its inherent credibility or the corroborative evidence in the record. In contrast, Felimar had not committed any material inconsistency in her sworn statement and her testimony before the trial court. The appellant failed to present any witness to corroborate Francisca’s testimony that Felimar was not in the river when Loreto was taking a bath and she (Francisca) was washing clothes in the river. Likewise, the trial court cannot be faulted for giving full probative weight to the testimony of Felimar.</p><p>Parenthetically, S/Sgt. Dacquel, who conducted the investigation on the appellant’s involvement in the killing of Loreto, on orders of the Acting Commanding Officer/District Commander and to whom Francisca gave her sworn statement on July 11, 1989, in his report, noted that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>… Francing Sequerra, on the other hand, might have also seen or witnessed the tragedy but for fear of being involved or be implicated by the Almazan’s, (sic) she have (sic) turned blind and deaf, so as to save her life and limb. (Autopsy Report of the late Loreto Apolinar hereto attached and marked as Tab-“D”) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Third. Admittedly, when the appellant shot the victim on May 14, 1989, Felimar was eight months on the family way. The distance from the place where the appellant first shot Loreto to the house of the Sequerras was only 45 meters. Completely unmindful of her physical condition and determined to help her husband at all costs, she followed the appellant and Loreto to the house of the Sequerras. There is no evidence that right after the appellant caught up with Loreto at the Sequerras’ house, the appellant shot Loreto immediately. It is possible that a struggle ensued between Loreto and the appellant even as the former crawled to the <em>sawali </em>wall of the house and managed to insert his head through the said wall. By the time Felimar reached the first step of the stairs of the house, the appellant gave Loreto the <em>coup de grace</em> and shot him for the second time, this time on the head.</p><p>Fourth. That the appellant ensured the death of Loreto by shooting him twice with a long firearm but did not shoot Felimar is not difficult to believe. The evidence on record shows that the appellant intended and was bent on killing Loreto only. The appellant had no motive to kill Felimar, Francisca, or any of the other people present, for that matter. Indeed, there was no reason for him to kill Felimar. Besides, she was eight months on the family way. The appellant must have thought that although Felimar witnessed the killing of her husband, she would be too petrified to divulge the assailant’s identity, just like Francisca. However, Felimar proved to be of sterner stuff. She was determined to put the appellant behind bars for his dastardly crime.</p><p>Despite her condition, it was not physically impossible for Felimar to have trekked the 250-meter distance between the house of the Sequerras and that of Blanes and sought the latter’s help. There is no evidence on how Felimar was able to cover said distance. She could have reached the house of Blanes via a tricycle or other mode of transportation. It is not quite far-fetched that despite her pregnancy, Felimar was able to run from the place where the appellant first shot her husband to the house of the Sequerras, which was only 45 meters, and from there, still managed to go to Blanes’ house, which was only 250 meters away.</p><p>The Court observes that the spouses Loreto and Felimar worked in the farm. It is established in the medical field that some pregnant women, even late in pregnancy, have run marathons of considerable distance without apparent harm to themselves or their fetuses:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>In general, it is not necessary for the pregnant woman to limit exercise, provided she does not become excessively fatigued or risk injury to herself or her fetus. The current enthusiasm for jogging has also attracted a number of pregnant women to the endeavor. In fact, several women, even late in pregnancy, have run in marathons of considerable distance without apparent harm to themselves or their fetuses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Fifth. The appellant claims that Felimar’s testimony that when he first shot Loreto, the muzzle of the gun was only 1-1/2 to 2 feet from the victim, is belied by physical evidence. He insists that if her testimony were true, then there should have been only a single entry wound. However, the autopsy report showed that Loreto had eight entry wounds on his chest. We do not agree with the appellant. The fact that the victim had been shot by a shotgun at 2 to 3 feet muzzle to skin distance does not preclude the possibility of independent entry. Dr. Pedro Solis notes that:&nbsp; </p><ol start="2"><li><em>Long Range Shot (more than 6 inches skin-muzzle distance):</em>&nbsp; </li></ol><ol type="a"><li>At 2 to 3 feet muzzle-skin distance, there is still a single wound of entry although there may be isolated shots causing independent entry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></li></ol><p>Sixth. As found by the trial court and the CA, which we find supported by the evidence, the prosecution proved that the appellant had an ill-motive to kill Loreto:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Lastly, the theory of the police that the motive for the killing of the victim is revenge because earlier, the victim, Loreto Apolinar was accused for killing P.C. S/Sgt. Rogelio Almazan, brother of the accused on January 18, 1988, and a criminal complaint for homicide was filed against Loreto Apolinar, the victim in the instant case or I.S. No. 178 of the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Abra, but the resolution of the fiscal exonerated the then respondent Apolinar, (Exhibit “1”), and the accused in killing the victim was out to revenge his brother’s death is not farfetched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p></blockquote><p>S/Sgt. Dacquel, based on his report, concluded that the appellant killed Loreto to avenge the death of his brother Rogelio Almazan:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>… This is the true fact, but all these facts cannot be admitted by the Almazan’s (sic), who have conceived hatred and taken revenge and killing the brother of Loreto Apolinar, who was hacked and stabbed to death by the Almanzan’s (<em>sic</em>). But not yet satisfied with what they have done to the brother of Loreto Apolinar, the Almazan’s (<em>sic</em>) have not stopped, not until C2C Rodrigo Almazan succeeded in killing his prime target. With all these facts and circumstances, clearly manifest that C2C Rodrigo Almazan PC of the 135<sup>th</sup> PC Company, is the killer of the late Loreto Apolinar, as being properly identified/pinpointed by the widow of Loreto Apolinar and who was likewise threatened to be killed by C2C Rodrigo Almazan. …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The Provincial Commander of Abra and the Acting Commanding Officer/District Commander of the Philippine Constabulary agreed with the findings of S/Sgt. Dacquel.</p><p>In rejecting the appellant’s defense of alibi, we agree with the encompassing disquisitions of the trial court:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>To fortify his defense of <em>alibi</em>, the accused submitted the following documentary evidence, to wit: Exhibits 3, Morning Report, 4, 5, 6 and 7, disposition and location of troops from May 12 to 14, 1989; Exhibit 9, guard detail and the testimony of witnesses. The time honored albeit weather beaten but still is the prevailing doctrine in this jurisdiction is that <em>alibi</em> is the weakest defense for the reason that it can easily be concocted and fabricated and for this defense to hold water the physical impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the particular hour and day of its commission must be established. The place where the accused claim he was at the time of the commission of the crime is only a scant 10 kilometers away which can be negotiated by land transportation means in 30 minutes. The estimation of witnesses of the approximate time of commission of the crime is <em>around</em> 9:00 o’clock in the morning, the end of the guard duty of the accused in the morning of May 14, 1989. He is to go on guard again at 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon of that day, his last duty. So that between 9:00 o’clock A.M. to 1:00 o’clock P.M. May 14, 1989, he is off duty and the crime was committed at around 9:00 o’clock in the morning of May 14, 1989. It is not really impossible for the accused to be in the vicinity of the scene of the crime at around 9:00 o’clock in the morning of May 14, 1989. But the most damaging evidence against the accused <em>viz-a-viz</em> his defense of <em>alibi</em>, is his positive identification by the wife of the victim, Mrs. Felimar Apolinar, a neighbor in Calaba, Bangued, Abra, who has known the accused since childhood as the assailant of her husband Loreto Apolinar and the identification by another resident of Calaba, Police Officer Juanito Blanes of the Bangued Police Station, Bangued, Abra, who testified that on his way home to Calaba, Bangued, Abra, he saw between the hours of 8:00 o’clock and 9:00 o’clock in the morning of May 14, 1989, the accused riding on a tricycle driven by one Marlon Barroga. After some 30 minutes from the time he arrived home, Blanes heard the 2 gunshots. He took his service firearm proceeded to the place where he heard the shots to investigate and on the way he met Felimar, wife of the victim who immediately sought his help about the shooting of her husband. <br></p><p>This <em>alibi</em> defense and the documents presented in this trial, as official records of the 135 P.C. Company were the subject of investigation by authorities at the Constabulary Headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, Exhibit “14”, but apparently the constabulary authorities did not give any credence to his defense because he was discharged from the military service effective November 30, 1989, not even giving him the chance to present his evidence. In other words, it was a summary dismissal a procedure resorted to by the military when there is no more need to investigate the case further because of the notoriety of the occurrence giving rise to the controversy and that whatever defense may be proffered by the respondent cannot overcome the preponderance of evidence on record against him. This is what happened in this case and the regularity of the performance of duty and functions by government officials is presumed. No evidence was ever offered by the accused to overcome it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p></blockquote><p align="center"><em>The Crime Committed by the Appellant</em></p><p>We agree with the trial court and the CA that under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the appellant is guilty of murder qualified by treachery. The crime was committed before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 7659; hence, the crime was punishable by <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its maximum period to death under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Further, under Republic Act No. 8294 amending Presidential Decree No. 1866, the use of an unlicensed firearm to commit homicide or murder is a special aggravating circumstance in the commission of the crime. The Information merely alleged that the appellant used a firearm to kill the victim. It did not allege that the same was unlicensed. Neither was it proved by the prosecution that the appellant had no license to possess the firearm. The appellant’s lack of license to possess the firearm is an essential element of the circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Unless it is alleged in the Information and proved by the prosecution, the use by the appellant of an unlicensed firearm to commit murder is not aggravating. Besides, the crime was committed before the effectivity of the Revised Rules of Court and Rep. Act No. 8294. Hence, the aggravating circumstance should not be appreciated against the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p>There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attendant to the crime, the medium period of the penalty imposed by the law for the crime, namely, reclusion perpetua, shall be imposed on the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In this case, the CA correctly imposed the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p><p>On the civil liability of the appellant, he should be ordered to pay exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim conformably to current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p><strong>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</strong>, the appeal is <em>DISMISSED</em>. The Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated February 27, 1998, is <em>AFFIRMED</em> with <em>MODIFICATION</em>.
