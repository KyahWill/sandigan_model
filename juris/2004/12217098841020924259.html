				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>This is a petition for prohibition to set aside Resolution No. NBC 01-005 dated 5 June 2001 (“Resolution No. 01-005”) and Resolution No. NBC 01-006 dated 20 July 2001 (“Resolution No. 01-006”) of respondent Commission on Elections (“COMELEC”). Resolution No. 01-005 proclaimed the 13 candidates elected as Senators in the 14 May 2001 elections while Resolution No. 01-006 declared “official and final” the ranking of the 13 Senators proclaimed in Resolution No. 01-005.<br><center><br><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>Shortly after her succession to the Presidency in January 2001, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo nominated then Senator Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (“Senator Guingona”) as Vice-President.&nbsp; Congress confirmed the nomination of Senator Guingona who took his oath as Vice-President on 9 February 2001.<br><br>Following Senator Guingona’s confirmation, the Senate on 8 February 2001 passed Resolution No. 84 (“Resolution No. 84”) certifying to the existence of a vacancy in the Senate. Resolution No. 84 called on COMELEC to fill the vacancy through a special election to be held simultaneously with the regular elections on 14 May 2001. Twelve Senators, with a 6-year term each, were due to be elected in that election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Resolution No. 84 further provided that the “Senatorial candidate garnering the 13<sup>th</sup> highest number of votes shall serve only for the unexpired term of former Senator Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr.,” which ends on 30 June 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On 5 June 2001, after COMELEC had canvassed the election results from all the provinces but one (Lanao del Norte), COMELEC issued Resolution No. 01-005 provisionally proclaiming 13 candidates as the elected Senators. Resolution No. 01-005 also provided that “the first twelve (12) Senators shall serve for a term of six (6) years and the thirteenth (13<sup>th</sup>) Senator shall serve the unexpired term of three (3) years of Senator Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. who was appointed Vice-President.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Respondents Ralph Recto (“Recto”) and Gregorio Honasan (“Honasan”) ranked 12<i>th</i> and 13<sup>th</sup>, respectively, in Resolution No. 01-005.<br><br>On 20 June 2001, petitioners Arturo Tolentino and Arturo Mojica (“petitioners”), as voters and taxpayers, filed the instant petition for prohibition, impleading only COMELEC as respondent. Petitioners sought to enjoin COMELEC from proclaiming with finality the candidate for Senator receiving the 13<sup>th</sup> highest number of votes as the winner in the special election for a single three-year term seat. Accordingly, petitioners prayed for the nullification of Resolution No. 01-005 in so far as it makes a proclamation to such effect.<br><br>Petitioners contend that COMELEC issued Resolution No. 01-005 without jurisdiction because: (1) it failed to notify the electorate of the position to be filled in the special election as required under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 6645 (“R.A. No. 6645”);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (2) it failed to require senatorial candidates to indicate in their certificates of candidacy whether they seek election under the special or regular elections as allegedly required under Section 73 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and, consequently, (3) it failed to specify in the Voters&nbsp; Information&nbsp; Sheet&nbsp; the&nbsp; candidates seeking election under the special or regular senatorial elections as purportedly required under Section 4, paragraph 4 of Republic Act No. 6646 (“R.A. No. 6646”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Petitioners add that because of these omissions, COMELEC canvassed all the votes cast for the senatorial candidates in the 14 May 2001 elections without distinction such that “there were no two separate Senate elections held simultaneously but just a single election for thirteen seats, irrespective of term.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Stated otherwise, petitioners claim that if held simultaneously, a special and a regular election must be distinguished in the documentation as well as in the canvassing of their results.&nbsp; To support their claim, petitioners cite the special elections simultaneously held with the regular elections of 13 November 1951 and 8 November 1955 to fill the seats vacated by Senators Fernando Lopez and Carlos P. Garcia, respectively, who became Vice-Presidents during their tenures in the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petitioners point out that in those elections, COMELEC separately canvassed the votes cast for the senatorial candidates running under the regular elections from the votes cast for the candidates running under the special elections.&nbsp; COMELEC also separately proclaimed the winners in each of those elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioners sought the issuance of a temporary restraining order during the pendency of their petition.<br><br>Without issuing any restraining order, we required COMELEC to Comment on the petition.<br><br>On 20 July 2001, after COMELEC had canvassed the results from all the provinces, it issued Resolution No. 01-006 declaring “official and final” the ranking of the 13 Senators proclaimed in Resolution No. 01-005. The 13 Senators took their oaths of office on 23 July 2001.<br><br>In view of the issuance of Resolution No. 01-006, the Court required petitioners to file an amended petition impleading Recto and Honasan as additional respondents. Petitioners accordingly filed an amended petition in which they reiterated the contentions raised in their original petition and, in addition, sought the nullification of Resolution No. 01-006.<br><br>In their Comments, COMELEC, Honasan, and Recto all claim that a special election to fill the seat vacated by Senator Guingona was validly held on 14 May 2001.&nbsp; COMELEC and Honasan further raise preliminary issues on the mootness of the petition and on petitioners’ standing to litigate. Honasan also claims that the petition, which seeks the nullity of his proclamation as Senator, is actually a <i>quo warranto</i> petition and the Court should dismiss the same for lack of jurisdiction. For his part, Recto, as the 12<sup>th</sup> ranking Senator, contends he is not a proper party to this case because the petition only involves the validity of the proclamation of the 13<sup>th</sup> placer in the 14 May 2001 senatorial elections.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>The following are the issues presented for resolution:<br><br>(1) Procedurally –&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <blockquote>(a) whether the petition is in fact a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> over which the Senate Electoral Tribunal is the sole judge;<br><br>(b) whether the petition is moot; and<br><br>(c) whether petitioners have standing to litigate.<br></blockquote>(2) On the merits, whether a special election to fill a vacant three-year term Senate seat was validly held on 14 May 2001.<br><center><br><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b><br></center><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br><center><b><i>On the Preliminary Matters</i></b><br></center><br><b><i>The Nature of the Petition and the Court’s Jurisdiction</i></b><br><br>A <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding is, among others, one to determine the right of a public officer in the exercise of his office and to oust him from its enjoyment if his claim is not well-founded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Under Section 17, Article VI of the Constitution, the Senate Electoral Tribunal is the sole judge of all contests relating to the qualifications of the members of the Senate.<br><br>A perusal of the allegations contained in the instant petition shows, however, that what petitioners are questioning is the validity of the special election on 14 May 2001 in which Honasan was elected.&nbsp; Petitioners’ various prayers are, namely: (1) a “declaration” that no special election was held simultaneously with the general elections on 14 May 2001; (2) to enjoin COMELEC from declaring anyone as having won in the special election; and (3) to annul Resolution Nos. 01-005 and 01-006 in so far as these Resolutions proclaim Honasan as the winner in the special election.&nbsp; Petitioners anchor their prayers on COMELEC’s alleged failure to comply with certain requirements pertaining to the conduct of that special election.&nbsp; Clearly then, the petition does not seek to determine Honasan’s right in the exercise of his office as Senator. Petitioners’ prayer for the annulment of Honasan’s proclamation and, ultimately, election is merely incidental to petitioners’ cause of action. Consequently, the Court can properly exercise jurisdiction over the instant petition.<br><br><b><i>On the Mootness of the Petition</i></b><br><br>COMELEC contends that its proclamation on 5 June 2001 of the 13&nbsp; Senators and its subsequent confirmation on 20 July 2001 of the ranking of the 13 Senators render the instant petition to set aside Resolutions Nos. 01-005 and 01-006 moot and academic.<br><br>Admittedly, the office of the writ of prohibition is to command a tribunal or board to desist from committing an act threatened to be done without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Consequently, the writ will not lie to enjoin acts already done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, as an exception to the rule on mootness, courts will decide a question otherwise moot if it is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, in <b><i>Alunan III v. Mirasol</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> we took cognizance of a petition to set aside an order canceling the general elections for the Sangguniang Kabataan (“SK”) on 4 December 1992 despite that at the time the petition was filed, the SK election had already taken place. We noted in <b><i>Alunan</i></b> that since the question of the validity of the order sought to be annulled “is likely to arise in every SK elections and yet the question may not be decided before the date of such elections,” the mootness of the petition is no bar to its resolution. This observation squarely applies to the instant case. The question of the validity of a special election to fill a vacancy in the Senate in relation to COMELEC’s failure to comply with requirements on the conduct of such special election is likely to arise in every such election.&nbsp; Such question, however, may not be decided before the date of the election.<br><br><b><i>On Petitioners’ Standing</i></b><br><br>Honasan questions petitioners’ standing to bring the instant petition as taxpayers and voters because petitioners do not claim that COMELEC illegally disbursed public funds. Neither do petitioners claim that they sustained personal injury because of the issuance of Resolution Nos. 01-005 and 01-006.<br><br>“Legal standing” or <i>locus standi</i> refers to a personal and substantial interest in a case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury because of the challenged governmental act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The requirement of standing, which necessarily “sharpens the presentation of issues,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> relates to the constitutional mandate that this Court settle only actual cases or controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thus, generally, a party will be allowed to litigate only when (1) he can show that he has personally suffered some actual or threatened injury because of the allegedly illegal conduct of the government; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Applied strictly, the doctrine of standing to litigate will indeed bar the instant petition. In questioning, in their capacity as voters, the validity of the special election on 14 May 2001, petitioners assert a harm classified as a “generalized grievance.” This generalized grievance is shared in substantially equal measure by a large class of voters, if not all the voters, who voted in that election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Neither have petitioners alleged, in their capacity as taxpayers, that the Court should give due course to the petition because in the special election held on 14 May 2001 “tax money [was] ‘x x x extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against abuses of legislative power’ or that there [was] misapplication of such funds by COMELEC or that public money [was] deflected to any improper purpose.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, we have relaxed the requirement on standing and exercised our discretion to give due course to voters’ suits involving the right of suffrage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Also, in the recent case of <b><i>Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we gave the same liberal treatment to a petition filed by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (“IBP”).&nbsp; The IBP questioned the validity of a Presidential directive deploying elements of the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Marines in Metro Manila to conduct patrols even though the IBP presented “too general an interest.” We held:<br><blockquote>[T]he IBP primarily anchors its standing on its alleged responsibility to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution. Apart from this declaration, however, the IBP asserts no other basis in support of its <i>locus standi</i>. The mere invocation by the IBP of its duty to preserve the rule of law and nothing more, while undoubtedly true, is not sufficient to clothe it with standing in this case.&nbsp; <u>This is too general an interest which is shared by other groups and the whole citizenry</u> x x x.<br><br>Having stated the foregoing, this Court has the discretion to take cognizance of a suit which does not satisfy the requirement of legal standing when paramount interest is involved.&nbsp; In not a few cases, the court has adopted a liberal attitude on the <i>locus standi</i> of a petitioner where the petitioner is able to craft an issue of transcendental significance to the people.&nbsp; Thus, when the issues raised are of paramount importance to the public, the Court may brush aside technicalities of procedure.&nbsp; <u>In this case, a reading of the petition shows that the IBP has advanced constitutional issues which deserve the attention of this Court in view of their seriousness, novelty and weight as precedents.&nbsp; Moreover, because peace and order are under constant threat and lawless violence occurs in increasing tempo, undoubtedly aggravated by the Mindanao insurgency problem, the legal controversy raised in the petition almost certainly will not go away.&nbsp; It will stare us in the face again.&nbsp; It, therefore, behooves the Court to relax the rules on standing and to resolve the issue now, rather than later</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>We accord the same treatment to petitioners in the instant case in their capacity as voters since they raise important issues involving their right of suffrage, considering that the issue raised in this petition is likely to arise again.<br><center><br><b><i>Whether a Special Election for a Single, Three-Year Term<br>Senatorial Seat was Validly Held on 14 May 2001</i></b><br></center><br>Under Section 9, Article VI of the Constitution, a special election may be called to fill any vacancy in the Senate and the House of Representatives “in the manner prescribed by law,” thus:<br><blockquote>In case of vacancy in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, a special election may be called to fill such vacancy <u>in the manner prescribed by law</u>, but the Senator or Member of the House of Representatives thus elected shall serve only for the unexpired term. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To implement this provision of the Constitution, Congress passed R.A. No. 6645, which provides in pertinent parts:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. In case a vacancy arises in the Senate at least eighteen (18) months or in the House of Representatives at least one (1) year before the next regular election for Members of Congress, the Commission on Elections, upon receipt of a resolution of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, certifying to the existence of such vacancy and calling for a special election, shall hold a special election to fill such vacancy.&nbsp; If Congress is in recess, an official communication on the existence of the vacancy and call for a special election by the President of the Senate or by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case may be, shall be sufficient for such purpose.&nbsp; The Senator or Member of the House of Representatives thus elected shall serve only for the unexpired term.<br><br>SECTION 2. The Commission on Elections shall <u>fix the date of the special election</u>, which shall not be earlier than forty-five (45) days nor later than ninety (90) days from the date of such resolution or communication, <u>stating among other things the office or offices to be voted for</u>: <i>Provided, however</i>, That if within the said period a general election is scheduled to be held, the special election shall be held simultaneously with such general election.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7166 subsequently amended Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as follows:<br><blockquote><i>Postponement, Failure of Election and Special Elections</i>. – x x x In case a permanent vacancy shall occur in the Senate or House of Representatives at least one (1) year before the expiration of the term, the Commission shall call and hold a special election to fill the vacancy not earlier than sixty (60) days nor longer than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the vacancy.&nbsp; <u>However, in case of such vacancy in the Senate, the special election shall be held simultaneously with the next succeeding regular election</u>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, in case a vacancy arises in Congress at least one year before the expiration of the term, Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as amended, requires COMELEC: (1) to call a special election by fixing the date of the special election, which shall not be earlier than sixty (60) days nor later than ninety (90) after the occurrence of the vacancy but in case of a vacancy in the Senate, the special election shall be held simultaneously with the next succeeding regular election; and (2) to give notice to the voters of, among other things, the office or offices to be voted for.<br><br>Did COMELEC, in conducting the special senatorial election simultaneously with the 14 May 2001 regular elections, comply with the requirements in Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645?<br><br>A survey of COMELEC’s resolutions relating to the conduct of the 14 May 2001 elections reveals that they contain nothing which would amount to a compliance, either strict or substantial, with the requirements in Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as amended. Thus, nowhere in its resolutions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> or even in its press releases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> did COMELEC state that it would hold a special election for a single three-year term Senate seat simultaneously with the regular elections on 14 May 2001. Nor did COMELEC give formal notice that it would proclaim as winner the senatorial candidate receiving the 13th highest number of votes in the special election.<br><br>The controversy thus turns on whether COMELEC’s failure, assuming it did fail, to comply with the requirements in Section 2 of R.A.&nbsp; No. 6645, as amended, invalidated the conduct of the special senatorial election on 14 May 2001 and accordingly rendered Honasan’s proclamation as the winner in that special election void. More precisely, the question is whether the special election is invalid for lack of a “call” for such election and for lack of notice as to the office to be filled and the manner by which the winner in the special election is to be determined. For reasons stated below, the Court answers in the negative.<br><br><b><i>COMELEC’s Failure to Give Notice<br>of the Time of the Special Election Did Not<br>Negate the Calling of such Election</i></b><br><br>The calling of an election, that is, the giving notice of the time and place of its occurrence, whether made by the legislature directly or by the body with the duty to give such call, is indispensable to the election’s validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In a general election, where the law fixes the date of the election, the election is valid without any call by the body charged to administer the election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In a special election to fill a vacancy, the rule is that a statute that expressly provides that an election to fill a vacancy shall be held at the next general elections fixes the date at which the special election is to be held and operates as the call for that election.&nbsp; Consequently, an election held at the time thus prescribed is not invalidated by the fact that the body charged by law with the duty of calling the election failed to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This is because the right and duty to hold the election emanate from the statute and not from any call for the election by some authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and the law thus charges voters with knowledge of the time and place of the election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Conversely, where the law does not fix the time and place for holding a special election but empowers some authority to fix the time and place after the happening of a condition precedent, the statutory provision on the giving of notice is considered mandatory, and failure to do so will render the election a nullity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645 itself provides that in case of vacancy in the Senate, the special election to fill such vacancy shall be held simultaneously with the next succeeding regular election.&nbsp; Accordingly, the special election to fill the vacancy in the Senate arising from Senator Guingona’s appointment as Vice-President in February 2001 could not be held at any other time but must be held simultaneously with the next succeeding regular elections on 14 May 2001.&nbsp; The law charges the voters with knowledge of this statutory notice and COMELEC’s failure to give the additional notice did not negate the calling of such special election, much less invalidate it.<br><br>Our conclusion might be different had the present case involved a special election to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives.&nbsp; In such a case, the holding of the special election is subject to a condition precedent, that is, the vacancy should take place at least one year before the expiration of the term.&nbsp; The time of the election is left to the discretion of COMELEC subject only to the limitation that it holds the special election within the range of time provided in Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as amended.&nbsp; This makes mandatory the requirement in Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as amended, for COMELEC to “call x x x a special election x x x not earlier than 60 days nor longer than 90 days after the occurrence of the vacancy” and give notice of the office to be filled.&nbsp; The COMELEC’s failure to so call and give notice will nullify any attempt to hold a special election to fill the vacancy.&nbsp; Indeed, it will be well-nigh impossible for the voters in the congressional district involved to know the time and place of the special election and the office to be filled unless the COMELEC so notifies them.<br><br><b><i>No Proof that COMELEC’s<br>Failure to Give Notice of the Office<br>to be Filled and the Manner of<br>Determining the Winner in the Special<br>Election Misled Voters</i></b><br><br>The test in determining the validity of a special election in relation to the failure to give notice of the special election is whether the want of notice has resulted in misleading a sufficient number of voters as would change the result of the special election. If the lack of official notice misled a substantial number of voters who wrongly believed that there was no special election to fill a vacancy, a choice by a small percentage of voters would be void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The required notice to the voters in the 14 May 2001 special senatorial election covers two matters.&nbsp; First, that COMELEC will hold a special election to fill a vacant single three-year term Senate seat simultaneously with the regular elections scheduled on the same date.&nbsp; Second, that COMELEC will proclaim as winner the senatorial candidate receiving the 13<sup>th</sup> highest number of votes in the special election.&nbsp; Petitioners have neither claimed nor proved that COMELEC’s failure to give this required notice misled a sufficient number of voters as would change the result of the special senatorial election or led them to believe that there was no such special election.<br><br>Instead, what petitioners did is conclude that since COMELEC failed to give such notice, no special election took place. This bare assertion carries no value.&nbsp; Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as amended, charged those who voted in the elections of 14 May 2001 with the knowledge that the vacancy in the Senate arising from Senator Guingona’s appointment as Vice-President in February 2001 was to be filled in the next succeeding regular election of 14 May 2001. Similarly, the absence of formal notice from COMELEC does not preclude the possibility that the voters had actual notice of the special election, the office to be voted in that election, and the manner by which COMELEC would determine the winner.&nbsp; Such actual notice could come from many sources, such as media reports of the enactment of R.A. No. 6645 and election propaganda during the campaign.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>More than 10 million voters cast their votes in favor of Honasan, the party who stands most prejudiced by the instant petition. We simply cannot disenfranchise those who voted for Honasan, in the absence of proof that COMELEC’s omission prejudiced voters in the exercise of their right of suffrage so as to negate the holding of the special election.&nbsp; Indeed, this Court is loathe to annul elections and will only do so when it is “impossible to distinguish what votes are lawful and what are unlawful, or to arrive at any certain result whatever, or that the great body of the voters have been prevented by violence, intimidation, and threats from exercising their franchise.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Otherwise, the consistent rule has been to respect the electorate’s will and let the results of the election stand, despite irregularities that may have attended the conduct of the elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> This is but to acknowledge the purpose&nbsp; and&nbsp; role&nbsp; of&nbsp; elections in a democratic society such as ours, which is:<br><blockquote>to give the voters a direct participation in the affairs of their government, either in determining who shall be their public officials or in deciding some question of public interest; and for that purpose all of the legal voters should be permitted, unhampered and unmolested, to cast their ballot.<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; </span><i>When that is done and no frauds have been committed, the ballots should be counted and the election should not be declared null.&nbsp; Innocent voters should not be deprived of their participation in the affairs of their government for mere irregularities on the part of the election officers, for which they are in no way responsible.</i>&nbsp; A different rule would make the <i>manner</i> and method of performing a public duty of greater importance than the <i>duty</i> itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><center><b><i>Separate Documentation and Canvassing<br>not Required under Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645,</i></b><br></center><br>Neither is there basis in petitioners’ claim that the manner by which COMELEC conducted the special senatorial election on 14 May 2001 is a nullity because COMELEC failed to document separately the candidates and to canvass separately the votes cast for the special election. No such requirements exist in our election laws.&nbsp; What is mandatory under Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645 is that COMELEC “fix the date of the election,” if necessary, and “state, among others, the office or offices to be voted for.” Similarly, petitioners’ reliance on Section 73 of B.P. Blg. 881 on the filing of certificates of candidacy, and on Section 4(4) of R.A. No. 6646 on the printing of election returns and tally sheets, to support their claim is misplaced. These provisions govern elections in general and in no way require separate documentation of candidates or separate canvass of votes in a jointly held regular and special elections.<br><br>Significantly, the method adopted by COMELEC in conducting the special election on 14 May 2001 merely implemented the procedure specified by the Senate in Resolution No. 84.&nbsp; Initially, the original draft of Resolution No. 84 as introduced by Senator Francisco Tatad (“Senator Tatad”) made no mention of the manner by which the seat vacated by former Senator Guingona would be filled.&nbsp; However, upon the suggestion of Senator Raul Roco (“Senator Roco”), the Senate agreed to amend Resolution No. 84 by providing, as it now appears, that “the senatorial candidate garnering the thirteenth (13<sup>th</sup>) highest number of votes shall serve only for the unexpired term of former Senator Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr.” Senator Roco introduced the amendment to spare COMELEC and the candidates needless expenditures and the voters further inconvenience, thus:<br><blockquote>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; Mr. President, I move that we now consider Proposed Senate Resolution No. 934 [later converted to Resolution No. 84].<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; Is there any objection? <i>[Silence]</i> There being none, the motion is approved.<br><br>Consideration of Proposed Senate Resolution No. 934 is now in order.&nbsp; With the permission of the Body, the Secretary will read only the title and text of the resolution.<br><br>T[HE] S[ECRETARY].&nbsp; Proposed Senate Resolution No. 934 entitled<br><blockquote>RESOLUTION CERTIFYING TO THE EXISTENCE OF A VACANCY IN THE SENATE AND CALLING ON THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (COMELEC) TO FILL UP SUCH VACANCY THROUGH ELECTION TO BE HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE REGULAR ELECTION ON MAY 14, 2001 AND THE SENATOR THUS ELECTED TO SERVE ONLY FOR THE UNEXPIRED TERM<br></blockquote>WHEREAS, the Honorable Teofisto T.

Mr. President.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; Sen. John H.

[Laughter]<br><br>S[ENATOR] O[SMEÑA] (J).&nbsp; What a way of flattery. [Laughter]<br><br>Mr. President, I think I recall that sometime in 1951 or 1953, there was a special election for a vacant seat in the Senate.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the one who was elected in that special election was then Congressman, later Senator Feli[s]berto Verano.<br><br>In that election, Mr. President, the candidates contested the seat.&nbsp; In other words, the electorate had to cast a vote for a ninth senator – because at that time there were only eight – to elect a member or rather, a candidate to that particular seat.<br><br>Then I remember, Mr. President, that when we ran after the EDSA revolution, twice there were 24 candidates and the first 12 were elected to a six-year term and the next 12 were elected to a three-year term.<br><br>My question therefore is, how is this going to be done in this election?&nbsp; Is the candidate with the 13<sup>th</sup> largest number of votes going to be the one to take a three-year term?&nbsp; Or is there going to be an election for a position of senator for the unexpired term of Sen. Teofisto Guingona?<br><br>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; Mr. President, in this resolution, we are leaving the mechanics to the Commission on Elections.&nbsp; But personally, I would like to suggest that probably, the candidate obtaining the 13<sup>th</sup> largest number of votes be declared as elected to fill up the unexpired term of Senator Guingona.<br><br>S[ENATOR] O[SMEÑA] (J).&nbsp; Is there a law that would allow the Comelec to conduct such an election?&nbsp; Is it not the case that the vacancy is for a specific office?&nbsp; I am really at a loss.&nbsp; I am rising here because I think it is something that we should consider.&nbsp; I do not know if we can… No, this is not a Concurrent Resolution.<br><br>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; May we solicit the legal wisdom of the Senate President.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; May I share this information that under Republic Act No. 6645, what is needed is a resolution of this Chamber calling attention to the need for the holding of a special election to fill up the vacancy created, in this particular case, by the appointment of our colleague, Senator Guingona, as Vice President.<br><br>It can be managed in the Commission on Elections so that a slot for the particular candidate to fill up would be that reserved for Mr. Guingona’s&nbsp; unexpired term.&nbsp; In other words, it can be arranged in such a manner.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>S[ENATOR] R[OCO].&nbsp; Mr. President.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; Sen.

Yes.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT]. – to implement.<br><br>S[ENATOR] R[OCO].&nbsp; Yes. The Comelec will not have the flexibility.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; That is right.<br><br>S[ENATOR] R[OCO].&nbsp; We will already consider the 13<sup>th</sup> placer of the forthcoming elections that will be held simultaneously as a special election under this law as we understand it.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That will be a good compromise, Senator Roco.<br><br>S[ENATOR] R[OCO].&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; So if the sponsor can introduce that later, maybe it will be better, Mr. President.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; What does the sponsor say?<br><br>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; Mr. President, that is a most satisfactory proposal because I do not believe that there will be anyone running specifically –<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; Correct.<br><br>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; – to fill up this position for three years and campaigning nationwide.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; Actually, I think what is going to happen is the 13th candidate will be running with specific groups.<br><br>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; Yes. Whoever gets No. 13.<br><br>T[HE] P[RESIDENT].&nbsp; I think we can specifically define that as the intent of this resolution.<br><br>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD].&nbsp; Subject to style, we accept that amendment and if there will be no other amendment, I move for the adoption of this resolution.<br><br>x x x x<br><center><br>ADOPTION OF S.

Conversely, this Court will not interfere should COMELEC, in subsequent special senatorial elections, choose to revert to the means it followed in the 13 November 1951 and 8 November 1955 elections. That COMELEC adopts means that are novel or even disagreeable is no reason to adjudge it liable for grave abuse of discretion. As we have earlier noted:<br><blockquote>The Commission on Elections is a constitutional body.&nbsp; It is intended to play a distinct and important part in our scheme of government.&nbsp; In the discharge of its functions, it should not be hampered with restrictions that would be fully warranted in the case of a less responsible organization.&nbsp; The Commission may err, so may this Court also.&nbsp; It should be allowed considerable latitude in devising means and methods that will insure the accomplishment of the great objective for which it was created — free, orderly and honest elections.&nbsp; We may not agree fully with its choice of means, but unless these are clearly illegal or constitute gross abuse of discretion, this court should not interfere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>A Word to COMELEC</u></b><br></center><br>The calling of a special election, if necessary, and the giving of notice to the electorate of necessary information regarding a special election, are central to an informed exercise of the right of suffrage.

Honasan. At issue is the right of the people to elect their representatives on the basis and only on the basis of an <b>informed judgment</b>. The issue strikes at the <b>heart</b> of democracy and representative government for without this right, the sovereignty of the people is a mere chimera and the rule of the <b>majority</b> will be no more than <b>mobocracy</b>. To clarify and sharpen the issue, 1 shall first unfurl the facts.<br><br><center><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts</b><br></center><br>The facts are undisputed. In February 2001, a Senate seat for a term expiring on June 30, 2004 was vacated with the appointment of then Senator Teofisto Guingona, Jr. as Vice-President of the Philippines. The Senate adopted Resolution No. 84 certifying “the existence of a vacancy in the Senate and calling the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to fill up such vacancy through election to be held simultaneously with the regular election on May 14, 2001, and the senatorial candidate garnering the thirteenth (13<sup>th</sup>) highest number of votes shall serve only for the unexpired term of former Senator Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr.” In the deliberations of the Senate on the resolution, the body agreed that the procedure it adopted for determining the winner in the special election was for the “guidance” and “implementation” of the COMELEC. The COMELEC had no discretion to alter the procedure.<br><br><b>Nobody</b> filed a certificate of candidacy to fill the position of senator to serve the unexpired three-year term in the special election. &nbsp;<b>All</b> the senatorial candidates filed the certificates of candidacy for the twelve regular Senate seats to be vacated on June 30, 2001 with a six-year term expiring on June 30, 2007. &nbsp;COMELEC distributed nationwide official documents such as the Voter Information Sheet, List of Candidates and Sample Ballot. &nbsp;The <b>List of Candidates did not</b> indicate a separate list of candidates for the special election. &nbsp;The <b>Sample Ballot and the official ballots did not</b> provide two different categories of Senate seats to be voted, namely the twelve regular six-year term seats and the single three-year term seat. &nbsp;Nor did the ballots provide a separate space for the candidate to be voted in the special election and instead provided thirteen spaces for thirteen senatorial seats.<br><br><b>Without</b> any COMELEC resolution or notice on the time, place and manner of conduct of the special election, the special election for senator was held on the scheduled May 14, 2001 regular elections.&nbsp; A <b>single canvass</b> of votes for a single list of senatorial candidates was done.&nbsp; On June 5, 2001, respondent COMELEC promulgated COMELEC Resolution No. NBC01-005, the dispositive portion of which reads, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the powers vested in it under the Constitution, Omnibus Election Code and other election laws, the Commission on Elections sitting <i>En Banc</i> as the National Board of Canvassers hereby proclaims the above-named thirteen (13) candidates as the duly elected Senators of the Philippines in the May 14, 2001 elections. <b>Based on the Certificates of Canvass finally tabulated, the first twelve (12) Senators shall serve for a term of six (6) years and the thirteenth (13<sup>th</sup>) Senator shall serve the unexpired term of three (3) years of Senator Teofisto T.

(<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>On June 21, 2001, petitioners filed with the Court their petition for prohibition to stop respondent COMELEC from proclaiming any senatorial candidate in the May 14, 2001 election as having been elected for the lone senate seat for a three-year term. Copies of the petition were served on respondent COMELEC twice, first on June 20, 2001 by registered mail, and second on June 21, 2001, by personal delivery of petitioner Mojica. &nbsp;On June 26, 2001 the Court issued a Resolution requiring respondent COMELEC to comment within ten days from notice. Even before filing its comment, respondent COMELEC issued Resolution No. NBC-01-006 on July 20, 2001, the dispositive portion of which reads, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the powers vested in it under the Constitution, Omnibus Election Code and other election laws, the Commission on Elections sitting as the National Board of Canvassers hereby DECLARES official and final the above ranking of the proclaimed 13 Senators of the Philippines in relation to NBC Resolution No. 01-005 promulgated June 5, 2001.<br></blockquote>Resolution No. NBC-01-006 indicates the following ranking of the 13 Senators with the corresponding votes they garnered as of June 20, 2001:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td scope="col" width="25%">1.

Said special election was held simultaneously with the regular election of 1951. <b>A separate space in the official ballot was provided for Senatorial candidates for the two year term; moreover, the candidates for the single Senate term for two years filed certificates of candidacy separate and distinct from those certificates of candidacy filed by the group of Senatorial candidates for the <u>six year</u> term.</b><br><br><b>(...the votes for the twenty (20) candidates who filed certificates of candidacy for the eight Senate seats with six year terms were tallied and canvassed separately from the votes for the five candidates who filed certificates of candidacy for the single Senate seat with a two year term...)</b><br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>(b) Again, a vacancy was created in the Senate by the election of then Senator Carlos P.

On the merits, they all defend the validity of the special election on the ground that the COMELEC had discretion to determine the manner by which the special election should be conducted and that the electorate was aware of the method the COMELEC had adopted. Moreover, they dismiss the deviations from the election laws with respect to the filing of certificates of candidacy for the special elections and the failure to provide in the official ballot a space for the special election vote separate from the twelve spaces for the regular senatorial election votes as inconsequential. They claim that these laws are merely directory after the election.<br><br><center><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Issues</b><br></center><br>The issues for resolution are procedural and substantive. I shall limit my humble opinion to the substantive issue of whether a special election for the single Senate seat with a three-year term was validly held simultaneous with the general elections on May 14, 2001.<br><center><br><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Laws on the Calling of Special Elections</b><br></center><br>Section 9, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution provides for the filling of a vacancy in the Senate and House of Representatives, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Sec. 9. In case of vacancy in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, a special election may be called to fill such vacancy in the manner prescribed by law, but the Senator or Member of the House of Representatives thus elected shall serve only for the unexpired term.<br></blockquote>Congress passed R.A. No. 6645, “An Act Prescribing the Manner of Filling a Vacancy in the Congress of the Philippines,” to implement this constitutional provision. The law provides, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.&nbsp; In case a vacancy arises in the Senate at least eighteen (18) months or in the House of Representatives at least one (1) year before the next regular election for Members of Congress, the Commission on Elections, upon receipt of a resolution of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, certifying to the existence of such vacancy and calling for a special election, shall hold a special election to fill such vacancy. &nbsp;If the Congress is in recess, an official communication on the existence of the vacancy and call for a special election by the President of the Senate or by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case may be, shall be sufficient for such purpose. &nbsp;The Senator or Member of the House of Representatives thus elected shall serve only for the unexpired term.<br><br>SECTION 2.&nbsp; The Commission on Elections shall fix the date of the special election, which shall not be earlier than forty-five (45) days nor later than ninety (90) days from the date of such resolution or communication, stating among other things, the office or offices to be voted for: <i>Provided, however</i>, That if within the said period a general election is scheduled to be held, the special election shall be held simultaneously with such general election.<br><br>SECTION 3.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span><b>The Commission on Elections shall send copies of the resolution, in number sufficient for due distribution and publication, to the Provincial or City Treasurer of each province or city concerned, who in turn shall publish it in their respective localities by posting at least three copies thereof in as many conspicuous places in each of their election precincts, and a copy in each of the polling places and public markets, and in the municipal buildings.</b> (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>R.A. No. 6645 was amended in 1991 by R.A.

In this case of first impression, however, the distance between existing jurisprudence and the resolution of the issue presented to the Court cannot be negotiated through a straight and direct line of reasoning. Rather, it is necessary to journey through a meandering path and unearth the root principles of democracy, republicanism, elections, suffrage, and freedom of information and discourse in an open society. As a first step in this indispensable journey, we should traverse the democratic and republican landscape to appreciate the importance of <b>informed judgment</b> in elections.<br><br><center><b>A.&nbsp; Evolution of Democracy from Plato to Locke<br><br>to Jefferson and Contemporary United States of America</b><br></center><br><b>In the ancient days</b>, democracy was dismissed by thoughtful thinkers.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span><b>Plato</b> deprecated democracy as rule by the masses. He warned that if all the people were allowed to rule, those of low quality would dominate the state by mere numerical superiority. He feared that the more numerous masses would govern with meanness and bring about a “tyranny of the majority.” Plato predicted that democracies would be short-lived as the mob would inevitably surrender its power to a single tyrant, and put an end to popular government. Less jaundiced than Plato was <b>Aristotle’s</b> view towards democracy. Aristotle agreed that under certain conditions, the will of the many could be equal to or even wiser than the judgment of the few. When the many governed for the good of all, Aristotle admitted that democracy is a good form of government. But still and all, Aristotle preferred a rule of the upper class as against the rule of the lower class. He believed that the upper class could best govern for they represent people of the greatest refinement and quality.<br><br>In the <b>Middle Ages</b>, Europe plunged when the Roman Empire perished. Europe re-emerged from this catastrophe largely through reliance on the scientific method which ultimately ushered the Industrial Revolution. Material success became the engine which drove the people to search for solutions to their social, political and economic problems. Using the scythe of science and reason, the thinkers of the time entertained an exaggerated notion of individualism. They bannered the idea that <b>all people were equal;</b> no one had a greater right to rule than another. Dynastical monarchy was taboo. <b>As all were essentially equal, no one enjoyed the moral right to govern another without the consent of the governed.</b> &nbsp;The people therefore were the source of legitimate legal and political authority.&nbsp; This theory of <b>popular sovereignty</b> revived an interest in democracy in the seventeenth century.&nbsp; The refinements of the grant of power by the people to the government led to the <b>social contract theory:</b> that is, <b>the social contract is the act of people exercising their sovereignty and creating a government to which they consent</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Among the great political philosophers who spurred the evolution of democratic thought was <b>John Locke</b> (1632-1704). &nbsp;In 1688, the English revolted against the “Catholic tyranny” of James II, causing him to flee to France. &nbsp;This <b>Glorious Revolution</b>, called such because it was almost bloodless, put to rest the long struggle between King and Parliament in England. &nbsp;The revolution reshaped the English government and ultimately brought about democracy in England.<br><br>John Locke provided the philosophical phalanx to the <b>Glorious Revolution</b>. &nbsp;For this purpose, he wrote his <b><i>Second Treatise of Government</i></b>, his work with the most political impact. &nbsp;In his monumental treatise, Locke asserted that the basis of political society is a contract whereby individuals consent to be bound by the laws of a common authority known as civil government. &nbsp;The objective of this social contract is the protection of the individual’s natural rights to life, liberty and property which are inviolable and enjoyed by them in the state of nature before the formation of all social and political arrangements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Locke thus argues that legitimate political power amounts to a form of <b>trust</b>, a contract among members of society <b>anchored on their own consent</b>, and seeks to preserve their lives, liberty and property. &nbsp;This <b>trust or social contract</b> makes government legitimate and clearly defines the functions of government as concerned, above all, with the preservation of the rights of the governed.<br><br>Even then, Locke believed that the <b>people should be governed</b> by a parliament elected by citizens <b>who owned property</b>. Although he argued that the people were sovereign, he submitted that they should not rule <b>directly</b>. Members of parliament represent their constituents and should vote as their constituents wanted. The government’s <b>sole reason</b> for being was to serve the individual by protecting his rights and liberties. <b>Although Locke’s ideas were liberal, they fell short of the ideals of democracy.</b> &nbsp;He spoke of a “middle-class revolution” at a time when the British government was controlled by the aristocracy. &nbsp;While he claimed that all people were equally possessed of natural rights, he advocated that <b>political power be devolved only to embrace the middle class</b> by giving Parliament, which was controlled through the House of Commons, the right to limit the monarchical power. &nbsp;<b>He denied political power to the poor;</b> they were bereft of the right to elect members of Parliament.<br><br>Locke influenced <b>Thomas Jefferson</b>, the eminent statesman and philosopher of the (American) revolution and of the first constitutional order which free men were permitted to establish.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> But although Jefferson espoused Locke’s version of the social contract and natural law, he had <b>respect for the common people and participatory government</b>. &nbsp;Jefferson believed that the people, <b>including the ordinary folk</b>, were the only competent guardians of their own liberties, and should thus control their government. &nbsp;Discussing the role of the people in a republic, Jefferson wrote to Madison from France in 1787 that “they are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The wave of liberalism from Europe notwithstanding, a much more conservative, <b>less democratic</b>, and more paternalistic system of government was originally adopted in the United States. &nbsp;The nation’s founders created a government in which power was much more centralized than it had been under the Articles of Confederation and they <b>severely restricted popular control over the government</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Many of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 adhered to <b>Alexander Hamilton’s</b> view that democracy was little more than legitimized mob rule, a constant threat to personal security, liberty and property. &nbsp;Thus, the framers sought to establish a constitutional republic, in which public policy would be made by elected representatives but individual rights were protected from the tyranny of transient majorities. With its several elitist elements and many limitations on majority rule, the framers’ Constitution had undemocratic strands.<br><br><b>The next two centuries, however, saw the further democratization of the federal Constitution.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The Bill of Rights was added to the American Constitution and since its passage, America had gone through a series of liberalizing eras that slowly relaxed the restraints imposed on the people by the new political order.

At the onset of Jacksonion democracy in the 1830s, property requirements quickly diminished and virtually became a thing of the past by the time of the Civil War. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment theoretically extended the franchise to African-Americans, although it took another century of struggle for the Amendment to become a reality.

Madam President, I think as a lawyer, the Commissioner knows that one of the manifestations of republicanism is the existence of the Bill of Rights and periodic elections, which already indicates that we are a democratic state. Therefore, the addition of “democratic” is what we call “pardonable redundancy” the purpose being to emphasize that our country is republican and democratic at the same time. . . In the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, “democratic” does not appear. I hope the Commissioner has no objection to that word.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. No, I would not die for that.

The constitutional framers of the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions were content with “republican.” Was this done merely lor the sake of emphasis?<br><br>MR. NOLLEDO. Madam President, that question has been asked several times, but being the proponent of this amendment, I would like the Commissioner to know that “democratic” was added because of the <b>need to emphasize people power</b> and the many provisions in the Constitution that we have approved related to recall, people’s organizations, initiative and the like, which recognize the participation of the people in policy-making in certain circumstances.”<br><br>MR.

So, why do we not retain the old formulation under the 1973 and 1935 Constitutions which used the words “republican state” because “republican state” would refer to a democratic state where people choose their representatives?<br><br>MR.

But even in the concept “republican state,” we are stressing the participation of the people. . . So the word “republican” will suffice to cover popular representation.<br><br>MR. AZCUNA. Yes, the Commissioner is right. However, the committee felt that in view of the introduction of the aspects of direct democracy such as initiative, referendum or recall, it was necessary to emphasize the democratic portion of republicanism, of representative democracy as well.

The 1987 Constitution not only enlarged the democratic space with provisions on the electorate’s direct exercise of sovereignty, but also highlighted the <b>right of the people to information on matters of public interest as a predicate to good governance and a working democracy</b>. The Bill of Rights sanctifies the right of the people to information under Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Constitution, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. The <b>right of the people to information</b> on matters of public concern shall be recognized.

(<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>This provision on the right to information sans the phrase “as well as to government research data” made its maiden appearance in the Bill of Rights of the 1973 Constitution. The original draft of the provision presented to the 1971 Constitutional Convention merely said that access to official records and the right to information “shall be afforded the citizens as may be provided by law.” Delegate De la Serna pointed out, however, that the provision did not grant a self-executory right to citizens.

In this particular case, <b>corresponding to this right of the people is precisely the duty of the State to make available whatever information there may be needed that is of public concern</b>. Section 6 is very broadly stated so that it covers anything that is of public concern.

Therefore, it is <b>the right of the citizen to demand information</b>. While under the Declaration of Principles, <b>the State must have a policy, even without being demanded, by the citizens, without being sued by the citizen, to disclose information and transactions</b>.

The next biennial election was held on September 11, 1944. In the June 1944 primary election (prior to the death of Hobbs) where nominations of candidates for the upcoming biennial elections were made, there was no nomination for the office of County Treasurer as Hobbes’ term was yet to expire on January 1947. Neither was a special primary election ordered by proclamation of the Governor after Hobbes’ death. Nor were other legal modes of nominating candidates such as through nomination of a political party, convention of delegates or appropriate caucus resorted to. &nbsp;Consequently, in the official ballot of the September 11, 1944 election, there was no provision made for the selection of a County Treasurer to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term. The name of the office did not appear on the ballot. Petitioner Duquette, however, claims that he was elected County Treasurer in the special election because in the City of Biddeford, the largest city in York County, 1,309 voters either wrote in the title of the office and his name thereunder, or used a “sticker” of the same import and voted for him. At the September 11, 1944 biennial election, there were approximately 22,000 ballots cast, but none included the name of the petitioner except for the 1,309 in Biddeford. In holding that the special election was void, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court made the following pronouncements, the first paragraph of which was cited by the ponencia in the case at bar, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Although there is not unanimity of judicial opinion as to the requirement of official notice, if the vacancy is to be filled at the time of a general election, yet <b>it appears to be almost universally held that if the great body of the electors are misled by the want of such notice and are instead led to believe that no such election is in fact to be held, an attempted choice by a small percentage of the voters is void</b>.

It is for this obvious reason that minors and the insane are not allowed to vote. &nbsp;Likewise, the literacy test for the right to vote was abolished because as explained by the Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms of the 1971 Constitutional Convention, “the requirement to read and write was written into our constitution at a time when the only medium of information was the printed word and even the public meetings were not as large and successful because of the absence of amplifying equipment. It is a fact that today the vast majority of the population learn about national matters much more from the audio-visual media, namely, radio and television, and public meetings have become much more effective since the advent of amplifying equipment.” Again, the necessity of information relevant to an election is highlighted. Similarly, in the 1986 Constitutional Commission, Commissioner Bernas, in justifying enfranchisement of the illiterates, spoke of their access to information relevant to elections, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>If we look at...the communication situation in the Philippines now, the means of communication that has the farthest reach is AM radio. People get their information not from reading newspapers but from AM radio - farmers while plowing, and vendors while selling things listen to the radio. Without knowing how to read and write, they are adequately informed about many things happening in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br></blockquote>Several election cases, albeit not involving an issue similar to the case at bar, affirm the <b>necessity of an informed electorate in holding free, intelligent and clean elections. In Blo Umpar Adiong v.

In such a case, the prohibition would not only deprive the owner who consents to such posting of the decals and stickers the use of his property but more important, in the process, it would deprive the citizen of his right to free speech and information:<br><blockquote><b>Freedom to distribute information to every citizen wherever he desires to receive it is so clearly vital to the preservation of a free society</b> that, putting aside reasonable police and health regulations of time and manner of distribution, it must be fully preserved.

Such supervision or regulation shall aim to ensure equal opportunity, time, and space and the right to reply, including reasonable, equal rates therefor, for public information campaigns and forums among candidates in connection with the objective of holding free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections. Section 6 provides that, “(a) free and open party system shall be allowed to evolve according to the free choice of the people”. Section 2(5) of the same article requires political parties, organizations and coalitions to present their platform or program of government before these can be registered. In the robust and wide open debate of the electorate, these programs of government are important matters for discussion.<br><br>The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission on whether voting of Congressmen should be by district or province also evince a clear concern for intelligent voting, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>SR. TAN. Mr. Presiding Officer, I think one of the drawbacks of our political system, especially in the campaign, is that many of us vote by personality rather than by issue. So I am inclined to believe that in the elections by district, that would be lessened because we get to know the persons running more intimately. So we know their motivation, their excesses, their weaknesses and there would be less chance for the people to vote by personality. I was wondering whether the Commission shares the same observation.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE. Mr. Presiding Officer, if it would be by province, the vote would no longer be personalities but more on issues, because the relationship is not really very personal. Whereas, if it would be by district, the vote on personality would be most impressive and dominant.<br><br>SR. TAN. I cannot quite believe that. It would be like a superstar running around.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE. For instance, we have a district consisting of two municipalities. The vote would be more on personalities. It is a question of attachment; you are the godson or the sponsor of a baptism, like that. But if you will be voted by province, it’s your merit that will be counted by all others outside your own area. In short, the more capable you are, the more chance you have of winning provincewide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Several provisions of our election laws also manifest a clear intent to facilitate the voters’ acquisition of information pertaining to elections to the end that their vote would truly reflect their will.</b> Section 52(j) of Article VII of B.P.

COMELEC, et al.,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> we ruled that constituents could not be charged with notice of a second special elections held only two days after the failure of the special election. This case involved the May 8, 1995 regular local elections in Madalum, Lanao del Sur. Due to the threats of violence and terrorism in the area, there was a failure of election in six out of twenty-four precincts in Madalum. A special elections was set on May 27, 1995 but the Board of Election Inspectors failed to report for duty due to the threats of violence. The Monitoring Supervising Team of the COMELEC reset the special elections to May 29, 1995 in a school 15 kilometers away from the designated polling places. In ruling that the May 29 special elections was invalid, the Court ruled, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>We cannot agree with the COMELEC that petitioner, his followers or the constituents must be charged with notice of the special elections to be held because of the failure of the two (2) previous elections. To require the voters to come to the polls on such short notice was highly impracticable. In a place marred by violence, it was necessary for the voters to be given sufficient time to be notified of the changes and prepare themselves for the eventuality.<br><br><b>It is essential to the validity of the election that the voters have notice in some form, either actual or constructive of the time, place and purpose thereof.</b> (Furste v. Gray, 240 Ky 604, 42 SW 2d 889; State ex. rel. Stipp v. Colliver (MO) 243 SW 2d 344.) The time for holding it must be authoritatively designated in advance. The requirement of notice even becomes stricter in cases of special elections where it was called by some authority after the happening of a condition precedent, or at least there must be a substantial compliance therewith so that it may fairly and reasonably be said that the purpose of the statute has been carried into effect. (State ex. rel. Stipp v. Colliver, <i>supra</i>). <b>The sufficiency of notice is determined on whether the voters generally have knowledge of the time, place and purpose of the elections so as to give them full opportunity to attend the polls and express their will or on the other hand, whether the omission resulted in depriving a sufficient number of the qualified electors of the opportunity of exercising their franchise so as to change the result of the election.</b> (Housing Authority of County of Kings v.

Application of the Principles of Democracy, Republicanism<br><br>Freedom of Information and Discourse to the Case at Bar</b><br></center><br>The 1987 Constitution, with its declaration that the Philippines is not only a republican but also a democratic state, and its various provisions broadening the space for direct democracy unmistakably show the framers’ intent to give the Filipino people a greater say in government. The heart of democracy lies in the majoritarian rule but the majoritarian rule is not a mere game of dominant numbers. The majority can rule and rule effectively only if its judgment is an informed one. With an informed electorate, a healthy collision of ideas is assured that will generate sparks to fan the flames of democracy. <b>Rule by the ignorant majority is a sham democracy - a mobocracy -for in the words of Jefferson, a nation cannot be both free and ignorant.</b> If there is anything that democracy cannot survive, it is the virus of ignorance.<br><br>Elections serve as a crevice in the democratic field where voters, for themselves and the public good, plant the seeds of their ideals and freedoms. <b>Yick Wo</b> is emphatic that voting is a fundamental right that preserves and cultivates all other rights. <b>In a republic undergirded by a social contract, the threshold consent of equal people to form a government that will rule them is renewed in every election where people exercise their fundamental right to vote to the end that their chosen representatives will protect their natural rights to life, liberty and property. It is this sacred contract which makes legitimate the government’s exercise of its powers and the chosen representatives’ performance of their duties and functions.</b> The electoral exercise should be nothing less than a pure moment of informed judgment where the electorate speaks its mind on the issues of the day and choose the men and women of the hour who are seeking their mandate.<br><br><b>The importance of information and discourse cannot be overemphasized in a democratic and republican setting.</b> Our constitutional provisions and cases highlighting the people’s right to information and the duty of the State to provide information unmistakably recognize the indispensable need of properly informing the citizenry so they can genuinely participate in and contribute to a functioning democracy. As elections lie at the foundation of representative democracy, there should be no quarrel over the proposition that electoral information should also be disseminated to the electorate as a predicate to an informed judgment.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> concedes that a survey of COMELEC’s resolutions relating to the conduct of the May 14, 2001 elections would reveal that they “contain nothing which would amount to a compliance, either strict or substantial, with the requirements in Section 2 of R.A. No. 6645, as amended.” Nowhere in its resolutions or even its press releases did COMELEC state that it would hold a special election for a single Senate seat with a three-year term simultaneously with the regular elections on May 14, 2001. Nor did COMELEC give official notice of the manner by which the special election would be conducted, <i>i.e.</i>, that the senatorial candidate receiving the 13<sup>th</sup> highest number of votes in the election would be declared winner in the special election. Still, the <i>ponencia</i> upheld the holding of the May 14, 2001 special election despite “the lack of ‘call’ for such election and ... lack of notice as to the office to be filled and the manner by which the winner in the special election is to be determined.”<br><br><b>With all due respect, I cannot subscribe to the <i>ponencia’s</i> position for it leaves the purity of elections and the ascertainment of the will of the electorate to chance, conjecture and speculation.</b> Considering that elections lie at the heart of the democratic process because it is through the act of voting that consent to government is secured, I choose to take a position that would ensure, to the greatest extent possible, an electorate that is informed, a vote that is not devalued by ignorance and an election where the consent of the governed is clear and unequivocal.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> justifies its position on the lack of call or notice of the time and place of the special election by holding that the law charges voters with knowledge of R.A. No. 7166 which provides that in case of a vacancy in the Senate, the special election to fill such vacancy shall be held simultaneously with the next succeeding election, that is, the May 14, 2001 election. The <i>ponencia’s</i> argument is that the provisions of R.A. No. 7166 stating that the special election would be held simultaneously with the regular election operated as a call for the election so that the absence of a call by the COMELEC did not taint the validity of the special election. With due respect, this is not the intention of R.A. No. 7166 for despite its paragraph 1, Section 7 that “in case of such vacancy in the Senate, the special election shall be held simultaneously with the succeeding regular election”, the law nevertheless required in paragraph 3 of the same section that <b>“(t)he Commission shall send sufficient copies of its resolution for the holding of the election to its provincial election supervisors and election registrars for dissemination, who shall post copies thereof in at least three conspicuous places preferably where public meetings are held in each city or municipality affected.”</b><br><br>The <b>Duquette case</b> cited by the <i>ponencia</i> does not lend support to its thesis that statutory notice suffices. In <b>Duquette</b>, it was held that <b>in the absence of an official notice of the special election mandated by law to be held simultaneously with the general election, there should be actual notice of the electorate</b>. Actual notice may be proved by the voting of a significant percentage of the electorate for the position in the special election or by other acts which manifest awareness of the holding of a special election such as nomination of candidates. <b>In the case at bar, however, the number of votes cast for the special election cannot be determined as the ballot did not indicate separately the votes for the special election.</b> In fact, whether or not the electorate had notice of the special election, a candidate would just the same fall as the 13<sup>th</sup> placer because more than twelve candidates ran for the regular senatorial elections. Nobody was nominated to vie specifically for the senatorial seat in the special election nor was there a certificate of candidacy filed for that position. In the absence of official notice of the time, place and manner of conduct of the special election, actual notice is a matter of proof. Respondents and the ponencia cannot point to any proof of actual notice.<br><br>With respect to the lack of notice of the <b>manner</b> by which the special election would be conducted, <i>i.e.</i>, that the 13<sup>th</sup> placer would be declared winner in the special election, there can be no debate that statutory notice will not operate as notice to the electorate as there is <b>no law</b> providing that a special election held simultaneously with a general election could be conducted in the manner adopted by the Senate and the COMELEC. Instead, the <i>ponencia</i> buttresses its holding by stating that the petitioner has not claimed nor proved that the failure of notice misled a sufficient number of voters as would change the result of the special senatorial election. It relies on “actual notice from many sources, such as media reports of the enactment of R.A. No. 6645 and election propaganda during the campaign” but without even identifying these media reports and election propaganda. Suffice to state that before the <i>ponencia</i> can require proof that a sufficient number of voters was misled during the May 14, 2001 elections, it must first be shown that in the absence of official notice of the procedure for the special election, there was nevertheless actual notice of the electorate so that the special election could be presumed to be valid. Only then will the duty arise to show proof that a sufficient number of voters was misled to rebut the presumption of validity.<br><br>I respectfully submit that the electorate should have been informed of the time, place and manner of conduct of the May 14, 2001 special election for the single senatorial seat for the unexpired term of former Senator Teofisto Guingona, Jr. <b>Tolentino, UNIDO, Blo Umpar Adiong</b> and <b>Hassan</b> all deepened the doctrine that a meaningful exercise of the right of suffrage in a genuinely free, orderly and honest election is predicated upon an electorate informed on the issues of the day, the programs of government laid out before them, the candidates running in the election and the time, place and manner of conduct of the election. It is for this reason that the Omnibus Election Code is studded with processes, procedures and requirements that ensure voter information.<br><br><b>Bince</b> and <b>Benito</b> further teach us that free and intelligent vote is not enough; <b>correct ascertainment of the will of the people is equally necessary</b>. The procedure adopted in the case at bar for holding the May 14, 2001 special senatorial election utterly <b>failed to ascertain the people’s choice in the special election</b>. Section 2 of R.A. No. 7166 provides that the “special election shall be held <b>simultaneously</b> with such general election.” <b>It does not contemplate, however, the integration of the special senatorial election into the regular senatorial election whereby candidates who filed certificates of candidacy for the regular elections also automatically stand as candidates in the special election.</b> The Omnibus Election Code is crystal clear that a candidate can run for only one position in an election. Consequently, there were no candidates in the special election to vote for. Separate sets of candidates for the special election and the regular elections are decisive of the election results. Each independent-minded voter could have a variety of reasons for choosing a candidate to serve for only the unexpired term of three years instead of the regular term of six years or not choosing a candidate at all. A voter might choose a neophyte to serve the three-year term as a shorter trial period. Another might be minded to choose an old timer to compel him to hasten the completion of his projects in a shorter period of three years. Still another might want to afford a second termer who has not performed too satisfactorily a second chance to prove himself but not for too long a period of six years. <b>In not allowing the voter to separately indicate the candidate he voted for the three-year senatorial term, the voter was deprived of his right to make an informed judgment based on his own reasons and valuations.</b> Consequently, his true will in the special election was not ascertained. As a particle of sovereignty, it is the thinking voter who must determine who should win in the special election and not the unthinking machine that will mechanically ascertain the 13<sup>th</sup> placer in the general election by mathematical computations.<br><br>The <b>models</b> to follow in the conduct of special elections mandated by law to be held simultaneously with a general elections are the special elections of November 13, 1951 and November 8, 1955 to fill the seats vacated by then Senators Fernando Lopez and Carlos P. Garcia, respectively. In these special senatorial elections, election activities <b>prior</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, filing of certificate of candidacies), <b>during</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, the act of voting for a special election candidate distinct from the candidates for the regular election) and <b>after</b> the election (<i>i.e.</i>, tallying and canvassing of results) were conducted simultaneously with, but <b>distinctly</b> from the regular senatorial elections. This procedure minimized voter confusion and allowed the voter to freely and accurately speak his mind and have his will truly ascertained. Regrettably, this objective appears to have been lost in the calling of the May 14, 2001 special election as can be gleaned from the Senate deliberations on the resolution calling for that election, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>S[ENATOR] T[ATAD]. Mr. President, in this resolution, we are leaving the mechanics to the Commission on Elections.

We cannot bargain the electorate’s fundamental right to vote intelligently with the coin of convenience. Even with the Senate stance, the regular ballot had to be modified to include a thirteenth space in the list of senatorial seats to be voted for. At any rate, reliance on R.A. No. 6645 is erroneous. This law provides that when a vacancy arises in the Senate, the <b>Senate, by resolution, certifies to the existence of the vacancy and calls for a special election</b>. Upon receipt of the resolution, the <b>COMELEC holds</b> the special election. R.A. No. 6645 was amended in 1991 by R.A. No. 7166. The latter law provides that when a permanent vacancy occurs in the Senate at least one year before the expiration of the term, “the <b>Commission (on Elections) shall call and hold</b> a special election to fill the vacancy...” Since under R.A. No. 7166, it is the power and duty of the COMELEC, and not the Senate, to <b>call and hold</b> the election, the Senate cannot, by mere resolution, impose upon the COMELEC the procedure for the special election that it intended such that “Comelec will not have the flexibility” to deviate therefrom. As a constitutional body created to ensure “free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections”, it was the duty of the COMELEC to give to the electorate notice of the time, place and manner of conduct of the special elections and to adopt only those mechanisms and procedures that would ascertain the true will of the people.<br><br>In sum, I submit that the ruling of the <i>ponencia</i> would result not just to a step back in an age of information, but would constitute a fall in the nation’s rise to democracy begun as early as the Malolos Constitution and begun anew in the 1987 Constitution after the 1986 People Power Revolution. Informing the electorate on the issues and conduct of an election is a prerequisite to a “free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections.” <b>Free elections does not only mean that the voter is not physically restrained from going to the polling booth, but also that the voter is unrestrained by the bondage of ignorance. We should be resolute in affirming the right of the electorate to proper information. The Court should not forfeit its role as gatekeeper of our democratic government run by an informed majority. Let us not open the door to ignorance.</b><br><br>I vote to grant the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 93-96; Amended Petition, pp. 8-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, pp. 100-101; Amended Petition, pp. 15-16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Baradat, L.

It is often said that the American economy has been shifting from one based on industrial development to one based on the creation and dissemination of information. (Sunstein, C., “Informational Regulation and Informational Standing: Akins and Beyond,” 147 University of Pennsylvania Law Review [January 1999], 613, citing David Osborne &amp; Ted Gaebler. Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Transforming the Public Sector 15-16 [1992] [describing the failure of government bureaucracy to adjust to the new “knowledge-based economy”]). In the last forty years, statutes have been designed to ensure disclosure of information and this mandatory disclosure has increasingly become a pervasive and important regulatory tool. Informational regulation such as requiring companies to disclose information about toxic releases, contents of food and drinks and workplace injuries has become one of the most striking developments in the last generation of American law. The government also attempts to control its own agents through compulsory production and disclosure of information such as through the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Freedom of Information Act and the Federal Election Campaign Act which enhance public monitoring of government decisions, with special attention being given to particular issues such as insufficient environmental concern, unlawful behavior during campaigns, and official corruption.
