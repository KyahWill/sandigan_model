				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In her Memorandum dated September 2, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Atty. Eden T. Candelaria, Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer of this Court, recommended the imposition of administrative penalties upon the twelve (12) above-named employees of this Court who committed habitual tardiness during the first semester of 2004.&nbsp; Her recommendation is pursuant to Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 22, 1991 and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated August 31, 1999.<br><br>On July 23, 2004, the Leave Division submitted to Atty. Candelaria a list of employees who incurred habitual tardiness for the first semester of the year 2004.&nbsp; Atty.

EVA III</b>, Information Officer V, PIO. –&nbsp; He was tardy 12 times in March and 10 times in April.&nbsp;&nbsp; He explained that his tardiness was due to the nature of his job.&nbsp;&nbsp; He usually worked beyond office hours and consequently, late for work the following morning.<br><br></li><li><b>MA.

Candelaria reported that Ma. Fe Santiago, Resurreccion Ilagan and Efren Ascrate were previously sanctioned for having committed habitual tardiness in 1999, 2000 and 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Thus, Atty. Candelaria, in her Memorandum, recommended that Ma. Fe Santiago, Resurreccion Ilagan and Efren Ascrate be suspended for five (5) days without pay, this being their second incursion of habitual tardiness.&nbsp; She further recommended that the following employees be reprimanded for their first offense of habitual tardiness:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Ms. Maria Liza Almojuela;<br><br></li><li>Ms. Marita Flora Ayllon;<br><br></li><li>Mr. Jose Emmanuel David Eva III;<br><br></li><li>Mr. Reynaldo Iglesias;<br><br></li><li>Ms. Aurora Quintos;<br><br></li><li>Mr. Ariel Vicedo;<br><br></li><li>Mr. Antonio Acuña;<br><br></li><li>Mr. Armando Guarin; and<br><br></li><li>Mr. Romeo C. Fabia.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Significantly, on November 04, 2004, in A.M. No. 2004-19-SC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Efren Ascrate was found guilty of dishonesty for falsifying his daily time record, and was dismissed from the service with forfeiture of all benefits and privileges except accrued leave credits, if any, with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations and financial institutions.<br><br>CSC Memorandum Circular No. 04, Series of 1991, as amended, provides that “An officer or employee of the civil service shall be considered habitually tardy if he incurs tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes, ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or at least two (2) consecutive months during the year.&nbsp; x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>There is no question that the above-named employees incurred habitual tardiness.&nbsp; Such infraction cannot be countenanced for it seriously impairs efficiency and hampers public service.&nbsp; By being habitually tardy, they have fallen short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the civil service, specially the administration of justice.&nbsp; By reason of the nature and functions of their office, the officials and employees of the Judiciary must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional cannon that public office is a public trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Inherent in this mandate are the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Verily, to inspire public respect for the justice system, the court officials and employees are at all times behooved to strictly observe official time.&nbsp; As punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are impermissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>As correctly found by Atty. Candelaria, none of the reasons relied upon by respondents to justify their habitual tardiness merits our consideration.&nbsp; We have ruled that family obligations, performance of household chores, traffic problems, health conditions, domestic and financial concerns are not sufficient reasons to excuse habitual tardiness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Under Sec. 52 (C) (4), Rule VI of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> habitual tardiness is penalized as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>First offense</td><td>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reprimand</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Second offense</td><td>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspension for 1-30 days</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Third offense</td><td>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dismissal from the service</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Atty. Candelaria’s findings and recommendation herein are well taken except in the case of Efren Ascrate.&nbsp; The penalty of suspension, as recommended, can no longer be imposed upon him considering that he was dismissed from the service on November 04, 2004 per A.M. No. 2004-19-SC.&nbsp; Thus, he can only be meted the penalty of fine equivalent to his three (3) months salary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we find the following employees of this Court administratively liable for habitual tardiness and impose upon them the corresponding penalties:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Efren Ascrate, who was dismissed from the service on November 04, 2004 per A.M.
