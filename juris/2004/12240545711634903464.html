				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is the appeal of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 160, in Criminal Case No. 107788-H, finding the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, qualified by treachery, sentencing all of them to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and ordering them to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the deceased Ruben A. Velecina in the amount of P50,000; and to pay the said heirs P20,000 as moral damages; and, P10,000 as exemplary damages.<br><br>On March 3, 1994, accused Nelson Cariño, “Boy Pansit,” appellants Domingo Banhaon, Luis Corcolon, Rogelio “Boy” Corcolon and Lito Calong-Calong were charged with murder in the Regional Trial Court of Calamba, Laguna, originally docketed as Criminal Case No. 3953-94-C. On March 2, 1998, the Court resolved to transfer the case to the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City. The case was re-docketed and raffled to Branch 160 thereof. The accusatory portion of the information reads as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about July 30, 1989 at Barangay Bayog, Los Baños, Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other and with treachery, abuse of superior strength and with the aid of armed men, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to kill, attack, assault and employ violence upon the person of Ruben Velecina by then and there shooting him with powerful firearms thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal injuries in the different parts of his body which directly caused his death to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Except for Nelson Cariño and “Boy Pansit” who remained at large, the rest of the accused were arrested. When arraigned, the accused, assisted by counsel, entered their respective plea of not guilty.<br><br><center><b>The Case for the Prosecution</b></center><br>Leopoldo Cariño and his brother, Nelson Cariño, Luis Corcolon, Rogelio (Boy) Corcolon, Lito Calong-Calong, Domingo Banhaon, “Boy Pansit” and Norberto Ongjuatco were bodyguards of Mayor Antonio Sanchez of Calauan, Laguna. Leopoldo was gunned down by an unknown assailant, and Mayor Sanchez suspected that the following persons were involved in the killing: Ruben Velecina; his mother, Atanacia Velecina; his brother who was a tricycle driver, Valentin Velecina; Bernardo Velecina; and Recto Aniceto, all residents of Los Baños, Laguna.<br><br>Nelson Cariño was reported to have killed Bernardo Velecina, while Recto Aniceto was reportedly shot by the group of Lito Calong-Calong. Norberto Ongjuatco, one of the bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez, secretly warned Valentin to be careful. When apprised of the impending peril to their lives, Valentin, Ruben and their mother, Atanacia, were afraid that they would be killed next on orders of Mayor Sanchez.<br><br>Isidro Velecina and Dory Perez were to be wed on July 30, 1989. A pre-nuptial party was set in    the evening of July 29, 1989, to be held in the yard of the Perez residence at Barangay Bayog, Los Baños, Laguna. Roger Perez, Dory’s father, invited his friends, and among them was Edwin Botero, a former soldier in the Philippine Army and a security guard employed at the Philippine Long Distance Company. Ruben Velecina, Isidro’s father, also invited guests of his own. Ruben’s brother, Valentin, arrived at the house with his family at about 7:00p.m. His wife, Ofelia, his mother, Atanacia, and his son Rowel were with him. Valentin, Edwin and other guests had a drinking spree in front of the house where the other guests were dancing and singing. The house was made of bamboo and wood.<br><br>Between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., July 30, 1989, Edwin noticed a white Ford Fiera with plate number 777 stop in front of the alley leading to Roger’s house, about twenty (20) meters from where he and his friends were drinking Tanduay. The Fiera was followed by a tricycle and a galvanized owner-type jeep driven by “Boy Pansit.” Edwin saw that Mayor Sanchez was inside the Fiera, along with two others who were seated at the backseat; beside “Boy Pansit” was Lito Corcolon. The latter alighted from the jeepney, approached Edwin and asked him if Ruben and Roger, the fathers of the persons to be wed, were inside the house. Edwin replied in the affirmative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thereafter, Lito Corcolon returned to the Ford Fiera and whispered something to Mayor Sanchez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The Ford Fiera then drove away.<br><br>Lito Corcolon, Rogelio Corcolon, Nelson Cariño, “Boy Pansit,” Lito Calong-Calong and Domingo Banhaon then alighted from the jeepney and entered the alley leading to the Perez residence. They posted themselves near the kitchen. When Valentin Velecina saw Mayor Sanchez’ men arrive, he posted himself in a dark place near the chicken coop, about seven (7) meters from the western side of the house. Valentin could see the kitchen from where he was. He could also see the bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez, all of whom were armed with short handguns.<br><br>Momentarily, Carlos Medel, Valentin’s cousin arrived near the chicken coop to urinate. When he saw Carlos, Valentin pulled his leg and told him to go to the kitchen to tell his brother, Ruben, and his mother, Atanacia, that the bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez were in the vicinity. Carlos obliged and left. Meanwhile, Ruben went to the comfort room which was near the kitchen sink and was covered by bamboo slits. As he emerged from the comfort room, Nelson Cariño, Lito Calong-Calong, Rogelio and Lito Corcolon aimed their guns at the kitchen and fired successively. “Boy Pansit” and Domingo Banhaon pulled out their guns and acted as lookouts.<br><br>People hurriedly scampered away when they heard the gunfire. There were shouts of: <i>“May patay, may patay!”</i> Momentarily, Nelson Cariño told his companions: <i>“Tayo na, yari na iyan.”</i> The six bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez then left the scene and boarded the jeepney. Edwin and Valentin heard two more gunshots coming from the direction of the jeep, after which the vehicle sped away.<br><br>Meanwhile, Valentin remained behind the chicken coop until he felt that it was safe for him to come out. Momentarily, he heard his brother, Ruben, cry out, <i>“Ate Uping, may tama ako.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Valentin rushed to the kitchen and saw Ruben lying on the floor, mortally wounded.<br><br>Isidro Velecina and Roger Perez reported the incident to the police. Policemen, including Wilfredo Palacpac and Oscar Ampao, rushed to the scene,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and saw the cadaver of Ruben lying on the ground, face down. The policemen recovered five empty shells fired from a .45 caliber gun, as well as slugs which were embedded on the cement walls of the house. In the course of the policemen’s on-the-spot investigation, no one ventured to identify the perpetrators. The shooting incident was recorded in the police blotter.<br><br>Dr. Ruben B. Escueta, the Rural Health Physician of Calauan, Laguna, conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of Ruben Velecina and submitted a report of his findings, viz:<br><blockquote>NECROPSY FINDING<br>General Survey<br>Well develop (sic), well nourish (sic), male, white complexion measuring 165 cms. and weighing about 130 lbs.

Valentin heeded his mother’s advice and hid in San Pablo City. He sought the help of the Ombudsman and the Criminal Investigation Service (CIS) of the Philippine National Police, but was    told to seek the help of the New People’s Army in Quezon. He reported the shooting to NBI Director Antonio Carpio, who referred him to the police authorities in Batangas. When he went to the police authorities in Batangas and revealed the identity of his brother’s assassins, he was told: <i>“Bumangga ka pala sa pader, magpahinog ka.”</i><br><br>Nonetheless, on March 15, 1991, Valentin sought the help of the President of the Philippines and gave a sworn statement to Norberto Galang at the Kalayaan Hall, Malacañang, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Edwin Botero was, however, afraid to reveal the identities of the culprits to the police authorities and that he witnessed the killing.<br><br>On August 13, 1993, Mayor Antonio Sanchez was arrested for rape with homicide. His bodyguards, the Corcolon Brothers Luis and Rogelio, had earlier surrendered to the Criminal Investigation Service for the same crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Barely three (3) days after Mayor Sanchez’ arrest, Edwin Botero gave his sworn statement to the Anti-Organized Crime Division of the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He applied for and was granted protection under the Witness Protection Program of the Department of Justice.<br><br><center><b>The Case for the Appellants</b></center><br>Appellant Rogelio “Boy” Corcolon denied the charge against him and offered alibi as his defense. While admitting that he knew Mayor Antonio Sanchez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> he denied that he had ever been in the latter’s employ. He claimed that he worked as a company guard of San Miguel Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He related that at or about 1:00 a.m. of July 30, 1989, he was in his residence at Barangay Mabacan, Calauan, Laguna, approximately thirty minutes away from Barangay Bayog.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He stated that he knew accused Cariño as “Bodoy,” but denied being with the latter on July 30, 1989. He, likewise, disclaimed knowing appellant Calong-Calong and explained that he only met him in the courtroom. He denied knowing Edwin Botero, saying that he met the latter only at the NBI. He also stated that he did not know much about Ruben Velecina and “Boy Pansit.”<br><br>For his part, Luis Corcolon claimed that at the time the incident occurred, he was a resident of Barangay Masaya. He denied knowing the victim, Ruben Velecina, but admitted that he used to see Valentin Velecina in the cockpit. He had heard of the name Nelson Cariño, but denied knowing the appellant Domingo Banhaon. He only got to meet “Boy Pansit” and Lito Calong-Calong in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He, likewise, denied that he was, at any time, in the employ of Mayor Sanchez, and claimed that he knew the latter only because he was the Mayor of Calauan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Domingo Banhaon, on the other hand, claimed that in the afternoon of July 29, 1989, he was in their residence at Barangay San Isidro, Calauan, Laguna, with the newly-eloped couple Alfredo and Lorenza Alcantara.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> As a friend and cousin of Alfredo, appellant Banhaon and his wife helped the Alcantara couple in preparing for their marriage. Appellant Banhaon fetched Barangay Captain Alberto Oroga of Barangay Lanot, and the latter accompanied them and the Alcantara couple to Alfredo’s parents, who were residing in Barangay Talang Uno, Lumban, Laguna where Alfredo’s parents resided. They left Calauan at 6:00 p.m. and reached Lumban at 8:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Banhaons helped the Alcantara couple explain their situation to Alfredo’s parents. The talk ended at around 10:00 p.m., prompting the Banhaons to spend the night at the Alcantara residence. They left Lumban for Calauan at 5:00 a.m. of July 30, 1989. Upon reaching their house, Domingo Banhaon learned of Ruben Velecina’s death. He then attended the victim’s wake, as the latter also happened to live in the same barangay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He admitted that he knew the Velecina family, having worked for them as helper.<br><br>Appellant Banhaon also claimed that Valentin Velecina, the victim’s brother, knew him to have provided photography services to Mayor Sanchez. Valentin approached him, and asked him to testify and implicate the Mayor in the killing of Ruben. Appellant Banhaon also claimed that Valentin threatened to implicate him in the murder of Ruben if he refused. As he did not know anything about the circumstances of Ruben’s death, appellant Banhaon refused to testify against Mayor Sanchez. Hence, Valentin Velecina implicated him in the killing.<br><br>Appellant Banhaon presented Lorenza Alcantara as witness to corroborate his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant Joselito Calong-Calong, for his part, denied any participation in the killing. He claimed that he was never employed by Mayor Sanchez, but that he worked as a truck helper at the Pepsi Bottling Company from 1976 to 1991, and then transferred to the Cosmos Bottling Company in 1992 until he was arrested. He said that he came to know Rogelio and Luis Corcolon only during the arraignment of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He also claimed that on July 29, 1989, he arrived from work at 7:00 p.m. and    stayed at home with his wife and children. He went to church the next day. On his way home, as he passed by the house of Dominador Banhaon, he learned of the death of Ruben Velecina, who lived only about “twelve (12) Meralco posts away” from him. He countered that Valentin Velecina approached him to testify in the killing of Ruben. When he refused, Valentin got mad and threatened him, <i>“Para kang hindi kanayon, kapag ako’y nainis sa ‘yo, isasama kita.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On September 30, 1996, the trial court promulgated its decision finding the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder. The dispositive portion of the decision    reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the Court finds accused LUIS CORCOLON, ROGELIO “BOY” CORCOLON, LITO CALONG-CALONG, and DOMINGO BANHAON, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by treachery and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances present in the commission of the crime, hereby sentences, said accused to suffer a penalty of reclusion perpetua, and the accused jointly and severally to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P50,000.00, to pay moral damages of P20,000.00, exemplary damages of P10,000.00 and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>The trial court declared that the prosecution was able to prove and establish the crime charged and that the appellants were guilty thereof. It found Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina’s positive identification of the victim’s assailants credible and entitled to full probative weight, as against the denial and alibi of the appellants. It held that the initial reluctance of the aforesaid witnesses to testify against the appellants did not militate nor diminish their credibility, especially considering the perilous situation they were in. Further, Valentin Velecina had no reason to implicate his barriomates, appellants Banhaon and Calong-Calong.<br><br>The court found that the appellants conspired with one another in killing the victim, and that they committed the crime with treachery and abuse of superior strength.<br><br><center><b>The Present Appeal</b></center><br>The appellants now come to this Court to appeal the trial court’s decision.<br><br>The appellant Calong-Calong assails the decision of the trial court contending as follows:<br><blockquote>THAT THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS IN LAW AND/OR MISAPPREHENSION OF FACTS WHEN IT FOUND THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT JOSELITO CALONG-CALONG GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF REASONABLE DOUBT AND/OR INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE AS AGAINST HIM THE ALLEGED PRESENCE OF CONSPIRACY NOT HAVING BEEN DULY PROVEN BY THE PROSECUTION’S EVIDENCE … <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>Appellant Calong-Calong asserts that the trial court committed serious errors in law when it found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, considering that the evidence presented against him was insufficient, especially as witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina failed to identify him. He stressed that witness Valentin Velecina was ill-motivated in implicating him in the murder charge. He furthered that only one kind of weapon caused the wounds that led to the death of Ruben Velecina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The appellants, Corcolon Brothers, for their part, contend that:<br><blockquote>THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT IN PASIG CITY (BRANCH 160) HAS ERRED IN NOT ABSOLVING AND FREEING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS LUIS CORCOLON AND ROGELIO CORCOLON OF THE SERIOUS CRIME OF MURDER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF REASONABLE DOUBT IN THEIR FAVOR.</blockquote>They point out that the RTC erred in finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, when the prosecution was not able to prove that they were involved in the aforesaid crime.<br><br>The appellant Banhaon, on the other hand, argues that he should be acquitted of the crime charged:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT DOMINGO BANHAON GUILTY OF MURDER DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE THAT WOULD WARRANT A CONVICTION BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>Appellant Banhaon contends that the trial court erred in not considering his defense. He emphasized that his innocence is buttressed by his voluntary surrender and the decision to remain in jail despite an opportunity to escape during a jail break.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the OSG avers that the prosecution established the crime with clear and convincing evidence through the testimony of witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina. The OSG contends that, in light of the prosecution witnesses’ testimonies, the denial and alibi of the appellants cannot prevail. The prosecution, likewise, proved that the appellants, in conspiring with one another and with the use of treachery and abuse of superior strength, willfully and unlawfully, killed Ruben Velecina.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></center><br>The threshold issue is whether or not the trial court erred in giving credence and probative weight to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses while disbelieving those of the appellants.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that the findings of a trial court on the credibility of witnesses deserve great weight, as the trial judge has a clear advantage over the appellate magistrate in appreciating testimonial evidence. The trial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witness as he had the unique opportunity to observe the witness firsthand and note his demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination. Absent any showing that the trial court’s calibration of credibility was flawed, we are bound by its assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Only the trial judge can observe the furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath – all of which are useful aid for an accurate determination of a witness’ honesty and sincerity. The trial court’s findings are accorded finality, unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight which the lower court may have overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated, and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We have reviewed the records and we find no justification to deviate from the findings of the trial court. The denial of the appellants of the crime charged cannot prevail over the positive declarations of prosecution witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina. The defense of alibi is inherently weak and crumbles in the light of positive declarations of truthful witnesses, who testified on affirmative matters that the appellants were at the scene of the incident and were among the victim’s assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Positive identification where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter prevails over a denial which, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence is negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In this case, Valentin Velecina testified that at a distance of seven (7) meters or so, and while he was hiding in a nearby chicken coop, he saw the accused Nelson Cariño, appellants Luis Corcolon, Rogelio Corcolon and Lito Calong-Calong fire their guns towards the kitchen sink, as Ruben Velecina emerged from the comfort room, while Domingo Banhaon and “Boy Pansit” acted as lookouts. When Luis Corcolon and his cohorts stopped firing, he heard his brother say, “Ate Uping, may tama ako.”  Immediately after the assailants left, he entered the house and saw his brother’s body slumped on the ground, soaked in his own blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The testimony of Velecina is quoted, viz:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q:</td><td width="90%">While you were at the back of the house of Dory Perez, what transpired next?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">At about 10:30 in the evening when I noticed that several persons arrived coming from the back portion of the house and not infront of the house.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>You are referring to what date, Mr. Witness?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY.

The requisites of this aggravating circumstance are: (1) that armed men or persons took part in the commission of the crime, directly or indirectly, and (2) that the accused availed himself of their aid or relied upon them when the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In this case, while the appellants were all armed, all of them acted in conspiracy with one another. All of the appellants acted in concert to ensure the commission of the crime. Hence, the aggravating circumstance cannot be appreciated. Even if it were so, the same could not be appreciated separately as it is deemed to have been absorbed by treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Appellant Domingo Banhaon insists that his voluntary surrender and his refusal to escape during the jail break gives proof to his innocence. In order for voluntary surrender to be appreciated, the following requisites should be present: (1) the offender has not been actually arrested; (2) the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority or the latter’s agent; and, (3) the surrender was voluntary. Further, the surrender must be spontaneous in such a manner that it shows the interest of the accused to surrender unconditionally to the authorities, either because he acknowledged his guilt or because he wishes to save them the trouble and expenses necessarily incurred in search and capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, appellant Banhaon remained at large even after Judge Francisco Ma. Guerrero issued the warrant for his arrest on March 17, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Appellant Banhaon surrendered only on June 27, 1995, after an alias warrant of arrest had already been issued against him, and approximately six years after the commission of the crime. Clearly, voluntary surrender cannot be appreciated in his favor as a mitigating circumstance. Neither can it be used to show his innocence. Appellant Banhaon’s failure to escape is not indicative of his innocence.<br><br>The records reveal that the crime was committed during nighttime. This circumstance is considered aggravating only when it facilitated the commission of the crime, or was especially sought or taken advantage of by the accused for the purpose of impunity. The essence of this aggravating circumstance is the <i>obscuridad</i> afforded by, and not merely the chronological onset of, nighttime. Although the offense was committed at night, nocturnity does not become a modifying factor when the place is adequately lighted and, thus, could no longer insure the offender’s immunity from identification or capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In the case at bar, it was not shown that nighttime was especially sought for or used to insure the offender’s immunity from identification or capture.<br><br>We note that the Information alleges that the appellants used firearms to kill the victim. Under Republic Act No. 8294, the use of unlicensed firearm is an aggravating circumstance if such firearm is used to commit homicide or murder. However, such circumstance cannot be appreciated against the appellants because of the following: (a) the law took effect after the commission of the crime and a retroactive application thereof would be unfavorable to the appellants; and, (b) there is no allegation in the Information, nor was it proved by the prosecution that the appellants had no license or permit to possess the firearms. The lack of license or permit of the appellants to possess the firearms is a negative averment which is an essential element of the aggravating circumstance and must be alleged in the Information.<br><br>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 7659, murder is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. However, when the crime was committed in 1989, murder was punishable by reclusion temporal maximum to death. Where no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime, the medium period of the imposable penalty, which is reclusion perpetua, should be imposed by the trial court. In this case, no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime. Hence, the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua on the appellants.<br><br>Conformably with recent jurisprudence, we sustain the amount of P50,000 for civil indemnity to the heirs of the deceased without need of any further proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Exemplary damages of P25,000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> must, likewise, be awarded, in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code because of the attendance of the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, the award of moral damages should be deleted in the absence of any sufficient evidence to support the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The heirs of the victim are, however, entitled to temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 160, finding the appellants Luis Corcolon, Rogelio “Boy” Corcolon, Lito Calong-Calong and Domingo Banhaon guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS</b>.
