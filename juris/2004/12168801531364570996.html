				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 22, 2001, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) received the verified <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of Margie Corpus-Macias (Mrs. Macias) dated May 11, 2001, accusing Judge Wilfredo G. Ochotorena, then Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 11, Sindangan, Zamboanga Del Norte, of bias, partiality and violation of judicial conduct in connection with his disposition of Civil Case No. S-695 for declaration of nullity of marriage, entitled “<span style="font-style: italic;">Mariano Joaquin S. Macias v. Margie Corpus-Macias</span>.”<br><br>The antecedents follow.<br><br>On February 6, 2001, a verified <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> for declaration of nullity of marriage was filed against Mrs. Macias by Mariano Joaquin S. Macias (“Mr. Macias”), her husband and incumbent presiding judge of RTC, Branch 11, Liloy, Zamboanga Del Norte.&nbsp; The case was raffled to the respondent’s court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> On the same day the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> was filed, the respondent immediately issued <span style="font-style: italic;">Summons</span> to Mrs. Macias.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> However, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Summons</span> was not served on Mrs. Macias for the reason that her whereabouts were allegedly unknown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Consequently, Mr. Macias filed a motion to serve summons by publication. &nbsp;The respondent granted the motion in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated March 7, 2001, with the directive that Mrs. Macias should file her answer within 30 days after notice.&nbsp; Thereafter, Mr. Macias caused the publication of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Summons</span> in the local weekly newspaper, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Tingog Peninsula</span>,” based in Dipolog City in its March 11-17, 2001 issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Mrs. Macias claims she learned of the aforesaid publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Summons</span> during the first week of April 2001. &nbsp;Without delay, on April 10, 2001 or within the 30-day period to file an answer, she filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span>, which she set for hearing on April 20, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, instead of first acting upon the motion, the respondent judge set the hearing on the merits of the subject case on April 19, 2001, or one day before.<br><br>On April 19, 2001, respondent judge denied the Motion to Dismiss and re-set the hearing on the merits to April 30, May 2 and 3, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After the scheduled hearings, the respondent judge terminated the proceedings and declared the case submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the interim, from April 10, 2001 up to April 30, 2001, various motions and manifestations, one after the other but interrelated, were filed by the counsel of Mrs. Macias opposing the hearing on the merits of the case before the respondent judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> One was denied while the rest were ignored. As previously stated, the respondent proceeded with the hearing on April 30, 2001 without resolving the other motions and manifestations.<br><br>It is in the light of the foregoing that Mrs. Macias believes that the respondent judge deprived her of the fundamental right to due process with utmost bias and partiality for Mr. Macias; hence, she filed the instant <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> containing the above-cited facts before the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Also in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> is her prayer that an order be issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> directing the respondent judge to desist from taking any further action in the subject case and imposing an administrative sanction against him.<br><br>Without waiting for the OCA’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Indorsement</span>, the respondent judge submitted his <span style="font-style: italic;">Comment/Answer</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> on May 25, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The respondent judge claims that the instant <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> is fatally defective because it is not supported by the affidavits of persons who have knowledge of the facts and documents needed to substantiate the allegations therein. &nbsp;Also, he asserts that malice, bad faith, and the intention to harass, embarrass and humiliate him had motivated Mrs. Macias to file the said <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span>.<br><br>The respondent judge disputes violating Mrs. Macias’ right to due process. &nbsp;He argues that Mrs. Macias was given the opportunity to be heard but chose not to give her side, as shown by her failure to appear during the trial despite prior notice. &nbsp;Furthermore, he points out that the records of the case would show that the proceedings was done in good faith and based on law and jurisprudence.<br><br>Furthermore, the respondent judge posits that even if he may have committed an error, such should be corrected by availing of judicial remedies and not by resorting to the filing of an administrative action.&nbsp; He argues that it is only after the Supreme Court finds that a judge had committed malice or gross ignorance that he should be administratively sanctioned. Moreover, respondent claims that a <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated May 11, 2001, containing similar allegations as the instant complaint, was filed before the Court of Appeals, a copy of which he received on May 21, 2001.<br><br>Finally, respondent judge insists that his <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> is valid and prays for the dismissal of the instant <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> for lack of merit.<br><br>In her <span style="font-style: italic;">Reply</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which she filed on July 19, 2001, Mrs. Macias admits having filed a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 64733 entitled “<span style="font-style: italic;">Margie Corpus Macias v. Judge Wilfredo G. Ochotorena</span>” on May 18, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In addition, Mrs. Macias claims that the Court of Appeals decided the Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> and Prohibition with Application for Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction in her favor on July 13, 2001, finding respondent judge blatantly transgressing her right to due process and ignorant of the basic rudiments of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; She notes that the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> nullified the assailed proceedings and the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> rendered by the respondent judge on May 15, 2001 in Civil Case No. S-695.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> And finally, Mrs. Macias stresses that the instant charge against respondent judge may simply be verified by checking the records of the case.<br><br>On June 4, 2001, the respondent judge retired from the service.&nbsp; However, pursuant to the Resolution of the Court in A.M. No. 10597-Ret. dated 22 October 2001, the Court retained the amount of Forty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>40,000.00) from his retirement benefits, to answer for whatever administrative sanction the Court may impose in relation to the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In summary, Mrs. Macias now asserts before the Court that the respondent judge’s actuations constitute bias, partiality and conduct unbecoming a judge. Moreover, according to her, what is more glaring and conclusive from the records is that the respondent is grossly ignorant of the law and procedure.&nbsp; For these administrative lapses, Mrs. Macias concludes that the Court should sanction him.<br><br>The conclusion is amply supported by the Court of Appeals’ Decision which states that the respondent judge totally disregarded Mrs. Macias’ right to due process when he proceeded with the trial on the merits of the case completely ignoring the fact that her Motion to Dismiss, which was filed within the 30-day reglementary period, was still pending resolution.<br><br>The respondent judge disregarded the provisions of Section 1, Rule 18 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure, which states that: “After the last pleading has been served and filed, it shall be the duty of the plaintiff to promptly move ex-parte that the case be set for pre-trial.” Considering that the last pleading was Mrs. Macias’ Motion to Dismiss, the respondent judge should have first resolved the motion and then waited for Mr. Macias’ motion to set the case for pre-trial.<br><br>What happened in the case is a classic example of “<span style="font-style: italic;">railroading</span>” or “<span style="font-style: italic;">procedural short-cut</span>.” Instead of resolving the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span>, the respondent judge completely ignored it and proceeded with the trial on the merits of the case by receiving Mr. Macias’ evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span>.<br><br>The respondent judge compounded his blunder when, after denying Mrs. Macias’ <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span>, he continued with the reception of Mr. Macias’ evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span>, ordered the termination of the trial and thereafter, considered the case submitted for decision despite Mrs. Macias’ filing of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span> of the order denying her <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span>. In holding the trial of the case up to its completion, the respondent judge had acted utterly oblivious to the pending <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>.<br><br>It is also worth mentioning that, as correctly found by the appellate court, even if Mrs. Macias failed to file her answer to the complaint after the period therefor had elapsed, the respondent judge was not authorized to conduct a hearing of the case on its merits. &nbsp;The Rules of Court prohibits default proceedings in cases involving declaration of nullity of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In that regard, Mrs. Macias had already filed her <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span> where she indicated her address and, hence, can be notified by the Public Prosecutor of his investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Section 3, Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure states: “If the defending party in an action for annulment or declaration of nullity of marriage or for legal separation fails to answer, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to investigate whether or not a collusion between the parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in order to see to it that the evidence submitted is not fabricated.” Thus, the report of the Public Prosecutor is a condition <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span> for further proceedings to go on in the case. Respondent judge ignored this procedural rule.<br><br>While the record shows that Public Prosecutor Arturo M. Paculanag had filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Certification</span> dated May 04, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> with the respondent judge’s court, stating, among others, that he appeared in behalf of the Solicitor General during the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> presentation of plaintiff’s evidence, even cross-examining the plaintiff and his witness, the psychiatrist Dr. Cheryl T. Zalsos, and that he had no objection to the granting of the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, such <span style="font-style: italic;">Certification</span> does not suffice to comply with the mandatory requirement that the court should order the investigating public prosecutor whether a collusion exists between the parties.&nbsp; Such directive must be made by the court before trial could proceed, not after the trial on the merits of the case had already been had.&nbsp; Notably, said <span style="font-style: italic;">Certification</span> was filed after the respondent judge had ordered the termination of the case.<br><br>Considering the foregoing, the Court rules that the respondent judge violated Mrs. Macias’ right to due process when he completely ignored the pertinent rules. &nbsp;A judge is called upon to exhibit more than just a modicum of acquaintance with statutes and procedural rules, it is his duty to keep always abreast with law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> When the law or procedure is so elementary, for him not to know it or to act as if he does not know it constitutes gross ignorance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Under Section 3 in relation to Section 10 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, gross ignorance of the law is considered a serious offense, for which a penalty of either dismissal from the service with forfeiture of benefits, suspension from office for more than three (3) months but not exceeding six (6) months or a fine of more than Twenty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>20,000.00) but not exceeding Forty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>40,000.00) may be imposed.<br><br>Respondent compulsorily retired from the service on June 04, 2001, thus, dismissal or suspension from the service is no longer possible.&nbsp; Nonetheless, a penalty of fine may still be imposed upon him considering that under the Resolution of the First Division in A.M. No. 10597-Ret. dated October 22, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court retained the amount of Forty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>40,000.00) from his retirement benefits to answer for whatever administrative sanction the Court may impose upon him with regard to this case. Considering that this is the first time the respondent judge will be meted a penalty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court finds a fine of Twenty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>20,000.00) appropriate.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, Judge Wilfredo G. Ochotorena is found GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law and incompetence and is hereby FINED the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>20,000.00) to be taken from the amount earlier withheld from his retirement benefits. &nbsp;The Fiscal Management Office of the OCA is DIRECTED to immediately release to the respondent judge the remaining balance of Twenty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>20,000.00) from the aforesaid retained amount, unless there are other valid reasons for its further retention.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo</span>, pp. 47-55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 57-64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 66.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 68.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 67-68.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 73-74.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 77-83.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 108-112.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 280.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The following motions and manifestations were filed by Mrs. Macias: (1) Manifestation and Motion filed on April 18, 2001 by registered mail stating among others, the need to resolve the pending Motion to Dismiss before proceeding with the trial on the merits considering that the Motion to Dismiss was filed within the 30-day period to file an answer/responsive pleading.

She submits to the Court that she has previously instituted an action for legal separation before the same Regional Trial Court where this case is pending, except that, it was raffled only to a different branch.
