The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in deciding this case <b>not in accord with applicable laws,</b> in particular the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL) which precludes CASA, on account of its own negligence, from asserting its forgery claim against BPI, specially taking into account the absence of any negligence on the part of BPI.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></sup><br></blockquote>In GR No. 149507, Petitioner CASA submits the following issues:<br><blockquote>“1.

It is of no moment that no criminal case has yet been filed against Yabut.  The filing thereof is entirely up to the appropriate authorities or to the private individuals upon whom damage has been caused.  As we shall also explain later, it is not mandatory for CASA -- the plaintiff below -- to implead Yabut in the civil case before the lower court.<br><br>Under these two constitutional provisions, “<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[t]</span>he Bill of Rights<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></sup> does not concern itself with the relation between a private individual and another individual.
