CV No. 50306 which affirmed with modification, the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 9, ordering the petitioner Chua Tee Dee to pay the private respondent back rentals plus interest and attorney’s fees.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>J.C. Agricom Development Corporation, Inc. (Agricom, for brevity), a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, is the owner of a rubber plantation located at Bayabas, Toril, Davao City, with an area of 132.4012 hectares, more or less.  Agricom planned to lease the plantation.<br><br>Chua Tee Dee, married to Amado Dee, is a businesswoman doing business under the name and style of Pioneer Enterprises (Pioneer, for brevity).<br><br>Manuel G. Alba, the president of Agricom, had a business meeting in Davao City with Amado Dee where they discussed the possibility of leasing the rubber plantation to Chua Tee Dee/Pioneer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thereafter, a draft contract of lease was made and delivered to Alba on May 22, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The final contract of lease<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was signed and acknowledged before a notary public on July 22, 1985.  The Agricom, represented by Alba, was referred to as the FIRST PARTY under the contract, while Chua Tee Dee doing business under the style of Pioneer was the SECOND PARTY.  Lillian Carriedo, a stockholder of Agricom, also signed the contract.  The pertinent portions of the lease contract were as follows:<br><ol><li>TERM: The lease shall be for a period of fifteen (15) years counted from the date of execution of this contract and may be renewed for another period of five (5) years upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties.<br><br></li><li>That the plantation, together with all the inventoried machineries, equipment and improvements found therein shall upon the execution of this contract be turned over to the SECOND PARTY free from any and all liens and/or encumbrances, provided, however, that the SECOND PARTY shall upon expiration and/or termination of the contract    return all the inventoried machineries, equipment and improvements to the FIRST PARTY.<br><br></li><li>RENTAL: The SECOND PARTY shall pay the FIRST PARTY within the first ten (10) days of the current month the following rentals, to wit:<br><blockquote>P45,000.00 per month for the first three (3) years of the lease<br>P60,000.00 per month for the second three (3) years of the lease<br>P75,000.00 per month for the third four (4) years of the lease<br>P90,000.00 per month for the last five (5) years of the lease<br></blockquote></li><li>NON-PAYMENT OF RENTALS: Delay in the payment of the monthly rental by the SECOND PARTY shall entitle the FIRST PARTY to charge to the former interest of two (2) percent per month as penalty.

In the event [that] this FIRST PARTY receives an offer to buy from a THIRD PARTY, the SECOND PARTY shall be advised thereof in writing and shall have the option to match said    offer within a period of thirty (30) days from receipt of said advice.<br><br>If the SECOND PARTY or his nominees fail to exercise the option granted under this aforementioned paragraph, and there is a sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance of the leased premises to a third party, it shall be a condition thereof that this contract of lease shall be respected and shall continue under the terms and conditions herein stipulated.</li></ol><ol start="13"><li>(<i>sic</i>) VENUE: UPON the expiration of this lease contract or its earlier termination for violation of its terms and conditions, the SECOND PARTY binds himself to peacefully turn over the possession of and surrender the leased premises to the FIRST PARTY is compelled, to resort to the courts to protect its rights under this contract, the parties agree that venue thereof shall be in the courts at Davao City. In such an event, the SECOND PARTY shall be answerable for all damages that the FIRST PARTY may suffer or be entitled to plus attorney’s fees equivalent to twenty-five (25%) percent thereof and costs of suit.</li></ol>On May 27, 1985, Alba met with the employees of the rubber plantation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and updated them on the impending termination of their employment due to the company’s contract of lease with Chua Tee Dee.  The employees were told that they would be given separation pay.<br><br>On June 3, 1985, Amado Dee delivered the amount of two hundred seventy thousand pesos (P270,000.00) to the Spouses Manuel and Suzanne Alba in compliance with paragraph 5 of the lease contract.  The corresponding receipt was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Azarinas P. Liguiz of Agricom sent letters to the said employees, confirming the termination of their employment and informing them that their separation pay shall be computed at one-half (1/2) month’s salary for every year of service rendered, and that a fraction of at least six (6) months service shall be considered as one year.  Thereafter, the corresponding vouchers were prepared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Sometime thereafter, the severed employees filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice against Agricom, Amado Dee and Pioneer, docketed as NLRC Case No. 1815-LR-XI-85.  The labor arbiter rendered his decision on August 22, 1986, holding that the termination of the complainants’ employment was illegal.  The respondents were ordered to pay its employees’ separation pay and backwages, but the complaint for unfair labor practice was dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><blockquote>(1)  Declaring the termination of complainants as illegal, thereby ordering respondents J.C. Agricom Development Company and/or Pioneer Enterprises and Amado Dee to pay all complainants herein, jointly and severally, the following, to wit:<br><br>(a) Separation pay – at one (1) month salary per year of service, from date of hiring to date this Decision becomes final and executory;<br><br>(b) Backwages – from date employment stopped up to the date this Decision becomes final and executory.<br><br>(2)  Dismissing the charge of unfair labor practice for lack of merit.<br></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The respondents appealed the decision.  Amado Dee and Pioneer posted a supersedeas bond of P21,415.58, as well as P142,770.54 covered by Check No. 610489625,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and P142,770.54 covered by Check No. 610489624<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to stave off execution pending appeal.<br><br>Because Pioneer was dragged into labor disputes not of its own making, it wrote Agricom, through its counsel, on October 20, 1987 suggesting a conference to settle the labor case, otherwise, it would consider the contract of lease as rescinded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Aside from the labor case, Pioneer, through Amado Dee, complained of being pestered by some individuals who claimed portions of the plantation as their own property.  Some of them went to its office and even presented tax declarations to prove their claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Pioneer claimed that the foregoing circumstances prevented it from operating fully the agreed area stated in the lease contract.  It also complained that the death of Pioneer’s foreman sometime in 1990 even exacerbated the unresolved labor problem.<br><br>On May 24, 1990, the counsel of the Carriedo heirs, the stockholders-owners of Agricom, sent a telegraphic note to Amado Dee demanding payment of long overdue rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On June 21, 1990, Pioneer sent a letter to Agricom complaining of facts and events which disrupted its operations in the plantation.  In a Letter dated August 2, 1990, Agricom informed Pioneer that, after due investigation, it concluded that the latter’s complaints were unfounded.  It also demanded the payment of back rentals for June, July and August 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As Pioneer was unable to pay its monthly rentals, Agricom filed, on September 4, 1990, a civil complaint for sum of money, damages and attorney’s fees against Chua Tee Dee before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 9.  The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 20,312-90.

She claimed that it was the plaintiff which failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract of lease when it failed to settle the labor dispute with its former employees, thus, dragging the defendant as respondent in NLRC Case No. 1815-LR-XI-85; and that the plaintiff failed to maintain her in the quiet and peaceful possession and enjoyment of the leased premises during the effectivity of the lease contract, in violation of paragraphs 6 and 11 thereof.<br><br>The defendant also claimed that she had paid premiums for the appeal bond in the labor case, and that she deposited with the NLRC the total amount of P306,956.66 to avert execution pending appeal, which was supposed to be the sole responsibility of the plaintiff.<br><br>By way of counterclaim, the defendant asserted that she was exposed to public contempt and ridicule which besmirched her reputation; and that she suffered mental anguish and sleepless nights because of the violation of the contract of lease.  She prayed, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, defendant respectfully prays this Honorable Court, that after considering all the foregoing facts and circumstances, judgment be rendered in favor of defendant and against plaintiff:<br><ol><li>Ordering the termination or rescission of the Contract of Lease;<br><br></li><li>Dismiss the complaint;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the plaintiff to pay defendant:<br><br>a)  P316,956.66 – as actual damages<br>b)  P500,000.00 – as moral damages<br>c)  P200,000.00 – as exemplary damages<br>d)  P100,000.00    – as attorney’s fees<br></li></ol>DEFENDANT FURTHER prays for such other relief and remedies available and legally tenable under the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>On November 8, 1990, the plaintiff filed its Motion to Strike Out Portion of the Pleading,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> particularly paragraph 8 thereof and to dismiss the counterclaim of the defendant with regard to the labor case on the ground that the NLRC had already rendered a decision ordering the dismissal of the complaint of its former    employees.  The plaintiff appended a copy of the decision of the NLRC to its motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On November 9, 1990, defendant Chua Tee Dee filed her Motion to Declare Plaintiff in Default<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for failure to answer her counterclaim.<br><br>During the pre-trial, the parties admitted the following:<br><ol><li>Legal Capacities of the respective party (sic);<br><br></li><li>The Contract of Lease entered into on July 22, 1985 between parties herein over the 132.4102 hectares of rubber plantation located in Bayabas, Toril, Davao City;<br><br></li><li>The Labor Case entitled NLRC Case No. 1815-LR-XI-85, BONIFACIO LANSANG, et al. vs. JC AGRICOM DEV.

Cecilia and Elaine, both surnamed Carriedo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On October 21, 1992, the court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint and declaring the lease contract terminated for failure of the plaintiff to implement the terms thereof.  The court ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>The evidence on record proves that plaintiff failed to effectively complement, implement and enforce the foregoing provision. The inevitable consequence was the impleading and involvement of defendant in a vexatious labor problem instituted by plaintiff’s original farm workers. This violation of paragraph 6 caused the problems that in great measure prejudiced the efficient operations intended by defendant, because of the peace and order situation caused by the malcontents, among others, resulted in the death of defendant’s foreman Elicano Apolonio.<br><blockquote>“11. Leases option to buy, the First Party shall maintain the Second Party in the quiet possession and employment (<i>sic</i>) of the leased premises during the effectivity of the lease. …”<br></blockquote>The evidence establishes that defendant’s possession was anything but peaceful and enjoyable. Within a comparatively short span of time from entry and occupation, defendant suffered from vexatious labor problems caused by plaintiff’s original farm workers who instituted a labor case impleading the defendant. Many of them remained in the area and made trouble to the workers hired by defendant, so terrorizing the latter that they were afraid to go to work for fear of bodily harm. Defendant’s foreman Elicano Apolonio, who reported early for work was shot to death in the premises (Exhibits “11,” “12”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27</sup><br></blockquote>The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is rendered dismissing the complaint and declares the lease contract between the parties terminated and of no force and effect.<br><br>Cost against the plaintiff.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>The plaintiff received its copy of the above decision on March 11, 1993 and filed its motion for reconsideration praying that the defendant be ordered to pay for the unpaid rentals in accordance with the contract of lease until it had actually vacated and surrendered the leased premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The defendant filed her manifestation and compliance, declaring that when she learned about the RTC decision that the lease contract between the parties no longer had force and effect, she pulled out her enterprise and stopped operations in the leased premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> She also filed her opposition to the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 1995, the court issued an Order granting the plaintiff’s motion and modifying its decision.  It ordered the defendant to pay rentals to the plaintiff since the defendant had occupied, used and continually operated the rubber plantation during the time the case was pending; equity demanded that compensation for the use thereof was just and proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The decretal portion reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED and the Decision dated October 21, 1992 is hereby recalled and modified as follows:<br><ol><li>Judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff, J.C.

It contends that the sweeping statements of the petitioner, that the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of its discretion, are baseless and unfounded.  It asserts that the petition is without merit.<br><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>Preliminarily, we note that the remedy resorted to by the petitioner is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, a remedy resorted to where the issues raised involve lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.  For the writ of certiorari under Rule 65 to issue, the petitioner must show not only that the lower court acted with grave abuse of discretion, but also that “there is no appeal, or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The assailed CA decision was a disposition on the merits; hence, the proper remedy of the petitioner was a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

As lessor, the Agricom had the duty to maintain the petitioner in the peaceful and adequate enjoyment of the leased premises.  Such duty was made as part of the contract of lease entered into by the parties.  Even if it had not been so, the lessor is still duty-bound under Art. 1654 of the Civil Code, thus:<br><blockquote>Art. 1654.  The lessor is obliged:<br><br>(1)     To deliver the thing which is the object of the contract in such a condition as to render it fit for the use intended;<br><br>(2)     To make on the same during the lease all the necessary repairs in order to keep it suitable for the use to which it has been devoted, unless there is a stipulation to the contrary:<br><br>(3)     To maintain the lessee in the peaceful and adequate enjoyment of the lease for the entire duration of the contract.<br></blockquote>The duty “to maintain the lessee in the peaceful and adequate enjoyment of the lease for the duration of the contract” mentioned in no. 3 of the article is merely a warranty that the lessee shall not be disturbed in his legal, and not physical, possession.  Thus, in the case of Goldstein v. Roces,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court ruled in favor of the lessor and denied the lessee's claim for damages which resulted from the opening of holes in the roof, as the lessor had allowed another lessee to construct another floor to the leased building.  The Court had the occasion to state:<br><blockquote>Article 1554 provides that the lessor is obliged to maintain the lessee in the peaceful enjoyment of the lease during all the time covered by the contract.<br><br>Nobody has in any manner disputed, objected to, or placed any difficulties in the way of plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment, or his quiet and peaceable possession of the floor he occupies. The lessors, therefore, have not failed to maintain him in the peaceful enjoyment of the floor leased to him and he continues to enjoy this status without the slightest opposition on the part of any one. That there was a disturbance of the peace or order in which he maintained his things in the leased story does not mean he lost the peaceful enjoyment of the thing rented. The peace would likewise have been disturbed or lost had some tenant of the Hotel de Francia, living above the floor leased by plaintiff, continually poured water on the latter's bar and sprinkled his bar-tender and his customers and tarnished his furniture; or had some gay patrons of the hotel gone down into his saloon and broken his crockery or glassware, or stunned him with deafening noises. Numerous examples could be given to show how the lessee might fail peacefully to enjoy the floor leased to him, in all of which cases he would, of course, have a right of action for the recovery of damages from those who disturbed his peace, but he would have no action against the lessor to compel the latter to maintain him in his peaceful enjoyment of the thing rented. The lessor can do nothing, nor is it incumbent upon him to do anything, in the examples or cases mentioned, to restore his lessee's peace. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the petitioner claims that several people presented tax declarations to her and claimed some portions of the leased premises.
