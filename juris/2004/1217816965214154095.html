Appellant lived six to seven meters away from the place where Grace lived.<br><br>“On April 24, 1994, around 11:30 in the morning, Mary Grace was alone in their house.&nbsp; She took a bath in the bathroom located adjacent to their house.&nbsp; She was still wrapped in a towel when she re-entered their abode.&nbsp; To her utter surprise, appellant who seemed drunk appeared inside their home.&nbsp; She asked him what he was doing there.&nbsp; Appellant did not answer instead he forcibly took her hand and pulled her.&nbsp; She screamed.&nbsp; Appellant then brought out a bladed weapon and poked it at her mouth.&nbsp; Without removing the weapon from her mouth, he then took off his shirt and tied it around her mouth and with another shirt tied her hands behind her back.&nbsp; Thereafter, appellant lowered down his shorts.&nbsp; She was able to escape briefly but he chased and boxed her.&nbsp; Grace kept on kicking him but appellant managed to force her to lie on the floor.&nbsp; Soon afterward, appellant laid on top of her and succeeded in having sexual knowledge of her.&nbsp; Grace cried in pain.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellant put on his clothes and left.<br><br>“On January 7, 1996, around one o’clock in the afternoon, Grace was again alone in their house.&nbsp; She had just taken a bath when appellant suddenly entered their home.&nbsp; Grace recalled what happened to her before and began to be afraid.&nbsp; She raised her right hand and pleaded to appellant not to abuse her again.&nbsp; She could not shout because he already poked a bladed instrument on her chest.&nbsp; Before long, appellant pushed her against the concrete wall of their house, which weakened her.&nbsp; He commanded her to lie on the floor.&nbsp; Thereafter, he pulled down his shorts, removed her panties and placed himself on top of her.&nbsp; He inserted his organ inside hers.&nbsp; Afterwards, he left.&nbsp; When Grace looked down, she saw blood on the floor which she supposed came from her.<br><br>“In yet another fateful day on May 16, 1996, around twelve thirty in the afternoon, Grace was on her way home from a barrio fiesta in Barangay Barayong, Sorsogon, Sorsogon.&nbsp; She was walking through an infrequently traversed trail in the woods when she heard a tree branch snap.&nbsp; When she turned around, she saw appellant more or less eight (8) meters behind her.&nbsp; Grace ran uphill while shouting for help but to no avail.&nbsp; Appellant overtook her, grabbed her hands and pulled her hair.&nbsp; They both tumbled downhill but he chased her still and even boxed her on her shoulder.&nbsp; He then pulled out his knife and ordered her to lie on the grass.&nbsp; He covered her mouth, tied her up and undressed her.&nbsp; After undressing himself, appellant ravished the 14-year-old Grace again.<br><br>“In all three x x x occasions of sexual molestations, appellant threatened Grace not to tell anybody of the rape incidents or else he would kill her and her family.&nbsp; She frightfully complied.<br><br>“On August 8, 1996, around eleven o’clock in the evening, Grace, together with her two elder sisters, was sleeping inside their houses.&nbsp; Their mother was away for work.&nbsp; Grace was awakened when appellant covered her mouth with a shirt.&nbsp; He then poked a knife at her as he was undressing her.&nbsp; She tried to kick appellant but instead she hit her sister Rosalie.&nbsp; The latter woke up and when she beamed a flashlight on Grace she saw appellant poking a bladed weapon on Grace who was crying.&nbsp; Appellant immediately left.&nbsp; Grace was reduced to tears.<br><br>“The following day, August 9, 1996, around six o’clock in the evening, the victim’s mother, Remedios Juntalan Estiola, arrived home from work.&nbsp; One of the victim’s sisters, Rosalie, related to her the incident.&nbsp; She then summoned the victim who confirmed the tale.&nbsp; The victim likewise narrated that she was sexually abused since she was twelve.&nbsp; The victim and her mother then proceeded to the barangay captain who advised her to return the following morning and report the matter to the police authorities.<br><br>“The next morning, the victim went to the police station and executed a sworn statement.&nbsp; A criminal complaint was then formally filed.<br><br>“Afterwards, on August 15, 1996, the victim and her mother went to the Municipal Health Officer of Sorsogon, Dr. Liduvina Dorion, who conducted a physical and mental examination on the victim for which she issued two (2) Medical Certificates.&nbsp; The medical findings stated therein, in part, as explained by Dr. Liduvina Dorion on direct examination, were as follows: <blockquote> ‘Pelvic Examination—wide flourchet in [the area of the] developing [vulva] x x x; moderate pubic hair; IE shows healed lacerations at 6:00 and 10:00 o’clock over the vaginal orifice; easily admits one finger; great difficulty with two.&nbsp; Extremities—no significant findings.’ </blockquote> “The examining physician explained that the finding of ‘wide flourchet’ suggests that the penetration happened several times.&nbsp; The membrane covering the vagina or hymen, which is the first part that is lacerated is already absent.&nbsp; The healed lacerations indicate that they are more [than] two (2) weeks old.&nbsp; She concluded that indeed there was penetration.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Citations omitted) </blockquote> <center><u><i><b>Version of the Defense</b></i></u><br></center><br>In his Brief, appellant presents his version of the facts in the following manner: <blockquote> “Accused Toribio Galido testified that during the farming season, he operated a hand tractor and during the harvest season he operated a thresher. December and January are the farming season.&nbsp; Harvest season is on March, April and May.<br><br>“On April 24, 1994 at around 1:00 p.m., he was operating the palay thresher at the place of his godfather.&nbsp; They began working at 7:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.<br><br>“The fiesta of Rocadel is on April 27, not April 24.<br><br>“If you are inside the house of Mary Grace and will shout, it will be heard by the nearest neighbor.&nbsp; There were 3 neighbors’ houses.<br><br>“The motive of the private complainant is that before, they requested him to testify on a case of a certain Junior Jasoro but when he refused, they got angry with him.&nbsp; Junior was convicted of a crime and has already been transferred to the Bilibid Prison. Mary Grace is the complainant in the case against Junior.<br><br>“On January 7, 1996 at around 1:00 p.m., he was at the ricefield operating the tractor owned by Tio Lando del Rosario.&nbsp; The ricefield was about 1 and a half kilometers from the house of Mary Grace.&nbsp; He was with Otoy, his godbrother.<br><br>“He started working at around 5:00 a.m., and finished at 4:00 p.m.&nbsp; He took his lunch in the center of the ricefield.<br><br>“On May 16, 1996 at around 12:30 p.m., he was threshing the palay.&nbsp; This was the barangay fiesta at Barangay Bayoyong.&nbsp; He did not go to the fiesta because they were threshing the palay.<br><br>“They began their work at 7:00 a.m., at the home of Padrino Juanito.&nbsp; They finished at 4:00 p.m.<br><br>“It is not true that his son accompanied Grace because of the fact that they are angry with him for his refusal to testify against accused Junior.<br><br>“He denied that on August 8, 1996 at around 11:00 p.m., he tried to rape Mary Grace.&nbsp; How can he do that when Grace had companions inside the house.&nbsp; He was also sleeping at the time.<br><br>“Edgar Bonos testified that he was a barangay captain.&nbsp; He knows Brgy.

JAMISOLA, adopted child of the undersigned Offended Party, a girl below 18 years of age, against the victim[’s] will.” </blockquote> In <i>People v. Mendez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Information against the accused therein also failed to state that the victim had been raped “through force or intimidation.”&nbsp; The former questioned the defective Information and claimed that he “cannot be validly convicted in an indictment that does not charge an offense.”&nbsp; Ruling squarely on the matter, the Court said: <blockquote> “As correctly pointed out by ROSENDO, the information or complaint for rape should expressly allege the commission of the rape in the manner prescribed in Article 335.&nbsp; Hence, in the case of <i>People v. Oso</i> the allegation in the complaint that the accused had carnal intercourse with the offended woman ‘against her will’ or ‘without her consent’ is insufficient to warrant a conviction for rape, although the evidence proves the commission of the crime.&nbsp; However, in this case, the complaint filed by VIRGINITA expressly alleges that the rape was committed ‘by means of force,’ viz.:<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>“What we have here is a complaint specifically accusing ROSENDO of rape committed ‘by means of force’ and an information that failed to allege this essential element.&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; The failure of the information to state that ROSENDO raped VIRGINITA ‘through force or intimidation’ is not a fatal omission in this case because the complaint alleged the ultimate fact that ROSENDO raped VIRGINITA ‘by means of force.’&nbsp; So, at the outset, ROSENDO could have readily ascertained that he was being accused of rape committed through force, a charge that sufficiently complies with Article 335.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </blockquote> In the present case, appellant was informed at the outset that he was being charged with rape through force and intimidation.&nbsp; All the elements of the crime were sufficiently alleged in the Complaint, copies of which were given to him and attached to the records.&nbsp; The Complaint sufficiently supplied the deficiency of the Information as regards the particulars of the rape charge.<br><br>Furthermore, in <i>People v. Palarca,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court held that the evidence presented during trial cured the failure of the Information to allege specifically that the rape had been committed through force or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the Court said: <blockquote> “While the accusatory portion of the information failed to specifically allege that the rape was committed through force or intimidation, the prosecution was able to establish by evidence that accused-appellant was guilty of rape as defined under Article 266-A, paragraph (1)(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>“In any event, accused-appellant failed to interpose any objection to the presentation by the prosecution of evidence which tended to prove that he committed the rape by force and intimidation.&nbsp; While generally an accused cannot be convicted of an offense that is not clearly charged in the complaint or information, this rule is not without exception.&nbsp; The right to assail the sufficiency of the information or the admission of evidence may be waived by the accused-appellant. x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </blockquote> This ruling was recently reiterated in <i>People v. Torellos.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The Information therein, which had failed to allege that the rape had been committed through force and intimidation, was considered by the Court as merely defective.&nbsp; It ruled that the deficiency was cured by the failure of the accused to object to the sufficiency of the Information and by competent evidence presented during trial.<br><br>In the present case, the sufficiency of the Information’s was never questioned by appellant during trial.&nbsp; Neither did he object to the prosecution’s presentation and offer of evidence of force and intimidation.&nbsp; That evidence, which is now extant in the records, cured the defect of the Informations.&nbsp; Hence, he cannot now assail those Informations or claim a violation of his right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<br><br><center><b><u>Second Issue:</u> <br><i><u>Credibility of Private Complainant</u></i></b><br></center><br>Appellant questions the identical narration by private complainant of the first two alleged occasions of rape.&nbsp; He casts doubt on her credibility, claiming that she gave her testimony in a mechanical and scripted manner.<br><br>We are not persuaded. In assessing the credibility of witnesses, we are guided by the following principles: (1) the reviewing court will not disturb the findings of the lower court, unless there is a showing that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that may affect the result of the case; (2) the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect and even finality, as it had the opportunity to examine their demeanor when they testified on the witness stand; and (3) one who testifies in a clear, positive and convincing manner and remains consistent during cross-examination is a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>After carefully reviewing the evidence on record and applying the foregoing guidelines to this case, we find no cogent reason to overturn the factual findings of the lower court.&nbsp; A careful scrutiny of the records and the transcripts shows that the RTC had ample opportunity to assess the credibility of private complainant.

What is necessary is that the force or intimidation be sufficient to consummate the purpose that the accused had in mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; By itself, the act of holding a knife is strongly suggestive of force or at least of intimidation.&nbsp; In the present case, threatening private complainant with a knife was sufficient to bring her into submission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Her seemingly identical narrations of the first two rapes does not detract from her credibility.&nbsp; Verily, the trial court was correct in its observation that the cross-examination, to which she was subjected, even tended to improve her recollection of the rape incidents.<br><br>Moreover, her testimony is supported by the findings of the medicolegal expert.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Medical Certificates show that the victim had healed lacerations at the five o’clock and the seven o’clock positions of her vaginal orifice.&nbsp; This finding is consistent with penile invasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> A rape victim’s account is sufficient to support a conviction for rape if it is straightforward, candid and corroborated by the medical findings of the examining physician, as in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Time and time again, we have said that a rape victim --especially one of tender age -- would not normally concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and thereafter permit herself to be subjected to a public trial, if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, when a woman -- more so if she is a minor -- says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.&nbsp; And as long as the testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on that basis alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is <i><b>DENIED</b></i> and the RTC Decision <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>.&nbsp;
