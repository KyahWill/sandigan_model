The identical allegations of the three (3) separate Informations read as follows:<blockquote>“That on or about October, 1988 in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the [petitioner], knowing fully well that he had no sufficient funds in the drawee bank, wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously issued and/or made out EBC Check No. __________ postdated ______________ in the amount of P75,000.00 in favor of Paul Gotianse in payment of an obligation;

Sometime in October 1988, in Davao City, [Petitioner] Kenneth Ngo, in settlement of the indebtedness he had incurred with Northern Hill Development Corporation, issued eight postdated checks payable to complainant and all drawn against the Equitable Banking Corporation.&nbsp; The first five checks were honored by the drawee bank but the three postdated checks were dishonored for the reason ‘drawn against insufficient funds.’&nbsp; These checks were the following:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;

18200-89 and 18201-89 indicated that the checks had been issued in favor of Paul Gotianse, yet the prosecutor’s evidence established that the actual obligation for which they had been issued was in favor of Northern Hill Development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On this basis, petitioner alleges that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of the offense, since the checks had not been issued for a valid consideration insofar as Complainant Gotianse was concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Elements of the Offense</span></span><br><br>It is fundamental that every element of the offense must be alleged in the complaint or information and proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.&nbsp; Whatever facts and circumstances must be stated are determined by reference to the definitions and the essentials of the specific crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner was charged with violation of BP 22 under the following provision:<blockquote>“Section 1.&nbsp; Checks without sufficient funds. -- Any person who makes or draws and issues any check to apply on account or for value, knowing at the time of issue that he does not have sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment of such check in full upon its presentment, which check is subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for insufficiency of funds or credit or would have been dishonored for the same reason had not the drawer, without any valid reason, ordered the bank to stop payment, shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than thirty days but not more than one (1) year or by a fine of not less than but not more than double the amount of the check which fine shall in no case exceed Two Hundred Thousand Pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court. x x x”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Under this provision, there are two ways of violating BP 22:&nbsp; 1) by making or drawing and issuing a check to apply “on account or for value,” knowing at the time of issue that the check was not sufficiently funded; and 2) by having sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank at the time of issue, but failing to keep sufficient funds or credit with the said bank to cover the full amount of the check when presented to the drawee bank within a period of ninety (90) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Pertinent to the present case, the elements of the offense under the first situation of BP 22 are the following:<blockquote><ol><li>the making, drawing and issuance of any check to apply on account or for value;</li><br><li>the maker, drawer or issuer knows at the time of issue that he does not have sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment of such check in full upon its presentment; and</li><br><li>the check is subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for insufficiency of funds or credit or would have been dishonored for the same reason had not the drawer, without any valid cause, ordered the bank to stop payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In the instant case, we find no reason to depart from the CA’s findings, which petitioner does not rebut.&nbsp;

font-weight: bold;">Cause for Issuance<br>of Check Is Immaterial</span></span><br><br>We agree with the submission of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) that petitioner’s argument is immaterial and irrelevant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This Court has consistently declared that the cause or reason for the issuance of a check is inconsequential in determining criminal culpability under BP 22.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; We explained the reason in Llamado v. Court of Appeals as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><blockquote>“[T]o determine the reason[s] for which checks are issued, or the terms and conditions for their issuance, will greatly erode the faith the public reposes in the stability and commercial value of checks as currency substitutes, and bring about havoc in trade and in banking communities.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The gravamen of the offense punished by BP 22 is the act of making and issuing a worthless check; that is, a check that is dishonored upon its presentation for payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The mere act of issuing a worthless check is malum prohibitum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Lozano v. Martinez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> has declared that it is not the nonpayment of the obligation that is being punished, but the making of worthless checks.&nbsp; In People v. Nitafan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court has ruled that a check issued as an evidence of debt -- though not intended to be presented for payment -- has the same effect as an ordinary check and would fall within the ambit of BP 22.&nbsp; Que v. People<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> has affirmed the application of BP 22 to cases in which dishonored checks have been issued in the form of deposit or guarantee.&nbsp; Indeed, the law does not make any distinction between checks issued in payment of an obligation and those made merely to guarantee that obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The claim that the prosecution failed to prove that the check had been issued to apply on account or for value in favor of Paul Gotianse<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> is irrelevant.&nbsp; The law does not require that the payee of a check be the same as the obligee of the obligation in consideration for which the check has been issued.&nbsp; Pertinent is a criminal law authority’s explanation of the term to apply on account or for value:<blockquote>“It should be noted that BP Blg. 22 punishes the making or drawing and issuing of any check that is subsequently dishonored, even in payment of pre-existing obligation, as indicated in Section 1 thereof by the phrase ‘to apply on account.’&nbsp; Section 1 also punishes the making or drawing and issuing of a check that is subsequently dishonored, in payment of an obligation contracted at the time of the issuance of the check, as indicated by the words ‘for value.’ x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>When the checks were issued by petitioner to Paul Gotianse as payee, they were issued to apply “on account;” that is, to settle the former’s obligation to the latter’s principal -- Northern Hill Development.&nbsp; In this regard, the Court also notes that the trial court found that petitioner had agreed to settle his debt to the company by issuing the checks payable to its agent, Gotianse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Clearly, the prosecution proved the first element of a violation of BP 22.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Propriety of the Award for<br>Civil Liability and Attorney’s Fees</span></span><br><br>Petitioner further argues that there was no legal basis to hold him civilly liable to Northern Hill Development, because it was not a party to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This allegation is erroneous.<br><br>The challenged Decision required petitioner to indemnify the agent, not the company.&nbsp; Moreover, the liability to pay Gotianse “in behalf of Northern Hill Development” was merely in conformity with the evidence adduced at the trial.&nbsp; It should be noted that Gotianse, the payee of the bounced check,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> is the injured party.&nbsp; One who is neither a payee nor a holder of a bad check has neither the personality to sue nor a cause of action against the drawer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The indemnity in favor of Gotianse was made pursuant to Section 1, Rule 111 of the Rules of Court:<blockquote>“When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability is impliedly instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves his right to institute it separately, or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>Under the present revised Rules, the criminal action for violation of BP 22 shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The reservation to file a separate civil action is no longer needed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also fails to support his opposition to the award of attorney’s fees.&nbsp; The recovery of such fees in the concept of actual or compensatory damages is allowed under the circumstances.&nbsp; Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, attorney’s fees and the expenses of litigation are awarded when the court deems them just and equitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40] </sup>Considering that the trial took almost two years to complete,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and that the agreed attorney’s fees of the private prosecutor engaged to represent complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> is twenty-five percent (25%) of the sum due in each case, the award of P18,000 as attorney’s fees for each of the cases is just and reasonable.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, this Petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals AFFIRMED.&nbsp;
