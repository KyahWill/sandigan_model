				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Kabankalan City, Branch 61, in Civil Case No. 830.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Antecedents</span></div><br>Celso “Nene” Zayco was the owner of a large parcel of agricultural land with an area of 540,248 square meters, located in Kabankalan <span style="font-style: italic;">Poblacion</span>, Negros Occidental, now Kabankalan City. &nbsp;The property was identified as Lot No. 343 and was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 133298, and portions thereof were occupied and cultivated by tenants.&nbsp; Zayco mortgaged the property to the Pacific Banking Corporation as security for a loan; however, the bank foreclosed the mortgage upon Zayco’s failure to pay his account.&nbsp; When the property was sold at public auction by the sheriff, the bank was adjudged as the highest bidder.&nbsp; Zayco failed to redeem the property, and the bank consolidated its title thereon; TCT No. 115264 was issued in its favor on March 20, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On December 21, 1984, the bank sold the property to Julieta C. Salgado, the Chairman of the Board of the respondent, Perpetual Help Development and Realty Corporation (PHDRC).&nbsp; TCT No. 133298 was, thereafter, issued in favor of PHDRC on January 18, 1985. &nbsp;No liens or encumbrances whatsoever or any notice that the property had been placed under the agrarian reform laws were annotated at the dorsal portion thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) granted Emancipation Patents to the twenty (20) tenants on the property from April 28, 1988 to July 1, 1988 on the basis of which titles were issued in their favor during the period of September 16, 1988 to August 24, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan ng</span> Kabankalan approved, on February 14, 1996, Resolution No. 96-39, reclassifying the property partly as property for light industry, and the rest as residential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On August 26, 1997, the respondent filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against the twenty (20) petitioners, who were all occupants-farmers on the property, with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Kabankalan City, docketed as Civil Case No. 034-97.<br><br>The respondent alleged, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia,</span> in its complaint that on May 27, 1997, it obtained a certified xerox copy of TCT No. 133298 from the Register of Deeds and discovered that of the twenty (20) petitioners, seven (7) had been issued Emancipation Patents on July 1, 1988 which were inscribed at the dorsal portion of said title. Nevertheless, according to the respondent, the petitioners were not agricultural tenants under the agrarian reform laws because (a) they entered the property without its consent and did not pay any consideration for the use of the land they occupied; and (b) the property was, as resolved by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan</span> under Resolution No. 96-39 in 1996, partly for light industry and partly residential.<br><br>The respondent prayed that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in its favor, thus:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed of the Honorable Court that, after due notice and hearing, judgment be rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants as follows: <br><blockquote><ol><li>Ordering defendants to vacate the areas they respectively occupy in Lot No. 343 and to return the same to plaintiff;</li><br><li>Ordering defendants to pay to plaintiff <s>P</s>10,000.00 as litigation expenses; <s>P</s>50,000.00 as attorney’s fees, plus <s>P</s>1,000.00 for every court appearance and <s>P</s>20,000.00 as exemplary damages.</li></ol></blockquote>Plaintiff prays for such other reliefs and remedies just and equitable in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Appended to the complaint was a photocopy of TCT No. 133298.<br><br>In their answer with motion to dismiss the complaint, the petitioners, who were represented by DAR lawyer Atty. Quirico Infante, alleged that the landholding had long been placed under Operation Land Transfer, and that they became the owners thereof under Presidential Decree No. 27. They interposed the following special and affirmative defenses: <br><blockquote><ol start="12"><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That the landholding, subject matter of the case more particularly described as Lot No. 343, has been placed within the ambit of the Operation Land Transfer program per P.D. 27 as amended;<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That defendants herein are actual-occupants and tenant-tillers of the land wayback in [the] 1970’s, having been installed thereat by Lorenzo Zayco, the original landowner with the defendants sharing [with] the landowner the produce of the land up to 1981 as evidenced by receipts which will be presented in due time;<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That being bonafide tenant-tillers thereat, they were identified by the Department of Agrarian Reform as qualified farmers-beneficiaries and consequently were issued Emancipation Patents;<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That in 1982-83, the subject landholding was conveyed by way of sale by the former landowner to J. Salgado;<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That despite the sale thereof to the plaintiff herein, defendants continued to cultivate the land and extend payment of lease rentals to the new landowner thereof;<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That in 1988-1989, being beneficiaries of the program, caused to directly pay their amortization to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP);<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; That defendants, having been issued EPs, are therefore considered owners of the land and now deemed full owners of the land they till as provided for under P.D. 27 and E.O. 328 respectively, thus, cannot be ejected/ousted therefrom without circumventing their right to [s]ecurity of tenure as amplified in the case of De Jesus vs. IAC, SCRA 559 <span style="font-style: italic;">(sic)</span> and Dolorfino vs. CA, 191 SCRA 880, Dec. 3, 1990, where the Highest Tribunal ruled that:<blockquote>“Once a leasehold relation has been established, the agricultural lessee is entitled to security of tenure.&nbsp; He has a right to continue working on the land and he may not be ejected therefrom except for cause as provided by law.<br><br>The agricultural relationship is not extinguished by the sale, alienation or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding. The purchaser or transferee is simply subjugated to the rights and substituted to the obligations of the agricultural lessor.”&nbsp; (Sec. 10, R.A. 3844) (Dolorfino vs. Court of Appeals, supra).</blockquote></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That granting that the property in question has already been classified as residential, commercial and industrial zone per Res. No. 96-39, dated February 14, 1996, however, the landowner has failed to present a Conversion Order to be issued by the DAR Secretary, thus, in absence thereof, the subject landholding remains agricultural, in the light of A.O. 12, Series of 1994 the same provides and we quote:<br><br>“II. LEGAL MANDATE <br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) is mandated to “approved (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) or disapproved (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) applications for conversion, restructuring or readjustment of agricultural lands into non-agricultural uses,” pursuant to Section 4(j) of Executive Order No. 129-A, Series of 1987.<br><br></li><li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 5(1) of E.O. No. 129-A, Series of 1987, vests in the DAR, exclusive authority to approve or disapprove applications for conversion of agricultural lands for residential, commercial, industrial and other land uses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></li></ol></blockquote></li></ol></blockquote>The petitioners prayed that the complaint be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.<br><br>The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> applied the Rules of Summary Procedure.&nbsp; Instead of ruling on the motion to dismiss, it ordered the parties to file their position papers.&nbsp; The petitioners appended to their position paper, as Annexes “1” to “36,” photocopies of sample receipts purportedly signed by Celso Zayco and Julieta Salgado, acknowledging receipt of their respective shares in the produce of the landholding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On December 18, 1997, after due proceedings, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered judgment in favor of the respondent.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the decision reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE and upon the foregoing disquisitions, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, to wit: <br><ol><li>- Ordering the named defendants to vacate the portions they had been occupying of Lot No. 343, situated in Sitio Lapui, Barangay Hilamanan, Kabankalan City, and to turn-over the possession thereof to the plaintiff; and<br><br></li><li>- Ordering the DISMISSAL of plaintiff’s claims for litigation expenses, attorney’s fees and exemplary damages.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> ruled that the petitioners failed to prove that they were farmers-beneficiaries on the landholding and that based on Resolution No. 96-39 of the Municipal Council, the said property had already been reclassified as part residential and part industrial/commercial areas.&nbsp; The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> also ruled that thirteen (13) of the petitioners occupied portions of the landholding only by tolerance of the respondent and its predecessors, and failed to pay any amount as consideration for their occupancy of the petitioners’ property.&nbsp; It rejected the petitioners’ contention that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) had exclusive original jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, ruling that the action was one for unlawful detainer over which it had exclusive original jurisdiction.<br><br>Aggrieved, the petitioners filed a notice of appeal dated January 19, 1998 on the ground that grave errors were committed by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> in its findings of facts and conclusions of law in its decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On February 6, 1998, a motion to disapprove the notice of appeal and for execution of final judgment was filed by the respondent on its claim that the required appellate docket and other lawful fees had not been paid to the clerk of court within the reglementary period therefor. The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> issued an Order on March 31, 1998, granting the motion of the respondent and disapproved the notice of appeal filed by the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It also ordered the issuance of a writ of execution on its finding that its decision had become final and executory, following the failure of the petitioners to perfect their appeal to the RTC.&nbsp; On April 2, 1998 and April 21, 1998, writs of execution were issued by the MTCC.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The petitioners did not assail the order of the MTCC</span>.&nbsp; Instead, the petitioners filed on April 23, 1998 a petition with the Regional Trial Court against the respondent for the annulment of the decision of the MTC in Civil Case No. 034-97.<br><br>The petitioners alleged, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that they were agricultural tenants of the late Cesar Zayco as evidenced by the receipts signed by him, where he acknowledged receipt of their rentals over the portions of the landholding tenanted by them, respectively, and the affidavit of Lorenzo Zayco, the son of Cesar Zayco, appended to the petition as Annex “J” thereof. They also alleged, thus: <br><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>That subject landholding has the following farmers- beneficiaries, whose respective farmholdings were identified under [the] Operation Land Transfer (OLT) program of the government pursuant to PD 27 as follows:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>1.&nbsp; Melchor Hilado</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>11.&nbsp; Federico Orlano</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>2.&nbsp; Cesar Aral</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>12.&nbsp; Felix Ortega</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>3.&nbsp; Adela Aral</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>13.&nbsp; Rogelio Semillano</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>4.&nbsp; Arturo Villarena</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>14.&nbsp; Antonio Ballentos</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>5.&nbsp; Salvador Mirano</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>15.&nbsp; Pacifico Talibutab</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>6.&nbsp; Tarcelo Mirano</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>16.

No. 27 and the Emancipation Patents issued to them, they became owners of the property and were entitled to the possession thereof.<br><br>For its part, the respondent asserts that, if at all, the RTC decision is appealable, the proper remedy of the petitioners from the said decision was to appeal, by writ of error, to the Court of Appeals under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, as amended, and not via a petition for review on certiorari to this Court under Rule 45 of the said Rules.&nbsp; It contends that, as gleaned from the petition, the petitioners raised factual issues.&nbsp; It notes that the petitioners assailed the factual findings made by the MTCC that they (the petitioners) are not agricultural tenants of the late Cesar Zayco and Julieta C. Salgado, and that the subject landholding is residential and not agricultural.<br><br>In reply, the petitioners contend that this appeal via Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is proper, considering that they raised purely legal issues in their petition.&nbsp; They note that the RTC itself, per its Order on April 29, 1998, succinctly states that the issue raised by the parties is one of law, namely, whether the MTCC had jurisdiction over the action of the respondent against the petitioners. They point out that the RTC required the parties to merely file their respective memoranda, instead of adducing evidence in their favor.<br><br>We agree with the respondent that the remedy of a party aggrieved by the decision of the RTC, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, is to appeal by writ of error to the Court of Appeals under Rule 41<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Rules of Court, in which questions of facts and/or of law may be raised by the parties.&nbsp; However, under Section 2(c),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, where only questions of law are raised or are involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules.&nbsp; However, even if only questions or issues are raised by the party in his appeal, it should be made to the Court of Appeals and not to the Supreme Court, unless there are compelling reasons to allow such appeal.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes v.

Had the MTCC followed our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayog</span>, it would have confirmed that, before the respondent filed its complaint, the property had long been brought under Operation Land Transfer and that the Register of Deeds had issued to all the petitioners their respective transfer certificates of title based on the Emancipation Patents issued by the President of the Philippines, through the DAR.&nbsp; However, the MTCC rendered judgment against the petitioners and ordered their eviction on the following findings:<blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firstly</span>, they asseverate that they had been giving the original landowner Lorenzo Zayco (but the owner was Celso Zayco) his shares of the produce from 191970 (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) to 1981 and that in 1982-83, they had been paying the lease rentals to the new landowner Julieta C. Salgado.&nbsp; Obviously, defendants predicate their tenurial rights on their perceived landowner Lorenzo Zayco (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) and that therefore, the new landowner Julieta C. Salgado has assumed her liabilities to them as her alleged tenants.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On this point</span>, there is not a shred of evidence proving that either Lorenzo Zayco or Julieta C. Salgado had ever received their respective shares of the harvests.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondly</span>, how was Celso Zayco (not Lorenzo Zayco, as erroneously claimed by defendants) able to mortgage Lot No. 343 with the Pacific Banking Corporation (PBC), despite this alleged tenancy relationship between him and the defendants?&nbsp; Equally baffling to the Court is this undisputed fact: although the Emancipation Patents (EPs) in the names of the seven (7) defendants were issued on July 1, 1988; yet, those were, respectively, registered on plaintiff’s title only on March 21, 1990, July 12, 1990 and August 24, 1990.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thirdly</span>, of the other thirteen (13) defendants, plaintiff’s Exhibit “A” clearly shows that they had not been cultivating personally the portions occupied by them or with the help of the immediate members of their families; but that they had been leasing such portions to several persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>The MTCC even ignored the receipts appended by the petitioners to their position paper showing that the landowner and/or Julieta C.

Under the DAR Rules of Procedure, the DARAB has primary and exclusive original jurisdiction over cases involving the issuance and cancellation of Emancipation Patents.&nbsp; Moreover, the respondent claimed possession over the property based on TCT No. 133298, which had already been partially cancelled by the Emancipation Patents and Torrens titles issued to the petitioners.<br><br>On the third issue, we reject the contention of the respondent that the decision of the MTCC had become final and executory because of the petitioners’ failure to perfect the appeal therefrom; hence, immutable.&nbsp; Neither do we agree with the respondent’s contention that by participating in the proceedings before the MTCC, the petitioners were estopped from assailing the jurisdiction of the MTCC.&nbsp; As we held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arevalo v. Benedicto</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><blockquote>[F]urthermore, the want of jurisdiction by a court over the subject-matter renders its judgment void and a mere nullity, and considering that a void judgment is in legal effect no judgment, by which no rights are divested, from which no rights can be obtained, which neither binds nor bars any one, and under which all acts performed and all claims flowing out of are void, and considering further, that the decision, for want of jurisdiction of the court, is not a decision in contemplation of law, and, hence, can never become executory, it follows that such a void judgment cannot constitute a bar to another case by reason of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.</blockquote>Our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Abbain v. Chua</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> is also instructive:<blockquote>In varying language, this Court has expressed its reprobation for judgments rendered by a court without jurisdiction. Such a judgment is held to be “a dead limb on the judicial tree, which should be lopped off or wholly disregarded as the circumstances require.” In the language of Mr. Justice Street: “Where a judgment or judicial order is void in this sense it maybe said to be a lawless thing, which can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight, or ignored wherever and whenever it exhibits its head.” And in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gomez vs. Concepcion</span>, this Court quoted with approval the following from <span style="font-style: italic;">Freeman on Judgments</span>:&nbsp; “A void judgment is in legal effect no judgment.&nbsp; By it no rights are divested.&nbsp; From it no rights can be obtained. Being worthless in itself, all proceedings found upon it are equally worthless.&nbsp; It neither binds nor bars any one.&nbsp; All acts performed under it and all claims flowing out of it are void.&nbsp; The parties attempting to enforce it may be responsible as trespassers.&nbsp; The purchaser at a sale by virtue of its authority finds himself without title and without redress.”<br><br>Since the judgment here on its face is <span style="font-style: italic;">void ab initio</span>, the limited periods for relief from judgment in Rule 38 are inapplicable.&nbsp; That judgment is vulnerable to attack “in any way and at any time, even when no appeal has been taken.”</blockquote>It is settled that jurisdiction over the judgment cannot be changed by agreement of the parties or by the act or omission of each of them that will contravene the legislative will.&nbsp; A party should not be allowed to divest a competent court of its jurisdiction, whether erroneously or even deliberately in derogation of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In this case, the counsel of the petitioners opted to assail in a direct action the decision of the MTCC, instead of perfecting their appeal or assailing the decision of the MTCC disallowing their appeal.&nbsp; The petitioners believed that the decision of the MTCC was null and void for want of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action filed therein; hence, they are not proscribed from assailing such decision in a direct action. The remedy resorted to by their counsel should not prejudice and bar them from assailing the MTCC decision before the RTC on a petition to annul the same for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Neither are they estopped from assailing the decision, simply because they filed their answer and motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.&nbsp; After all, the only relief prayed for by them in their answer was the dismissal of the complaint.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">A propos</span> is our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Calimlim v. Ramirez</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><blockquote>It is neither fair nor legal to bind a party by the result of a suit or proceeding which was taken cognizance of in a court which lacks jurisdiction over the same irrespective of the attendant circumstances.&nbsp; The equitable defense of estoppel requires knowledge or consciousness of the facts upon which it is based.&nbsp; The same thing is true with estoppel by conduct which may be asserted only when it is shown, among others, that the representation must have been made with knowledge of the facts and that the party to whom it was made is ignorant of the truth of the matter. &nbsp;(<span style="font-style: italic;">De Castro vs. Gineta</span>, 27 SCRA 623.)&nbsp; The filing of an action or suit in a court that does not possess jurisdiction to entertain the same may not be presumed to be deliberate and intended to secure a ruling which could later be annulled if not favorable to the party who filed such suit or proceeding.&nbsp; Instituting such an action is not a one-sided affair.&nbsp; It can just as well be prejudicial to the one who filed the action or suit in the event that he obtains a favorable judgment therein which could also be attacked for having been rendered without jurisdiction.&nbsp; The determination of the correct jurisdiction of a court is not a simple matter.&nbsp; It can raise highly debatable issues of such importance that the highest tribunal of the land is given the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to entertain the same.&nbsp; The point simply is that when a party commits error in filing his suit or proceeding in a court that lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same, such act may not at once be deemed sufficient basis of estoppel.&nbsp; It could have been the result of an honest mistake, or of divergent interpretations of doubtful legal provisions.&nbsp; If any fault is to be imputed to a party taking such course of action, part of the blame should be placed on the court which shall entertain the suit, thereby lulling the parties into believing that they pursued their remedies in the correct forum.&nbsp; Under the rules, it is the duty of the court to dismiss an action “whenever it appears that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter.” (Sec. 2, Rule 9, Rules of Court.)&nbsp; Should the court render a judgment without jurisdiction, such judgment may be impeached or annulled for lack of jurisdiction (Sec. 30, Rule 132, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid</span>.), within ten (10) years from the finality of the same. (Art. 1144, par. 3, Civil Code.)</blockquote>It bears stressing that the petitioners are now the registered owners of the portions of the landholding and entitled to the possession thereof.&nbsp; For us to deny the petition and affirm the decision of the RTC would be to sanction the eviction of the petitioners who are the registered owners of the landholding and, as such, are entitled to the possession thereof and allow the respondent to take possession thereof in derogation of law.&nbsp; Not too long ago in <span style="font-style: italic;">Calimlim v.
