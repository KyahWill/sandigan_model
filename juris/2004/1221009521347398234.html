				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Foreseeable difficulties that occur during the Christmas season and cause a delay do not constitute a fortuitous event.&nbsp; The difficulties in processing claims during that period are not “acts of God” that would excuse noncompliance with judicially approved obligations.<br><br><b><center><u>The Case</u><br></center></b><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the February 28, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 59518.&nbsp; The dispositive part of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>“<b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed final order is hereby <b>REVERSED</b>.&nbsp; The Court a quo is ordered to issue a Writ of Execution directing the branch sheriff to enforce [Respondent] ALA Industries’ unpaid claim against [Petitioner] Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) in the total amount of P7,171,835.53.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><b><center><u>The Facts</u><br></center></b><br>The facts of the case are narrated by the CA as follows:<br><blockquote>“[Petitioner] MIAA conducted a public bidding for a contract involving the structural repair and waterproofing of the International Passenger Terminal (IPT) and International Container Terminal (ICT) buildings of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).&nbsp; Out of eleven bidders, [Respondent] ALA submitted the second lowest and most advantageous bid.&nbsp; The contract was awarded to [respondent] in the amount of P32,000,000.00 when it agreed to reduce the price from P36,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On June 28, 1993, the contract was executed providing, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, the following terms:<br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><center>‘ARTICLE I<br></center><br><center><u>‘SCOPE OF WORK</u><br></center><br>‘1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Progress billings shall be paid by the MIAA periodically but not more than once a month within 30 calendar days from receipt hereof.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>“The contract contains escalation clauses and price adjustments.&nbsp; [Respondent] made the necessary repairs and waterproofing.&nbsp; After submission of its progress billings to [petitioner], [respondent] received partial payments.&nbsp; Progress billing No. 6 remained unpaid despite repeated demands by [respondent].<br><br>“On June 30, 1994, [petitioner] unilaterally rescinded the contract on the ground that [respondent] failed to complete the project within the agreed completion date.&nbsp; On September 16, 1994, [petitioner] advised [respondent] of a committee formed to determine the extent of the work done which was given until September 30, 1994 to submit its findings.&nbsp; Just the same, [respondent] was not fully paid.<br><br>“On October 20, 1994, [respondent] objected to the rescission made by [petitioner] and reiterated its claims.&nbsp; As of the filing of the complaint for sum of money and damages on July 18, 1995, [respondent] was seeking to recover from [petitioner] P10,376,017.00 as the latter’s outstanding obligation and P1,642,112.84 due from the first to [the] fifth progress billings.<br><br>“With the filing of [respondent’s] sur-rejoinder to [petitioner’s] rejoinder, the trial Court directed the parties to proceed to arbitration on July 16, 1996.&nbsp; The Court <u>a quo’s</u> ruling is based on Article XXVII of the contract that provides for arbitration.<br><br>“Both parties executed a compromise agreement, assisted by their counsels, and jointly filed in court a motion for judgment based on compromise agreement.<br><br><u>RTC Disposition</u><br><br>“On November 4, 1997, the Court <u>a quo</u> rendered judgment approving the compromise agreement.&nbsp; The pertinent portions of the compromise read as follows:<br><ol><blockquote>‘1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As full and complete payment of its claims against [petitioner] arising from their waterproofing contract subject of this case, [respondent] accepts [petitioner]’s offer of payment in the amount of FIVE MILLION NINE HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AND 31/100 (P5,946,294.31).<br><br>‘2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Failure of the [petitioner] to pay said amount to [respondent] within the period above stipulated shall entitle the [respondent] to a writ of execution from this Honorable Court to enforce all its claims</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);

moral[s], good customs, public order, and public policy, the Court
hereby approves the same and renders judgment in conformity with the
terms and conditions of the said COMPROMISE AGREEMENT, enjoining the
parties to comply with the provisions thereof strictly and in good
faith without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">‘SO ORDERED.’<br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>“For [petitioner’s] failure to pay within the period above stipulated, [respondent] filed a motion for execution to enforce its claim in the total amount of P13,118,129.84.&nbsp; [Petitioner] filed a comment and attributed the delays to its being a government agency.&nbsp; In its effort to render [respondent’s] motion for execution moot and academic, [petitioner] paid [respondent] P5,946,294.31 on February 2, 1998.<br></blockquote></ol><blockquote><br>“On February 16, 1998, the trial court denied [respondent’s] motion for execution.&nbsp; It also denied the motion for reconsideration, ruling as follows:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>‘The delay in complying with the Compromise Agreement having been satisfactorily explained by the Office of the Government Counsel, the Motion for Reconsideration of the order denying [respondent’s] Motion for Execution is denied.’<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><b><u><center>Ruling of the Court of Appeals<br></center></u></b><br>Reversing the trial court, the CA ordered it to issue a writ of execution to enforce respondent’s claim to the extent of petitioner’s remaining balance.&nbsp; The appellate court ratiocinated that a judgment rendered in accordance with a compromise agreement was immediately executory, and that a delay of almost two months was not substantial compliance therewith.<br><br>Hence this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>Issues</u><br></center></b><blockquote>Petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><center>“I.<br></center><br>Whether or not the slight delay of petitioner in complying with its obligation under the Compromise Agreement is a valid ground for the enforcement of private respondent’s claim under the Complaint.<br><br><center>“II.<br></center><br>Whether or not the delay of petitioner in complying with its obligation under the Compromise Agreement is justified under the principle that no person shall be responsible for those events which could not be foreseen, or which though foreseen, were inevitable.<br><br><center>“III.<br></center><br>Whether or not private respondent is estopped from enforcing its claim under the Complaint considering that it already enjoyed the benefits of the Compromise Agreement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>The foregoing may be summed up in one issue:&nbsp; Whether there was a fortuitous event that excused petitioner from complying with the terms and conditions of the judicially approved Compromise Agreement.<br><b><center><br><u>The Court’s Ruling</u><br></center></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Petition has no merit.<br><br><b><center><u>Sole Issue:<br><i>Delay in Payment by Reason<br>of a Fortuitous Event</i></u><br></center></b><br>A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions to resolve their differences,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> thus avoiding litigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> or putting an end to one that has already commenced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Generally favored in law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> such agreement is a bilateral act or transaction that is binding on the contracting parties and is expressly acknowledged by the Civil Code as a juridical agreement between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Provided it is not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> it is immediately executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b><i><center><br><div style="text-align: left;"><u>Judicial Compromise</u><br><u>Final and Executory</u><br></div></center></i></b><br>In a long line of cases, we have consistently held that “x x x ‘a compromise once approved by final orders of the court has the force of <i>res judicata</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> between the parties and should not be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery.’&nbsp; Hence, ‘a decision on a compromise agreement is final and executory x x x.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Such agreement has the force of law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and is conclusive between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It transcends its identity as a mere contract binding only upon the parties thereto, as it becomes a judgment that is subject to execution in accordance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Judges therefore have the ministerial and mandatory duty to implement and enforce it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>To be valid, a compromise agreement is merely required by law, <i>first</i>, to be based on real claims; <i>second</i>, to be actually agreed upon in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Both conditions are present in this case.&nbsp; The claims of the parties are valid, and the agreement done without any fraud or vice of consent.<br><br>Without a doubt, each of the parties herein entered into Compromise Agreement freely and voluntarily.&nbsp; When they carefully negotiated the terms and provisions thereof, they were adequately assisted by their respective counsels — petitioner, no less than by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Each party agreed to something that neither might have actually wanted, except for the peace that would be brought by the avoidance of a protracted litigation.&nbsp; Hence, the Agreement must govern their relations.<br><br><b><i><u>The Christmas Season<br>Not a Fortuitous Event</u></i></b><br><br>The failure to pay on the date stipulated was clearly a violation of the Agreement.&nbsp; Within thirty days from receipt of the judicial Order approving it — on December 20, 1997 —payment should have been made, but was not.&nbsp; Thus, nonfulfillment of the terms of the compromise justified execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It is the height of absurdity for petitioner to attribute to a fortuitous event its delayed payment.&nbsp; Petitioner’s explanation is clearly “a gratuitous assertion that borders on callousness.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Christmas season cannot be cited as an act of God that would excuse a delay in the processing of claims by a government entity that is subject to routine accounting and auditing rules.<br><br>A fortuitous event is one that cannot be foreseen or, though foreseen, is inevitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It has the following characteristics:<br><br><blockquote>“x x x (a) [T]he cause of the unforeseen and unexpected occurrence, or the failure of the debtor to comply with his obligations, must be independent of human will; (b) it must be impossible to foresee the event which constitutes the <i>caso fortuito</i>, or if it can be foreseen, it must be impossible to avoid; (c) the occurrence must be such as to render it impossible for the debtor to fulfill his obligation in a normal manner; and (d) the obligor must be free from any participation in the aggravation of the injury resulting to the creditor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>None of these elements appears in this case.<br><br><i>First</i>, processing claims against the government and subjecting these to the usual accounting and auditing procedures are certainly not only foreseeable and expectable, but also dependent upon the human will.&nbsp; Liquidation and payment resulting therefrom can be deliberately delayed or speeded up.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the Christmas season is not a <i>caso fortuito</i>, but a regularly occurring event.&nbsp; It is in fact foreseeable, and its occurrence has absolutely nothing to do with the processing of claims.<br><br>Further, in order to claim exemption from liability by reason of a fortuitous event, such event should be the sole and proximate cause of the injury to or the loss or destruction of the object of the contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or compromise, which was the payment to be made by petitioner.&nbsp; Certainly, this payment was not lost or destroyed, but merely delayed, thus causing injury to respondent.&nbsp; Granting <i>arguendo</i> such loss or destruction, the Christmas season could not have been the sole and proximate cause thereof.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the occurrence of the Christmas season did not at all render impossible the normal fulfillment of the obligation of petitioner; otherwise, few claims would ever be paid during this period.&nbsp; It ought to have taken appropriate measures to ensure that a delay would be avoided.&nbsp; When it entered into the Agreement, it knew fully well that the 30-day period for it to pay its obligation would end during the Christmas season.&nbsp; Thus, it cannot now be allowed to renege on its commitment.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, petitioner cannot argue that it is free from any participation in the delay.&nbsp; It should have laid out on the compromise table the problems that would be caused by a deadline falling during the Christmas season.&nbsp; Furthermore, it should have explained to respondent that government accounts would be examined carefully and thoroughly to the last detail, in strict compliance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> with accounting and auditing rules issued by and pursuant to the constitutional mandate of the Commission on Audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the liquidation of government obligations involves a long process beginning with the preparation of disbursement vouchers; followed by the processing of requests for allotment as supported by vouchers, job orders and requisitions; and ending with the issuance of the corresponding checks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Without first securing the necessary certification as to the availability of funds and allotment against which expenditures may be properly charged,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> no funds shall be disbursed; and no expenditures chargeable against any authorized allotments shall be incurred or authorized by agency heads.<br><br>Moreover, it is important to note that under government accounting principles, “no contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be made until there is an appropriation therefor, the unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is sufficient to cover the proposed expenditure.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In the present case, there was already an antecedent appropriation for the contract when petitioner entered into it.&nbsp; Obviously, prior planning had not taken into account the liquidation process in the conduct of the compromise.<br><br>The sheer neglect shown by petitioner in failing to consider these matters aggravated the resulting injury suffered by respondent.&nbsp; The former cannot be allowed to hide now behind its government cloak.<br><br><b><i><u>Fortuitous Event<br>Negated by Negligence</u></i></b><br><br>The act-of-God doctrine requires all human agencies to be excluded from creating the cause of the mischief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Such doctrine cannot be invoked to protect a person who has failed to take steps to forestall the possible adverse consequences of loss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> or injury.&nbsp; Since the delay in payment in the present case was partly a result of human participation — whether from active intervention or neglect — the whole occurrence was humanized and was therefore outside the ambit of a <i>caso fortuito</i>.<br><br>Furthermore, none of the requisites we have earlier mentioned are present in this case, a fact that clearly prevents petitioner from being excused from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Under the rules of evidence, the burden of proving that a loss is due to a <i>caso fortuito</i> rests upon the party invoking it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This responsibility, it failed to discharge.<br><br>Verily, an assiduous scrutiny of the records convinces us that it was negligent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and that it thereby incurred a delay in the performance of its contractual obligation under the judicial compromise.&nbsp; It thus created an undue risk or injury to respondent by failing to exercise that reasonable degree of care, precaution or vigilance that the circumstances justly demanded,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and that an ordinarily prudent person would have done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Court Without Power to Alter<br>a Judicial Compromise</u></i></b><br><br>“The principle of autonomy of contracts must be respected.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The Compromise Agreement was a contract perfected by mere consent;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> hence, it should have been respected.&nbsp; Item 3 thereof provided that failure of petitioner to pay within the stipulated period would entitle respondent to a writ of execution to enforce all the claims that had been pleaded by the latter in the Complaint.&nbsp; This provision must be upheld, because the Agreement supplanted the Complaint itself.&nbsp; Although judicial approval was not required for the perfection of that Agreement once it was granted, it could not and must not be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>No such infirmity can be found in the subject Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; Its terms are clear and leave no doubt as to their intention.&nbsp; Thus, the literal meaning of its stipulations must control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It “must be strictly interpreted and x x x understood as including only matters specifically determined therein or which, by necessary inference from its wording, must be deemed included.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The lower court was without power to relieve petitioner from an obligation it had voluntarily assumed, simply because the Agreement later turned out to be unwise, disastrous or foolish.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It had no authority to impose upon the parties a judgment different from or against the terms and conditions of their Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It could not alter a contract by construction or make a new one for the parties; “its duty is confined to the interpretation of the one which they have made for themselves without regard to its wisdom or folly as the court cannot supply material stipulations or read into the contract words which it does not contain.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It could not even set aside its judgment without declaring in an incidental hearing that the Agreement was vitiated by any of the grounds enumerated in Article 2038 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Above all, neither the Agreement nor the court’s approval of it was ever questioned or assailed by the parties.<br><br>Basic is the rule that if a party fails or refuses to abide by a compromise agreement, the other may either enforce it or regard it as rescinded and insist upon the original demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> For failure of petitioner to abide by the judicial compromise, respondent chose to enforce it.&nbsp; The latter’s course of action was in accordance with the very stipulations in the Agreement that the lower court could not change.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Respondent is thus entitled to a writ of execution for the total amount contained in the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; The Court cannot reduce it.&nbsp; The partial payment made by petitioner does not at all contravene Article 1229 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which is applicable only to contracts that are the subjects of litigation, not to final and executory judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>Estoppel Inapplicable</i></u></b><br><br>Petitioner’s attempt to put respondent in estoppel must be struck down.&nbsp; “In estoppel, a person, who by his act or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner, is barred from adopting an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct that thereby causes loss or injury to another.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> No such inconsistency is present here.&nbsp; From the very start, respondent was already asking the courts to enforce all its claims, pursuant to the Agreement.&nbsp; It has not shown any act or conduct that would leads us to believe that by accepting petitioner’s partial payment, it has dropped all claims to which it is entitled.<br><br>Certainly, an obligation may be extinguished by payment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> but this rule applies when the creditor “receives and acknowledges full payment”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> from the debtor.&nbsp; Respondent has neither acknowledged full payment nor led petitioner to believe that it has.&nbsp; Lack of reservation or protest does not <i>ipso facto</i> constitute a waiver of claims.&nbsp; Because estoppel should be applied with caution, the action that gives rise to it must be deliberate and unequivocal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In the present case, respondent continued to pursue the execution of its total demand of P13,118,129.84, even after receiving P5,946,294.31 from petitioner. This continued pursuit signified the former’s intent not to waive its total claim.&nbsp; Hence, it cannot be considered estopped from enforcing such claim.<br><br>The appellate court was correct in strictly following the Agreement by deducting the amount received by respondent from the latter’s total claim.&nbsp; Besides, “questions raised on appeal must be within the issues framed by the parties and, consequently, issues not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Any assertion of equity must finally be struck down “when dilatory schemes exist.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b><i>DENIED</i></b>, and the assailed Decision <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Ynares-Santiago, Carpio</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 8-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id., pp. 26-38.&nbsp; Penned by Justice Ruben T.
