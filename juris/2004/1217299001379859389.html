Baluyot of the Medico-Legal Division of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) conducted an autopsy where he made the following findings: <blockquote> Cyanosis, lips and nailbeds.<br><br>Abrasion, 7.0 x 2.0 cms., right arm, middle third, postero-lateral aspect.<br><br>Contused-abrasion, 14.5 x 2.5 cms., postero-lateral chest wall, right side.<br><br>Gunshot Wound, <u>Entrance</u>, 3.0 x 0.8 cms., roughly ovaloid, with irregular edges, abrasion collar widest postero-inferiorly, located at the head, left parietal area, 9.0 cms. above and 8.0 cms. behind the left external auditory meatus, directed forward upward and from left to right, involving the scalp, fracturing the left parietal bone (punched-in), lacerating the left and right cerebral hemispheres of the brain, fracturing the right parietal bone (punched-out), lacerating the scalp, making an Exit wound, 3.3 x 1.0 cms., stellate with everted and irregular edges, 12.0 cms. above and 2.0 cms. in front of the right external auditory meatus.<br><br>Intracranial hemorrhage, subdural and subarachnoid, extensive, bilateral.<br><br>Scalp hematoma, fronto-parietal areas, bilateral.<br>Visceral organs, congested.<br>Stomach, one-fourth (1/4) filled with partially digested food particles.<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH: GUNSHOT WOUND, HEAD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </blockquote> Dr. Baluyot testified that the victim died from a single gunshot wound in the head.&nbsp; The bullet entered the left upper back portion of the head (above the level of the left ear)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and exited to the right side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Dr. Baluyot signed Vincent’s certificate of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>At about 3:00 p.m., SPO2 Felix Pajarillo and Police Inspector Abelardo P. Aquino proceeded to the scene of the shooting but failed to find the victim and the appellant.&nbsp; They proceeded to the Quezon City General Hospital where they heard that the victim had died.&nbsp; They returned to the crime scene and recovered an empty shell from a .45 caliber gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On September 28, 1998, Major Isidro Suyo, the Chief of the MMDA Motorcycle Unit to which the appellant was assigned on detached service, reported to the Sangandaan Police Station that the appellant had not reported for duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> At 2:10 p.m. of September 29, 1998, Police Senior Superintendent Alfonso Nalangan, the Regional Director of the PNP-TMG, NCR, surrendered the appellant to the Sangandaan Police Station together with his .45 caliber pistol bearing Serial No. AOC-38701.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Meantime, upon the urging of Vicente Jorojoro, Ricardo was brought to the Department of Justice where he was enrolled under its Witness Protection Program.&nbsp; He gave his sworn statement to NBI Special Agent Roberto Divinagracia on September 29, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On the same date, P/Insp. Abelardo Aquino wrote the Chief of the PNP Crime Laboratory Examination Unit requesting for the ballistic examination of the .45 caliber pistol with Serial No. AOC-38701 and the empty shell of a .45 caliber gun found at the scene of the shooting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Before noon on September 30, 1998, Divinagracia arrived at the station and turned over two witnesses, Raymond Castro and Ricardo Salvo.&nbsp; He also turned over the witnesses’ sworn statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On October 2, 1998, on orders of the police station commander,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Pajarillo took pictures of the crime scene, including the <i>carinderia</i> and the roof with a bullet hole as part of the office filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; He did not inform the prosecution that he took such pictures, nor did he furnish it with copies thereof.&nbsp; However, the appellant’s counsel learned of the existence of the said pictures.<br><br>On October 5, 1998, P/Insp. Mario Prado signed Firearms Identification Report No. FAIB-124-98 stating that: <blockquote> FINDINGS:<br><br>Microscopic examination and comparison of the specimen marked “FAP” revealed the same individual characteristics with cartridge cases fired from the above-mentioned firearm.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>The specimen marked “FAP” was fired from the above-mentioned caliber .45 Thompson Auto Ordnance pistol with serial number AOC-38701.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </blockquote> Vincent’s family suffered mental anguish as a result of his death.&nbsp; As evidenced by receipts, they spent P49,174 for the funeral.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><u>Case for the Appellant</u><br></center><br>The appellant denied shooting Vincent.&nbsp; He testified that at about 1:30 p.m. of September 26, 1998, Macario Ortiz, a resident of Sitio San Jose, Quezon City, asked for police assistance; Macario’s brother-in-law was drunk and armed with a knife, and was creating trouble in their house.&nbsp; The appellant’s house was located along a narrow alley (<i>eskinita</i>) perpendicular to the main road.&nbsp; It was 200 meters away from Macario’s house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Responding to the call, the appellant took his .45 service revolver, cocked it, put the safety lock in place and tucked the gun at his right waistline.&nbsp; He brought out his motorcycle from the garage and slowly negotiated the bumpy alley leading to the main road.&nbsp; Macario, who was waiting for him at the main road, called his attention to his revolver which was about to fall off from his waist.&nbsp; The appellant got distracted and brought his motorcycle to the right side of the road, near the abandoned <i>carinderia</i> where he stopped. &nbsp;As he stepped his right foot on the ground to keep himself from falling, the appellant lost his balance and slipped to the right.&nbsp; At this point, the revolver fell to the ground near his foot and suddenly went off.&nbsp; Bystanders shouted, “<i>Ano yon, ano yon, mukhang may tinamaan.</i>” He picked up his gun and examined it.&nbsp; He put the safety latch back on and tucked it at his right waistline.&nbsp; He then told Macario to wait for a while to check if somebody was really hit.&nbsp; He went near the abandoned <i>carinderia</i> and saw Vincent sprawled to the ground.&nbsp; He picked up the bloodied child, boarded him on a tricycle on queue and instructed its driver, Boy Candaje, to bring the boy to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> On board the tricycle were Jeffrey Dalansay and Milbert Doring.<br><br>The appellant rode his motorcycle and proceeded to his mother’s house in Caloocan City but did not inform her of the incident.&nbsp; He then called his superior officer, Major Isidro Suyo, at the Base 103, located at Roces Avenue, Quezon City.&nbsp; The appellant informed Major Suyo that he met an accident; that his gun fell and fired; and, that the bullet accidentally hit a child.&nbsp; He also told his superior that he might not be able to report for work that day and the following day.&nbsp; He assured his superior that he would surrender later.&nbsp; He then went to Valenzuela City to the house of his friend PO3 Angelito Lam, who was a motorcycle unit cop.&nbsp; The appellant stayed there for three days.&nbsp; He also visited friends during that time.<br><br>On September 29, 1998, he went to the office of Major Suyo and surrendered his .45 caliber pistol.&nbsp; Major Suyo accompanied and turned over the appellant to the commanding officer at Camp Crame, Quezon City.&nbsp; The appellant was subjected to a neuro and drug test.&nbsp; He stated that the results of the drug test were negative.&nbsp; The appellant was then referred to the Sangandaan Police Station for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The pictures<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the crime scene were given to him by Barangay Tanod Johnny Yaket, shown in one of the pictures pointing to a bullet hole.&nbsp; The appellant’s testimony was corroborated in <i>pari materia</i> by Macario Ortiz.<br><br>Leonel Angelo Balaoro, Vincent’s thirteen-year-old playmate, testified that at 1:30 p.m. of September 26, 1998, he was playing basketball at Barangay Bahay Toro, at the basketball court along the road beside the chapel.&nbsp; With him were Ricardo, Puti and Nono.&nbsp; Vincent was on the rooftop of the <i>carinderia</i> with Whilcon.&nbsp; While Puti was shooting the ball, an explosion ensued.&nbsp; He and Ricardo ran beside the chapel near the basketball court.&nbsp; He looked back towards the basketball court and saw the appellant, about 15 meters away from the canal, holding the prostrate and bloodied Vincent.&nbsp; He did not see the appellant shoot Vincent.&nbsp; He did not report what he saw to the police authorities.&nbsp; He was ordered by his father to testify for the appellant.&nbsp; He also testified that his mother was related to Daniel, the appellant’s brother.<br><br>On January 19, 1999, the trial court rendered judgment convicting the appellant of murder, qualified by treachery and aggravated by abuse of public position.&nbsp; The trial court did not appreciate in favor of the appellant the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the decision reads: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused PO3 Ferdinand Fallorina y Fernando GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder defined in and penalized by Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and in view of the presence of the aggravating circumstance of taking advantage by the accused of his public position (par. 1, Art. 14, Revised Penal Code), is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>The accused is hereby ordered to indemnify the heirs of the late Vincent Jorojoro, Jr. the amounts of P49,174.00, as actual damages; P50,000.00, as moral damages; P25,000.00, as exemplary damages; and, P50,000.00, as death indemnity.<br><br>The accused is to pay the costs.<br><br>The .45 caliber pistol, service firearm (Exh. “R”) of the accused, shall remain under the custody of the Court and shall be disposed of in accordance with the existing rules and regulations upon the finality of this decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </blockquote> The appellant assigned the following errors for resolution: <blockquote><ol><li>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT GIVING DUE CREDENCE TO RELEVANT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, WHICH IF CONSIDERED COULD HAVE ALTERED THE CONCLUSIONS ARRIVED AT BY THE COURT AND THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> SERIOUSLY ERRED BY OVERSTEPPING THE LINE OF JUDGING AND ADVOCACY, AND GOING INTO THE REALM OF SPECULATION, PATENTLY DEMONSTRATING BIAS AND PARTIALITY.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN GIVING UNDUE CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF RICARDO SALVO, ALLEGED PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS, WHOSE TESTIMONY IS WANTING IN PROBABILITY, AS IT IS CONTRARY TO THE COMMON EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> GRAVELY ERRED IN INEQUITABLY APPRECIATING EXCULPATORY AND INCULPATORY FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> GRAVELY ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIS POSITION BY ACCUSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote> The appellant asserts that the trial court failed to appreciate in his favor the physical evidence, <i>viz.</i>, the hole found on the rooftop of the <i>carinderia</i> where Vincent was when he was shot.&nbsp; The appellant contends that the picture<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> taken on October 2, 1998 by no less than SPO2 Felix Pajarillo, one of the principal witnesses of the prosecution, and the pictures<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> showing Barangay Tanod Yaket pointing to a hole on the roof buttress the defense of the appellant that the shooting was accidental.&nbsp; The appellant maintains that his service revolver fell to the ground, hit a hard object, and as the barrel of the gun was pointed to an oblique direction, it fired, hitting the victim who was on the rooftop.&nbsp; The bullet hit the back portion of the victim’s head, before exiting and hitting the rooftop.&nbsp; The appellant posits that the pictures belie Ricardo’s testimony that he deliberately shot the victim, and, instead, complements Dr. Baluyot’s testimony that the gunshot wound came from somewhere behind the victim, somewhere lower than the point of entrance.&nbsp; The appellant invokes P/Insp. Mario Prado’s testimony that if a gun hits the ground in an oblique position, the gun will fire and the bullet will exit in the same position as the gun, that is, also in an oblique position.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, for its part, asserts that the contention of the appellant is based on speculations and surmises, the factual basis for his conclusion not having been proven by competent and credible evidence.&nbsp; There is no evidence on record that the hole shown in the pictures<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was caused by a bullet from a .45 caliber pistol.&nbsp; The appellant did not present Barangay Tanod Johnny Yaket, who was shown in the pictures, to testify on the matter.&nbsp; The appellant failed to prove that any slug was found on the rooftop or under the roof which came from the appellant’s .45 caliber pistol.&nbsp; According to the Solicitor General, the pictures relied upon by the appellant cannot overcome the positive and straightforward testimony of the young eyewitness Ricardo Salvo.<br><br>We agree with the Office of the Solicitor General.&nbsp; Whether or not the appellant is exempt from criminal liability is a factual issue.&nbsp; The appellant was burdened to prove, with clear and convincing evidence, his affirmative defense that the victim’s death was caused by his gun accidentally going off, the bullet hitting the victim without his fault or intention of causing it; hence, is exempt from criminal liability under Article 12, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code which reads – <br><blockquote>The following are exempt from criminal liability: <div style="text-align: center;"> … </div><ol start="4"> <li>Any person who, while performing a lawful act with due care, causes an injury by mere accident without fault or intention of causing it. </li></ol></blockquote> The basis for the exemption is the complete absence of intent and negligence on the part of the accused.&nbsp; For the accused to be guilty of a felony, it must be committed either with criminal intent or with fault or negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The elements of this exempting circumstance are (1) a person is performing a lawful act; (2) with due care; (3) he causes an injury to another by mere accident; and (4) without any fault or intention of causing it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> An accident is an occurrence that “happens outside the sway of our will, and although it comes about through some act of our will, lies beyond the bounds of humanly foreseeable consequences.”&nbsp; If the consequences are plainly foreseeable, it will be a case of negligence.<br><br>In <i>Jarco Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court held that an accident is a fortuitive circumstance, event or happening; an event happening without any human agency, or if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstance is unusual or unexpected by the person to whom it happens.&nbsp; Negligence, on the other hand, is the failure to observe, for the protection of the interest of another person, that degree of care, precaution and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand without which such other person suffers injury.&nbsp; Accident and negligence are intrinsically contradictory; one cannot exist with the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In criminal negligence, the injury caused to another should be unintentional, it being simply the incident of another act performed without malice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The appellant must rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution because by admitting having caused the death of the victim, he can no longer be acquitted.<br><br>In this case, the appellant failed to prove, with clear and convincing evidence, his defense.<br><br>First.&nbsp; The appellant appended to his counter-affidavit in the Office of the Quezon City Prosecutor the pictures showing the hole on the roof of the <i>carinderia</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> to prove that he shot the victim accidentally.&nbsp; However, when the investigating prosecutor propounded clarificatory questions on the appellant relating to the pictures, the latter refused to answer.&nbsp; This can be gleaned from the resolution of the investigating prosecutor, thus: <blockquote> Classificatory questions were propounded on the respondent but were refused to be answered.&nbsp; This certainly led the undersigned to cast doubt on respondent’s allegations.&nbsp; The defenses set forth by the respondent are evidentiary in character and best appreciated in a full-blown trial; and that the same is not sufficient to overcome probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </blockquote> Second.&nbsp; The appellant did not see what part of the gun hit the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> There is no evidence showing that the gun hit a hard object when it fell to the ground, what part of the gun hit the ground and the position of the gun when it fell from the appellant’s waist.<br><br>Third.&nbsp; In answer to the clarificatory questions of the court, the appellant testified that the chamber of his pistol was loaded with bullets and was cocked when he placed it on his right waistline.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He also testified that the gun’s safety lock was on.&nbsp; He was asked if the gun would fire if the hammer is moved backward with the safety lock in place, and the appellant admitted that even if he pulled hard on the trigger, the gun would not fire:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q:</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Is this your service firearm?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">So the chamber might have been loaded when you went out of the house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">What about the hammer, how was the hammer at that time when you tucked the gun in your waistline?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">The hammer was cocked like this.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">COURT:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Can you not stipulate that the hammer is moved backwards near the safety grip.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

In fine, his act was deliberate and intentional.<br><br>It bears stressing that of the eyewitnesses listed in the Information as witnesses for the prosecution, only Ricardo Salvo remained steadfast after he was brought under the Witness Protection Program of the Department of Justice.&nbsp; He explained that the reason why he testified for the prosecution, despite the fact that the appellant was a policeman, was because he pitied the victim’s mother who was always crying,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> unable to obtain justice for her son.&nbsp;

As the trial court correctly pointed out, Vincent was shot intentionally while his back was turned against the appellant.&nbsp; The little boy was merely flying his kite and was ready to get down from the roof when the appellant fired a shot directed at him.&nbsp; The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack on an unsuspecting victim without the slightest provocation on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Nonetheless, Vincent was an eleven-year-old boy.&nbsp; He could not possibly put up a defense against the appellant, a police officer who was armed with a gun.&nbsp; It is not so much as to put emphasis on the age of the victim, rather it is more of a description of the young victim’s state of helplessness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Minor children, who by reason of their tender years, cannot be expected to put up a defense.&nbsp; When an adult person illegally attacks a child, treachery exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The abuse of superior strength as alleged in the Information is already absorbed by treachery and need not be considered as a separate aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>We, however, note that the trial court appreciated the aggravating circumstance of abuse of public position in this case.&nbsp; We reverse the trial court on this score.<br><br>There is no dispute that the appellant is a policeman and that he used his service firearm, the .45 caliber pistol, in shooting the victim.&nbsp; However, there is no evidence on record that the appellant took advantage of his position as a policeman when he shot the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The shooting occurred only when the appellant saw the victim on the rooftop playing with his kite.&nbsp; The trial court erred in appreciating abuse of public position against the appellant.<br><br>The trial court did not, however, err in ruling that the appellant is not entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.&nbsp; Surrender is said to be voluntary when it is done by the accused spontaneously and made in such a manner that it shows the intent of the accused to surrender unconditionally to the authorities, either because he acknowledges his guilt or he wishes to save them the trouble and expense necessarily incurred in his search and capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In this case, the appellant deliberately evaded arrest, hid in the house of PO3 Lam in Valenzuela City, and even moved from one house to another for three days.&nbsp; The appellant was a policeman who swore to obey the law.&nbsp; He made it difficult for his brother-officers to arrest him and terminate their investigation.&nbsp; It was only after the lapse of three days that the appellant gave himself up and surrendered his service firearm.<br><br>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for murder is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp;
