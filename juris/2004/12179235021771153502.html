The petition was docketed by this Court as G.R.

No. 154041 before this Court, the COMELEC Second Division, by Order of January 16, 2003, nullified in <b>SPR No. 21-2002</b> the writ of execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> issued by the RTC.  Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the said Order which motion was duly certified to the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>.<br><br>On September 16, 2003, this Court, by Resolution on even date, <u>dismissed G.R. No. 154041 </u>on the grounds that 1) the case had become moot and academic because of the COMELEC Second Division’s resolution on the merits of <b>SPR No. 21-2002</b>, and (2) this Court has no jurisdiction over Division orders or rulings of the COMELEC.<br><br>On October 15, 2003, the COMELEC Second Division, issued in <b>EAC No. A-10-2002</b> an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> adopting the order of substitution in <b>SPR No. 21-2002</b> dated August 25, 2002 designating Commissioner Borra as substitute member thereof.<br><br>On October 20, 2003, the COMELEC Second Division issued in <b>EAC No. A-10-2002</b> a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> affirming with modifications the RTC decision and declaring petitioner as the duly elected mayor.  On even date, respondent moved to reconsider<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the said October 20, 2003 Order.<br><br>Petitioner, in the meantime, filed on October 22, 2003 a motion for immediate execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the COMELEC Second Division October 20, 2003 Resolution, which was set for hearing on October 28, 2003 but reset to November 4, 2003.<br><br>On October 29, 2003, respondent filed before the COMELEC Second Division a “very urgent motion to consider the instant case certified to the Commission <i>en banc</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Respondent later filed on November 3, 2003 a “very urgent manifestation and motion to suspend proceedings.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Hearing of the incidents in <b>EAC No. A-10-2002</b> was conducted on November 4, 2003.  The following day or on November 5, 2003, the COMELEC Second Division issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> denying respondent’s plea for suspension of proceedings and granting petitioner’s motion for execution pending appeal and accordingly directing the issuance of a writ of execution. On even date, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> issued the questioned November 5, 2003 <i>Status Quo Ante </i>Order.  Five (5) members including Commissioner <b>Lantion</b> participated in this November 5, 2003 Order wherein Commissioner Lantion stated that “his previous voluntary inhibition is only in the SPR cases and not in the EAC” and “as further agreed in the Second Division, [he] will not participate in the Division deliberations but will vote when the case is elevated [to the] <i>en banc.</i>” Of the five Commissioners, Commissioner Borra dissented.<br><br>Hence, the present petition, alleging as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE NOV. 5 STATUS QUO ANTE ORDER IS NULL AND VOID FOR WANT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY AUTHORITY OF THE COMELEC TO ISSUE SUCH AND ORDER.<br><br></li><li>THE COMELEC EN BANC PALPABLY ACTED WITHOUT JURISDICTION AND IN FLAGRANT BREACH OF INTER-COLLEGIAL COMITY WHEN IT ISSUED THE NOV. 5 ORDER CONSIDERING THAT EAC NO. A-10-2002 IS STILL UNDER THE PRIMARY AND CONTINUING JURISDICTION OF THE SPECIAL SECOND DIVISION WHICH HAS YET TO FULLY DISPOSE OF ESTRELLA’S TIMELY FILED MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE EXECUTION.<br><br></li><li> DUE TO HIS PREVIOUS VOLUNTARY INHIBITION IN A RELATED CASE, SPR NO. 21-2002 AND AT THE DIVISION LEVEL IN THE SAME CASE, EAC NO. A-10-2002, COMMISSIONER LANTION’S VOTE IN THE ASSAILED ORDER SHOULD BE DISREGARDED AND CANCELLED. THE EN BANC’S NOV. 5 ORDER IS THUS INVALID FOR FURTHER REASON THAT IT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE REQUIRED MAJORITY VOTE.<br><br></li><li>THE COMELEC EN BANC ALSO ACTED ARBITRARILY AND IN MANIFEST GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK AND/OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT PREVENTED THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE DIVISION’S ORDER OF EXECUTION THE ISSUANCE OF WHICH IS LEGALLY JUSTIFIED UNDER THE APPLICABLE CASE PRECEDENTS AND WARRANTED UNDER THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE.<br><br></li><li> THE COMELEC EN BANC GROSSLY VIOLATED ESTRELLA’S RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS AND EQUAL OR FAIR TREATMENT WHEN IT IGNORED ITS OWN CASE PRECEDENTS AND PRACTICE. IN STARK CONTRAST TO WHAT IT DID IN THIS CASE, THE EN BANC HAD PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED THE FIRST DIVISION, IN AT LEAST TWO RECENT CASES (EPC NO. 2001-19 AND EAC NO. A-4-20030 TO RESOLVE TIMELY FILED MOTION FOR EXECUTION PENDING RECONSIDERATION AND GAVE SAID DIVISION A FREE HAND AT FULLY DISPOSING OF SAID INCIDENTS.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner argues that Commissioner Lantion’s vote in the assailed order should be disregarded because of his previous inhibition in a similar case and in the same case in the Division level, thus making said assailed order null and void as it was not concurred by the required majority.<br><br>Petitioner’s argument is meritorious.<br><br>Commissioner Lantion’s voluntary piecemeal inhibition cannot be    countenanced.  Nowhere in the COMELEC Rules does it allow a Commissioner to voluntarily inhibit with reservation.  To allow him to participate in the <i>En Banc</i> proceedings when he previously inhibited himself in the Division is, absent any satisfactory justification, not only judicially unethical but legally improper and absurd.<br><br>Since Commissioner Lantion could not participate and vote in the issuance of the questioned order, thus leaving three (3) members concurring therewith, the necessary votes of four (4) or majority of the members of the COMELEC was not attained.  The order thus failed to comply with the number of votes necessary for the pronouncement of a decision or order, as required under Rule 3, Section 5(a) of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Quorum; Votes Required. – (a) When sitting en banc, four (4) Members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business.  <b><u>The concurrence of a majority of the Members of the Commission</u> shall be necessary for the pronouncement of a decision, resolution, order or ruling.</b><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The <i>Status Quo Ante</i> Order dated November 5, 2003 issued by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> is hereby <b>NULLIFIED</b>.
