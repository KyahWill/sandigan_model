				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolution, dated September 11, 2003 of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in EPC No. 2001-11 which affirmed the Resolution, dated April 2, 2003, of the COMELEC First Division<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> declaring respondent Nestor B. Pulido as the duly elected Number 2 Provincial Board Member of the First District of Pangasinan.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>On May 19, 2001, petitioner Ariel G. De Guzman was proclaimed winner of the second of two Provincial Board seats allocated for the First District of Pangasinan with 40,441 votes. Respondent Nestor B. Pulido, a candidate for the same position, garnered 40,383 votes or 58 votes less than De Guzman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 2001, Pulido filed with the COMELEC an election protest against De Guzman, docketed as EPC No. 2001-11.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> He alleged that: <blockquote><ol start="7"> <li>In the Municipality of Mabini, Province of Pangasinan, where the PROTESTEE is the incumbent Mayor, more than one thousand (1,000) votes were padded in his favor. On the other hand, more than one hundred (100) votes of the PROTESTANT were deliberately not read and counted;<br><br></li><li>The PROTESTEE obviously orchestrated the tempo in the canvassing of votes in the Municipality of Mabini, Province of Pangasinan. He has the power and clout to do so being the immediate past third termer Mayor of that town. It must be told with regrets that the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Mabini, Pangasinan, without justifiable reasons, deliberately suspended the canvassing of votes for more than eight hours, from five o’clock in the afternoon of May 15, 2001 to 2:00 o’clock in the early morning of May 16, 2001, without proper notice to the watchers and to the public. The idea behind the suspension of canvassing for more than eight hours was to give the PROTESTEE enough time to know the results of the elections in the other municipalities and in case he loses in the quick count, he would still have time to pad his votes. Indeed, when he knew he was losing, the PROTESTEE padded more than one thousand votes to his name in order to win;<br><br></li><li>Thus, a recount of the votes cast in the various<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> precincts in the Municipality of Mabini, Province of Pangasinan, is necessary to ascertain the number of votes the PROTESTEE and the PROTESTANT actually garnered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote> The following day, Pulido amended his protest by also claiming that in the town of Mabini 500 ballots cast in his favor were misappreciated in favor of De Guzman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On June 18, 2001, De Guzman filed his Amended Answer with Counter Protest denying Pulido’s allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As counter-protest, he alleged misappreciation of ballots cast in all the precincts in the town of Anda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In addition, he alleged that: <blockquote><ol start="13"><li>In precinct 10A1 in Barangay Gais-Guipe, Dasol, Pangasinan, in CE Form No. 9 Sheet No. 67180016, the PROTESTEE garnered seventy (70) votes; that apparently when the result was transferred in CE Form No. 20-A, Sheet No. 2113885, the PROTESTEE was credited with only seventeen (17) votes, thus depriving the PROTESTEE of fifty three (53) votes. A photocopy from the copy for the Majority Party each of CE Form No. 9 Sheet 67180016 and CE Form No. 20-A, Sheet No. 2113885 are hereto attached as Annexes “A” and “B” respectively, and made parts hereof; A recount of the votes in said precinct No. 10A1 of Barangay Gais-Guipe, Dasol, Pangasinan is therefore, necessary to ascertain the correct numbers of votes of the PROTESTANT and PROTESTEE in said precinct;<br><br></li><li>In precinct No. 27A1 and 27A2, Barangay Bued, Alaminos, Pangasinan, it is made to appear in CE Form 9, Sheet 67030051, that the PROTESTANT obtained twenty four (24) votes when per the tally he received only nineteen (19) votes thereby adding five (5) votes for the PROTESTANT which should be deducted from his total votes. A copy of CE Form 9, Sheet 67030051 is hereto attached as Annex “C” and made a part hereto. A recount of the votes in said precincts 27A1 and 27A2 is therefore, necessary to ascertain the correct number of votes of the PROTESTANT and the PROTESTEE in said precincts;<br><br></li><li>In precinct No. 22A2 of Bamban, Infanta, Pangasinan, it is made to appear in CE Form No. 9, Sheet No. 67190050, that the PROTESTEE obtained twenty eight (28) votes when per tally he received thirty three (33) votes thus five (5) votes should be added to the total votes of the PROTESTEE. A photocopy of CE Form No. 9, Sheet No. 67190050 is hereto attached as Annex “D and made a part hereof;<br><br></li><li>In the Statement of Votes By Precinct, CE Form 20A, Sheet Nos. 2113889, 2113890 and 2113891 there is an error in the addition of the number of votes for the PROTESTEE, more particularly in Sheet No. 2113891 where it is made to appear in the sub-total that the PROTESTEE received three hundred forty two (342) votes instead of the correct one which is three hundred eighty nine (389) thus from this erroneous addition he was deprived of 47 votes. This 47 votes should be added to the PROTESTEE’s total votes in Infanta, Pangasinan. A copy each of the Statement of Votes By Precinct, CE Form No. 20-A, Sheet Nos. 2113889, 2113890 and 2113891 are hereto attached as Annexes “E”, “F” and “G” respectively, and made parts hereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote> On July 31, 2001, the COMELEC First Division directed the parties to deposit money to defray the expenses to be incurred in the revision of the ballots.<br><br>On September 10, 2001, the revision of the contested ballots commenced. Thereafter, both parties presented their evidence. After both parties formally offered their respective evidence, the case was submitted for decision.<br><br>Meanwhile, on March 20, 2002, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> received three letter-petitions separately filed by the Municipal Board of Canvassers of the towns of Infanta and Dasol and the Board of Election Inspectors of Precincts 27A1 and 27A2 of Alaminos City. The letter-petitions, docketed as SPC Nos. 02-001, 02-002 and 02-003, requested authority to correct mistakes or errors in tabulation reflected in the Election Returns and Statement of Votes by Precinct which were also the subject of De Guzman’s counter-protest.<br><br>On September 19, 2002, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> jointly dismissed the letter-petitions in SPC Nos. 02-002 and 02-003 of the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Infanta and the Board of Election Inspectors of Precincts 27A1 and 27A2 of Alaminos City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The COMELEC <i>en banc</i> reasoned: <blockquote> xxx [A]ll the matters raised in the letters-petitions are included in the issues to be resolved in EPC No. 2001-11 pending before the First Division which was initiated more than 9 months before the instant petitions. The election protest case is more extensive and appropriate in closely looking into the parties’ allegations and supporting documents. Such proceedings are in fact consistent with Mr. De Guzman’s call for a recount of votes in the subject clustered precincts, which we cannot undertake in a petition for correction of mistake. Hence, the First Division is in a better position to rule upon the issues and make the necessary conclusions especially on the allegations of fact that we find insufficient herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </blockquote> Subsequently, on April 2, 2003, the COMELEC First Division issued a Resolution in EPC No. 2001-11 annulling the proclamation of De Guzman. It declared Pulido as the duly elected Number 2 Provincial Board Member of the First District of Pangasinan having garnered a total of 40,336 votes as against De Guzman who obtained 40,263 votes or a plurality of 73 votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, De Guzman sought reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>De Guzman alleged that the base figures adopted by the COMELEC First Division, that is, 40,441 votes cast for De Guzman and 40,383 votes cast for Pulido, are the original figures as provided in the original canvass or statements of votes. He assailed that the use thereof as base figures, before imputing the rejected and admitted votes on appreciation, is erroneous because the manifest errors of tabulation complained of by De Guzman in his counter-protest were not considered. He claimed that the original statement of total votes for the candidates should have been first rectified to reflect the manifest errors of computation or tabulation, citing that the COMELEC en banc itself declared that the alleged errors in tabulation, which were also subject of the letter-petitions in SPC Nos. 02-002 and 02-003, are best reviewed in the election protest proper. De Guzman argued further that the COMELEC First Division misappreciated 7 ballots for De Guzman as written-by-one in Precinct 47A, Mabini, with recorded data and evidence of assistory voting and 37 more ballots for De Guzman as marked ballots with noted pattern marks.<br><br>Following hearing on the motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and submission of memoranda,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> issued a Resolution dated September 11, 2003 denying De Guzman’s motion for reconsideration. The COMELEC <i>en banc</i> ratiocinated: <blockquote> Admittedly, however, the First Division has not addressed the subject in its 02 April 2003 Resolution. Thus it is now incumbent upon us to pass upon the same to finally settle the matter.<br><br>Even a cursory reading of De Guzman’s counter-protest reveals that <b>only photocopies of the involved election returns and Statements of Votes by Precinct were submitted in evidence</b>, with the exception of the Statement of Votes to support the mistake in addition of De Guzman’s total number of Votes in Infanta, Pangasinan, which was a certified true copy. <b>Being mere photocopies, the same does not have any probative value</b>. These would not warrant a recount of the votes in precinct numbers 101A of Brgy. Gais-Gaipe, Dasol, 27A1 and 27A2 of Brgy. Bued, Alaminos and 22A2 of Brgy. Bamban, Infanta, all in the province of Pangasinan.<br><br>. . .<br><br>Moreover, the photocopy of the Statement of Votes by Precinct from Brgy. Gais-Gaipe, Dasol does not clearly show that only seventeen (17) votes, instead of seventy, were credited to protestee De Guzman, thereby depriving him of fifty three (53) votes. Aside from the fact that the figures in said photocopy did not clearly show the votes credited, <b>the entries under the column for sub/grand total votes received were not legible at all.</b><br><br><b>During the pendency of this case, protestee had every opportunity to offer competent evidence to support his contentions. He, however, failed to do the same.</b><br><br>Though a certified true copy of the Statement of Votes for Infanta, Pangasinan was submitted in evidence, such, on its own, is not sufficient to effect a correction. Protestee De Guzman did not even offer in evidence the election returns for the votes reflected in the Statement of Votes where error in addition has been alleged. Not even after careful perusal of the subject Statement of Votes by Precinct can this Commission ascertain the individual entries therein. Naturally, the Commission can, and should, only consider the documents formally offered in evidence pursuant to Section 34 of the Rules of Court, finding suppletory application in this case.<br><br>. . .<br><br>With respect to the alleged misappreciation of ballots, the First Division already painstakingly examined the ballots and ruled upon their validity. Guided by pertinent rules and Supreme Court doctrines, the Division found that protestant Nestor Pulido won over protestee Ariel De Guzman with a margin of seventy (73) votes. Such finding by the First Division must be accorded great weight in the absence of substantial showing that it was made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </blockquote> On September 18, 2003, De Guzman filed the present petition with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining and/or writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The present petition is anchored on the following grounds: <blockquote> THE COMELEC EN BANC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DICRETION AMOUNTING TO EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT FAILED AND REFUSED TO CORRECT THE PLAIN AND MANIFEST ERRORS OF TABULATION, DULY PROVEN BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE AND CONFIRMED ON (SIC) PHYSICAL COUNT, AND, CONSEQUENTLY FAILED AND REFUSED TO CORRECT THE WRONG BASE FIGURES USED IN THE COMPUTATION OF THE FINAL VOTES. THE COMELEC’S JUDGMENT UNSEATING DE GUZMAN WAS THE DIRECT AND NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE PATENTLY ERRONEOUS FIGURES IN THE FIRST DIVISION’S RESOLUTION.<br><br>THE COMELEC EN BANC LIKEWISE ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT SUSTAINED IN TOTO THE FIRST DIVISION’S APPRECIATION FINDINGS WITHOUT RECTIFYING OR REVERSING THE MANIFESTLY ERRONEOUS INVALIDATION OF 7 BALLOTS FOR DE GUZMAN AS WRITTEN-BY-ONE IN PREC. 47A, MABINI, WITH RECORDED DATA AND EVIDENCE OF ASSISTORY VOTING AND 37 MORE BALLOTS FOR DE GUZMAN AS MARKED BALLOTS WITH NOTED PATTERN MARKS SANS ANY EVIDENCE <i>ALIUNDE</i> OF THE VOTER’S DESIGN TO MARK.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </blockquote> De Guzman claims that the COMELEC en banc gravely abused its discretion when it sustained the factual findings of the First Division notwithstanding that the base figures adopted by the latter was erroneous because it did not consider the manifest errors of tabulation challenged in his counter-protest. He submits that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> erred grievously when it declared that “only photocopies of the involved Election Returns and Statements of Votes by Precinct were submitted in evidence” since he formally offered in evidence certified true copies of the documents involved.<br><br>As regards the appreciation of ballots, De Guzman claims the patent failure of the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> to consider the existence of assistory voting and the absence of evidence on the alleged pattern marking constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>On September 30, 2003, this Court required the COMELEC and Pulido to comment on the petition and, upon the posting of a bond by De Guzman in the amount of P25,000.00, issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the COMELEC from implementing its resolutions of April 2, 2003 and September 11, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In his Urgent Motion to Lift the TRO/Comment, Pulido points out that the issues raised in the petition are factual and cannot be subject of a petition for certiorari. He maintains that the rulings of the COMELEC are amply justified and the alleged errors were already corrected on physical count and reviewed or considered by the COMELEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On January 7, 2004, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Manifestation In Lieu of Comment, essentially recommending that this Court grant the present petition. It contends that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion by totally ignoring not only competent and relevant documents but obviously material pieces of evidence earlier presented before it by De Guzman; consequently, its assailed Resolution becomes grossly not in accord with the facts and the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In view of the OSG’s manifestation, the COMELEC filed its Comment. The COMELEC submits that the setting aside of the alleged correct base figures, having been unsubstantiated by De Guzman despite extensive time the protest case lasted, was in order and deserves credence. With regards to the appreciation of ballots, it contends that the COMELEC’s appreciation of ballots must be accorded great weight and presumption of regularity, in the absence of substantial showing that it was made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In his Consolidated Reply, De Guzman staunchly insists that the base figures utilized by the COMELEC are the original unrectified statement of votes without regard to the physical count results in the protested and counter-protested precincts. He vigorously maintains that he presented competent evidence, all certified true copies and not mere photocopies of the documents involved, which proved the clear and manifest tabulation errors. Anent the appreciation errors, he emphatically argues that the COMELEC’s patent failure to apply the very fundamental rules of appreciation in respect of the 7 ballots rejected as written-by-one in Precinct 47A, Mabini and 37 ballots rejected as marked in seven other revised precincts, constitutes grave abuse of discretion correctible by the present petition for certiorari.<br><br>Well recognized is the rule that the appreciation of the contested ballots and election documents involves a question of fact best left to the determination of the COMELEC. It is the constitutional commission vested with the exclusive original jurisdiction over election contests involving regional, provincial and city officials, as well as appellate jurisdiction over election protests involving elective municipal and barangay officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> By reason of the special knowledge and expertise of an administrative agency like the COMELEC over matters falling under their jurisdiction, they are in a better position to pass judgment thereon. Thus, their findings of fact in that regard are generally accorded great respect, if not finality by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, it must be emphasized that even decisions of administrative agencies which are declared “final” by law are not exempt from judicial review when so warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Factual findings of administrative agencies are not infallible and will be set aside when they fail the test of arbitrariness, or upon proof of gross abuse of discretion, fraud or error of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Otherwise stated, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion or any jurisdictional infirmity or error of law, the factual findings, conclusions, rulings and decisions rendered by the said Commission on matters falling within its competence shall not be interfered with by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, when it can be shown that administrative bodies grossly misappreciated evidence of such nature as to compel a contrary conclusion, this Court will not hesitate to reverse their factual findings.<br><br>In this case, the Court finds that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> acted whimsically, capriciously and without any rational basis in upholding the factual findings of the First Division which disregarded manifest errors in tabulation. It was remiss in its duties to properly resolve the Motion for Reconsideration before it and it should have given a close scrutiny of the evidence on hand. Its conclusion that only photocopies of the documents involved are in evidence is contradicted by the records. Its observation that De Guzman failed to present competent evidence to support his allegations is a glaringly erroneous estimation of the evidence presented. Admittedly, De Guzman attached only photocopies of documents in his counter-protest, but he formally offered certified true copies thereof in the presentation of his evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As such, the COMELEC should have delved into the alleged manifest errors of tabulation.<br><br>The Court notes that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> itself noted that it “can, and should, only consider the documents formally offered in evidence” but it entirely glossed over the formally offered certified true copies of the Election Returns and Statement of Votes by Precinct, as well as the COMELEC’s own Minutes of the Proceedings in the Revision and the Revision Reports of the contested precincts which confirms the manifest errors committed in the counting of votes. Needless to stress, in an election contest where the correctness of the number of votes is involved, the best and most conclusive evidence are the ballots themselves; where the ballots can not be produced or are not available, the election returns would be the best evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>For Precinct No. 10A1 of Brgy. Gais-Guipe, Dasol, the Election Returns shows that De Guzman obtained 70 votes, while Pulido got 36 votes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> but the Statement of Votes by Precinct indicates only 17 votes credited to De Guzman as against the 36 votes of Pulido.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Revision Report for Precinct No. 10A1 of Brgy. Gais-Guipe, Dasol confirms that De Guzman obtained 70 votes, to wit:<br><br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">DATA PER ELECTION RETURN:</td> <td width="23%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Total Number of Registered Voters</td> <td>199</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Total Number of Voters who Actually Voted</td> <td>185</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Votes obtained by Protestant</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;36</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><b>Votes obtained by Protestee</b></td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>70</b></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Others</td> <td>150</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">PER PHYSICAL COUNT:</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="62%">Votes for Protestant</td> <td width="15%">25 + 11 =</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;36</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>Votes for Protestee</b></td> <td> <b>59 + 11 =</b> </td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>70</b></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Others</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;62</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Blank</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;28</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Stray </td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">TOTAL</td> <td>196 (-11 = 185)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Thus, 53 votes were not credited to De Guzman.<br><br>For Precinct No. 27A1/27A2 of Brgy.

There is no showing that the 7 rejected ballots as having been written-by-one falls under the exception. The handwriting of the assistor in the 7 rejected ballots is the same as that appearing in the Minutes of Voting. All of the 7 assailed ballots were cast in favor of De Guzman. Consequently, four ballots should be appreciated in his favor it being reasonably presumed that the identically written ballots were prepared by the assistor, not only for three illiterate or physically disabled voters but also for himself. Hence, added to the 38 votes, de Guzman won the election by 42 votes.<br><br>It is well to remember the basic principle that the cardinal objective of ballot appreciation is to discover and give effect to, rather than frustrate the intention of the voters, thus, every ballot shall be presumed valid unless clear and good reasons justify its rejection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Extreme caution should be observed before any ballot is invalidated and doubts in the appreciation of ballots are resolved in favor of their validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, it is a well-founded rule ensconced in our jurisprudence that laws and statutes governing election contests especially appreciation of ballots must be liberally construed to the end that the will of the electorate in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by technical infirmities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>With respect to the 37 ballots rejected as marked in seven other revised precincts, we find that petitioner has offered insufficient justification to reverse the COMELEC’s appreciation of the same.<br><br>All told, we rule in favor of petitioner De Guzman.

When the sovereignty of the people expressed thru the ballot is at stake, it is not enough for this Court to make a statement but it should do everything to have that sovereignty obeyed by all.

Corollarily, laws and statutes governing election contests especially the appreciation of ballots must be liberally construed to the end that the will of the electorate in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by technical infirmities. </blockquote> WHEREFORE, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the assailed Resolution of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, dated September 11, 2003, in EPC No. 2001-11 affirming the Resolution of the COMELEC First Division, dated April 2, 2003, which annulled the proclamation of petitioner Ariel G.
