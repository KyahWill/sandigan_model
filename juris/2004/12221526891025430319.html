				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Admitting she killed her husband, appellant anchors her prayer for acquittal on a novel theory -- the “battered woman syndrome” (BWS), which allegedly constitutes self-defense.&nbsp; Under the proven facts, however, she is not entitled to complete exoneration because there was no unlawful aggression -- no immediate and unexpected attack on her by her batterer-husband at the time she shot him.<br><br>Absent unlawful aggression, there can be no self-defense, complete or incomplete.<br><br>But all is not lost.&nbsp; The severe beatings repeatedly inflicted on appellant constituted a form of cumulative provocation that broke down her psychological resistance and self-control.&nbsp; This “psychological paralysis” she suffered diminished her will power, thereby entitling her to the mitigating factor under paragraphs 9 and 10 of Article 13 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>In addition, appellant should also be credited with the extenuating circumstance of having acted upon an impulse so powerful as to have naturally produced passion and obfuscation.&nbsp; The acute battering she suffered that fatal night in the hands of her batterer-spouse, in spite of the fact that she was eight months pregnant with their child, overwhelmed her and put her in the aforesaid emotional and mental state, which overcame her reason and impelled her to vindicate her life and her unborn child’s.<br><br>Considering the presence of these two mitigating circumstances arising from BWS, as well as the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, she may now apply for and be released from custody on parole, because she has already served the minimum period of her penalty while under detention during the pendency of this case.<br><center><br><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>For automatic review before this Court is the September 25, 1998 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Ormoc City (Branch 35) in Criminal Case No. 5016-0, finding Marivic Genosa guilty beyond reasonable doubt of parricide.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, after all the foregoing being duly considered, the Court finds the accused, Marivic Genosa y Isidro, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide as provided under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code as restored by Sec. 5, RA No. 7659, and after finding treachery as a generic aggravating circumstance and none of mitigating circumstance, hereby sentences the accused with the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>“The Court likewise penalizes the accused to pay the heirs of the deceased the sum of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00), Philippine currency as indemnity and another sum of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00), Philippine currency as moral damages.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> charged appellant with parricide as follows:<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 15<sup>th</sup> day of November 1995, at Barangay Bilwang, Municipality of Isabel, Province of Leyte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, hit and wound one BEN GENOSA, her legitimate husband, with the use of a hard deadly weapon, which the accused had provided herself for the purpose, [causing] the following wounds, to wit:<br><blockquote>‘Cadaveric spasm.<br><br>‘Body on the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of decomposition.<br><br>‘Face, black, blownup &amp;

Thereafter, they lived with the parents of Ben in their house at Isabel, Leyte.&nbsp; For a time, Ben’s younger brother, Alex, and his wife lived with them too.&nbsp; Sometime in 1995, however, appellant and Ben rented from Steban Matiga a house at Barangay Bilwang, Isabel, Leyte where they lived with their two children, namely: John Marben and Earl Pierre.<br><br>“On November 15, 1995, Ben and Arturo Basobas went to a cockfight after receiving their salary.&nbsp; They each had two (2) bottles of beer before heading home.&nbsp; Arturo would pass Ben’s house before reaching his.&nbsp; When they arrived at the house of Ben, he found out that appellant had gone to Isabel, Leyte to look for him.&nbsp; Ben went inside his house, while Arturo went to a store across it, waiting until 9:00 in the evening for the masiao runner to place a bet.&nbsp; Arturo did not see appellant arrive but on his way home passing the side of the Genosas’ rented house, he heard her say ‘I won’t hesitate to kill you’ to which Ben replied ‘Why kill me when I am innocent?’&nbsp; That was the last time Arturo saw Ben alive. Arturo also noticed that since then, the Genosas’ rented house appeared uninhabited and was always closed.<br><br>“On November 16, 1995, appellant asked Erlinda Paderog, her close friend and neighbor living about fifty (50) meters from her house, to look after her pig because she was going to Cebu for a pregnancy check-up.&nbsp; Appellant likewise asked Erlinda to sell her motorcycle to their neighbor Ronnie Dayandayan who unfortunately had no money to buy it.<br><br>“That same day, about 12:15 in the afternoon, Joseph Valida was waiting for a bus going to Ormoc when he saw appellant going out of their house with her two kids in tow, each one carrying a bag, locking the gate and taking her children to the waiting area where he was.&nbsp; Joseph lived about fifty (50) meters behind the Genosas’ rented house.&nbsp; Joseph, appellant and her children rode the same bus to Ormoc.&nbsp; They had no conversation as Joseph noticed that appellant did not want to talk to him.<br><br>“On November 18, 1995, the neighbors of Steban Matiga told him about the foul odor emanating from his house being rented by Ben and appellant.&nbsp; Steban went there to find out the cause of the stench but the house was locked from the inside.&nbsp; Since he did not have a duplicate key with him, Steban destroyed the gate padlock with a borrowed steel saw.&nbsp; He was able to get inside through the kitchen door but only after destroying a window to reach a hook that locked it.&nbsp; Alone, Steban went inside the unlocked bedroom where the offensive smell was coming from.&nbsp; There, he saw the lifeless body of Ben lying on his side on the bed covered with a blanket.&nbsp; He was only in his briefs with injuries at the back of his head.&nbsp; Seeing this, Steban went out of the house and sent word to the mother of Ben about his son’s misfortune.&nbsp; Later that day, Iluminada Genosa, the mother of Ben, identified the dead body as that of [her] son.<br><br>“Meanwhile, in the morning of the same day, SPO3 Leo Acodesin, then assigned at the police station at Isabel, Leyte, received a report regarding the foul smell at the Genosas’ rented house.&nbsp; Together with SPO1 Millares, SPO1 Colon, and Dr. Refelina Cerillo, SPO3 Acodesin proceeded to the house and went inside the bedroom where they found the dead body of Ben lying on his side wrapped with a bedsheet.&nbsp; There was blood at the nape of Ben who only had his briefs on.&nbsp; SPO3 Acodesin found in one corner at the side of an aparador a metal pipe about two (2) meters from where Ben was, leaning against a wall.&nbsp; The metal pipe measured three (3) feet and six (6) inches long with a diameter of one and half (1 1/2) inches.&nbsp; It had an open end without a stop valve with a red stain at one end.&nbsp; The bedroom was not in disarray.<br><br>“About 10:00 that same morning, the cadaver of Ben, because of its stench, had to be taken outside at the back of the house before the postmortem examination was conducted by Dr. Cerillo in the presence of the police.&nbsp; A municipal health officer at Isabel, Leyte responsible for medico-legal cases, Dr. Cerillo found that Ben had been dead for two to three days and his body was already decomposing.&nbsp; The postmortem examination of Dr. Cerillo yielded the findings quoted in the Information for parricide later filed against appellant.&nbsp; She concluded that the cause of Ben’s death was ‘cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to severe intracranial hemorrhage due to a depressed fracture of the occipital [bone].’<br><br>“<b>Appellant admitted killing Ben.</b> She testified that going home after work on November 15, 1995, she got worried that her husband who was not home yet might have gone gambling since it was a payday.&nbsp; With her cousin Ecel Araño, appellant went to look for Ben at the marketplace and taverns at Isabel, Leyte but did not find him there.&nbsp; They found Ben drunk upon their return at the Genosas’ house.&nbsp; Ecel went home despite appellant’s request for her to sleep in their house.<br><br>“Then, Ben purportedly nagged appellant for following him, even challenging her to a fight.&nbsp; She allegedly ignored him and instead attended to their children who were doing their homework.&nbsp; Apparently disappointed with her reaction, Ben switched off the light and, with the use of a chopping knife, cut the television antenna or wire to keep her from watching television.&nbsp; According to appellant, Ben was about to attack her so she ran to the bedroom, but he got hold of her hands and whirled her around.&nbsp; She fell on the side of the bed and screamed for help.&nbsp; Ben left.&nbsp; At this point, appellant packed his clothes because she wanted him to leave.&nbsp; Seeing his packed clothes upon his return home, Ben allegedly flew into a rage, dragged appellant outside of the bedroom towards a drawer holding her by the neck, and told her ‘You might as well be killed so nobody would nag me.’&nbsp; Appellant testified that she was aware that there was a gun inside the drawer but since Ben did not have the key to it, he got a three-inch long blade cutter from his wallet.&nbsp; She however, ‘smashed’ the arm of Ben with a pipe, causing him to drop the blade and his wallet.&nbsp; Appellant then ‘smashed’ Ben at his nape with the pipe as he was about to pick up the blade and his wallet.&nbsp; She thereafter ran inside the bedroom.<br><br>“Appellant, however, insisted that she ended the life of her husband by shooting him.&nbsp; She supposedly ‘distorted’ the drawer where the gun was and shot Ben.&nbsp; He did not die on the spot, though, but in the bedroom.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]&nbsp; </sup>(Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><center><b><i><u>Version of the Defense</u></i></b><br></center><br>Appellant relates her version of the facts in this manner:<br><blockquote>“1. Marivic and Ben Genosa were allegedly married on November 19, 1983.&nbsp; Prior to her marriage, Marivic had graduated from San Carlos, Cebu City, obtaining a degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, and was working, at the time of her husband’s death, as a Secretary to the Port Managers in Ormoc City.&nbsp; The couple had three (3) children: John Marben, Earl Pierre and Marie Bianca.<br><br>“2. Marivic and Ben had known each other since elementary school; they were neighbors in Bilwang; they were classmates; and they were third degree cousins.&nbsp; Both sets of parents were against their relationship, but Ben was persistent and tried to stop other suitors from courting her.&nbsp; Their closeness developed as he was her constant partner at fiestas.<br><br>“3. After their marriage, they lived first in the home of Ben’s parents, together with Ben’s brother, Alex, in Isabel, Leyte.&nbsp; In the first year of marriage, Marivic and Ben ‘lived happily’.&nbsp; But apparently, soon thereafter, the couple would quarrel often and their fights would become violent. <br><br>“4. Ben’s brother, Alex, testified for the prosecution that he could not remember when Ben and Marivic married.&nbsp; He said that when Ben and Marivic quarreled, <u>generally when Ben would come home drunk</u>, Marivic would inflict injuries on him.&nbsp; He said that in one incident in 1993 he saw Marivic holding a kitchen knife after Ben had shouted for help as his left hand was covered with blood.&nbsp; Marivic left the house but after a week, she returned apparently having asked for Ben’s forgiveness.&nbsp; In another incident in May 22, 1994, early morning, Alex and his father apparently rushed to Ben’s aid again and saw blood from Ben’s forehead and Marivic holding an empty bottle.&nbsp; Ben and Marivic reconciled after Marivic had apparently again asked for Ben’s forgiveness.<br><br>“Mrs. Iluminada Genosa, Marivic’s mother-in-law, testified too, saying that Ben and Marivic married in ‘1986 or 1985 more or less here in Fatima, Ormoc City.’&nbsp; She said as the marriage went along, Marivic became ‘already very demanding.&nbsp; Mrs. Iluminada Genosa said that after the birth of Marivic’s two sons, there were ‘three (3) misunderstandings.’&nbsp; The first was when Marivic stabbed Ben with a table knife through his left arm; the second incident was on November 15, 1994, when Marivic struck Ben <u>on the forehead</u> ‘using a sharp instrument until the eye was also affected.&nbsp; It was wounded and also the ear’ and her husband went to Ben to help; and the third incident was in 1995 when the couple had already transferred to the house in Bilwang and she saw that Ben’s hand was plastered as ‘<u>the bone cracked.</u>’<br><br>“Both mother and son claimed they brought Ben to a Pasar clinic for medical intervention.<br><br>“5. Arturo Basobas, a co-worker of Ben, testified that on November 15, 1995 ‘After we collected our salary, we went to the cock-fighting place of ISCO.’&nbsp; They stayed there for three (3) hours, after which they went to ‘Uniloks’ and drank beer – allegedly only two (2) bottles each.&nbsp; After drinking they bought barbeque and went to the Genosa residence.&nbsp; <u>Marivic was not there</u>.&nbsp; He stayed a while talking with Ben, after which he went across the road to wait ‘for the runner and the usher of the masiao game because during that time, the hearing on masiao numbers was rampant.&nbsp; I was waiting for the ushers and runners so that I can place my bet.’&nbsp; On his way home at about 9:00 in the evening, he heard the Genosas arguing.&nbsp; They were quarreling loudly.&nbsp; Outside their house was one ‘Fredo’ who is used by Ben to feed his fighting cocks.&nbsp; Basobas’ testimony on the root of the quarrel, conveniently overheard by him was Marivic saying ‘I will never hesitate to kill you’, whilst Ben replied ‘Why kill me when I am innocent.’&nbsp; Basobas thought they were joking.<br><br>“He did not hear them quarreling while he was across the road from the Genosa residence.&nbsp; Basobas admitted that he and Ben were always at the cockpits every Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; He claims that he once told Ben ‘before when he was stricken with a bottle by Marivic Genosa’ that he should leave her and that Ben would always take her back after she would leave him ‘so many times’.<br><br>“Basobas could not remember when Marivic had hit Ben, but it was a long time that they had been quarreling.&nbsp; He said Ben ‘even had a wound’ on the right forehead.&nbsp; He had known the couple for only one (1) year.<br><br>“6. Marivic testified that after the first year of marriage, Ben became cruel to her and was a habitual drinker.&nbsp; She said he provoked her, he would slap her, sometimes he would pin her down on the bed, and sometimes beat her.<br><br>“These incidents happened several times and she would often run home to her parents, but Ben would follow her and seek her out, promising to change and would ask for her forgiveness.&nbsp; She said after she would be beaten, she would seek medical help from Dr. Dino Caing, Dr. Lucero and Dra. Cerillo.&nbsp; These doctors would enter the injuries inflicted upon her by Ben into their reports.&nbsp; Marivic said Ben would beat her or quarrel with her every time he was drunk, at least three times a week.<br><br>“7. In her defense, witnesses who were not so closely related to Marivic, testified as to the abuse and violence she received at the hands of Ben.<br><blockquote>‘7.1. Mr. Joe Barrientos, a fisherman, who was a [neighbor] of the Genosas, testified that on November 15, 1995, he overheard a quarrel between Ben and Marivic.&nbsp; Marivic was shouting for help and through the open jalousies, he saw the spouses ‘grappling with each other’.&nbsp; Ben had Marivic in a choke hold.&nbsp; He did not do anything, but had come voluntarily to testify.&nbsp; (<i>Please note this was the same night as that testified to by Arturo Busabos</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>)<br><br>‘7.2. Mr. Junnie Barrientos, also a fisherman, and the brother of Mr. Joe Barrientos, testified that he heard his neighbor Marivic shouting on the night of November 15, 1995.&nbsp; He peeped through the window of his hut which is located beside the Genosa house and saw ‘the spouses grappling with each other then Ben Genosa was holding with his both hands the neck of the accused, Marivic Genosa’.&nbsp; He said after a while, Marivic was able to extricate he[r]self and enter the room of the children.&nbsp; After that, he went back to work as he was to go fishing that evening.&nbsp; He returned at 8:00 the next morning.&nbsp; (<i>Again, please note that this was the same night as that testified to by Arturo Basobas</i>).<br><br>‘7.3. Mr. Teodoro Sarabia was a former neighbor of the Genosas while they were living in Isabel, Leyte. His house was located about fifty (50) meters from theirs.&nbsp; Marivic is his niece and he knew them to be living together for 13 or 14 years.&nbsp; He said the couple was always quarreling.&nbsp; Marivic confided in him that Ben would pawn items and then would use the money to gamble.&nbsp; One time, he went to their house and they were quarreling.&nbsp; Ben was so angry, but would be pacified ‘if somebody would come.’&nbsp; He testified that while Ben was alive ‘he used to gamble and when he became drunk, he would go to our house and he will say, ‘Teody’ because that was what he used to call me, ‘mokimas ta,’ which means ‘let’s go and look for a whore.’&nbsp; Mr. Sarabia further testified that Ben ‘would box his wife and I would see bruises and one time she ran to me, I noticed a wound (the witness pointed to his right breast) as according to her a knife was stricken to her.’&nbsp; Mr. Sarabia also said that once he saw Ben had been injured too.&nbsp; He said he voluntarily testified only that morning.<br><br>‘7.4. Miss Ecel Arano, an 18-year old student, who is a cousin of Marivic, testified that in the afternoon of November 15, 1995, Marivic went to her house and asked her help to look for Ben.&nbsp; They searched in the market place, several taverns and some other places, but could not find him.&nbsp; She accompanied Marivic home.&nbsp; Marivic wanted her to sleep with her in the Genosa house ‘because she might be battered by her husband.’&nbsp; When they got to the Genosa house at about 7:00 in the evening, Miss Arano said that ‘her husband was already there and was drunk.’&nbsp; Miss Arano knew he was drunk ‘because of his staggering walking and I can also detect his face.’&nbsp; Marivic entered the house and she heard them quarrel noisily. (Again, please note that this is the same night as that testified to by Arturo Basobas) Miss Arano testified that this was not the first time Marivic had asked her to sleep in the house as Marivic would be afraid every time her husband would come home drunk.&nbsp; At one time when she did sleep over, she was awakened at 10:00 in the evening when Ben arrived because the couple ‘were very noisy in the sala and I had heard something was broken like a vase.’&nbsp; She said Marivic ran into her room and they locked the door.&nbsp; When Ben couldn’t get in he got a chair and a knife and ‘showed us the knife through the window grill and he scared us.’&nbsp; She said that Marivic shouted for help, but no one came.&nbsp; On cross-examination, she said that when she left Marivic’s house on November 15, 1995, the couple were still quarreling.<br><br>‘7.5. Dr. Dino Caing, a physician testified that he and Marivic were co-employees at PHILPHOS, Isabel, Leyte.&nbsp; Marivic was his patient ‘many times’ and had also received treatment from other doctors.&nbsp; Dr. Caing testified that from July 6, 1989 until November 9, 1995, there were six (6) episodes of physical injuries inflicted upon Marivic.&nbsp; These injuries were reported in his Out-Patient Chart at the PHILPHOS Hospital.&nbsp; The prosecution admitted the qualifications of Dr. Caing and considered him an expert witness.’<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>‘Dr. Caing’s clinical history of the <u>tension headache and hypertention of Marivic on twenty-three (23) separate occasions</u> was marked at Exhibits ‘2’ and ‘2-B.’&nbsp; The OPD Chart of Marivic at the Philphos Clinic which reflected all the consultations made by Marivic and the six (6) incidents of physical injuries reported was marked as Exhibit ‘3.’<br><br>“On cross-examination, Dr. Caing said that he is not a psychiatrist, he could not say whether the injuries were directly related to the crime committed.&nbsp; <u>He said it is only a psychiatrist who is qualified to examine the psychological make-up of the patient, ‘whether she is capable of committing a crime or not.’</u><br><br>‘7.6 Mr. Panfilo Tero, the barangay captain in the place where the Genosas resided, testified that about two (2) months before Ben died, Marivic went to his office past 8:00 in the evening.&nbsp; She sought his help to settle or confront the Genosa couple who were experiencing ‘family troubles’.&nbsp; He told Marivic to return in the morning, but he did not hear from her again and assumed ‘that they might have settled with each other or they might have forgiven with each other.’<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center></blockquote>“Marivic said she did not provoke her husband when she got home that night it was her husband who began the provocation.&nbsp; Marivic said she was frightened that her husband would hurt her and she wanted to make sure she would deliver her baby safely.&nbsp; In fact, Marivic had to be admitted later at the Rizal Medical Centre as she was suffering from eclampsia and hypertension, and the baby was born prematurely on December 1, 1995.<br><br>“Marivic testified that during her marriage she had tried to leave her husband at least five (5) times, but that Ben would always follow her and they would reconcile.&nbsp; Marivic said that the reason why Ben was violent and abusive towards her that night was because ‘he was crazy about his recent girlfriend, Lulu x x x Rubillos.’<br><br>“On cross-examination, Marivic insisted she shot Ben with a gun; she said that he died in the bedroom; that their quarrels could be heard by anyone passing their house; that Basobas lied in his testimony; that she left for Manila the next day, November 16, 1995; that she did not bother anyone in Manila, rented herself a room, and got herself a job as a field researcher under the alias ‘Marvelous Isidro’; she did not tell anyone that she was leaving Leyte, she just wanted to have a safe delivery of her baby; and that she was arrested in San Pablo, Laguna.<br><blockquote>‘Answering questions from the Court, Marivic said that she threw the gun away; that she did not know what happened to the pipe she used to ‘smash him once’; that she was wounded by Ben on her wrist with the bolo; and that two (2) hours after she was ‘whirled’ by Ben, he kicked her ‘ass’ and dragged her towards the drawer when he saw that she had packed his things.’<br></blockquote>“9. The body of Ben Genosa was found on November 18, 1995 after an investigation was made of the foul odor emitting from the Genosa residence.&nbsp; This fact was testified to by all the prosecution witnesses and some defense witnesses during the trial.<br><br>“10. Dra. Refelina Y. Cerillo, a physician, was the Municipal Health Officer of Isabel, Leyte at the time of the incident, and among her responsibilities as such was to take charge of all medico-legal cases, such as the examination of cadavers and the autopsy of cadavers.&nbsp; <u>Dra. Cerillo is not a forensic pathologist</u>.&nbsp; She merely took the medical board exams and passed in 1986.&nbsp; She was called by the police to go to the Genosa residence and when she got there, she saw ‘some police officer and neighbor around.’&nbsp; She saw Ben Genosa, covered by a blanket, lying in a semi-prone position with his back to the door.&nbsp; He was wearing only a brief.<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“Dra. Cerillo said that ‘there is only one injury and that is the injury involving the skeletal area of the head’ which she described as a ‘fracture’.&nbsp; And that based on her examination, Ben had been dead 2 or 3 days.&nbsp; Dra. Cerillo did not testify as to <u>what</u> caused his death.<br><br>“Dra. Cerillo was not cross-examined by defense counsel.<br><br>“11. The Information, dated November 14, 1996, filed against Marivic Genosa charged her with the crime of PARRICIDE committed ‘with intent to kill, with treachery and evidence premeditation, x x x wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, hit and wound x x x her legitimate husband, with the use of a hard deadly weapon x x x which caused his death.’<br><br>“12. Trial took place on 7 and 14 April 1997, 14 May 1997, 21 July &nbsp;1997, 17, 22 and 23 September 1997, 12 November 1997, 15 and 16 December 1997, 22 May 1998, and 5 and 6 August 1998.<br><br>“13. On 23 September 1998, or only fifty (50) days from the day of the last trial date, the Hon. Fortunito L. Madrona, Presiding Judge, RTC-Branch 35, Ormoc City, rendered a JUDGMENT finding Marivic guilty ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ of the crime of parricide, and further found treachery as an aggravating circumstance, thus sentencing her to the ultimate penalty of DEATH.<br><br>“14. The case was elevated to this Honorable Court upon automatic review and, under date of 24 January 2000, Marivic’s trial lawyer, Atty. Gil Marvel P. Tabucanon, filed a Motion to Withdraw as counsel, attaching thereto, as a precautionary measure, two (2) drafts of Appellant’s Briefs he had prepared for Marivic which, for reasons of her own, were not conformed to by her.<br><br>“The Honorable Court allowed the withdrawal of Atty. Tabucanon and permitted the entry of appearance of undersigned counsel.<br><br>“15. Without the knowledge of counsel, Marivic Genosa wrote a letter dated 20 January 2000, to the Chief Justice, coursing the same through Atty. Teresita G. Dimaisip, Deputy Clerk of Court of Chief Judicial Records Office, wherein she submitted her ‘Brief without counsels’ to the Court.<br><br>“This letter was stamp-received by the Honorable Court on 4 February 2000.<br><br>“16. In the meantime, under date of 17 February 2000, and stamp-received by the Honorable Court on 19 February 2000, undersigned counsel filed an URGENT OMNIBUS MOTION praying that the Honorable Court allow the exhumation of Ben Genosa and the re-examination of the cause of his death; allow the examination of Marivic Genosa by qualified psychologists and psychiatrists to determine her state of mind at the time she killed her husband; and finally, to allow a partial re-opening of the case <u><i>a quo</i></u> to take the testimony of said psychologists and psychiatrists.<br><br><u>“Attached to the URGENT OMNIBUS MOTION was a letter of Dr. Raquel Fortun, then the only qualified forensic pathologist in the country, who opined that the description of the death wound (as culled from the post-mortem findings, Exhibit ‘A’) is more akin to a gunshot wound than a beating with a lead pipe</u>.<br><br>“17. In a RESOLUTION dated 29 September 2000, the Honorable Court partly granted Marivic’s URGENT OMNIBUS MOTION and remanded the case ‘to the trial court for the reception of expert psychological and/or psychiatric opinion on the ‘battered woman syndrome’ plea, within ninety (90) days from notice, and, thereafter to forthwith report to this Court the proceedings taken, together with the copies of the TSN and relevant documentary evidence, if any, submitted.’<br><br>“18. On 15 January 2001, Dra. Natividad A. Dayan appeared and testified before the Hon. Fortunito L. Madrona, RTC-Branch 35, Ormoc City.<br><br>“Immediately before Dra. Dayan was sworn, the Court <u><i>a quo</i></u> asked if she had interviewed Marivic Genosa.&nbsp; Dra. Dayan informed the Court that interviews were done at the Penal Institution in 1999, but that the clinical interviews and psychological assessment were done at her clinic.<br><br>“Dra. Dayan testified that she has been a clinical psychologist for twenty (20) years with her own private clinic and connected presently to the De La Salle University as a professor.&nbsp; Before this, she was the Head of the Psychology Department of the Assumption College; a member of the faculty of Psychology at the Ateneo de Manila University and St. Joseph’s College; and was the counseling psychologist of the National Defense College.&nbsp; She has an AB in Psychology from the University of the Philippines, a Master of Arts in Clinical [Counseling], Psychology from the Ateneo, and a PhD from the U.P.&nbsp; She was the past president of the Psychological Association of the Philippines and is a member of the American Psychological Association.&nbsp; She is the secretary of the International Council of Psychologists from about 68 countries; a member of the Forensic Psychology Association; and a member of the ASEAN [Counseling] Association.&nbsp; She is actively involved with the Philippine Judicial Academy, recently lecturing on the socio-demographic and psychological profile of families involved in domestic violence and nullity cases.&nbsp; She was with the Davide Commission doing research about Military Psychology.&nbsp; She has written a book entitled ‘Energy Global Psychology’ (together with Drs. Allan Tan and Allan Bernardo).&nbsp; The Genosa case is the first time she has testified as an expert on battered women as this is the first case of that nature.<br><br>“Dra. Dayan testified that for the research she conducted, on the socio-demographic and psychological profile of families involved in domestic violence, and nullity cases, she looked at about 500 cases over a period of ten (10) years and discovered that ‘there are lots of variables that cause all of this marital conflicts, from domestic violence to infidelity, to psychiatric disorder.’<br><br>“Dra.

Dayan said that the batterer, just like the battered woman, ‘also has a very low opinion of himself.&nbsp; But then emerges to have superiority complex and it comes out as being very arrogant, very hostile, very aggressive and very angry.&nbsp; They also had (sic) a very low tolerance for frustrations.&nbsp; A lot of times they are involved in vices like gambling, drinking and drugs.&nbsp; And they become violent.’&nbsp; The batterer also usually comes from a dysfunctional family which over-pampers them and makes them feel entitled to do anything. Also, they see often how their parents abused each other so ‘there is a lot of modeling of aggression in the family.’<br><br>“Dra. Dayan testified that there are a lot of reasons why a battered woman does <u>not</u> leave her husband: poverty, self-blame and guilt that she provoked the violence, the cycle itself which makes her hope her husband will change, the belief in her obligations to keep the family intact at all costs for the sake of the children.<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>“Dra. Dayan said that abused wives react differently to the violence: some leave the house, or lock themselves in another room, or sometimes try to fight back triggering ‘physical violence on both of them.’&nbsp; She said that in a ‘normal marital relationship,’ abuses also happen, but these are ‘not consistent, not chronic, are not happening day in [and] day out.’&nbsp; In an ‘abnormal marital relationship,’ the abuse occurs day in and day out, is long lasting and ‘even would cause hospitalization on the victim and even death on the victim.’<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>“Dra.

On 9 February 2001, Dr. Alfredo Pajarillo, a physician, who has since passed away, appeared and testified before RTC-Branch 35, Ormoc City.<br><br>“Dr. Pajarillo was a Diplomate of the Philippine Board of Psychiatry; a Fellow of the Philippine Board of Psychiatry and a Fellow of the Philippine Psychiatry Association.&nbsp; He was in the practice of psychiatry for thirty-eight (38) years.&nbsp; Prior to being in private practice, he was connected with the Veterans Memorial Medical Centre where he gained his training on psychiatry and neurology.&nbsp; After that, he was called to active duty in the Armed Forces of the Philippines, assigned to the V. Luna Medical Center for twenty six (26) years.&nbsp; Prior to his retirement from government service, he obtained the rank of Brigadier General.&nbsp; He obtained his medical degree from the University of Santo Tomas.&nbsp; He was also a member of the World Association of Military Surgeons; the Quezon City Medical Society; the Cagayan Medical Society; and the Philippine Association of Military Surgeons.<br><br>“He authored ‘The Comparative Analysis of Nervous Breakdown in the Philippine Military Academy from the Period 1954 – 1978’ which was presented twice in international congresses.&nbsp; He also authored ‘The Mental Health of the Armed Forces of the Philippines 2000’, which was likewise published internationally and locally.&nbsp; He had a medical textbook published on the use of Prasepam on a Parke-Davis grant; was the first to use Enanthate (siquiline), on an E.R. Squibb grant; and he published the use of the drug Zopiclom in 1985-86.<br><br>“Dr. Pajarillo explained that psychiatry deals with the functional disorder of the mind and neurology deals with the ailment of the brain and spinal cord enlarged.&nbsp; Psychology, on the other hand, is a bachelor degree and a doctorate degree; while one has to finish medicine to become a specialist in psychiatry.<br><br>“Even only in his 7th year as a resident in V. Luna Medical Centre, Dr. Pajarillo had already encountered a suit involving violent family relations, and testified in a case in 1964.&nbsp; In the Armed Forces of the Philippines, violent family disputes abound, and he has seen probably ten to twenty thousand cases.&nbsp; In those days, the primordial intention of therapy was reconciliation.&nbsp; As a result of his experience with domestic violence cases, he became a consultant of the Battered Woman Office in Quezon City under Atty. Nenita Deproza.<br><br>“As such consultant, he had seen around forty (40) cases of severe domestic violence, where there is physical abuse: such as slapping, pushing, verbal abuse, battering and boxing a woman even to an unconscious state such that the woman is sometimes confined.&nbsp; The affliction of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ‘depends on the vulnerability of the victim.’&nbsp; Dr. Pajarillo said that if the victim is not very healthy, perhaps one episode of violence may induce the disorder; if the psychological stamina and physiologic constitutional stamina of the victim is stronger, ‘it will take more repetitive trauma to precipitate the post-traumatic stress disorder and this x x x is very dangerous.’<br><br>“In psychiatry, the post-traumatic stress disorder is incorporated under the ‘anxiety neurosis or neurologic anxcietism.’&nbsp; It is produced by ‘overwhelming brutality, trauma.’<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“Dr. Pajarillo explained that with ‘neurotic anxiety’, the victim relives the beating or trauma as if it were real, although she is not actually being beaten at that time.&nbsp; She thinks ‘of nothing but the suffering.’<br><center><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>“A woman who suffers battery has a tendency to become neurotic, her emotional tone is unstable, and she is irritable and restless.&nbsp; She tends to become hard-headed and persistent.&nbsp; She has higher sensitivity and her ‘self-world’ is damaged.<br><br>“Dr. Pajarillo said that an abnormal family background relates to an individual’s illness, such as the deprivation of the continuous care and love of the parents.&nbsp; As to the batterer, he normally ‘internalizes what is around him within the environment.’&nbsp; And it becomes his own personality.&nbsp; He is very competitive; he is aiming high all the time; he is so macho; he shows his strong façade ‘but in it there are doubts in himself and prone to act without thinking.’<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“Dr. Pajarillo emphasized that ‘even though without the presence of the precipator (sic) or the one who administered the battering, that re-experiencing of the trauma occurred (sic) because the individual cannot control it.&nbsp; It will just come up in her mind or in his mind.’<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“Dr. Pajarillo said that a woman suffering post traumatic stress disorder try to defend themselves, and ‘primarily with knives.&nbsp; Usually pointed weapons or any weapon that is available in the immediate surrounding or in a hospital x x x because that abound in the household.’&nbsp; He said a victim resorts to weapons when she has ‘reached the lowest rock bottom of her life and there is no other recourse left on her but to act decisively.’<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“Dr. Pajarillo testified that he met Marivic Genosa in his office in an interview he conducted for two (2) hours and seventeen (17) minutes.&nbsp; He used the psychological evaluation and social case studies as a help in forming his diagnosis.&nbsp; He came out with a Psychiatric Report, dated 22 January 2001.<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“On cross-examination by the private prosecutor, Dr. Pajarillo said that at the time she killed her husband Marivic’c mental condition was that she was ‘re-experiencing the trauma.’&nbsp; <u>He said ‘that we are trying to explain scientifically that the re-experiencing of the trauma is not controlled by Marivic.&nbsp; It will just come in flashes and probably at that point in time that things happened when the re-experiencing of the trauma flashed in her mind.’</u>&nbsp; At the time he interviewed Marivic ‘she was more subdued, she was not super alert anymore x x x she is mentally stress (sic) because of the predicament she is involved.’<br><center><br>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x<br><br></center>“20.

The trial court gravely erred in promulgating an obviously hasty decision without reflecting on the evidence adduced as to self-defense.<br><br>“2. The trial court gravely erred in finding as a fact that Ben and Marivic Genosa were legally married and that she was therefore liable for parricide.<br><br>“3. The trial court gravely erred finding the cause of death to be by beating with a pipe.<br><br>“4. The trial court gravely erred in ignoring and disregarding evidence adduced from impartial and unbiased witnesses that Ben Genosa was a drunk, a gambler, a womanizer and wife-beater; and further gravely erred in concluding that Ben Genosa was a battered husband.<br><br>“5. The trial court gravely erred in not requiring testimony from the children of Marivic Genosa.<br><br>“6. The trial court gravely erred in concluding that Marivic’s flight to Manila and her subsequent apologies were indicia of guilt, instead of a clear attempt to save the life of her unborn child.<br><br>“7. The trial court gravely erred in concluding that there was an aggravating circumstance of treachery.<br><br>“8. The trial court gravely erred in refusing to re-evaluate the traditional elements in determining the existence of self-defense and defense of foetus in this case, thereby erroneously convicting Marivic Genosa of the crime of parricide and condemning her to the ultimate penalty of death.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>In the main, the following are the essential legal issues: (1) whether appellant acted in self-defense and in defense of her fetus; and (2) whether treachery attended the killing of Ben Genosa.<br><center><br><u><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><center><br><u><b>Collateral Factual Issues</b></u><br></center><br>The first six assigned errors raised by appellant are factual in nature, if not collateral to the resolution of the principal issues.&nbsp; As consistently held by this Court, the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any showing that the trial judge gravely abused his discretion or overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied material facts or circumstances of weight and substance that could affect the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In appellant’s first six assigned items, we find no grave abuse of discretion, reversible error or misappreciation of material facts that would reverse or modify the trial court’s disposition of the case.&nbsp; In any event, we will now briefly dispose of these alleged errors of the trial court.<br><br><i>First</i>, we do not agree that the lower court promulgated “an obviously hasty decision without reflecting on the evidence adduced as to self-defense.”&nbsp; We note that in his 17-page Decision, Judge Fortunito L. Madrona summarized the testimonies of both the prosecution and the defense witnesses and -- on the basis of those and of the documentary evidence on record -- made his evaluation, findings and conclusions.&nbsp; He wrote a 3-page discourse assessing the testimony and the self-defense theory of the accused.&nbsp; While she, or even this Court, may not agree with the trial judge’s conclusions, we cannot peremptorily conclude, absent substantial evidence, that he failed <i>to reflect</i> on the evidence presented. <br><br>Neither do we find the appealed Decision to have been made in an “obviously hasty” manner.&nbsp; The Information had been filed with the lower court on November 14, 1996.&nbsp; Thereafter, trial began and at least 13 hearings were held for over a year.&nbsp; It took the trial judge about two months from the conclusion of trial to promulgate his judgment.&nbsp; That he conducted the trial and resolved the case with dispatch should not be taken against him, much less used to condemn him for being unduly hasty.&nbsp; If at all, the dispatch with which he handled the case should be lauded.&nbsp; In any case, we find his actions in substantial compliance with his constitutional obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, the lower court did not err in finding as a fact that Ben Genosa and appellant had been legally married, despite the non-presentation of their marriage contract.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Malabago</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>“The key element in parricide is the relationship of the offender with the victim.&nbsp; In the case of parricide of a spouse, the best proof of the relationship between the accused and the deceased is the marriage certificate.&nbsp; In the absence of a marriage certificate, however, oral evidence of the fact of marriage may be considered by the trial court if such proof is not objected to.”<br></blockquote>Two of the prosecution witnesses -- namely, the mother and the brother of appellant’s deceased spouse -- attested in court that Ben had been married to Marivic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The defense raised no objection to these testimonies.&nbsp; Moreover, during her direct examination, appellant herself made a judicial admission of her marriage to Ben.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Axiomatic is the rule that a judicial admission is conclusive upon the party making it, except only when there is a showing that (1) the admission was made through a palpable mistake, or (2) no admission was in fact made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Other than merely attacking the non-presentation of the marriage contract, the defense offered no proof that the admission made by appellant in court as to the fact of her marriage to the deceased was made through a palpable mistake. <br><br><i>Third</i>, under the circumstances of this case, the specific or direct cause of Ben’s death -- whether by a gunshot or by beating with a pipe -- has no legal consequence.&nbsp; As the Court elucidated in its September 29, 2000 Resolution, “[c]onsidering that the appellant has admitted the fact of killing her husband and the acts of hitting his nape with a metal pipe and of shooting him at the back of his head, the Court believes that exhumation is unnecessary, if not immaterial, to determine <i>which of said acts actually caused the victim’s death</i>.”&nbsp; Determining which of these admitted acts caused the death is not dispositive of the guilt or defense of appellant.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, we cannot fault the trial court for not fully appreciating evidence that Ben was a drunk, gambler, womanizer and wife-beater.&nbsp; Until this case came to us for automatic review, appellant had not raised the novel defense of “battered woman syndrome,” for which such evidence may have been relevant.&nbsp; Her theory of self-defense was then the crucial issue before the trial court.&nbsp; As will be discussed shortly, the legal requisites of self-defense under prevailing jurisprudence ostensibly appear inconsistent with the surrounding facts that led to the death of the victim.&nbsp; Hence, his personal character, especially his past behavior, did not constitute vital evidence at the time.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>, the trial court surely committed no error in not requiring testimony from appellant’s children.&nbsp; As correctly elucidated by the solicitor general, all criminal actions are prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor, in whom lies the discretion to determine which witnesses and evidence are necessary to present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As the former further points out, neither the trial court nor the prosecution prevented appellant from presenting her children as witnesses.&nbsp; Thus, she cannot now fault the lower court for not requiring them to testify.<br><br><i>Finally</i>, merely collateral or corroborative is the matter of whether the flight of Marivic to Manila and her subsequent apologies to her brother-in-law are indicia of her guilt or are attempts to save the life of her unborn child.&nbsp; Any reversible error as to the trial court’s appreciation of these circumstances has little bearing on the final resolution of the case.<br><center><br><b><u>First Legal Issue:<br><i>Self-Defense and Defense of a Fetus</i></u></b><br></center><br>Appellant admits killing Ben Genosa but, to avoid criminal liability, invokes self-defense and/or defense of her unborn child.&nbsp; When the accused admits killing the victim, it is incumbent upon her to prove any claimed justifying circumstance by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Well-settled is the rule that in criminal cases, self-defense (and similarly, defense of a stranger or third person) shifts the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]<br><br></sup><u><b><i>The Battered Woman Syndrome</i></b></u><br><br>In claiming self-defense, appellant raises the novel theory of the battered woman syndrome.&nbsp; While new in Philippine jurisprudence, the concept has been recognized in foreign jurisdictions as a form of self-defense or, at the least, incomplete self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> By appreciating evidence that a victim or defendant is afflicted with the syndrome, foreign courts convey their “understanding of the justifiably fearful state of mind of a person who has been cyclically abused and controlled over a period of time.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>A battered woman has been defined as a woman “who is repeatedly subjected to any forceful physical or psychological behavior by a man in order to coerce her to do something he wants her to do without concern for her rights.&nbsp; Battered women include wives or women in any form of intimate relationship with men.&nbsp; Furthermore, in order to be classified as a battered woman, the couple must go through the battering cycle at least twice.&nbsp; Any woman may find herself in an abusive relationship with a man once.&nbsp; If it occurs a second time, and she remains in the situation, she is defined as a battered woman.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Battered women exhibit common personality traits, such as low self-esteem, traditional beliefs about the home, the family and the female sex role; emotional dependence upon the dominant male; the tendency to accept responsibility for the batterer’s actions; and false hopes that the relationship will improve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>More graphically, the battered woman syndrome is characterized by the so-called “cycle of violence,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which has three phases: (1) the tension-building phase; (2) the acute battering incident; and (3) the tranquil, loving (or, at least, nonviolent) phase.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>During the <b>tension-building phase</b>, minor battering occurs -- it could be verbal or slight physical abuse or another form of hostile behavior.&nbsp; The woman usually tries to pacify the batterer through a show of kind, nurturing behavior; or by simply staying out of his way.&nbsp; What actually happens is that she allows herself to be abused in ways that, to her, are comparatively minor.&nbsp; All she wants is to prevent the escalation of the violence exhibited by the batterer.&nbsp; This wish, however, proves to be double-edged, because her “placatory” and passive behavior legitimizes his belief that he has the right to abuse her in the first place.<br><br>However, the techniques adopted by the woman in her effort to placate him are not usually successful, and the verbal and/or physical abuse worsens.&nbsp; Each partner senses the imminent loss of control and the growing tension and despair.&nbsp; Exhausted from the persistent stress, the battered woman soon withdraws emotionally.&nbsp; But the more she becomes emotionally unavailable, the more the batterer becomes angry, oppressive and abusive.&nbsp; Often, at some unpredictable point, the violence “spirals out of control” and leads to an acute battering incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The <b>acute battering incident</b> is said to be characterized by brutality, destructiveness and, sometimes, death.&nbsp; The battered woman deems this incident as unpredictable, yet also inevitable.&nbsp; During this phase, she has no control; only the batterer may put an end to the violence.&nbsp; Its nature can be as unpredictable as the time of its explosion, and so are his reasons for ending it.&nbsp; The battered woman usually realizes that she cannot reason with him, and that resistance would only exacerbate her condition.<br><br>At this stage, she has a sense of detachment from the attack and the terrible pain, although she may later clearly remember every detail.&nbsp; Her apparent passivity in the face of acute violence may be rationalized thus: the batterer is almost always much stronger physically, and she knows from her past painful experience that it is futile to fight back.&nbsp; Acute battering incidents are often very savage and out of control, such that innocent bystanders or intervenors are likely to get hurt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The final phase of the cycle of violence begins when the acute battering incident ends.&nbsp; During this <b>tranquil period</b>, the couple experience profound relief.&nbsp; On the one hand, the batterer may show a tender and nurturing behavior towards his partner.&nbsp; He knows that he has been viciously cruel and tries to make up for it, begging for her forgiveness and promising never to beat her again.&nbsp; On the other hand, the battered woman also tries to convince herself that the battery will never happen again; that her partner will change for the better; and that this “good, gentle and caring man” is the real person whom she loves.<br><br>A battered woman usually believes that she is the sole anchor of the emotional stability of the batterer.&nbsp; Sensing his isolation and despair, she feels responsible for his well-being.&nbsp; The truth, though, is that the chances of his reforming, or seeking or receiving professional help, are very slim, especially if she remains with him.&nbsp; Generally, only after she leaves him does he seek professional help as a way of getting her back.&nbsp; Yet, it is in this phase of remorseful reconciliation that she is most thoroughly tormented psychologically.<br><br>The illusion of absolute interdependency is well-entrenched in a battered woman’s psyche.&nbsp; In this phase, she and her batterer are indeed emotionally dependent on each other -- she for his nurturant behavior, he for her forgiveness.&nbsp; Underneath this miserable cycle of “tension, violence and forgiveness,” each partner may believe that it is better to die than to be separated.&nbsp;

The Report said that during the first three years of her marriage to Ben, everything looked good -- the atmosphere was fine, normal and happy -- until “Ben started to be attracted to other girls and was also enticed in[to] gambling[,] especially cockfighting.&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; At the same time Ben was often joining his <i>barkada</i> in drinking sprees.”<br><br>The drinking sprees of Ben greatly changed the attitude he showed toward his family, particularly to his wife.&nbsp; The Report continued: “At first, it was verbal and emotional abuses but as time passed, he became physically abusive.&nbsp; Marivic claimed that the viciousness of her husband was progressive every time he got drunk.&nbsp; It was a painful ordeal Marivic had to anticipate whenever she suspected that her husband went for a drinking [spree].&nbsp; They had been married for twelve years[;] and practically more than eight years, she was battered and maltreated relentlessly and mercilessly by her husband whenever he was drunk.”<br><br>Marivic sought the help of her mother-in-law, but her efforts were in vain.&nbsp; Further quoting from the Report, “[s]he also sought the advice and help of close relatives and well-meaning friends in spite of her feeling ashamed of what was happening to her.&nbsp; But incessant battering became more and more frequent and more severe.&nbsp; x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>From the totality of evidence presented, there is indeed no doubt in the Court’s mind that Appellant Marivic Genosa was a severely abused person.<br><br><u><b><i>Effect of Battery on Appellant</i></b></u><br><br>Because of the recurring cycles of violence experienced by the abused woman, her state of mind metamorphoses.&nbsp; In determining her state of mind, we cannot rely merely on the judgment of an ordinary, reasonable person who is evaluating the events immediately surrounding the incident.&nbsp; A Canadian court has aptly pointed out that expert evidence on the psychological effect of battering on wives and common law partners are both relevant and necessary. “How can the mental state of the appellant be appreciated without it?&nbsp; The average member of the public may ask:&nbsp; Why would a woman put up with this kind of treatment?&nbsp; Why should she continue to live with such a man?&nbsp; How could she love a partner who beat her to the point of requiring hospitalization?&nbsp; We would expect the woman to pack her bags and go.&nbsp; Where is her self-respect?&nbsp; Why does she not cut loose and make a new life for herself?&nbsp; Such is the reaction of the average person confronted with the so-called ‘battered wife syndrome.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>To understand the syndrome properly, however, one’s viewpoint should not be drawn from that of an ordinary, reasonable person.&nbsp; What goes on in the mind of a person who has been subjected to repeated, severe beatings may not be consistent with -- nay, comprehensible to -- those who have not been through a similar experience.&nbsp; Expert opinion is essential to clarify and refute common myths and misconceptions about battered women.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The theory of BWS formulated by Lenore Walker, as well as her research on domestic violence, has had a significant impact in the United States and the United Kingdom on the treatment and prosecution of cases, in which a battered woman is charged with the killing of her violent partner.&nbsp; The psychologist explains that the cyclical nature of the violence inflicted upon the battered woman immobilizes the latter’s “ability to act decisively in her own interests, making her feel trapped in the relationship with no means of escape.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In her years of research, Dr. Walker found that “the abuse often escalates at the point of separation and battered women are in greater danger of dying then.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Corroborating these research findings, Dra. Dayan said that “the battered woman usually has a very low opinion of herself.&nbsp; She has x x x&nbsp; self-defeating and self-sacrificing characteristics.&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; [W]hen the violence would happen, they usually think that they provoke[d] it, that they were the one[s] who precipitated the violence[; that] they provoke[d] their spouse to be physically, verbally and even sexually abusive to them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>According to Dra. Dayan, there are a lot of reasons why a battered woman does not readily leave an abusive partner -- poverty, self-blame and guilt arising from the latter’s belief that she provoked the violence, that she has an obligation to keep the family intact at all cost for the sake of their children, and that she is the only hope for her spouse to change.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The testimony of another expert witness, Dr. Pajarillo, is also helpful.&nbsp; He had previously testified in suits involving violent family relations, having evaluated “probably ten to twenty thousand” violent family disputes within the Armed Forces of the Philippines, wherein such cases abounded.&nbsp; As a result of his experience with domestic violence cases, he became a consultant of the Battered Woman Office in Quezon City.&nbsp; As such, he got involved in about forty (40) cases of severe domestic violence, in which the physical abuse on the woman would sometimes even lead to her loss of consciousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Dr. Pajarillo explained that “overwhelming brutality, trauma” could result in posttraumatic stress disorder, a form of “anxiety neurosis or neurologic anxietism.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> After being repeatedly and severely abused, battered persons “may believe that they are essentially helpless, lacking power to change their situation.&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; [A]cute battering incidents can have the effect of stimulating the development of coping responses to the trauma at the expense of the victim’s ability to muster an active response to try to escape further trauma.&nbsp; Furthermore, x x x the victim ceases to believe that anything she can do will have a predictable positive effect.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>A study<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> conducted by Martin Seligman, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, found that “even if a person has control over a situation, but believes that she does not, she will be more likely to respond to that situation with coping responses rather than trying to escape.” He said that it was the cognitive aspect -- the individual’s thoughts -- that proved all-important.&nbsp; He referred to this phenomenon as “learned helplessness.” “[T]he truth or facts of a situation turn out to be less important than the individual’s set of beliefs or perceptions concerning the situation.&nbsp; Battered women don’t attempt to leave the battering situation, even when it may seem to outsiders that escape is possible, because they cannot predict their own safety; they believe that nothing they or anyone else does will alter their terrible circumstances.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Thus, just as the battered woman believes that she is somehow responsible for the violent behavior of her partner, she also believes that he is capable of killing her, and that there is no escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Battered women feel unsafe, suffer from pervasive anxiety, and usually fail to leave the relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Unless a shelter is available, she stays with her husband, not only because she typically lacks a means of self-support, but also because she fears that if she leaves she would be found and hurt even more.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, we meticulously scoured the records for specific evidence establishing that appellant, due to the repeated abuse she had suffered from her spouse over a long period of time, became afflicted with the battered woman syndrome.&nbsp; We, however, failed to find sufficient evidence that would support such a conclusion.&nbsp; More specifically, we failed to find ample evidence that would confirm the presence of the essential characteristics of BWS.<br><br>The defense fell short of proving all three phases of the “cycle of violence” supposedly characterizing the relationship of Ben and Marivic Genosa.&nbsp; No doubt there were acute battering incidents.&nbsp; In relating to the court <i>a quo</i> how the fatal incident that led to the death of Ben started, Marivic perfectly described the tension-building phase of the cycle.&nbsp; She was able to explain in adequate detail the typical characteristics of this stage.&nbsp; However, that single incident does not prove the existence of the syndrome.&nbsp; In other words, she failed to prove that in at least another battering episode in the past, she had gone through a similar pattern.<br><br>How did the tension between the partners usually arise or build up prior to acute battering?&nbsp; How did Marivic normally respond to Ben’s relatively minor abuses?&nbsp; What means did she employ to try to prevent the situation from developing into the next (more violent) stage?<br><br>Neither did appellant proffer sufficient evidence in regard to the third phase of the cycle.&nbsp; She simply mentioned that she would usually run away to her mother’s or father’s house;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> that Ben would seek her out, ask for her forgiveness and promise to change; and that believing his words, she would return to their common abode.<br><br>Did she ever feel that she provoked the violent incidents between her and her spouse?&nbsp; Did she believe that she was the only hope for Ben to reform?&nbsp;

and (2) this act is not far removed from the commission of the crime by a considerable length of time, during which the accused might recover her normal equanimity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Here, an acute battering incident, wherein Ben Genosa was the unlawful aggressor, preceded his being killed by Marivic.&nbsp; He had further threatened to kill her while dragging her by the neck towards a cabinet in which he had kept a gun.&nbsp; It should also be recalled that she was eight months pregnant at the time.&nbsp; The attempt on her life was likewise on that of her fetus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> His abusive and violent acts, an aggression which was directed at the lives of both Marivic and her unborn child, naturally produced passion and obfuscation overcoming her reason.&nbsp;

Helpful is Dr. Pajarillo’s testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> that with “neurotic anxiety” -- a psychological effect on a victim of “overwhelming brutality [or] trauma” -- the victim relives the beating or trauma as if it were real, although she is not actually being beaten at the time.&nbsp; She cannot control “re-experiencing the whole thing, the most vicious and the trauma that she suffered.”&nbsp; She thinks “of nothing but the suffering.”&nbsp; Such reliving which is beyond the control of a person under similar circumstances, must have been what Marivic experienced during the brief time interval and prevented her from recovering her normal equanimity.&nbsp; Accordingly, she should further be credited with the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation.<br><br>It should be clarified that these two circumstances --psychological paralysis as well as passion and obfuscation -- did not arise from the same set of facts.<br><br>On the one hand, the first circumstance arose from the cyclical nature and the severity of the battery inflicted by the batterer-spouse upon appellant.&nbsp; That is, the repeated beatings over a period of time resulted in her psychological paralysis, which was analogous to an illness diminishing the exercise of her will power without depriving her of consciousness of her acts.<br><br>The second circumstance, on the other hand, resulted from the violent aggression he had inflicted on her prior to the killing.&nbsp; That the incident occurred when she was eight months pregnant with their child was deemed by her as an attempt not only on her life, but likewise on that of their unborn child.&nbsp; Such perception naturally produced passion and obfuscation on her part.<br><center><br><b><u>Second Legal Issue:<br><i>Treachery</i></u></b><br></center><br>There is treachery when one commits any of the crimes against persons by employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof without risk to oneself arising from the defense that the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In order to qualify an act as treacherous, the circumstances invoked must be proven as indubitably as the killing itself;

Panganiban found that there was no factual basis to conclude that Marivic was suffering from “Battered Woman Syndrome” (BWS) at the time she took the life of her husband. With due respect, I register my dissent.<br><br>The novel theory of "Battered Woman Syndrome" is recognized in foreign jurisprudence as a form of self-defense. It operates upon the premise that a woman who has been cyclically abused and controlled over a period of time develops a fearful state of mind. Living in constant danger of harm or death, she knows that future beatings are almost certain to occur and will escalate over time. Her intimate knowledge of the violent nature of her batterer makes her alert to when a particular attack is forthcoming, and when it will seriously threaten her survival. Trapped in a cycle of violence and constant fear, it is not unlikely that she would succumb to her helplessness and fail to perceive possible solutions to the problem other than to injure or kill her batterer. She is seized by fear of an existing or impending lethal aggression and thus would have no opportunity beforehand to deliberate on her acts and to choose a less fatal means of eliminating her sufferings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>As exhaustively discussed in the <i>ponencia</i>, the "Battered Woman Syndrome" has three phases, to wit: (1) the tension-building phase, where minor batterings in the form of verbal or slight physical abuse occurs. Here, the woman tries to pacify the batterer through a show of kind, nurturing behavior; or by simply staying out of his way; (2) the acute battering incident phase which is characterized by brutality, destructiveness and sometimes, death. The battered woman usually realizes that she cannot reason with him and that resistance would only exacerbate her condition; and (3) the tranquil period, where the couple experience a compound relief and the batterer may show a tender and nurturing behavior towards his partner.<br><br>Contrary to the findings in the <i>ponencia</i>, the defense was able to establish the occurrence on more than one occasion of the "tension-building phase" of the cycle. The various testimonies of appellant's witnesses clearly reveal that she knew exactly when she would once again be subjected to acute battery. Her cousin, Ecel Arano, testified that she often asked the latter to sleep in her house as she was afraid every time her husband came home drunk. Clearly, whenever appellant requested for Arano's company, she was experiencing a tension-building phase. The barangay captain, Panfilo Tero, also testified that appellant sought his help two months before she killed her husband, again demonstrating that she was in the tension-building phase and was attempting to prevent another incident of acute battery. Appellant presented evidence to prove that the tension-building phase would occur whenever her husband would go out looking for other women, would lose at cockfights or would come home drunk. She often tried to ignore her husband's attitude or, as testified to by some witnesses for the prosecution, even shouted back, fought off or even injured her husband during the tension-building phase, if only to prevent the onset of acute battery.<br><br>Appellant was able to perfectly describe the tension-building phase of the cycle immediately prior to the death of her husband, <i>i.e.</i>, when she knew or felt that she was going to be killed by the deceased. She could not possibly have testified with clarity as to prior tension-building phases in the cycle as she had never tried to kill her husband before this time.<br><br>It was shown by the testimonies of appellant and even witnesses for the prosecution that appellant would seek shelter in her mother's or her father's house after an acute battering incident, after which would begin the process of begging for forgiveness, promises of change in behavior and return to the conjugal home, only for the same cycle to begin all over again.<br><br>To require appellant to prove the state of mind of the deceased, as seems to be required in the <i>ponencia</i>, would mean that no person would ever be able to prove self-defense in a battered woman case. Appellant could not possibly prove whether the deceased felt provoked into battering by any act or omission of appellant. She cannot possibly prove that she felt herself to be the sole support of the deceased's emotional stability and well-being. Nevertheless, appellant felt trapped and helpless in the relationship as, in the end, she resorted to killing her husband as no one could or did help her, whether out of fear or insensitivity, during the violent marriage she endured.<br><br>The "acute battering incident stage" was well demonstrated by the severe beatings suffered by Marivic in the hands of the deceased as well as the threats to kill her using a bolo or a cutter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The physical abuses occurred at least 3 times a week in the 11 miserable years of their marriage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> six incidents of which were documented by the 1990-1995 medical records of Marivic. They included, among others, hematoma, contusion, and pain on the breasts; multiple contusions and trauma on the different parts of her body even during her pregnancy in 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The tranquil period underwent by Marivic was shown by the repeated “kiss and make-up” episodes of their relationship. On more than 5 occasions, Marivic ran to her parents’ house after violent fights with the deceased only to forgive the latter every time he would fetch her and promise to change.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>All these recurring phases of cycle of violence, repentance and forgiveness developed a trauma in the mind of Marivic making her believe that a forthcoming attack from the deceased would cause her death. This state of mind of Marivic was revealed in her testimony given way back in 1998, before she was examined by experts on BWS. Unaware of the significance of her declarations, she candidly narrated how she felt immediately before she killed the deceased, thus -<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

This makes the foregoing testimony more worthy of great weight and credence considering that the same could not have been cunningly given to suit or conform to the profile of a battered woman.<br><br>Moreover, there was indeed basis for Marivic to fear death because of her medical history. Dr. Dino Caing testified that he treated Marivic for hypertension due to domestically related emotional stress on 23 separate occasions. The latest one was on November 6, 1995 when she suffered from severe hypertension and had a blood pressure of 180/120 on the 8th month of her pregnancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, Dr. Natividad A.

Again, I beg to disagree.<br><br>Traditionally, in order that self-defense may be appreciated, the unlawful aggression or the attack must be imminent and actually in existence. This interpretation must, however, be re-evaluated <i>vis-á-vis</i> the recognized inherent characteristic of the psyche of a person afflicted with the "Battered Woman Syndrome." As previously discussed, women afflicted by this syndrome live in constant fear for their life and thus respond in self-defense. Once BWS and an impending danger based on the conduct of the deceased in previous battering episodes are established, actual occurrence of an assault is no longer a condition <i>sine qua non</i> before self defense may be upheld. <i>Threatening behavior or communication can satisfy the required imminence of danger</i>. As stated in the ponencia, to require the battered person to await an obvious deadly attack before she can defend her life would amount to sentencing her to murder by installment.<br><br>In the case at bar, the cycle of violence perpetrated by the deceased, which culminated in the physical assaults and an attempt to shoot Marivic when she was 8 months pregnant, took the place of unlawful aggression, thus entitling her to a complete self defense even if there was no <i>actual</i> employment of violence by the deceased at the time of the killing. Marivic had every reason to believe that the deceased would kill her that night not only because the latter was verbally threatening to kill her while attempting to get a gun from the drawer, but more importantly because the deceased wounded her on the wrist with a bolo, and because of the deceased's previous conduct of threatening to cut her throat with a cutter which he kept in his wallet.

One of this is state of mind. In the case at bar, there is more than sufficient physical evidence presented by the appellant from which her mental state can be inferred. The prosecution did not object to the presentation of these physical and testimonial pieces of evidence, namely, the medical records of 23 instances of domestic violence-related injuries and the testimonies of neighbors, cousins and even the barangay captain. Indeed, no person would endure 23 reported instances of beatings if she were planning to kill her spouse in the first place. The majority need not worry that women around the country will mastermind the killings of their husbands and then use this Decision to bolster their attempts to employ the BWS defense.<br><br>Moreover, as found in the <i>ponencia</i>, appellant should be allowed the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation. This, at the very least, supports a finding that the acts of violence and battery committed by the deceased were illegal and unlawful and were committed immediately before appellant could recover her natural equanimity. But what is the natural equanimity of a battered woman? Appellant was not a normal married woman. She can never be in a state of natural equanimity as she was in a constant state of alertness and hypersensitivity to the next phase of acute battery. The esteemed <i>ponente</i> also correctly found that the appellant acted with diminished will-power. However, he failed to go further. In the case of <i>People v. Javier</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> it was held:<br><blockquote>Since accused-appellant has already admitted to the killing, it is incumbent upon him to prove the claimed mitigating circumstance of illness. In this case, however, aside from the testimony of the accused that his mind went blank when he killed his wife due to loss of sleep, no medical finding was presented regarding his mental condition at the time of the killing. This Court can hardly rely on the bare allegations of accused-appellant, nor on mere presumptions and conjectures. No clear and convincing evidence was shown that accused-appellant was suffering an illness which diminished his exercise of will-power at the time of the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, appellant was allowed and did in fact present clear and convincing evidence that she was a battered woman for 13-14 years and that she suffered from the "Battered Woman Syndrome". Expert testimony was presented and admitted to this effect, such that the <i>ponente</i> ably discussed the causes and effects of the syndrome. To ignore the testimony and the evidence thus presented is to make impossible the proof of mental state. Evidence as to the mental state need not be also "beyond reasonable doubt.”<br><br>Verily, the requirement of threatening behavioral pattern of the batterer in previous violent episodes was sufficiently satisfied in the present case. This, juxtaposed to Marivic's affliction with BWS justified the killing of the deceased. The danger posed or created in her mind by the latter's threats using bladed weapons, bred a state of fear, where under the circumstances, the natural response of the battered woman would be to defend herself even at the cost of taking the life of the batterer.<br><br>The <i>ponencia's</i> acknowledgement of "Battered Woman Syndrome" as a valid form of self-defense, is a noble recognition of the plight of, and a triumph for battered women who are trapped in a culture of silence, shame, and fear. This would however be an empty victory if we deliberately close our eyes to the antecedents of this case. The facts are simple. Marivic was suffering from the "Battered Woman Syndrome" and was defending herself when she killed her husband.
