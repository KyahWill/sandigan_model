				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Romeo Valdez, who was indicted for three counts of rape of his daughter in Criminal Case Nos. 7176, 7177, and 7178 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Masbate, Masbate and was convicted in the first and third, comes to this Court on appeal under Sec. 3 (c), Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>The three separate informations charged appellant with violating Article 335<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code (prior to its amendment by Republic Act Nos. 7659<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 8353<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>) as follows, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote>IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 7176<br><br>That on or about April 2, 1993 in the afternoon thereof at No. 17, Mabini St., Municipality of Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with ROMELA M. VALDEZ, his 17 year old daughter against the latter’s will and without her consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 7177<br><br>That on or about the 3rd week of October 1993 (sic) in the morning thereof at No. 17, Mabini St., Municipality of Masbate, Province of Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of chemical or drug used and/or mixed in the soft drink of ROMELA M. VALDEZ, his 17 year old daughter, which rendered the latter unconscious, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously did lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of said ROMELA M. VALDEZ without the latter’s consent and against her will.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 7178<br><br>That on or about the second week of November 1992 in the afternoon thereof at No. 17, Mabini St., Municipality of Masbate, Province of Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused while <u>armed with a handgun</u> entered the room of ROMELA M. VALDEZ his 17 year old daughter, who was then and there alone and by means of force and intimidation, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously did lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of said ROMELA M. VALDEZ without the latter’s consent and against her will.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>From the evidence of the prosecution, the following have been established.<br><br>Romela, who was born out of wedlock to appellant and Nora Mercaida at Masbate, Masbate on December 29, 1975, was still a small child when she was brought to Manila to live with her grandparents and aunts. It was only in the summer of 1990, when she was vacationing in Masbate, that her mother took her to meet her father, appellant Romeo Valdez, at his residential apartment at Nursery Street, Masbate, Masbate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>After that meeting in 1990, Romela lived with her mother and appellant, first at a house at Ibingay, Masbate, Masbate, and later in a unit of his apartment building at Mabini Street, Masbate, Masbate.<br><br>While in Masbate, Romela enrolled at the Masbate National Comprehensive High School and after graduation she took summer classes at the Masbate Colleges.<br><br>Sometime in the third week of October 199<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> while her mother was in Manila,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Romela and her friends Cathy Alix and Rhodora Villanueva were at appellant’s apartment where they took some snacks and were served Coca-cola by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After Romela’s friends left at around 6:00 p.m., appellant    advised Romela to consume the remaining softdrinks so that it would not go to waste. Romela obliged. About five to ten minutes following her consumption of the remaining softdrinks, Romela, became dizzy and fell asleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>As she woke up at 2:00 a.m. of the following morning, Romela found herself naked, with appellant sleeping on the floor. Noticing that her bed sheets were soiled with fresh blood and feeling pain in her breast and private organ, she immediately repaired to the bathroom and took a bath. On stepping out of the bathroom, she saw appellant already awake, prompting her to run outside and head towards the rooftop of the apartment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellant, with gun in hand, followed Romela and demanded to know “[T]o whom are you going to report?,” warning her that he was a powerful man who knew the officials of Masbate province including a certain colonel who was also staying at his apartment building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Berating her father for what he had done, Romela descended from the rooftop ahead of appellant, locked herself in the bedroom and cried helplessly. Pounding on the door, appellant warned her not to report the incident to anyone or he would kill her and the person to whom she would report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Sometime in the second week of the following month, or in November, 1992, at about 3:00 p.m., appellant forced Romela out from the bathroom of their apartment unit and pulled her onto the bed. While Romela struggled, appellant boxed her thighs and forced her to spread her legs. With a revolver, appellant asked her, as she did, to masturbate him while he kissed her and fingered her private organ, causing her pain. He then laid on top of her, forced his penis into her vagina and began pushing and pulling, causing her pain. The whole process took almost 30 minutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Helpless at gunpoint and with appellant’s hand covering her mouth, Romela was unable to shout for help. Afterwards, she was again warned, under pain of death, not to report the incident to anyone. Believing that appellant would really kill her, Romela once more kept silent and did not report the incident to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the afternoon of April 2, 1993, appellant again subjected his daughter to his bestial desires. Seeing that Romela was about to leave the apartment, appellant took his gun from under the bed, pointed it at her and told her to    undress. When she did not obey him, appellant pulled Romela to the bed and removed her dress himself. He then began masturbating, after which, at gun point, he told Romela to hold his “testicles” and stroke his penis. Appellant    then proceeded to kiss Romela’s private parts and suck her breasts. Although she struggled against him, appellant laid himself on top of her. He then inserted his penis inside her vagina, and went on pushing and pulling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In pain, crushed under appellant’s weight and aware that he was still holding a gun, Romela was unable to defend herself against appellant. Helpless, fearful and ashamed of her sexual violation at the hands of her own father, she again did not report the incident to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On April 4, 1992, after her mother arrived in Masbate, Masbate, Romela finally found a way out of her sorry plight. Taking advantage of her mother and appellant not being on good terms and his having gone to his paramour in Lomboy, she obtained permission from her mother to go to Manila. Borrowing money from her friends, she left for Manila on a boat that same night and proceeded to the residence of Juana Mercaida, her maternal grandmother, in Antipolo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Even then, Romela, fearing for her grandparents’ health, did not tell them of what had happened to her in Masbate.<br><br>One day, after she was almost hit by car, Romela’s cousin, Rosemarie Mercaida, confronted her about her persistent depression and absent-mindedness. It was then that she confided to her cousin that she had not had her menstruation for four months and was afraid that she might be pregnant.<br><br>Pressed by Rosemarie to divulge who could have impregnated her, Romela finally revealed that she had been raped by appellant.<br><br>Accompanied by her grandmother, Romela proceeded to the offices of the NBI in Manila where she was examined by Dr. Maximo L. Reyes and investigated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The result of the examination of Romela by Dr. Reyes, as stated in Living Case No. MG-93-589,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> reads as follows:<br><blockquote>GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Height: 162.0cm.

Thus he avers that her claims that she was raped sometime during the third week of October 1992, and then again around the second week of November 1992, and finally on April 2, 1993 are unbelievable given her continued stay with him in his apartment until April 2, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> whereas she could have fled at anytime since she was completely free to come and go as she pleased and, in fact, went unescorted to the Miss Foundation pageant of the Masbate Colleges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Appellant likewise avers that Romela never said anything about the alleged molestations to her mother although the latter stayed with them in the same apartment for three weeks in December, 1992 and again from February to April 1993; and that neither did her mother raise any concerns about her daughter’s well-being even after the latter had already left for Manila,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> as in fact, it was not until June 17, 1993, more than two months after she arrived at Manila from Masbate that Romela filed a complaint with the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Appellant furthermore maintains that Romela could not have been the victim of multiple rapes since throughout the period from October 1992 until she left for Manila on April 2, 1993, she was “living normally” with “no mental disturbance whatsoever,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> in support of which appellant submitted a number of pictures<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> showing her attending social functions from December 1992 to February 1993, and a Certification from the College Registrar,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a Certificate of Scholarship,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and various examination booklets<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> from the Masbate Colleges showing that she obtained fair ratings in her subjects for school year 1992-1993.<br><br>Finally, appellant assails Romela’s capacity for truth, honesty and integrity by submitting her Permanent Record<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> for first and second year high school from Roosevelt College, Cainta, Rizal which “falsely” indicates that her father is a certain Raymundo Valdez, a veterinarian, and that she was born in Antipolo, Rizal. Appellant theorizes that she provided false information in her high school record because her mind was “poisoned” by her grandparents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The appealed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of December 15, 1997, disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered as follows:<br><br>(1) ACQUITTING the accused in Criminal Case No. 7177 on grounds of reasonable doubt;<br><br>(2) Finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case Nos. 7176 and 7178 of    the crime of Rape and hereby sentences the accused Romeo Valdez y Labnotin to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in each of the two (2) counts;<br><br>(3) Ordering the accused to indemnify the victim Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as exemplary damage in both cases and One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) Pesos in each of the two (2) counts for moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>His Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of the trial court’s Decision having been denied by Order of February 30, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> appellant filed the instant appeal. In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> he proffers the following:<br><blockquote><center>LONE ASSIGNED ERROR<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Citing <i>People v. Subido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> appellant questions the alleged failure of the trial court to apply the following well-settled principles in reviewing rape cases: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>For conviction to be had in the crime of rape, the following elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) that said act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation; or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) when the victim is twelve years of age, or is demented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is settled that the foregoing elements may be established by the sole testimony of the victim, provided it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, in rape through force or intimidation the force employed by the guilty party need not be irresistible. It is only necessary that such force is sufficient to consummate the purpose for which it was inflicted. Similarly, intimidation should be evaluated in light of the victim’s perception at the time of the commission of the crime. It is enough that it produced the fear in the mind of the victim that if she did not yield to the bestial demands of her ravisher, some evil would happen to her at that moment or even thereafter. Hence, what is important is that because of force and intimidation, the victim was made to submit to the will of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the first and third cases, as the following testimony of Romela clearly establishes, she was raped by the accused, through force and intimidation, on the second week of November 1992 and on April 2, 1993:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You also charged your father that on the second week of November, 1992 in the afternoon thereof you were again assaulted and abused by your father in that apartment where you live.

penetration of the labia of the woman’s pudendum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> appellant contends that Romela’s claim that there was repeated painful penetration of her vagina is belied by the findings contained in the medico-legal certificate issued by the NBI, particularly that which found her hymen still intact and no extragenital injuries on her body.<br><br>Appellant’s contention does not lie. On cross-examination, Dr. Reyes patiently explained that, medically, the laceration or non-laceration of a woman’s hymen is not, by itself, determinative of whether she has experienced sexual intercourse. Citing the books of Solis and Taylor, Dr. Reyes explained that the laceration of the hymen may be caused by other factors such as horseback riding, instrumentation as a result of a disease, riding on a bicycle, or passage of dark-clotted blood during menstruation. Conversely, the doctor declared that it is also possible for a woman with a distensible or elastic hymen to have engaged in sexual intercourse several times without laceration of her hymen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Dr. Reyes’s medical opinion is not new. In <i>People v. Llanto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> this Court had occasion to take note of instances when penetration was shown to have occurred even though the victim’s hymen remained intact:<br><blockquote>That Cristy was allegedly raped by the accused in many instances other than on November 12, 1999 and her hymen remained intact do not lend support to the cause of the accused. In People v. Caballes [199 SCRA 152 (1991)], the fourteen year-old victim was raped nine times by her father in a span of four months.<br><br>x x x <span style="font-weight: bold;">A medical examination upon the victim showed that the victim’s hymen was thick and very elastic. It had no lacerations and remained intact. The examining physician</span> presented by the prosecution <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">opined that it is possible for a woman’s hymen to remain intact even after having been raped if it is lax, thick and elastic</span>. x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>In People v. Santos, [343 SCRA 503 (2000)], <span style="font-weight: bold;">the accused</span> was charged of raping the helpless eight-year old complainant. He <span style="font-weight: bold;">assailed the credibility of the victim as according to him it was impossible for her to have been raped up to twenty times, but her hymen remained intact. The Court found no merit in the accused’s contention</span>, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>“We find no merit in the contention of accused-appellant. Dr. Cenido thoroughly discussed these intriguing hymenal qualities, but the accused-appellant would, understandably so, pretend to find the whole concept as obscure. He said that, as a general rule, a hymen that is intact would negate prior sexual intercourse but that the rule was not absolute as <b><u>penetration can happen with or without rupturing the hymen</u></b>. He confirmed that there were women whose hymens remained intact even after giving birth owing to the fact that their hymens must be very elastic. x x x<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Applying these rulings to the case at bar, <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is possible for the victim’s hymen to remain intact despite repeated sexual intercourse</span>. Dr. Soliman testified that during the examination on Cristy, a tube 2.5 centimeters in diameter was inserted into her hymenal opening without any injury. Her hymenal opening is wide at 2.5 centimeters in diameter so as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized adult Filipino male organ in full erection, about 2.5 centimeters, without producing genital/hymenal injury. Likewise, whether the accused’s penis fully or only partially penetrated the victim’s genitalia, it is still possible that her hymen would remain intact because it was thick and distensible or elastic. We stated in People v. Aguinaldo [316 SCRA 819 (1999)] <span style="font-weight: bold;">that the strength and dilability of the hymen varies from one woman to another such that it may be so elastic as to stretch without laceration during intercourse, or on the other hand, may be so resistant that its surgical removal is necessary before intercourse can ensue. In some cases even, the hymen is still intact even after the woman has given birth</span> [citing People v. Almaden, 305 SCRA 157 (1999)].<br><br>In view of Dr. Soliman’s medical examination and opinion and the foregoing rulings of this Court that support the finding that <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">a thick and elastic hymen can remain intact despite several instances of sexual intercourse</span>, we find that the trial court was not in error in not admitting the expert testimonies of the defense witnesses who did not examine Cristy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>More importantly, Dr. Reyes testified that from his medical examination of Romela, particularly his finding that her vaginal walls were lax and the rugosities (the vaginal lining) were shallow, she had indeed experienced sexual intercourse several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Again on cross-examination, he stated:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

Neither did he present any proof of his claim that the diameter of his sexual organ exceeded the Filipino average of 2.5 to 2.7 centimeters in full erection.<br><br>Where a rape victim’s testimony is corroborated by the physical findings of penetration, there is sufficient basis for concluding that sexual intercourse did take place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Appellant zeroes in on Romela’s failure to immediately flee the Mabini Street apartment and report her harrowing experience to her mother and the police as giving rise to reasonable doubt as to the truth of her testimony.<br><br>Contrary to appellant’s simplistic reasoning, there can be no hard and fast rule with respect to a victim’s reaction to the physical and psychological trauma attendant to the crime of rape. In <i>People v. Silvano</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> cited by the Solicitor General and involving similar factual circumstances, this Court stated:<br><blockquote>Appellant further contends that her daughter’s acts after the alleged rape, such as going to school the next day, leaving their home after more than two weeks had lapsed since the incident and reporting the same only when confronted by her mother are inconsistent with the behavior of a rape victim. The contention is without merit.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The behavior and reaction of every person cannot be predicted with accuracy. It is a time-honored precept that “different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation and there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful experience.”</span> Not every rape victim can be expected to act conformably to the usual expectations of every one. Some may shout; some may faint; and some may be shocked into insensibility; while others may openly welcome the intrusion.<br><br>The failure of the victim to immediately reveal his father’s incestuous acts is not indicative of fabricated charges. It should be noted that:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">“Many victims of rape never complain or file criminal charges against their rapists. They prefer to bear the ignominy and pain rather than reveal their shame to the world or risk rapists making good their threats to kill or hurt their victims.”</span> [citing <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Silvafan</span>, 151 SCRA 617, 629 (1987); and <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Cabreras</span>, 314 Phil. 250 (1995), 244 SCRA 362]<br></blockquote>The victim herein is in no case different. Her shame and genuine fear of what appellant might do to her or her brothers had temporarily sealed her lips. This is why she left their home, the scene of her defilement where her appellant father resides and went to her maternal grandmother’s place. Only when confronted why she would not come back to their house did she reveal the avalanche of shame and degradation that had befallen her at that tender age of 16 years from her very own father. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not uncommon for a young girl at such age to be intimidated into silence and conceal for sometime the violation of her honor, even by the mildest threat against her life. Silence is not an odd behavior of rape victims who do not always immediately go to the rooftop and denounce their assailants. This “natural reticence or aversion of the victims to reveal the humiliation attaching to the crime” is a “stigma they will have to bear indefinitely thereafter.”</span> The fear of these young victims of reprisals upon them or their families easily cows them into submission and silence. Worse, in incestuous rape, that fear which compels non-revelation is further reinforced by the moral ascendancy of the rapist over his ravished relative. As the father of the victim, appellant whom she called “Daddy” had assumed parental authority over her during her formative years. Undisputedly, he exerts strong moral influence over complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In Romela’s case, her testimony with respect to the first and third case clearly conveys, in no uncertain terms, not only the fear and ordeal she was subjected to during each rape, but the abiding feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, shame and disgrace which continued to distress her thereafter:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Why did you not go out and report this incident to the police?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">Because I know nothing will happened and wherever I go he is always there and follows me besides I was also afraid and ashamed.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">You said you were ashamed.

Nowhere does the record show that Romela, or any of her maternal relatives for that matter, demanded money or property in exchange for the withdrawal of the charges against appellant. In the words of the trial court:<br><blockquote>Accused unabash[ed]ly claims that the mother, Nora Mercaida motivates and/or manipulates the mind of Romela to file this instant case because of anger coupled with the fact that he will be receiving as inheritance a cool sum of Five Million (P5,000,000.00) Pesos. This contention is utterly baseless. If at all, his testimony is self-serving. It is inconceivable that a mother would draw her daughter, into a rape scam with all its attendant scandal and humiliation just because of a supposed dispute over an admittedly inchoate inheritance. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>And the trial court correctly gave little weight to appellant’s assertions that the alleged falsities contained in Romela’s permanent high school record proves that she is inherently untrustworthy. As it correctly pointed out, these pertain to “[c]ollateral or minor matters which do not at all touch upon the commission of the crime itself nor affect Romela’s credibility.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>All told, this Court finds and affirms that appellant’s guilt was indeed proven with moral certainty.<br><br>Under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, which was in force at the dates of the commission of the felonies, the penalty for rape with the use of a deadly weapon was “<i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.” However, the penalty of death may not be imposed since the aggravating circumstance of Romela’s relationship to appellant was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. While during the trial Romela testified that appellant is her father and appellant, in turn, repeatedly admitted that Romela is his daughter, this Court has held that, because of the serious and irrevocable nature of the death penalty, the bare testimony of the complainant and the admission of the accused are not sufficient for its imposition; the relationship between the victim and the accused must be sufficiently established by competent and independent evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Moreover, conformably with prevailing jurisprudence, the damages awarded by the trial court must be modified such that Romela is entitled to civil indemnity of P50,000.00 for each count of rape and moral damages of P50,000.00 also for each count.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment on review is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b>. Appellant Romeo Valdez is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of RAPE and is hereby sentenced to the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each.
