(hereafter, “Foodmasters”).&nbsp; DBP subsequently filed a Third-Party Complaint against Foodmasters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered a decision in favor of Union Bank, which DBP appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;

Notably, the decision of the Court of Appeals was promulgated only on <u>27 May 1994</u>, a time when the proscription on Union Bank’s right to collect was still in effect, DBP having been given a period until <u>29 December 1998</u> within which to fully pay its obligation to Union Bank.&nbsp; It would, thus, be too strained to argue that payment by DBP of its assumed obligation to Union Bank shall be dependent on Foodmaster’s (sic) ability, if not availability, to pay.&nbsp; Neither would it be logical to opine that the suspension of Union Banks (sic) right to claim payment be made to go beyond the very deadline set by the Honorable Collective Courts themselves having declared that DBP is accountable for its assumed obligation.&nbsp; At most, and as mandated by the decision of the Court of Appeals, a mechanism was merely fixed when Union Bank could realize on its credit, viz:<br><center><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mere application is needed.&nbsp; Assuming, gratis arguendo, that an ambiguity exists, resulting from the simplicity of the dispositive portion, the rationale behind its judgment, contained in the body of the decision must be resorted to bearing in mind, however, the cardinal postulate that where there is an ambiguity, such interpretation as will avoid inconvenience and absurdity must be adopted. x x x<br><center><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Petitioner and respondent both filed their Memoranda, which we noted in our Resolution dated December 10, 2003.<br><br>In essence, petitioner questions the Order of Execution, the Writ of Execution issued pursuant thereto, and the manner in which the Writ of Execution was implemented by respondent sheriff.<br><br>We find merit in the petition.<br><br>It is a fundamental legal axiom that a Writ of Execution must conform <i>strictly</i> to the dispositive portion of the decision sought to be executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> A Writ of Execution may not vary, or go beyond, the terms of the judgment it seeks to enforce.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> When a Writ of Execution does not conform strictly to a decision’s dispositive portion, it is null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> To maintain otherwise would be to ignore the constitutional prohibition against depriving a person of his property without due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>To our mind, there are significant points of variance between the Court of Appeals’ decision, the Order of Execution, and the Writ of Execution that was issued by the court <i>a quo</i>. <br><br>As correctly pointed out by petitioner, the Court of Appeals’ decision provided a two-step process for the satisfaction of DBP’s obligation to Union Bank.&nbsp; The first was the <i>prior</i> satisfaction of Foodmasters’ lease obligation to DBP in the amount of P32,441,401.85, representing unpaid rentals from August 1981 to June 30, 1987, as well as P10,000.00 for attorney’s fees.&nbsp; DBP was to remit 30% thereof to Union Bank only <i>after</i> this obligation had been satisfied.<br><br>In contrast, the Writ of Execution issued by the trial court called for the satisfaction of the said decision from the <i>obligors</i>, without specifying who these obligors were, the amount due from each obligor, or the order in which the obligors were to be proceeded against.&nbsp; A more significant and glaring error in the Writ of Execution is that it merely called for the immediate payment of a <i>single</i> obligation to a <i>single</i> obligee, again without specifying who this obligee was, when there were two obligations and two obligees mentioned in the dispositive portion of the decision sought to be enforced.<br><br>Contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals, therefore, the Writ of Execution was <i>not</i> enforceable against both DBP and Foodmasters.&nbsp; In fact, it was so vague as to be enforceable against <i>neither</i>.&nbsp; For varying the terms of the decision, the Writ of Execution is a patent nullity.<br><br>The court <i>a quo</i>, swayed by the arguments of Union Bank, relied on the dates mentioned in the subject decision, which was promulgated allegedly at “a time when the proscription on Union Bank’s right to collect was still in effect”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In the Order of Execution, the trial court then went on to state that DBP had “been given a period until <u>29 December 1998</u> within which to fully pay its obligation to Union Bank. It would, thus, be too strained to argue that payment By DBP of its assumed obligation to Union Bank shall be dependent on Foodmaster’s (<i>sic</i>) ability, if not availability, to pay.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The trial court overlooked the fact that the dates in question are irrelevant in order to execute the decision of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In fact, the said decision did not grant any such period to DBP within which to pay its full obligations to Union Bank, if any, under the various contracts executed on May 21, 1979.&nbsp; This is because the complaint of Union Bank had absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with the determination of the entirety of DBP’s obligations to Union Bank, if any, arising from the contracts executed on May 21, 1979 and due and demandable as of December 29, 1998.&nbsp; Rather, the complaint against DBP sought merely the collection of rentals, interest and other charges, exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, and litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> DBP’s Third-Party Complaint, on the other hand, against Foodmasters, sought actual and compensatory damages, interest, exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, or indemnification for any and all amounts for which DBP would be adjudged liable to Union Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>This being the case, the decision of the Court of Appeals settled <i>only</i> the issue of which of the parties were liable for rentals, interest and other charges as of June 30, 1987, as supported by the evidence in Civil Case No. 7648; exemplary damages; attorney’s fees; and litigation expenses.&nbsp; Both the body and the dispositive portion of the decision correctly construed the nature of DBP’s liability for the lease payments under the various contracts, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x Construing these three contracts, especially the “Agreement” x x x between DBP and Bancom as providing for the payment of DBP’s assumed obligation out of the rentals to be paid to it does not mean negating DBP’s assumption “for its own account” of the P17.0 million debt x x x.&nbsp; It only means that they provide a mechanism for discharging [DBP’s] liability.&nbsp; This liability subsists, since under the “Agreement” x x x, DBP is obligated to pay “any balance of the Assumed Obligations after application of the entire rentals and or the entire sales proceeds actually received by [Union Bank] on the Leased Properties … not later than December 29, 1998.” x x x&nbsp; It only means that the lease rentals must first be applied to the payment of the P17 million debt and that [DBP] would have to pay out of its money <u>only in case of insufficiency of the lease rentals having until December 29, 1998 to do so</u>.&nbsp; In this sense, it is correct to say that the means of repayment of the assumed obligation is not limited to the lease rentals.&nbsp; The monthly installments, however, would still have to come from the lease rentals since this was stipulated in the “Agreement”. x x x<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>Since, as already stated, the monthly installments for the payment of the P17 million debt are to be funded from the lease rentals, <u>it follows that if the lease rentals are not paid, there is nothing for DBP to remit to [Union Bank],</u> and thus [DBP] should not be considered in default.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that, as stated in the appealed decision, “as regards plaintiff’s claim for damages against defendant for its alleged negligence in failing and refusing to enforce a lessor’s remedies against Foodmasters Worldwide, Inc., the Court finds no competent and reliable evidence of such claim.”<br><br>This is not unfair to [Union Bank], since as mentioned earlier, defendant and third-party plaintiff-appellant DBP remains liable for the balance of the P17 million debt <u>after application to it of the lease rentals</u>, although DBP would have until December 29, 1998 to make such payment.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
