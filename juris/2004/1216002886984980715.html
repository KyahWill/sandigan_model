By Order of June 29, 1988, the land registration court, Branch 17 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cavite which took over the cases pending before Branch 3 of the former CFI of Cavite, noting that titles to properties cannot be collaterally attacked, directed the parties “to have Plan PSU-113427 amended to exclude the portions already titled [in the name of Landicho] without prejudice to filing the corresponding case for annulment of titles.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>By Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of July 2, 1991, the land registration court, resolving two motions to reopen the decree of registration in LRC Case No. N-249, ruled:<br><blockquote><center>x x x<br></center><br>After evidence pro and con for the reopening of this case to determine the merits of the report of the Land Registration Commission of October 15, 1963 which states that there are several overlappings upon the very land subject matter of this application and which have been adjudicated in previous land registration proceedings in which said land had been issued corresponding certificates of title pursuant to the provisions of Act 496 and that only a small portion remains undecreed, <u>counsel for the parties in open Court this morning, after hearing the testimony of Isidro R.

In the same Order, <u>Branch 18 of the RTC of Tagaytay dismissed herein petitioners’ complaint for lack of merit</u>, it finding that the only basis of their claim of ownership to the Roxas property, said to have been included in the Landicho title, is Psu-113427, whereas the subsequent transfer of the Landicho property to Republic Planters Bank and later to intervenor Solid Builders, Inc. were evidenced by documents including titles, the existence of which documents petitioners admitted in their Complaint and Amended Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of their complaint having been denied by Order of April 10, 2000, petitioners filed a <u>petition for certiorari</u> with the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The appellate court, by Resolution of July 28, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dismissed petitioners’ petition for certiorari on the ground that the RTC Tagaytay’s order dismissing their complaint is a final, not an interlocutory order, hence, a subject of appeal and not certiorari.<br><br>Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration of the appellate court’s July 28, 2000 Resolution having been denied by Resolution of November 6, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> for lack of merit and, in any event, the petition for certiorari was filed out of time, they lodged the petition for review on certiorari at bar, submitting the following<br><blockquote><center>x x x<br><br>REASONS FOR THE PETITION<br></center><ol type="A"><li> Respondent Court of Appeals <u>erred in holding that the dismissal of the complaint by way of granting private respondents’ motion for summary judgment is a proper subject of appeal</u>, not certiorari, despite the grave abuse of discretion committed by public respondent Presiding Judge Alfonso Garcia of the trial court;<br><br></li><li> Respondent Court of Appeals also <u>committed error of law in applying the presumption of completeness of service after five (5) days from receipt of the first notice</u>, considering the actual receipt of the registered mail by the petitioners;<br><br></li><li> Respondent Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion in <u>resorting to strict technicality in dismissing the petition for certiorari</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>The petition fails.<br><br>It is settled that an order dismissing a complaint is a final, not an interlocutory order, hence, a proper subject of appeal. If indeed petitioners received the December 17, 1999 Order of the trial court dismissing their complaint on February 1, 2000 and filed on February 3, 2000 a motion for reconsideration thereof, the Order denying which motion they received on May 26, 2000, they had fifteen days<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> or until June 8, 2000 to appeal. They, however, did not appeal and instead filed on July 24, 2000 before the Court of Appeals the petition for certiorari.<br><br>When the remedy of appeal is available but is lost due to petitioner’s own negligence or error in the choice of remedies, resort to certiorari is precluded. That is settled.<br><br>Even if, in the greater interest of substantial justice, certiorari may be availed of, it must be shown that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that is, that the trial court exercised its powers in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostilities, so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion or virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Petitioners’ assignment of errors of the trial court before the appellate court, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li> PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ERRED IN <u>APPLYING THE RULE ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT</u> IN THE CASE AT BAR, THE SAME BEING ONE FOR CANCELLATION OF TITLE OR DECLARATION OF NULLITY OF TITLES, AND THERE BEING SERIOUS AND TRIABLE ISSUES ON THE MERITS, JOINED AFTER PRIVATE RESPONDENTS FILED THEIR ANSWERS TO THE AMENDED COMPLAINT;<br><br></li><li> PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN <u>APPLYING THE RULING IN ARMY AND NAVY CLUB OF MANILA, INC. VS. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL.</u>, G.R. NO. 110223, APRIL 8, 1997;<br><br></li><li> PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN <u>HOLDING THAT PETITIONERS’ ALLEGATION IN THE COMPLAINT ABOUT TRANSFERS OF TITLES TO SUPPOSED SUBSEQUENT PURCHASERS WARRANT DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINT THROUGH SUMMARY JUDGMENT</u>.<br><br></li><li> PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN <u>DENYING PETITIONERS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</u>, BASED ON THE OPPOSITION FILED BY THE INTERVENOR WHOSE ONLY BASIS FOR INTERVENTION IS A DEED OF PROMISE TO SELL WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DECLAREED NULL AND VOID BY ANOTHER COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Underscoring supplied),<br></li></ol></blockquote>shows, however, that what were being assailed were errors not of jurisdiction but of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Whether a trial court, which has jurisdiction over the person of the parties to, and the subject matter of the case, will grant a motion for summary judgment is within its power or authority in law to perform. Its propriety rests on its sound exercise of discretion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and judgment. In the event that it errs in finding that there is no genuine issue to thus call for the rendition of a summary judgment, the resulting decision may not be set aside either directly or indirectly by petition for certiorari, but may only be corrected on appeal or other direct review. Parenthetically, contrary to petitioners’ argument that the rule on summary judgment applies to only two kinds of action — an action to recover a debt or a liquidated demand for money, and an action for declaratory relief, the rule is applicable to <b>all</b> kinds of actions. <i>De Leon v. Faustino</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> holds so.<br><blockquote>It is contended that the procedure of summary judgment is not warranted in the instant case since it is not an action “to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim”. It is argued that section 1 of Rule 36 providing for the remedy of summary judgment for the claimant contemplates action or cases which are in the nature of money claims. The contention cannot be sustained. Summary judgment procedure is a method for promptly disposing of actions in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Under this definition and from the provision of section 1 of Rule 36, <u>there would seem to be no limitation as to the type of actions in which the remedy is available</u>, except, of course, where the material facts alleged in the complaint are required to be proved. As observed in the note of the Advisory Committee of the United States Supreme Court, quoted by former Chief Justice Moran in his comments on the Rules of Court (Vol. I, 1957 ed., p. 497) —<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>In England it was first employed only in cases of liquidation claims, but there has been a steady enlargement of the scope of the remedy until <u>it is now used in actions to recover land or chattels and in all other actions at law</u>, for liquidated or unliquidated claims, except for a few designated torts and breach of promise of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The foregoing discussions leave it unnecessary to pass on the second reason proffered for the petition, that bearing on the timeliness of the filing of the petition for certiorari before the appellate court.<br><br>At all events, the remedy of one who has established his ownership over a property but which property has been wrongfully or erroneously registered through fraud or mistake in another’s name is, after the lapse of one year from the date of issuance of the questioned decree, not to set aside the decree, it having become incontrovertible and no longer open to review, but to institute <u>an ordinary action in the ordinary court of justice for reconveyance</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>If the property, however, has already passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, the remedy is to file an action for damages from the person who allegedly registered the property through fraud,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or if he had become insolvent or if the action is barred by prescription, to file an action for recovery against the Assurance Fund under Section 95 of P.D.
