				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><b><center><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></center></b><br>On automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 31 August 2000 of the Regional Trial Court of Baler, Aurora, Branch 96 (“trial court”), in Criminal Case No. 2340.&nbsp; The trial court found appellant Alberto Luceriano (“appellant”) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and sentenced him to suffer the death penalty and to indemnify the victim.<br><center><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Charge</b><br></center><blockquote>The Information for rape against appellant reads:<br><br>That at about 10:30 o’clock in the evening on January 3, 1998 at Poblacion Zone 1, Dinalungan, Aurora and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, taking advantage of nighttime and his relationship with the offended party Mysan Onde, did then and there, unlawfully, feloniously and willfully have carnal knowledge of the said eleven year old Mysan Onde in their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote><b><center><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arraignment and Plea</span><br></center></b><br>When arraigned, appellant, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>The Trial</u><br></center></b><br><center><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br></center><br>Mysan Onde (“Mysan”) was born on 13 April 1986 to spouses Pepe G. Onde and Teresita Demetrio.&nbsp; The Onde spouses were lawfully married sometime in 1972.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Out of such union, five children were born, the youngest being Mysan.&nbsp; When Pepe died, Teresita started living-in with appellant.&nbsp; Teresita begot appellant a child whom they named Noe.&nbsp; As Teresita’s first four children with Pepe later got married, only Mysan continued to stay with Teresita and appellant, and her younger half-brother, Noe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On 3 January 1998, at around 10:30 p.m., Mysan was sleeping on the floor of their house in Poblacion Zone I, Dinalungan, Aurora.&nbsp; Teresita and Noe were then at the plaza selling candies and cigarettes to people watching the <i>Tuklas-Talino</i> show.&nbsp; Mysan woke up and saw appellant kneeling beside her.&nbsp; Appellant covered her mouth with his hands, then pointed a knife at her.&nbsp; He warned her not to tell anyone about what he was doing to her.&nbsp; He then ordered her to undress herself, and she did so while lying on the floor face up.&nbsp; Appellant undressed himself.&nbsp; He then mounted on top of Mysan and forced his organ into hers.&nbsp; He made thrusting motions.&nbsp; Mysan felt intense pain in her genitalia.&nbsp; She was crying all the time but she was unable to shout for fear that appellant might kill her.&nbsp; Appellant kissed her face several times.&nbsp; After appellant satisfied his savage urge, he dressed up and left the room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the afternoon of the following day, while Teresita was washing clothes outside their house, Mysan disclosed to her the rape incident.&nbsp; Appellant was cooking in the kitchen at the time.&nbsp; Teresita and Mysan immediately went to the police and reported the matter.&nbsp; On the same day, police officer Rene Dizon arrested the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 5 January 1998, Teresita brought Mysan to the Casiguran District Hospital and submitted her to a medical examination.&nbsp; The medico-legal examination conducted on Mysan contained the following findings:<br><blockquote>=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hymenal lacerations noted on the following:<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; superficial healed lacerations at 3:00 o’clock, 9:00 o’clock<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deep healed lacerations at 2:00 o’clock and 6:00 o’clock<br><br><u>INTERNAL EXAMINATIONS:</u><br><br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vagina admits one (1) finger w/ ease<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cervix closed, firm uterus small<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adnexac negative, negative bleeding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><b><center><i>Version of the Defense</i><br></center></b><br>Appellant denied that he raped Mysan on 3 January 1998.&nbsp; He claimed that on the night in question, he was in San Ildefonso, Casiguran, Aurora, where he had been staying from the time he left his residence in Pulilan, Bulacan.&nbsp; Appellant admitted that he was Teresita’s common-law husband but asserted that only Teresita, Mysan and Noe transferred residence to Poblacion, Dinalungan, Aurora.&nbsp; Appellant averred that he worked as a farmer in a <i>kaingin</i> in San Ildefonso and raised livestock.&nbsp; He stated that he visited his family in Dinalungan only occasionally, as he could not leave his livestock in San Ildefonso.&nbsp; Appellant claimed that he could not have possibly gone to Dinalungan on the night in question because there was no means of transportation.&nbsp; It would take 2 hours by motorboat to go to Dinalungan from San Ildefonso, and 4 hours if the boat has no motor.&nbsp; Appellant said he has no boat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b><center>The Trial Court’s Ruling<br></center></b><br>On 31 August 2000, the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction with the following dispositive portion:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the herein accused Alberto Luceriano y Bagacay GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of rape, sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH, and awarding the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages and the sum of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<br><b><u><center><br>The Issues<br></center></u></b><br>In this appeal, appellant contends that:<br><blockquote><ol> I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape committed on January 3, 1998 despite the obvious impossibility of such accusation.<br><br>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in imposing upon the accused the supreme penalty of death despite the failure of the information to allege clearly the qualifying circumstance which would warrant such imposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></ol></blockquote><b><center><u>The Court’s Ruling</u><br></center></b><br>We affirm the judgment of conviction but modify the penalty.<br><br>Appellant argues that Mysan’s claim that he raped her on 3 January 1998 does not jibe with the results of the medical examination conducted on Mysan on 5 January 1998.&nbsp; The physical examination of Mysan reveals that she has two hymenal lacerations.&nbsp; One is a “superficial healed laceration” and the other is a “deep healed laceration.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On the witness stand, Dr. German Tiongson, Chief of the Casiguran District Hospital, explained the findings of Dr. Rogelio Vicente Reyes, Jr., the physician who examined Mysan two days after the incident in question.&nbsp; Dr. Tiongson testified that the “superficial healed laceration” could have been inflicted at least one week before the medical examination was conducted on Mysan.&nbsp; As regards the “deep healed laceration,” Dr. Tiongson stated that it could have been inflicted one year before the night in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Appellant claims that if it were true that he raped Mysan on 3 January 1998, then the lacerations in Mysan’s hymen should still be fresh or not totally healed when she was physically examined two days after he allegedly raped her or on 5 January 1998.&nbsp; Appellant asserts that Mysan’s testimony that he first raped her when she was 8 years old does not deserve serious consideration because the testimony is unsubstantiated and self-serving.&nbsp; Appellant asserts that the healed lacerations in Mysan’s hymen “only prove that Mysan had engaged in prior sexual activities, although not necessarily with him.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Appellant’s arguments are untenable.<br><br>The healed lacerations in Mysan’s hymen do not prove that appellant did not rape her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> A freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It is highly unlikely that a young girl like Mysan would fabricate a story that would destroy her reputation and her family life, and endure the ordeal of a trial, were it not to seek justice for herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> No ulterior motive was offered to explain why Mysan would concoct a story charging appellant with the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The presence of old healed hymenal lacerations prior to the date of the victim’s medical examination does not negate the commission of rape by the accused when the victim herself has testified in vivid detail on the sexual assault on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the present case, we entertain no doubt that Mysan told the truth.&nbsp; Her testimony was straightforward, consistent and unwavering.&nbsp; There is also her positive assertion that appellant raped her when she was 8 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Rape is committed when the accused has carnal knowledge of the victim by force or intimidation and without consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Based on the records, the prosecution sufficiently established that appellant had sexual intercourse with the victim.&nbsp; If the victim’s testimony meets the test of credibility, that is sufficient to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> When a woman says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Here, Mysan’s testimony, particularly as regards appellant’s identity, was direct, clear, and positive.

Mysan testified that appellant “pointed a knife at her side.”&nbsp; There was, therefore, the essence of force and intimidation sufficient to engender fear in Mysan’s mind that she would be killed if she did not yield to appellant’s bestial desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The act of holding a knife by itself is strongly suggestive of force or at least intimidation, and threatening the victim with a knife is sufficient to bring her into submission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Even in the absence of force, threat or intimidation, appellant’s sexual intercourse with Mysan would constitute statutory rape.&nbsp; The Information alleged, and the prosecution proved during trial, that Mysan was only eleven (11) years old when appellant had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; Under Article 266-A(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, there is rape even in the absence of force, threat or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s pretense cannot prevail over the testimony of Mysan which the trial court found to be “candid, plain, and straightforward.”&nbsp; The testimony of victims who are of tender age are credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, we note that Mysan could not hold back her emotions and cried profusely at certain points during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The spontaneous crying of a young victim while recounting her heart-rending experience is evidence that speaks well of her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>There being proof beyond reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crime as charged, we affirm his conviction.<br><br>However, the penalty imposed must be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; Even the Office of the Solicitor General concedes that the trial court erroneously imposed the death penalty.<br><br>Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, states in part:<br><blockquote>Art. 266-B.&nbsp; Penalties – x x x.<br><br>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><ol>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, <b>or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim</b>.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied) <br></ol></blockquote>Under this provision, both circumstances of the victim’s minority and her relationship to the offender must be alleged in the information.&nbsp; Since these attendant circumstances alter the nature of the crime of rape and increase the penalty, they are in the nature of qualifying circumstances.&nbsp; They must be specifically and clearly alleged in the information and proven during the trial to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The prosecution proved Mysan’s minority during the trial by presenting in evidence Mysan’s birth certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The document clearly states that Mysan was born on 13 April 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the Information correctly alleged that at the time of the commission of the rape on 3 January 1998, Mysan was “11 years old.”<br><br>We find, however, that the Information did not properly allege the relationship of appellant to Mysan as required by Section 9, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure which reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 9.&nbsp; Cause of the accusation. — The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment.</blockquote>In the present case, the Information does not state that appellant is the live-in partner of Mysan’s mother.&nbsp; Even if the prosecution proved that appellant was in fact the common-law spouse of Mysan’s mother, the death penalty could not be imposed on appellant because the Information did not specifically allege this relationship.&nbsp; The relationship cannot increase the crime to qualified rape if the Information does not specifically allege the relationship.
