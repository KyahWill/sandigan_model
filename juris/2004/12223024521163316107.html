The dispositive portion of the RTC <i>Decision</i> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court, finding the accused Ramon Dujua guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense in Criminal Case 92-108910 which is for Illegal Recruitment for Violation of Art. 38 (a and b) in relation to Art. 39 of PD 442, as amended by PD 1412 and further amended by PD 1920 and PD 2018, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay fine in the amount of P100,000.00.&nbsp; He is further ordered to pay the private complainants a) Jaime Cabus the amount of P47,000.00; b) Benton [<i>sic</i>] C. Caluten the amount of P26,000.00; and c) Roberto Perlas the amount of&nbsp; P17,000.00. In so far as Romulo Partos is concerned, his case is dismissed. With costs.<br><br>With respect to Criminal Case No. 92-108912 and Criminal Case No. 92-108920 involving private complainants Roberto Perlas and Jaime Cabus, respectively, the Court, finding the accused Ramon Dujua guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged which is for Estafa, hereby sentences him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, eleven (11) months and eleven (11) days of prision correccional as minimum to four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional as maximum for each of the cases.&nbsp; Considering that the accused had been ordered to pay private complainant Roberto Perlas the amount of P17,000.00 and private complainant Jaime Cabus the amount of P47,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 92-108910 for Illegal Recruitment they should not be awarded again the said amounts in these Estafa cases.&nbsp; With costs.<br><br>Considering that the accused Ramon Dujua is a detention prisoner, he shall be credited in the service of his sentence with the full time during which he has undergone preventive imprisonment.<br><br>As against accused Rose Dujua, Editha S. Sing [<i>sic</i>] and Guillermo “Willy” Samson who remained at-large, their cases were archieved [<i>sic</i>] (Order dated November 23, 1992).<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote>Seeking the reversal of his conviction, Ramon Dujua contends that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he committed the crimes of illegal recruitment in large scale and estafa.<br><br>The essential elements of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale are: (1) the accused engages in acts of recruitment and placement of workers defined under Article 13(b) or in any prohibited activities under Art. 34 of the Labor Code; (2) the accused has not complied with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, particularly with respect to the securing of a license or an authority to recruit and deploy workers, either locally or overseas; and (3) the accused commits the unlawful acts against three or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>All three elements have been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>First, the testimonies of the complaining witnesses satisfactorily prove that appellant promised them employment and assured them placement overseas.&nbsp; Complainants were firm and categorical.&nbsp; All of them positively identified appellant as the person who recruited them for employment abroad.&nbsp; Their testimonies dovetail each other on material points.&nbsp; There is no adequate showing that any of them was impelled by any ill motive to testify against appellant.&nbsp; Their testimonies were straightforward, credible and convincing.&nbsp; As against the positive and categorical testimonies of the three complainants, appellant’s mere denials cannot prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>It is irrelevant whether or not complainants’ claims are supported by receipts.&nbsp; The absence of receipts in a case for illegal recruitment does not warrant the acquittal of the appellant and is not fatal to the prosecution’s case. As long as the prosecution is able to establish through credible testimonial evidence that the appellant has engaged in Illegal Recruitment, a conviction for the offense can very well be justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Second, appellant did not have any license or authority to recruit persons for overseas work, as shown by the Certification issued by the POEA.&nbsp; Neither did his employer, the World Pack Travel and Tours, possess such license or authority.<br><br>Third, it bears clarifying that although Romulo Portos was named as among those recruited by appellant the evidence reveals that Romulo withdrew his application in lieu of which his wife Melodea Villanueva applied for placement with appellant.&nbsp; Villanueva, however, is not named as one of appellant’s victims.<br><br>Nevertheless, it has been alleged and proven that appellant undertook the recruitment of not less than three persons, namely, Cabus, Caluten and Perlas.<br><br>The RTC, therefore, aptly meted upon appellant the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P100,000.00, in accordance with Article 39(a) of the Labor Code.<br><br>The following elements of estafa, as defined by Article 315 (2) (a) are also present in this case, to wit: (1) the accused has defrauded the offended party by means of abuse of confidence or by deceit; and (2) as a result, damage or prejudice, which is capable of pecuniary estimation, is caused to the offended party or third person. Appellant misrepresented himself to Jaime Cabus and Roberto Perlas as one who can make arrangements for job placements in Taiwan and Japan and, by reason of such misrepresentations, the two complainants were induced to part with their money, causing them damage.<br><br>The RTC, however, erred in imposing upon appellant, for each count of estafa, the penalty of two (2) years, eleven (11) months and eleven (11) days of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum.&nbsp; Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code provides that:<br><blockquote>ART. 315. <i>Swindling</i> (<i>estafa</i>). — Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1st</span>. The penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period to prision mayor in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 but does not exceed 22,000 pesos, and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.&nbsp; In such case, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <i>prision mayor</i> or <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as the case may be.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">….<br></div><ol> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br></ol><blockquote>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits.</blockquote></blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 92-108920, the prosecution alleged and proved that appellant defrauded complainant Jaime Cabus in the amount of P47,000.00, which exceeds the sum of P22,000.00.&nbsp; Thus, the penalty prescribed, i.e., <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period (4 years, 2 months and 1 day to 6 years) to <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period (6 years and 1 day to 8 years), shall be imposed in its maximum period.<br><br>The penalty prescribed by Article 315, however, is composed of only two, not three, periods, in which case Article 65 of the Revised Penal Code requires the division into three equal portions the time included in the penalty, forming one period of each of the three portions.&nbsp; Applying this provision, the minimum, medium and maximum periods of the penalty prescribed are:<br><blockquote>Maximum - 6 years, 8 months, 21 days to 8 years<br>Medium - 5 years, 5 months, 11 days to 6 years, 8 months, 20 days<br>Minimum - 4 years, 2 months,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 day&nbsp; to&nbsp; 5 years, 5 months, 10 days</blockquote>Thus, the maximum period is 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years.<br><br>Article 315 further states that one year shall be added for each additional P10,000.00 defrauded in excess of P22,000.00.&nbsp;
