CV No. 53757, <i>“In re: Petition for the Probate of the Codicil (Will) of Rufina Reyes; Bernardo Patulandong v. Anselmo Mangulabnan v. Carolina G.

The pertinent portion of her will reads:<br><blockquote>IKALIMA. — <b>Aking inihahayag at ginagawa na tagapagmana, sa aking kusang loob, ang pinalaki kong APO na si ANSELMO P.

Patulandong refused to heed the request, however, in view of the codicil which modified the testator’s will.<br><br>Mangulabnan thus filed an “action for partition” against Patulandong with the Regional Trial Court of Gapan, Nueva Ecija, docketed as Civil Case No. 552 (the partition case).<br><br>On June 8, 1989, the trial court rendered a decision in the partition case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the court orders the partitioning of the properties and the defendant to deliver the copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-47089.<br><br>However, in view <b>of the case cited by the plaintiff himself, the court holds that the partition is without prejudice [to]... the probate of the codicil in accordance with the Rules of Court</b>, [P]alacios vs. Catimbang Palacios cited by the plaintiff:<br><br>“After a will has been probated during the lifetime of the testator, it does not necessarily mean that he cannot alter or revoke the same before his death. Should he make a new will, it would also be allowable of his petition and if he should die before he had a chance to present such petition, the ordinary probate proceedings after the testator’s death would be in order.”<br><br>The Court also orders that the right of the tenants of the agricultural land in question should be protected meaning to say that the tenants should not be ejected.

All that said court could do as regards said properties is to determine whether they should or should not be included in the inventory</b> or list of properties to be administered by the administrator. <b>If there is no dispute, well and good; but if there is, then the parties, the administrator, and the opposing parties <u>have to resort to an ordinary action for a final determination of the conflicting claims of title because the probate court cannot do so</u></b>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Having been apprised of the fact that the property in question was in the possession of third parties and more important, covered by a transfer certificate of title issued in the name of such third parties, the respondent court should have denied the motion of the respondent administrator and excluded the property in question from the inventory of the property of the estate. <b>It had no authority to deprive such third persons of their possession and ownership of the property.</b> x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Following <i>Cuizon</i>, the probate court exceeded its jurisdiction when it further declared the deed of sale and the titles of petitioners null and void, it having had the effect of depriving them possession and ownership of the property.<br><br>Moreover, following Section 48 of the Property Registry Decree which reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 48. <i>Certificate not subject to collateral attack.</i> — A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law,</blockquote>petitioners’ titles cannot, under probate proceedings, be declared null and void.<br><br>As to the second issue, petitioners argue that by allowing the codicil to probate, it in effect amended the final judgment in the partition case which is not allowed by law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and that petitioner Camayas are innocent purchasers for value and enjoy the legal presumption that the transfer was lawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioners’ first argument does not persuade.<br><br>Though the judgment in the partition case had become final and executory as it was not appealed, it specifically provided in its dispositive portion that the decision was <b><u>“without prejudice [to] ... the probate of the codicil.”</u></b> The rights of the prevailing parties in said case were thus subject to the outcome of the probate of the codicil.<br><br>The probate court being bereft of authority to rule upon the validity of petitioners’ titles, there is no longer any necessity to dwell on the merits of petitioners Camayas’ claim that they are innocent purchasers for value and enjoy the legal presumption that the transfer was lawful.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED IN PART</b>.<br></div><br>The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 19, 2000 in CA-G.R.
