The undersigned also arrived at about 9:30 AM and confronted Sheriff Luna who admitted that he was under the instruction of Atty. Edralin. He advised the undersigned to talk to Honorable Judge Augustus Diaz at the City Hall and he promised that he will withhold the demolition up to 3:00 o’clock in that afternoon to give me a chance to talk with Judge Diaz.

No one from the tenants was allowed to retrieved (<em>sic</em>) their remaining personal properties including one Sony 14 inches colored TV, an electric fan standard brand and an office table with some documents therein owned by the undersigned.

These allegedly forged signatures are that of Mr. Gabriel Eugenio, an employee of the Court, to indicate that they have been released through registered mail.<br><br>The defendant Octavio Alvarez received the decision on January 7, 1998. He had, therefore, until January 22, 1998 within which to file a notice of appeal.&nbsp; He filed a notice of appeal on January 14, 1998 x x x The xeroxed copies of the receipt of payments were forwarded to the Court on February 23, 1998.<br><br>On January 23, 1998, the day after the lapse of the period for him to file a notice of appeal, defendant Alvarez had not yet posted the required supersedeas bond in order to stay the execution of judgment.<br><br>The complainant also alleged that the undersigned promised to Judge Arreola that the undersigned will stop the demolition. x x x [I]f people come to see the undersigned to request for accommodation, it is just the character of the undersigned that he is only being polite to them. But this does not mean that he gives in to requests for accommodation outrightly. The undersigned likewise sees to it that such requests are meritorious, just, and valid under the circumstances. x x x The alleged request, if there was any, was not in accordance with the foregoing. Certainly, it was not legal and proper. Furthermore, the undersigned did not make any promise to Judge Arreola. If ever he talked to Judge Arreola, it is certain that no promises were made.<br><br>As to the charge that the materials were confiscated by the undersigned, the Clerk of Court and Deputy Sheriff, the undersigned vehemently denies such acts were committed. The undersigned never even went to the premises in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (<i>emphasis ours</i>) </blockquote> For their part, respondents Clerk of Court Victory Edralin and Deputy Sheriff Luna submitted a Joint Answer dated October 5, 1998, strongly denying the allegations of the complainant that they solicited gifts and demanded P100,000 from him in exchange for the dismissal of the forcible entry case. The pertinent portions of their answer read: <blockquote> Let it be noted that the original Complaint in Civil Case No. 13857, for Forcible Entry x x x was filed with our Court on October 27, 1995, and complainant Octavio Alvarez was not cited as co-defendant therein. We never came to meet nor have we talked with Mr. Octavio Alvarez in December of 1995 regarding aforesaid case. So how could this alleged asking of PhP100,000.00 for the dismissal of the complaint for Forcible Entry x x x and the solicitation of gifts from the complainant happened who was NOT a party to the case.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</center><br>On January 29, 1998, plaintiffs filed their Motion For Issuance Of Writ Of Execution, setting said motion for hearing on February 3, 1998. A copy of this motion was duly furnished Atty. Bernardo Nera, counsel for the defendants, on the same date x x x as shown by the stamp that it was received by the office of Atty. Nera. This is also contrary to the allegation of Mr. Octavio Alvarez that his counsel was never furnished a copy of this motion.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>On February 27, 1998, plaintiffs filed their Motion For Writ of Demolition. On this point, Mr. Octavio Alvarez was hammering on the fact again that said motion was never set for hearing. The Court did not see the necessity in setting the motion for hearing anymore as it would be just <i><b>an idle ceremony</b></i> considering that the defendants have failed to post the requisite supersedeas bond.<br><br><center>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>That it is not also true that on March 11, 1998, the undersigned Branch Clerk of Court was at subject premises while the demolition was going on because she was never been there. In fact, a son of Mr. Octavio Alvarez took pictures while the demolition was going on x x x. But yet, these pictures do not depict that Branch Clerk of Court Victory A. Edralin was there present.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>That this Octavio Alvarez has an axe to grind against the Branch Clerk of Court because sometime in the morning of March 11 1998, the day of the demolition, Atty. Rebeck Espiritu, the new lawyer of Mr. Octavio Alvarez, called her up at her office. Atty. Espiritu informed her that together with Judge Pedro Areola, an RTC Judge in Quezon City, (the latter claims that a brother-in-law of his is in turn the brother-in-law of Mr. Octavio Alvarez), they went to see Judge Augustus C. Diaz xxx and allegedly Judge Areola prevailed upon Judge Diaz to issue an Order for the stopping of the demolition. Atty. Espiritu asked the Branch Clerk of Court whether she has prepared the Order for the stopping of the demolition and when she told Atty. Espiritu that Judge Diaz has not yet advised her to prepare one, Atty. Espiritu then told her to prepare the order for the stopping of the demolition and to have it signed at once by Judge Diaz. The Branch Clerk inquired from Atty. Espiritu whether they have already filed their supersede (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) as bond and if there was any motion for reconsideration in order that the Court will have a basis to reconsider its Order for demolition. But this only infuriated Atty. Espiritu as he said there was no more time to draft one and he reminded the Branch Clerk of Court again that Judge Diaz promised this Order to Judge Areola and the latter was expecting this Order x x x since there was no order from Judge Diaz for her to prepare the requested Order x x x she did not prepare the requested order xxx. This is the very reason why Octavio Alvarez is dragging the Branch Clerk of Court into this complaint. He expected her to succumb to their pressure and make her a tool to (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) their unjust, illegal, and improper conduct.<br><br>The fact that the Branch Clerk of Court did not succumb to the pressure of the complainant to prepare the requested Order for the stopping of the demolition only proves the truth that the alleged solicitation of gifts never happened in this case. For why did the Branch Clerk of Court not give in to the request of the complainant if she had indeed solicited gifts from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (<i>emphasis ours</i>) </blockquote> In his Reply to the answers of respondents, dated November 19, 1998, complainant Alvarez insisted that Deputy Sheriff Luna&nbsp; and&nbsp; Clerk&nbsp; of Court Edralin were aware from the very start that he was the principal litigant in the complaint for forcible entry, even if the original complaint filed on October 27, 1995 did not include him as one of the defendants. He also alleged that it was respondent Judge Diaz who required him and his counsel to get an RTC Judge to state that his (Judge Diaz’s) orders were incorrect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In her Rejoinder to the complainant’s reply dated January 4, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> respondent Clerk of Court Edralin countered that she never saw complainant appear in court after the original complaint for forcible entry was filed on October 27, 1995.&nbsp; The first time she ever spoke with complainant regarding the case was during the first ocular inspection of the premises on April 22, 1996. Complainant called up one of his tenants, telling the latter to give the phone to the clerk of court because he (complainant) wanted to talk to her. According to respondent clerk of court, this belied the allegations of complainant that she demanded money from him in December 1995 since she did not meet nor talk to complainant at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Court Administrator Alfredo Benipayo, in his Report dated March 13, 2000, found the versions of the parties conflicting and suspected that "there (was) more to the case than (met) the eye." He thus recommended that the charges against Judge Diaz, Clerk of Court Edralin and Deputy Sheriff Luna be assigned to a consultant for a full-blown investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In our Resolution dated June 14, 2000, we resolved to re-docket the case as a regular administrative matter, A.M. No. MTJ-00-1283.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Retired Justice Narciso T. Atienza was assigned as consultant to investigate the charges. In his Report, Investigating Justice Atienza found respondent Judge Diaz guilty of "gross ignorance of basic procedural laws and grave misconduct prejudicial to the interest of the service" for (1) issuing a writ of demolition without notice and hearing, and (2) taking cognizance of plaintiffs' fatally defective Motion for Execution and Motion for Demolition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As to the charges against respondents Clerk of Court Edralin and Deputy Sheriff Luna, Justice Atienza found no substantial evidence to support the accusations of grave misconduct and solicitation of gifts. However, he found respondent clerk of court guilty of "ignorance of the law" for accepting the fatally defective motions of the plaintiffs. Accordingly, Justice Atienza recommended that: <blockquote> Judge Augustus C. Diaz be penalized to pay a fine of P20,000.00. Respondent Clerk of Court be ordered to pay a fine of P5,000 and the charge against Deputy Sheriff Luna be dismissed for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </blockquote> After a meticulous review of the records, we find respondent Judge Diaz guilty of gross ignorance of basic procedural laws and grave abuse of authority.&nbsp; On the other hand, we find the evidence against respondents Clerk of Court Edralin and Deputy Sheriff Luna insufficient to hold them liable for grave misconduct and solicitation of gifts. We, however, find respondent clerk of court guilty of ignorance of the law and incompetence in the performance of official duties for accepting the fatally defective motions of the plaintiffs.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Complainant Alvarez alleged that the respondent judge abused his authority in issuing the following defective orders: <blockquote> a) the order dismissing complainant's notice of appeal despite payment of the appellate docket fees on time and the absence of any&nbsp; motion to dismiss the said notice of appeal;<br><br>b) the order granting plaintiff's Motion for Execution despite a perfected notice of appeal filed by complainant and failure to furnish a copy of the same to the complainant; and<br><br>c) the order granting plaintiff's <i>ex parte</i> Motion for Demolition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </blockquote> As to the propriety of the first order, we find that respondent Judge Diaz did not abuse his authority in initially dismissing complainant Alvarez’s Notice of Appeal inasmuch as the latter failed to submit to the court the official receipts showing payment of the appellate docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The last day for filing the appellate docket fees was on January 22, 1998, since complainant Alvarez received a copy of the decision&nbsp;&nbsp; on January 7, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> On January 15, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> complainant Alvarez paid the appellate docket fees but, for unknown reasons, he failed to submit the original copies of the official receipts to the MeTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He only submitted photocopies thereof on February 23, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Thus, on February 3, 1998, upon verification from the records that complainant had not paid the appellate docket fees within the appeal period, respondent judge correctly dismissed complainant's notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Certainly, no abuse of authority can be attributed to respondent judge for that.<br><br>Complainant further alleged that respondent judge abused his authority in dismissing his Notice of Appeal despite the absence of a motion to dismiss said order. We hold, however, that respondent judge may <i>motu proprio</i> dismiss complainant's notice of appeal in accordance with Section 13, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court which provides that "prior to the transmittal of the original record or the record on appeal to the appellate court, the trial court may <i>motu proprio</i>, or on motion, dismiss the appeal for having been taken out of time."<br><br>Respondent judge was therefore correct in granting plaintiff's Motion for Execution on February 3, 1998 on the grounds that (1) there was no perfected Notice of Appeal and (2) as admitted by the complainant himself, there was no payment of the <i>supersedeas</i> bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>However, even if there was no perfected Notice of Appeal and payment of the supersedeas bond, respondent judge should not have granted plaintiff's Motion for Execution because it was fatally defective. Section 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court provides: <blockquote> Sec. 5. Notice of Hearing.&nbsp; — <i>The notice of hearing shall be addressed to all parties concerned</i>, and shall specify the time and date of the hearing which must not be later than ten (10) days after the filing of the motion. (emphasis ours) </blockquote> It is well-settled that any motion with a notice of hearing <i>that is not addressed to all parties</i>, in violation of Section 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, is a mere scrap of paper which should not be accepted for filing and, if filed, is not entitled to judicial cognizance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, the notice of hearing of the motion for execution was addressed only to the clerk of court and not to the parties: <blockquote> The Clerk of Court <br>MTC Branch 37 <br>Quezon City<br><br>Kindly&nbsp; include&nbsp; this&nbsp; motion&nbsp; in&nbsp; your&nbsp; calendar&nbsp; for&nbsp; February 3, 1998 at 8:30 in the morning during which the matter and parties may be heard.

Conrado A. Leaño, respondent clerk of court’s counsel, who testified that he (Atty. Leaño) <i>personally</i> delivered a copy of the Motion for Execution to complainant's counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>If personal service of the motion was made upon complainant's counsel, then proof of service thereof consisting of any of the following should have been presented to the court, together with the Motion for Execution: <blockquote> Section 13. Proof of service. — x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> a written admission of the party served, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the official return of the server, or <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the affidavit of the party serving containing a full statement of the date, place and manner of service x x x. </blockquote> None of the above was presented. Thus, in accordance with Section 6, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court which mandates the "no written motion set for hearing shall be acted upon by the court without proof of service thereof," the motion for execution should not have been acted upon by the respondent judge.<br><br>Complainant also charged respondent judge with grave abuse of authority for granting plaintiff's Motion for Demolition without notice and hearing. In his answer, respondent judge argued that a hearing for the Motion for Demolition was "moot and academic" as his decision in the forcible entry case already included the demolition of the structures in the subject premises.<br><br>During the hearing conducted by Investigating Justice Narciso Atienza, respondent judge admitted "with confidence" that no hearing was necessary for the Motion for Demolition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Section 10 (d), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court provides: <blockquote> (d) Removal of improvements on property subject of execution. — When the property subject of the execution contains improvements constructed or planted by the judgment obligor or his agent, the officer shall not destroy, demolish or remove said improvements <i>except upon special order of the court, issued upon motion of the judgment obligee after due hearing and after the former has failed to remove the same within a reasonable time fixed by the court.

Clearly, his actuation amounted to gross ignorance of the law.<br><br>In fact, respondent judge's own testimony clearly showed his gross ignorance of basic procedural laws, thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%">ATTY.

Complainant Alvarez alleged that, sometime before Christmas of 1995, respondents Clerk of Court Edralin and Deputy Sheriff Luna asked for P100,000 from him in exchange for the dismissal of the complaint for forcible entry. Complainant Alvarez said he refused the request though, on several occasions, he gave respondents gifts they allegedly solicited from him. Before Christmas of 1995, he claimed to have given respondent clerk of court a “Guchi” (sic) lady's wrist watch and golden necklace with pendant, and to respondent deputy sheriff, a Dunhill men's jacket and P5,000. Before New Year’s Day, he said he gave respondent deputy sheriff a golden pendant and two bottles of Fundador brandy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In his report, Investigating Justice Atienza did not believe complainant Alvarez's allegations because these were in conflict with the fact on record that complainant was, at that time, not yet a party to the forcible entry case.&nbsp; There was no reason for the respondents to demand money from complainant Alvarez who was then a stranger to the forcible entry case. Furthermore, the unexplained delay in the filing of the administrative complaints against respondents clerk of court and deputy sheriff affected complainant's credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>After a careful review of the records, we affirm the findings of Investigating Justice Atienza.&nbsp; It is worth reiterating that the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt in administrative cases is substantial evidence, meaning, such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Members of the judiciary may be disciplined but only after due investigation and the presentation of substantial evidence, specially considering that charges of this nature are penal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In his testimony, complainant Alvarez admitted that respondent clerk of court did not demand any money from him and that it was only respondent deputy sheriff who tried to illegally solicit money for the dismissal of the forcible entry case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> However, complainant Alvarez was not able to prove his allegation against respondent deputy sheriff.&nbsp; Records show that, when respondent deputy sheriff allegedly demanded money from complainant sometime in December 1995, complainant was not yet a party to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Complainant Alvarez himself admitted as much in his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> He was only made a party to the amended complaint filed on June 17, 1996. This made complainant’s claim of extortion in December 1995 unworthy of belief.<br><br>Complainant Alvarez, however, argued that respondent deputy sheriff knew that he was a party to the forcible entry case right from its start in the barangay conciliation proceedings. Allegedly, respondent also acted as sheriff in some of the ejectment cases he had previously filed against his tenants and that they (complainant and respondent deputy sheriff) purportedly talked about the forcible entry case against him. Complainant promised to present documentary evidence to prove that respondent had indeed acted as sheriff in some of his previous cases but he never did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; In any case, these circumstances were not sufficient to prove that respondent deputy sheriff demanded money from him.<br><br>Complainant moreover alleged that it was precisely because of his failure to give in to the monetary demand of respondent deputy sheriff that his name was included in the complaint. He, however, failed to present evidence to show that the plaintiffs, their counsel and respondent deputy sheriff conspired with one other to include him in the complaint. In reality, what complainant's testimony showed was that it was only "his belief" that respondent deputy sheriff had something to do with his inclusion in the amended complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This hardly constituted substantial evidence.&nbsp; A charge of extortion is a serious charge. A finding of guilt can result in dismissal and thus cannot be based on mere speculation but on substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>As to the charge that respondents clerk of court and deputy sheriff solicited gifts from him, we find that complainant likewise failed to substantiate his claim.
