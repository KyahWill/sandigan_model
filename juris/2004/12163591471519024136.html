				<BR><BR><div align="justify">“Good fences make good neighbors,” so observed Robert Frost, the archetype of traditional New England detachment.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">Frost</span> ethos has been heeded by nations adjusting to the effects of the liberalized global market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Philippines, for one, enacted Republic Act&nbsp; (Rep. Act) No. 8751 (on the imposition of countervailing duties), Rep. Act No. 8752 (on the imposition of anti-dumping duties) and, finally, Rep. Act No. 8800, also known as the Safeguard Measures Act (“SMA”)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> soon after it joined the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The SMA provides the structure and mechanics for the imposition of emergency measures, including tariffs, to protect domestic industries and producers from increased imports which inflict or could inflict serious injury on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The wisdom of the policies behind the SMA, however, is not put into question by the petition at bar.&nbsp; The questions submitted to the Court relate to the means and the procedures ordained in the law to ensure that the determination of the imposition or non-imposition of a safeguard measure is proper.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Antecedent Facts</span><br><br>Petitioner Southern Cross Cement Corporation (“Southern Cross”) is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of cement manufacturing, production, importation and exportation. Its principal stockholders are Taiheiyo Cement Corporation and Tokuyama Corporation, purportedly the largest cement manufacturers in Japan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Private respondent Philippine Cement Manufacturers Corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (“Philcemcor”) is an association of domestic cement manufacturers. It has eighteen (18) members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> per <span style="font-style: italic;">Record</span>.&nbsp; While Philcemcor heralds itself to be an association of domestic cement manufacturers, it appears that considerable equity holdings, if not controlling interests in at least twelve (12) of its member-corporations, were acquired by the three largest cement manufacturers in the world, namely Financiere Lafarge S.A. of France, Cemex S.A. de C.V. of Mexico, and Holcim Ltd. of Switzerland (formerly Holderbank Financiere Glaris, Ltd., then Holderfin B.V.).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 22 May 2001, respondent Department of Trade and Industry (“DTI”) accepted an application from Philcemcor, alleging that the importation of gray Portland cement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in increased quantities has caused declines in domestic production, capacity utilization, market share, sales and employment; as well as caused depressed local prices. Accordingly, Philcemcor sought the imposition at first of provisional, then later, definitive safeguard measures on the import of cement pursuant to the SMA. Philcemcor filed the application in behalf of twelve (12) of its member-companies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After preliminary investigation, the Bureau of Import Services of the DTI, determined that critical circumstances existed justifying the imposition of provisional measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On 7 November 2001, the DTI issued an <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span>, imposing a provisional measure equivalent to Twenty Pesos and Sixty Centavos (P20.60) per forty (40) kilogram bag on all importations of gray Portland cement for a period not exceeding two hundred (200) days from the date of issuance by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) of the implementing <span style="font-style: italic;">Customs Memorandum Order</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The corresponding <span style="font-style: italic;">Customs Memorandum Order</span> was issued on 10 December 2001, to take effect that same day and to remain in force for two hundred (200) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, the Tariff Commission, on 19 November 2001, received a request from the DTI for a formal investigation to determine whether or not to impose a definitive safeguard measure on imports of gray Portland cement, pursuant to Section 9 of the SMA and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. A notice of commencement of formal investigation was published in the newspapers on 21 November 2001. Individual notices were likewise sent to concerned parties, such as Philcemcor, various importers and exporters, the Embassies of Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan, contractors/builders associations, industry associations, cement workers’ groups, consumer groups, non-government organizations and concerned government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> A preliminary conference was held on 27 November 2001, attended by several concerned parties, including Southern Cross.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Subsequently, the Tariff Commission&nbsp; received several position papers both in support and against Philcemcor’s application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The Tariff Commission also visited the corporate offices and manufacturing facilities of each of the applicant companies, as well as that of Southern&nbsp; Cross and two other cement importers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On 13 March 2002, the Tariff Commission issued its Formal Investigation Report (“Report”). Among the factors studied by the Tariff Commission in its Report were the market share of the domestic industry,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> production and sales,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> capacity utilization,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> financial performance and profitability,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and return on sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; The Tariff Commission arrived at the following conclusions:<blockquote><ol><li>The circumstances provided in Article XIX of GATT 1994 need not be demonstrated since the product under consideration (gray Portland cement) is not the subject of any Philippine obligation or tariff concession under the WTO Agreement. Nonetheless, such inquiry is governed by the national legislation (R.A. 8800) and the terms and conditions of the Agreement on Safeguards.</li><br><li>The collective output of the twelve (12) applicant companies constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of gray Portland cement and blended Portland cement.</li><br><li>Locally produced gray Portland cement and blended Portland cement (Pozzolan) are “like” to imported gray Portland cement.</li><br><li>Gray Portland cement is being imported into the Philippines in increased quantities, both in absolute terms and relative to domestic production, starting in 2000.&nbsp; The increase in volume of imports is recent, sudden, sharp and significant.</li><br><li>The industry has not suffered and is not suffering significant overall impairment in its condition, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., serious injury.</li><br><li>There is no threat of serious injury that is imminent from imports of gray Portland cement.</li><br><li>Causation has become moot and academic in view of the negative determination of the elements of serious injury and imminent threat of serious injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Accordingly, the Tariff Commission made the following recommendation, to wit:<blockquote>The elements of serious injury and imminent threat of serious injury not having been established, it is hereby recommended that no definitive general safeguard measure be imposed on the importation of gray Portland cement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The DTI received the Report on 14 March 2002. After reviewing the report, then DTI Secretary Manuel Roxas II (“DTI Secretary”) disagreed with the conclusion of the Tariff Commission that there was no serious injury to the local cement industry caused by the surge of imports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In view of this disagreement, the DTI requested an opinion from the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on the DTI Secretary’s scope of options in acting on the Commission’s recommendations. Subsequently, then DOJ Secretary Hernando Perez rendered an opinion stating that Section 13 of the SMA precluded a review by the DTI Secretary of the Tariff Commission’s negative finding, or finding that a definitive safeguard measure should not be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On 5 April 2002, the DTI Secretary promulgated a <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>. After quoting the conclusions of the Tariff Commission, the DTI Secretary noted the DTI’s disagreement with the conclusions. However, he also cited the DOJ Opinion advising the DTI that it was bound by the negative finding of the Tariff Commission.&nbsp; Thus, he ruled as follows:<blockquote>The DTI has no alternative but to abide by the [Tariff] Commission’s recommendations.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</span>, and in accordance with Section 13 of RA 8800 which states:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the event of a negative final determination</span>; or if the cash bond is in excess of the definitive safeguard duty assessed, the Secretary shall immediately issue, through the Secretary of Finance, a written instruction to the Commissioner of Customs, authorizing the return of the cash bond or the remainder thereof, as the case may be, previously collected as provisional general safeguard measure within ten (10) days from the date a final decision has been made; Provided, that the government shall not be liable for any interest on the amount to be returned. The Secretary shall not accept for consideration another petition from the same industry, with respect to the same imports of the product under consideration within one (1) year after the date of rendering such a decision.”</span></blockquote>The DTI hereby issues the following:<blockquote>The application for safeguard measures against the importation of gray Portland cement filed by PHILCEMCOR (Case No. 02-2001) is hereby denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>Philcemcor received a copy of the DTI <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> on 12 April 2002.&nbsp; Ten days later, it filed with the Court of Appeals a <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> seeking to set aside the DTI <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>, as well as the Tariff Commission’s Report. Philcemcor likewise applied for a <span style="font-style: italic;">Temporary Restraining Order/Injunction</span> to enjoin the DTI and the BOC from implementing the questioned <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> and Report.&nbsp; It prayed that the Court of Appeals direct the DTI Secretary to disregard the Report and to render judgment independently of the Report.&nbsp; Philcemcor argued that the DTI Secretary, vested as he is under the law with the power of review, is not bound to adopt the recommendations of the Tariff Commission; and, that the Report is void, as it is predicated on a flawed framework, inconsistent inferences and erroneous methodology.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On 10 June 2002, Southern Cross filed its <span style="font-style: italic;">Comment</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It argued that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction over Philcemcor’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span>, for it is on the Court of Tax Appeals (“CTA”) that the SMA conferred jurisdiction to review rulings of the Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure.&nbsp; It likewise argued that Philcemcor’s resort to the special civil action of certiorari is improper, considering that what Philcemcor sought to rectify is an error of judgment and not an error of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that a petition for review with the CTA was available as a plain, speedy and adequate remedy. Finally, Southern Cross echoed the DOJ Opinion that Section 13 of the SMA precludes a review by the DTI Secretary of a negative finding of the Tariff Commission.<br><br>After conducting a hearing on 19 June 2002 on Philcemcor’s application for preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals’ Twelfth Division<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> granted the writ sought in its <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 21 June 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Seven days later, on 28 June 2002, the two-hundred (200)-day period for the imposition of the provisional measure expired. Despite the lapse of the period, the BOC continued to impose the provisional measure on all importations of Portland cement made by Southern Cross. The uninterrupted assessment of the tariff, according to Southern Cross, worked to its detriment to the point that the continued imposition would eventually lead to its closure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Southern Cross timely filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span> of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> on 9 September 2002.&nbsp; Alleging that Philcemcor was not entitled to provisional relief, Southern Cross likewise sought a clarificatory order as to whether the grant of the writ of preliminary injunction could extend the earlier imposition of the provisional measure beyond the two hundred (200)-day limit imposed by law. The appeals’ court failed to take immediate action on Southern Cross’s motion despite the four (4) motions for early resolution the latter filed between September of 2002 and February of 2003.&nbsp; After six (6) months, on 19 February 2003, the Court of Appeals directed Philcemcor to comment on Southern Cross’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> After Philcemcor filed its <span style="font-style: italic;">Opposition</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> on 13 March 2003, Southern Cross filed another set of four (4) motions for early resolution.<br><br>Despite the efforts of Southern Cross, the Court of Appeals failed to directly resolve the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>. Instead, on 5 June 2003, it rendered a <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> granting in part Philcemcor’s petition. The appellate court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the petition for certiorari since it alleged grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; It refused to annul the findings of the Tariff Commission, citing the rule that factual findings of administrative agencies are binding upon the courts and its corollary, that courts should not interfere in matters addressed to the sound discretion and coming under the special technical knowledge and training of such agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Nevertheless, it&nbsp; held that the DTI Secretary is not bound by the factual findings of the Tariff Commission since such&nbsp; findings are merely recommendatory and they fall within the ambit of the Secretary’s discretionary review.&nbsp; It determined that the legislative intent is to grant the DTI Secretary the power to make a final decision on the Tariff Commission’s recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> reads:<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, based on the foregoing premises, petitioner’s prayer to set aside the findings of the Tariff Commission in its assailed Report dated March 13, 2002 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.&nbsp; On the other hand, the assailed April 5, 2002 Decision of the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>.&nbsp; Consequently, the case is <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> to the public respondent Secretary of Department of Trade and Industry for a final decision in accordance with RA 8800 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>On 23 June 2003, Southern Cross filed the present petition, assailing the appellate court’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> for departing from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, and not deciding the substantial questions in accordance with law and jurisprudence.&nbsp; The petition argues in the main that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction over Philcemcor’s petition, the proper remedy being a petition for review with the CTA conformably with the SMA, and; that the factual findings of the Tariff Commission on the existence or non-existence conditions warranting the imposition of general safeguard measures are binding upon the DTI Secretary.<br><br>The timely filing of Southern Cross’s petition before this Court necessarily prevented the Court of Appeals <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> from becoming final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Yet on 25 June 2003, the DTI Secretary issued a new <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>, ruling this time that that in light of the appellate court’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> there was no longer any legal impediment to his deciding Philcemcor’s application for definitive safeguard measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He made a determination that, contrary to the findings of the Tariff Commission, the local cement industry had suffered serious injury as a result of the import surges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Accordingly, he imposed a definitive safeguard measure on the importation of gray Portland cement, in the form of a definitive safeguard duty in the amount of <s>P</s>20.60/40 kg. bag for three years on imported gray Portland Cement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On 7 July 2003, Southern Cross filed with the Court a “<span style="font-style: italic;">Very Urgent Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or A Writ of Preliminary Injunction</span>” (“TRO <span style="font-style: italic;">Application</span>”), seeking to enjoin the DTI Secretary from enforcing his <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of 25 June 2003 in view of the pending petition before this Court.&nbsp; Philcemcor filed an opposition, claiming, among others, that it is not this Court but the CTA that has jurisdiction over the application under the law.<br><br>On 1 August 2003, Southern Cross filed with the CTA a <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition for Review</span>, assailing the DTI Secretary’s 25 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> which imposed the definite safeguard measure. Prescinding from this action, Philcemcor filed with this Court a <span style="font-style: italic;">Manifestation and Motion to Dismiss</span> in regard to Southern Cross’s petition, alleging that it deliberately and willfully resorted to forum-shopping.&nbsp; It points out that Southern Cross’s TRO <span style="font-style: italic;">Application</span> seeks to enjoin the DTI Secretary’s second decision, while its <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span> before the CTA prays for the annulment of the same decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Reiterating its <span style="font-style: italic;">Comment</span> on Southern Cross’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition for Review</span>, Philcemcor also argues that the CTA, being a special court of limited jurisdiction, could only review the ruling of the DTI Secretary when a safeguard measure is imposed, and that the factual findings of the Tariff Commission are not binding on the DTI Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>After giving due course to Southern Cross’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span>, the Court called the case for oral argument on 18 February 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> At the oral argument, attended by the counsel for Philcemcor and Southern Cross and the Office of the Solicitor General, the Court simplified the issues in this wise: (i) whether the <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of the DTI Secretary is appealable to the CTA or the Court of Appeals; (ii) assuming that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, whether its <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> is in accordance with law; and, (iii) whether a <span style="font-style: italic;">Temporary Restraining Order</span> is warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>During the oral arguments, counsel for Southern Cross manifested that due to the imposition of the general safeguard measures, Southern Cross was forced to cease operations in the Philippines in November of 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Propriety of the Temporary Restraining Order</span><br><br>Before the merits of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span>, a brief comment on Southern Cross’s application for provisional relief.&nbsp; It sought to enjoin the DTI Secretary from enforcing the definitive safeguard measure he imposed in his 25 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>. The Court did not grant the provisional relief for it would be tantamount to enjoining the collection of taxes, a peremptory judicial act which is traditionally frowned upon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> unless there is a clear statutory basis for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In that regard, Section 218 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 prohibits any court from granting an injunction to restrain the collection of any national internal revenue tax, fee or charge imposed by the internal revenue code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> A similar philosophy is expressed by Section 29 of the SMA, which states that the filing of a petition for review before the CTA does not stop, suspend, or otherwise toll the imposition or collection of&nbsp; the appropriate tariff duties or the adoption of other appropriate safeguard measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This evinces a clear legislative intent that the imposition of safeguard measures, despite the availability of judicial review, should not be enjoined notwithstanding any timely appeal of the imposition.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Forum-Shopping Issue</span><br><br>In the same breath, we are not convinced that the allegation of forum-shopping has been duly proven, or that sanction should befall upon Southern Cross and its counsel. The standard by Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure in order that sanction may be had is that “the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The standard implies a malicious intent to subvert procedural rules, and such state of mind is not evident in this case.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Jurisdictional Issue</span><br><br>On to the merits of the present petition.<br><br>In its assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>, the Court of Appeals, after asserting only in brief that it had jurisdiction over Philcemcor’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span>, discussed the issue of whether or not the DTI Secretary is bound to adopt the negative recommendation of the Tariff Commission on the application for safeguard measure.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals maintained that it had jurisdiction over the petition, as it alleged grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DTI Secretary, thus:<blockquote>A perusal of the instant petition reveals allegations of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DTI Secretary in rendering the assailed April 5, 2002 Decision wherein it was ruled that he had no alternative but to abide by the findings of the Commission on the matter of safeguard measures for the local cement industry. Abuse of discretion is admittedly within the ambit of certiorari.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. It is alleged that, in the assailed Decision, the DTI Secretary gravely abused his discretion in wantonly evading to discharge his duty to render an independent determination or decision in imposing a definitive safeguard measure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote>We do not doubt that the Court of Appeals’ certiorari powers extend to correcting grave abuse of discretion on the part of an officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> However, the special civil action of certiorari is available only when there is no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Southern Cross relies on this limitation, stressing that Section 29 of the SMA is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law which Philcemcor did not avail of.&nbsp; The Section reads:<blockquote>Section 29. <span style="font-style: italic;">Judicial Review</span>. – Any interested party who is adversely affected by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ruling of the Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure</span> may file with the CTA, a petition for review of such ruling within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof. Provided, <span style="font-style: italic;">however</span>, that the filing of such petition for review shall not in any way stop, suspend or otherwise toll the imposition or collection of the appropriate tariff duties or the adoption of other appropriate safeguard measures, as the case may be.<br><br>The petition for review shall comply with the same requirements and shall follow the same rules of procedure and shall be subject to the same disposition as in appeals in connection with adverse rulings on tax matters to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>It is not difficult to divine why the legislature singled out the CTA as the court with jurisdiction to review the ruling of the DTI Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure. The Court has long recognized the legislative determination to vest sole and exclusive jurisdiction on matters involving internal revenue and customs duties to such a specialized court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> By the very nature of its function, the CTA is dedicated exclusively to the study and consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>At the same time, since the CTA is a court of limited jurisdiction, its jurisdiction to take cognizance of a case should be clearly conferred and should not be deemed to exist on mere implication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Concededly, Rep. Act No. 1125, the statute creating the CTA, does not extend to it the power to review decisions of the DTI Secretary in connection with the imposition of safeguard measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Of course, at that time which was before the advent of trade liberalization the notion of safeguard measures or safety nets was not yet in vogue.<br><br>Undeniably, however, the SMA expanded the jurisdiction of the CTA by including review of the rulings of the DTI Secretary in connection with the imposition of safeguard measures.&nbsp; However, Philcemcor and the public respondents agree that the CTA has appellate jurisdiction over a decision of the DTI Secretary imposing a safeguard measure, but not when his ruling is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> to impose such measure.<br><br>In a related development, Rep. Act No. 9282, enacted on 30 March 2004, expressly vests unto the CTA jurisdiction over “[d]ecisions of the Secretary of Trade and Industry,&nbsp; in case of nonagricultural product, commodity or article xxx involving xxx <span style="font-weight: bold;">safeguard measures under Republic Act No. 8800, where either party may appeal the decision to impose or not to impose said duties</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Had Rep. Act No. 9282 already been in force at the beginning of the incidents subject of this case, there would have been no need to make any deeper inquiry as to the extent of the CTA’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; But as Rep. Act No. 9282 cannot be applied retroactively to the present case, the question of whether such jurisdiction extends to a decision not to impose a safeguard measure will have to be settled principally on the basis of the SMA.<br><br>Under Section 29 of the SMA, there are three requisites to enable the CTA to acquire jurisdiction over the petition for review contemplated therein: (i) there must be a ruling by the DTI Secretary; (ii) the petition must be filed by an interested party adversely affected by the ruling; and (iii) such ruling must be in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure. The first two requisites are clearly present.&nbsp; The third requisite deserves closer scrutiny.<br><br>Contrary to the stance of the&nbsp; public respondents and Philcemcor, in this case where&nbsp; the DTI Secretary decides not to impose a safeguard measure,&nbsp; it is the CTA which has jurisdiction to review his decision.&nbsp; The reasons are as follows:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>.&nbsp; Split jurisdiction is abhorred.<br><br>Essentially, respondents’ position is that judicial review of the DTI Secretary’s ruling is exercised by two different courts, depending on whether or not it imposes a safeguard measure, and&nbsp; in either case the court exercising jurisdiction does so to the exclusion of the other.&nbsp; Thus, if the DTI decision involves the imposition of a safeguard measure it is the CTA which has appellate jurisdiction; otherwise, it is the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Such setup is as novel and unusual as it is cumbersome and unwise. Essentially, respondents advocate that Section 29 of the SMA has established split appellate jurisdiction over rulings of&nbsp; the DTI Secretary on the imposition of safeguard measure.<br><br>This interpretation cannot be favored, as the Court has consistently refused to sanction split jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The power of the DTI Secretary to adopt or withhold a safeguard measure emanates from the same statutory source, and it boggles the mind why the appeal modality would be such that one appellate court is qualified if what is to be reviewed is a positive determination, and it is not if what is appealed is a negative determination. In deciding whether or not to impose a safeguard measure, provisional or general, the DTI Secretary would be evaluating only one body of facts and applying them to one set of laws.&nbsp; The reviewing tribunal will be called upon to examine the same facts and the same laws, whether or not the determination is positive or negative.<br><br>In short, if we were to rule for respondents we would be confirming the exercise by two judicial bodies of jurisdiction over basically the same subject matter¾precisely the split-jurisdiction situation which is anathema to the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The Court cannot accept that such was the legislative motive especially considering that the law expressly confers on the CTA, the tribunal with the specialized competence over tax and tariff matters, the role of judicial review without mention of any other court that may exercise corollary or ancillary jurisdiction in relation to the SMA.&nbsp; The provision refers to the Court of Appeals but only in regard to procedural rules and dispositions of appeals from the CTA to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The principle enunciated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tejada v. Homestead Property Corporation</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> is applicable to the case at bar:<blockquote>The Court agrees with the observation of the [that] when an administrative agency or body is conferred quasi-judicial functions, <span style="font-weight: bold;">all controversies relating to the subject matter pertaining to its specialization are deemed to be included within the jurisdiction of said administrative agency or body. Split jurisdiction is not favored</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>. The interpretation of the provisions of the SMA favors vesting untrammeled appellate jurisdiction on the CTA.<br><br>A plain reading of Section 29 of the SMA reveals that Congress did not expressly bar the CTA from reviewing a negative determination by the DTI Secretary nor conferred on the Court of Appeals such review authority.&nbsp; Respondents note, on the other hand, that neither did the law expressly grant to the CTA the power to review a negative determination. However, under the clear text of the law, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the CTA is vested with jurisdiction to review the ruling of the DTI Secretary “<span style="font-weight: bold;">in connection with</span> the imposition of a safeguard measure.</span>” Had the law been couched instead to incorporate the phrase “the ruling imposing a safeguard measure,” then respondent’s claim would have indisputable merit. Undoubtedly, the phrase “in connection with” not only qualifies but clarifies the succeeding phrase “imposition of a safeguard measure.” As expounded later, the phrase also encompasses the opposite or converse ruling which is the non-imposition of a safeguard measure.<br><br>In the American case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc</span>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the United States Supreme Court, in interpreting a key provision of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, construed the phrase “relates to” in its normal sense which is the same as “if it has connection with or reference to.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> There is no serious dispute that the phrase “in connection with” is synonymous to “relates to” or “reference to,” and that all three phrases are broadly expansive. This is affirmed not just by jurisprudential fiat, but also the acquired connotative meaning of “in connection with” in common parlance.&nbsp; Consequently, with the use of the phrase “in connection with,” Section 29 allows the CTA to review not only the ruling imposing a safeguard measure, but all other <span style="font-weight: bold;">rulings related or have reference to the application for such measure.</span><br><br>Now, let us determine the maximum scope and reach of the phrase “in connection with” as used in Section 29 of the SMA.&nbsp; A literalist reading or linguistic survey may not satisfy.&nbsp; Even the US Supreme Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">New York State Blue Cross Plans v. Travelers Ins</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> conceded that the phrases “relate to” or “in connection with” may be extended to the farthest stretch of indeterminacy for, universally, relations or connections are infinite and stop nowhere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Thus, in the case the US High Court, examining the same phrase of the same provision of law involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">Shaw</span>, resorted to looking at the statute and its objectives as the alternative to an “uncritical literalism.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> A similar inquiry into the other provisions of the SMA is in order to determine the scope of review accorded therein to the CTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The authority to decide on the safeguard measure is vested in the DTI Secretary in the case of non-agricultural products, and in the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture in the case of agricultural products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Section 29 is likewise explicit that only the rulings of the DTI Secretary or the Agriculture Secretary may be reviewed by the CTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Thus, the acts of other bodies that were granted some powers by the SMA, such as the Tariff Commission, are not subject to direct review by the CTA.<br><br>Under the SMA, the Department Secretary concerned is authorized to decide on several matters.

They may arise at different stages – the preliminary investigation stage, the post-formal investigation stage, or the post-safeguard measure stage – yet all these issues do become ripe for resolution because an initiatory action has been taken seeking the imposition of a safeguard measure. It is the initiatory action for the imposition of a safeguard measure that sets the wheels in motion, allowing the Secretary to make successive rulings, beginning with the preliminary determination.<br><br>Clearly, therefore, the scope and reach of the phrase “in connection with,” as intended by Congress, pertain to <span style="font-weight: bold;">all rulings of the DTI Secretary or Agriculture Secretary which arise from the time an application or <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> initiation for the imposition of a safeguard measure is taken</span>.&nbsp; Indeed, the incidents which require resolution come to the fore only because there is an initial application or action seeking the imposition of a safeguard measure. From the legislative standpoint, it was a matter of sense and practicality to lump up the questions related to the initiatory application or action for safeguard measure and to assign only one court and; that is the CTA to initially review all the rulings related to such initiatory application or action.&nbsp; Both directions Congress put in place by employing the phrase “in connection with” in the law.<br><br>Given the relative expanse of decisions subject to judicial review by the CTA under Section 29, we do not doubt that a negative ruling refusing to impose a safeguard measure falls within the scope of its jurisdiction. On a literal level, such negative ruling is “a ruling of the Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure,” as it is one of the possible outcomes that may result from the initial application or action for a safeguard measure.&nbsp; On a more critical level, the rulings of the DTI Secretary in connection with a safeguard measure, however diverse the outcome may be, arise from the same grant of jurisdiction on the DTI Secretary by the SMA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The refusal by the DTI Secretary to grant a safeguard measure involves the same grant of authority, the same statutory prescriptions, and the same degree of discretion as the imposition by the DTI Secretary of a safeguard measure.<br><br>The position of the respondents is one of “uncritical literalism”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> incongruent with the animus of the law. Moreover, a fundamentalist approach to Section 29 is not warranted, considering the absurdity of the consequences.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third. Interpretatio Talis In Ambiguis Semper Fienda Est, Ut Evitur Inconveniens Et Absurdum</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Even assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that Section 29 has not expressly granted the CTA jurisdiction to review a negative ruling of the DTI Secretary, the Court is precluded from favoring an interpretation that would cause inconvenience and absurdity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Adopting the respondents’ position favoring the CTA’s minimal jurisdiction would unnecessarily lead to illogical and onerous results.<br><br>Indeed, it is illiberal to assume that Congress had intended to provide appellate relief to rulings imposing a safeguard measure but not to those declining to impose the measure. Respondents might argue that the right to relief from a negative ruling is not lost since the applicant could, as Philcemcor did, question such ruling through a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, in lieu of an appeal to the CTA. Yet these two reliefs are of differing natures and gravamen. While an appeal may be predicated on errors of fact or errors of law, a special civil action for certiorari is grounded on grave abuse of discretion or lack of or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decider. For a special civil action for certiorari to succeed, it is not enough that the questioned act of the respondent is wrong. As the Court clarified in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sempio v. Court of Appeals</span>:<blockquote>A tribunal, board or officer acts without jurisdiction if it/he does not have the legal power to determine the case. There is excess of jurisdiction where, being clothed with the power to determine the case, the tribunal, board or officer oversteps its/his authority as determined by law. And there is grave abuse of discretion where the tribunal, board or officer acts in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of his judgment as to be said to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Certiorari is often resorted to in order to correct errors of jurisdiction. Where the error is one of law or of fact, which is a mistake of judgment, appeal is the remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote>It is very conceivable that the DTI Secretary, after deliberate thought and careful evaluation of the evidence, may either make a negative preliminary determination as he is so empowered under Section 7 of the SMA, or refuse to adopt the definitive safeguard measure under Section 13 of the same law. Adopting the respondents’ theory, this negative ruling is susceptible to reversal only through a special civil action for certiorari, thus depriving the affected party the chance to elevate the ruling on appeal on the rudimentary grounds of errors in fact or in law.&nbsp; Instead, and despite whatever indications that the DTI Secretary acted with measure and within the bounds of his jurisdiction are, the aggrieved party will be forced to resort to a gymnastic exercise, contorting the straight and narrow in an effort to discombobulate the courts into believing that what was within was actually beyond and what was studied and deliberate actually whimsical and capricious. What then would be the remedy of the party aggrieved by a negative ruling that simply erred in interpreting the facts or the law? It certainly cannot be the special civil action for certiorari, for as the Court held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Silverio v. Court of Appeals</span>: “Certiorari is a remedy narrow in its scope and inflexible in its character. It is not a general utility tool in the legal workshop.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Fortunately, this theoretical quandary need not come to pass.&nbsp; Section 29 of the SMA is worded in such a way that it places&nbsp; under the CTA’s judicial review all rulings of the DTI Secretary, which are connected with the imposition of a safeguard measure. This is sound and proper in light of the specialized jurisdiction of the CTA over tax matters. In the same way that a question of whether to tax or not to tax is properly a tax matter, so is the question of whether to impose or not to impose a definitive safeguard measure.<br><br>On another note, the second paragraph of Section 29 similarly reveals the legislative intent that rulings of the DTI Secretary over safeguard measures should first be reviewed by the CTA and not the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It reads:<blockquote>The petition for review shall comply with the same requirements and shall follow the same rules of procedure and shall be subject to the same disposition as in appeals in connection with adverse rulings on tax matters to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>This is the only passage in the SMA in which the Court of Appeals is mentioned. The express wish of Congress is that the petition conform to the requirements and procedure under Rule 43 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Since Congress mandated that the form and procedure adopted be analogous to a review of a CTA ruling by the Court of Appeals, the legislative contemplation could not have been that the appeal be directly taken to the Court of Appeals.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Issue of Binding Effect of Tariff<br>Commission’s Factual Determination<br>on DTI Secretary.<br><br></span>The next issue for resolution is whether the factual determination made by the Tariff Commission under the SMA is binding on the DTI Secretary.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, the question is whether the DTI Secretary may impose general safeguard measures in the absence of a positive final determination by the Tariff Commission.<br><br>The Court of Appeals relied upon Section 13 of the SMA in ruling that the findings of the Tariff Commission do not necessarily constitute a final decision.&nbsp; Section 13 details the procedure for the adoption of a safeguard measure, as well as the steps to be taken in case there is a negative final determination.&nbsp; The implication of the Court of Appeals’ holding is that the DTI Secretary may adopt a definitive safeguard measure, notwithstanding a negative determination made by the Tariff Commission.<br><br>Undoubtedly, Section 13 prescribes certain limitations and restrictions before general safeguard measures may be imposed. However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the most fundamental restriction on the DTI Secretary’s power in that respect is contained in Section 5 of the SMA¾that there should first be a positive final determination of the Tariff Commission</span>¾which the Court of Appeals curiously all but ignored.&nbsp; Section 5 reads:<blockquote>Sec. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Conditions for the Application of General Safeguard Measures</span>. – The Secretary <span style="font-weight: bold;">shall apply a general safeguard measure upon a positive final determination of the [Tariff] Commission</span> that a product is being imported into the country in increased quantities, whether absolute or relative to the domestic production, as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry; however, in the case of non-agricultural products, the Secretary shall first establish that the application of such safeguard measures will be in the public interest. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The plain meaning of Section 5 shows that it is the Tariff Commission that has the power to make a “positive final determination.” This power lodged in the Tariff Commission, must be distinguished from the power to impose the general safeguard measure which is properly vested on the DTI Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>All in all, there are two condition precedents that must be satisfied before the DTI Secretary may impose a general safeguard measure on grey Portland cement. First, there must be a positive final determination by the Tariff Commission that a product is being imported into the country in increased quantities (whether absolute or relative to domestic production), as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat to the domestic industry. Second, in the case of non-agricultural products the Secretary must establish that the application of such safeguard measures is in the public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> As Southern Cross argues, Section 5 is quite clear-cut, and it is impossible to finagle a different conclusion even through overarching methods of statutory construction. There is no safer nor better settled canon of interpretation that when language is clear and unambiguous it must be held to mean what it plainly expresses:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> In the quotable words of an illustrious member of this Court, thus:<blockquote>[I]f a statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation. The <span style="font-style: italic;">verba legis</span> or plain meaning rule rests on the valid presumption that the words employed by the legislature in a statute correctly express its intent or will and preclude the court from construing it differently. The legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by the use of such words as are found in the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, Rule 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the SMA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> which interprets Section 5 of the law, likewise requires a positive final determination on the part of the Tariff Commission before the application of the general safeguard measure.<br><br>The SMA establishes a distinct allocation of functions between the Tariff Commission and the DTI Secretary. The plain meaning of Section 5 shows that it is the Tariff Commission that has the power to make a “positive final determination.” This power, which belongs to the Tariff Commission, must be distinguished from the power to impose general safeguard measure properly vested on the DTI Secretary. The distinction is vital, as a “positive final determination” clearly antecedes, as a condition precedent, the imposition of a general safeguard measure.&nbsp; At the same time, a positive final determination does not necessarily result in the imposition of a general safeguard measure.&nbsp; Under Section 5, notwithstanding the positive final determination of the Tariff Commission, the DTI Secretary is tasked to decide whether or not that the application of the safeguard measures is in the public interest.<br><br>It is also clear from Section 5 of the SMA that the positive final determination to be undertaken by the Tariff Commission does not entail a mere gathering of statistical data. In order to arrive at such determination, it has to establish causal linkages from the statistics that it compiles and evaluates: after finding there is an importation in increased quantities of the product in question, that such importation is a substantial cause of serious threat or injury to the domestic industry.<br><br>The Court of Appeals relies heavily on the legislative record of a congressional debate during deliberations on the SMA to assert a purported legislative intent that the findings of the Tariff Commission do not bind the DTI Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Yet as explained earlier, the plain meaning of Section 5 emphasizes that only if the Tariff Commission renders a positive determination could the DTI Secretary impose a safeguard measure.&nbsp; Resort to the congressional records to ascertain legislative intent is not warranted if a statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity. The legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by the use of such words as are found in the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the legislative record, if at all to be availed of, should be approached with extreme caution, as legislative debates and proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the statute when the meaning is clear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Our holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil Liberties Union v.

Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk xxx. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, it is easy to selectively cite passages, sometimes out of their proper context, in order to assert a misleading interpretation. The effect can be dangerous. Minority or solitary views, anecdotal ruminations, or even the occasional crude witticisms, may improperly acquire the mantle of legislative intent by the sole virtue of their publication in the authoritative congressional record. Hence, resort to legislative deliberations is allowable when the statute is crafted in such a manner as to leave room for doubt on the real intent of the legislature.<br><br>Section 5 plainly evinces legislative intent to restrict the DTI Secretary’s power to impose a general safeguard measure by preconditioning such imposition on a positive determination by the Tariff Commission. Such legislative intent should be given full force and effect, as the executive power to impose definitive safeguard measures is but a delegated power¾the power of taxation, by nature and by command of the fundamental law, being a preserve of the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Section 28(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution confirms the delegation of legislative power, yet ensures that the prerogative of Congress to impose limitations and restrictions on the executive exercise of this power:<blockquote>The Congress may, by law, authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></blockquote>The safeguard measures which the DTI Secretary may impose under the SMA may take the following variations, to wit: (a) an increase in, or imposition of any duty on the imported product; (b) a decrease in or the imposition of a tariff-rate quota on the product; (c) a modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of the product into the Philippines; (d) one or more appropriate adjustment measures, including the provision of trade adjustment assistance; and (e) any combination of the above-described actions.

The Tariff Commission makes its determination only after a formal investigation process, with such investigation initiated only if there is a positive preliminary determination by the DTI Secretary under Section 7 of the SMA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, the DTI Secretary may impose definitive safeguard measure only if there is a positive final determination made by the Tariff Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><br>In contrast, a “recommendation” is a suggested remedial measure submitted by the Tariff Commission under&nbsp; Section 13 after making a positive final determination in accordance with Section 5. The Tariff Commission is not empowered to make a recommendation absent a positive final determination on its part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Under Section 13, the Tariff Commission is required to recommend to the [DTI] Secretary an “appropriate definitive measure.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> The Tariff Commission “may also recommend other actions, including the initiation of international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase of imports of the products, to alleviate the injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry and to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>The recommendations of the Tariff Commission, as rendered under Section 13, are not obligatory on the DTI Secretary. Nothing in the SMA mandates the DTI Secretary to adopt the recommendations made by the Tariff Commission.&nbsp; In fact, the SMA requires that the DTI Secretary establish that the application of such safeguard measures is in the public interest, notwithstanding the Tariff Commission’s&nbsp; recommendation on the appropriate safeguard measure based on its positive final determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> The non-binding force of the Tariff Commission’s recommendations is congruent with the command of Section 28(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution that only the President may be empowered by the Congress to impose appropriate tariff rates, import/export quotas and other similar measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> It is the DTI Secretary, as <span style="font-style: italic;">alter ego</span> of the President, who under the SMA may impose such safeguard measures subject to the limitations imposed therein.&nbsp; A contrary conclusion would in essence unduly arrogate to the Tariff Commission the executive power to impose the appropriate tariff measures. That is why the SMA empowers the DTI Secretary to adopt safeguard measures other than those recommended by the Tariff Commission.<br><br>Unlike the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, its determination has a different effect on the DTI Secretary.&nbsp; Only on the basis of a positive final determination made by the Tariff Commission under Section 5 can the DTI Secretary impose a general safeguard measure.&nbsp; Clearly, then the DTI Secretary is <span style="font-weight: bold;">bound by the determination</span> made by the Tariff Commission.<br><br>Some confusion may arise because the sixth paragraph of Section 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> uses the variant word “determined” in a different context, as it contemplates “the appropriate general safeguard measure as determined by the Secretary within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the report.” Quite plainly, the word “determined” in this context pertains to the DTI Secretary’s power of choice of the appropriate safeguard measure, as opposed to the Tariff Commission’s power to determine the existence of conditions necessary for the imposition of any safeguard measure.&nbsp; In relation to Section 5, such choice also relates to the mandate of the DTI Secretary to establish that the application of safeguard measures is in the public interest, also within the fifteen (15) day period. Nothing in Section 13 contradicts the instruction in Section 5 that the DTI Secretary is allowed to impose the general safeguard measures only if there is a positive determination made by the Tariff Commission.<br><br>Unfortunately, Rule 13.2 of the Implementing Rules of the SMA is captioned “Final Determination by the Secretary.” The assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> and Philcemcor latch on this phraseology to imply that the factual determination rendered by the Tariff Commission under Section 5 may be amended or reversed by the DTI Secretary. Of course, implementing rules should conform, not clash, with the law that they seek to implement,&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; regulation&nbsp; which&nbsp; operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute is a nullity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Yet imperfect draftsmanship aside, nothing in Rule 13.2 implies that the DTI Secretary can set aside the determination made by the Tariff Commission under the aegis of Section 5. This can be seen by examining the specific provisions of Rule 13.2, thus:<br><br>RULE 13.2.&nbsp; Final Determination by the Secretary<blockquote>RULE 13.2.a.&nbsp; Within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the Report of the Commission, the Secretary shall make a decision, taking into consideration the measures recommended by the Commission.<br><br>RULE 13.2.b.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the determination is affirmative</span>, the Secretary shall issue, within two (2) calendar days after making his decision, a written instruction to the heads of the concerned government agencies to immediately implement the appropriate general safeguard measure as determined by him.&nbsp; Provided, however, that in the case of non-agricultural products, the Secretary shall first establish that the imposition of the safeguard measure will be in the public interest.<br><br>RULE 13.2.c.&nbsp; Within two (2) calendar days after making his decision, the Secretary shall also order its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation. He shall also furnish a copy of his Order to the petitioner and other interested parties, whether affirmative or negative.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Moreover, the DTI Secretary does not have the power to review the findings of the Tariff Commission for it is not subordinate to the Department of Trade and Industry (“DTI”).&nbsp; It falls under the supervision, not of the DTI nor of the Department of Finance (as mistakenly asserted by Southern Cross),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> but of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">National Economic Development Authority, an independent planning agency of the government of co-equal rank as the DTI</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> As the supervision and control of a Department Secretary is limited to the bureaus, offices, and agencies under him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> the DTI Secretary generally cannot exercise review authority over actions of the Tariff Commission. Neither does the SMA specifically authorize the DTI Secretary to alter, amend or modify in any way the determination made by the Tariff Commission. The most that the DTI Secretary could do to express displeasure over the Tariff Commission’s actions is to ignore its recommendation, but not its determination.<br><br>The word “determination” as used in Rule 13.2 of the Implementing Rules is dissonant with the same word as employed in the SMA, which in the latter case is undeviatingly in reference to the determination made by the Tariff Commission. Beyond the resulting confusion, however, the divergent use in Rule 13.2 is explicable as the Rule textually pertains to the power of the DTI Secretary to review the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, not the latter’s determination. Indeed, an examination of the specific provisions show that there is no real conflict to reconcile. Rule 13.2 respects the logical order imposed by the SMA.&nbsp; The Rule does not remove the essential requirement under Section 5 that a positive final determination be made by the Tariff Commission before a definitive safeguard measure may be imposed by the DTI Secretary.<br><br>The assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> characterizes the findings of the Tariff Commission as merely recommendatory and points to the DTI Secretary as the authority who renders the final decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> At the same time, Philcemcor asserts that the Tariff Commission’s functions are merely investigatory, and as such do not include the power to decide or adjudicate. These contentions, viewed in the context of the fundamental requisite set forth by Section 5, are untenable.&nbsp; They run counter to the statutory prescription that a positive final determination made by the Tariff Commission should first be obtained before the definitive safeguard measures may be laid down.<br><br>Was it anomalous for Congress to have provided for a system whereby the Tariff Commission may preclude the&nbsp; DTI, an office of higher rank, from imposing a safeguard measure? Of course, this Court does not inquire into the wisdom of the legislature but only charts the boundaries of powers and functions set in its enactments.&nbsp; But then, it is not difficult to see the internal logic of this statutory framework.<br><br>For one, as earlier stated, the DTI cannot exercise review powers over the Tariff Commission which is not its subordinate office.<br><br>Moreover, the mechanism established by Congress establishes a measure of check and balance involving two different governmental agencies with disparate specializations.&nbsp; The matter of safeguard measures is of such national importance that a decision either to impose or not to impose then could have ruinous effects on companies doing business in the Philippines.&nbsp; Thus, it is ideal to put in place a system which affords all due deliberation and calls to fore various governmental agencies exercising their particular specializations.<br><br>Finally, if this arrangement drawn up by Congress makes it difficult to obtain a general safeguard measure, it is because such safeguard measure is the exception, rather than the rule. The Philippines is obliged to observe its obligations under the GATT, under whose framework trade liberalization, not protectionism, is laid down. Verily, the GATT actually prescribes conditions before a member-country may impose a safeguard measure. The pertinent portion of the GATT Agreement on Safeguards reads:<blockquote><ol start="2"><li>A Member may only apply a safeguard measure to a product only if that member has determined, pursuant to the provisions set out below, that such product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup></li><br><li>(a) A Member may apply a safeguard measure only following an investigation by the competent authorities of that Member pursuant to procedures previously established and made public in consonance with Article X of the GATT 1994. This investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which importers, exporters and other interested parties could present evidence and their views, including the opportunity to respond to the presentations of other parties and to submit their views, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, as to whether or not the application of a safeguard measure would be in the public interest. The competent authorities shall publish a report setting forth their findings and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The SMA was designed not to contradict the GATT, but to complement it. The two requisites laid down in Section 5 for a positive final determination are the same conditions provided under the GATT Agreement on Safeguards for the application of safeguard measures by a member country. Moreover, the investigatory procedure laid down by the SMA conforms to the procedure required by the GATT Agreement on Safeguards. Congress has chosen the Tariff Commission as the competent authority to conduct such investigation. Southern Cross stresses that applying the provision of the GATT Agreement on Safeguards, the Tariff Commission is clearly empowered to arrive at binding conclusions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> We agree: binding on the DTI Secretary is the Tariff Commission’s determinations on whether a product is imported in increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production and whether any such increase is a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br>Satisfied as we are with the proper statutory paradigm within which the SMA should be analyzed, the flaws in the reasoning of the Court of Appeals and in the arguments of the respondents become apparent.&nbsp; To better understand the dynamics of the procedure set up by the law leading to the imposition of definitive safeguard measures, a brief step-by-step recount thereof is in order.<blockquote><ol><li>After the initiation of an action involving a general safeguard measure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> the DTI Secretary makes a preliminary determination whether the increased imports of the product under consideration substantially cause or threaten to substantially cause serious injury to the domestic industry,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> and whether the imposition of a provisional measure is warranted under Section 8 of the SMA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> If the preliminary determination is negative, it is implied that no further action will be taken on the application.</li><br><li>When his preliminary determination is positive, the Secretary immediately transmits the records covering the application to the Tariff Commission for immediate formal investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup></li><br><li>The Tariff Commission conducts its formal investigation, keyed towards making a final determination. In the process, it holds public hearings, providing interested parties the opportunity to present evidence or otherwise be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> To repeat, Section 5 enumerates what the Tariff Commission is tasked to determine: (a) whether a product is being imported into the country in increased quantities, irrespective of whether the product is absolute or relative to the domestic production; and (b) whether the importation in increased quantities is such&nbsp; that it causes serious injury or threat to the domestic industry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> The findings of the Tariff Commission as to these matters constitute the final determination, which may be either positive or negative.</li><br><li>Under Section 13 of the SMA, if the Tariff Commission makes a positive determination, the Tariff Commission “recommends to the [DTI] Secretary an appropriate definitive measure.” The Tariff Commission “may also recommend other actions, including the initiation of international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase of imports of the products, to alleviate the injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry, and to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup></li><br><li>If the Tariff Commission makes a positive final determination, the DTI Secretary is then to decide, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the report, as to what appropriate safeguard measures should he impose.</li><br><li>However, if the Tariff Commission makes a negative final determination, the DTI Secretary cannot impose any definitive safeguard measure. Under Section 13, he is instructed instead to return whatever cash bond was paid by the applicant upon the initiation of the action for safeguard measure.</li></ol></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">The Effect of the Court’s Decision</span><br><br>The Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case back to the DTI Secretary, with the instruction that the DTI Secretary may impose a general safeguard measure even if there is no positive final determination from the Tariff Commission.&nbsp; More crucially, the Court of Appeals could not have acquired jurisdiction over Philcemcor’s petition for certiorari in the first place, as Section 29 of the SMA properly vests jurisdiction on the CTA. Consequently, the assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> is an absolute nullity, and we declare it as such.<br><br>What is the effect of the nullity of the assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> on the 5 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of the DTI Secretary imposing the general safeguard measure? We have recognized that any initial judicial review of a DTI ruling in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure belongs to the CTA. At the same time, the Court also recognizes the fundamental principle that a null and void judgment cannot produce any legal effect.&nbsp; There is sufficient cause to establish that the 5 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of the DTI Secretary resulted from the assailed Court of Appeals <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>, even if the latter had not yet become final. Conversely, it can be concluded that it was because of the putative imprimatur of the Court of Appeals’ <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> that the DTI Secretary issued his ruling imposing the safeguard measure.&nbsp; Since the 5 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> derives its legal effect from the void <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of the Court of Appeals, this ruling of the DTI Secretary is consequently void.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The spring cannot rise higher than the source.</span><br><br>The DTI Secretary himself acknowledged that he drew stimulating force from the appellate court’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> for in his own 5 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>, he declared:<blockquote>From the aforementioned ruling, the CA has remanded the case to the DTI Secretary for a final decision. Thus, there is no legal impediment for the Secretary to decide on the application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup></blockquote>The inescapable conclusion is that the DTI Secretary needed the assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of the Court of Appeals to justify his rendering a second <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>.&nbsp; He explicitly invoked the Court of Appeals’ <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> as basis for rendering his 5 June 2003 ruling, and implicitly recognized that without such <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> he would not have the authority to revoke his previous ruling and render a new, obverse ruling.<br><br>It is clear then that the 25 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> of the DTI Secretary is a product of the void <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span>, it being an attempt to carry out such null judgment. There is therefore no choice but to declare it void as well, lest we sanction the perverse existence of a fruit from a non-existent tree. It does not even matter what the disposition of the 25 June 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> was, its nullity would be warranted even if the DTI Secretary chose to uphold his earlier ruling denying the application for safeguard measures.<br><br>It is also an unfortunate spectacle to behold the DTI Secretary, seeking to enforce a judicial decision which is not yet final and actually pending review on appeal. Had it been a judge who attempted to enforce a decision that is not yet final and executory, he or she would have readily been subjected to sanction by this Court. The DTI Secretary may be beyond the ambit of administrative review by this Court, but we are capacitated to allocate the boundaries set by the law of the land and to exact fealty to the legal order, especially from the instrumentalities and officials of government.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is GRANTED.

We do not doubt that forum-shopping can be committed even if the identical relief or cause of action is sought or asserted before a different forum not in the initiatory pleading, but in an application for provisional relief. Forum-shopping is frowned upon as it affords the litigant the opportunity to avail of the same relief based on the same cause of action before different jurisdictions.
