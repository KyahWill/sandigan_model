				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Arra Realty Corporation (ARC) was the owner of a parcel of land, located in Alvarado Street, Legaspi Village, Makati City, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 112269 issued by the Register of Deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Through its president, Architect Carlos D. Arguelles, the ARC decided to construct a five-story building on its property and engaged the services of Engineer Erlinda Peñaloza as project and structural engineer.&nbsp; In the process, Peñaloza and the ARC, through Carlos Arguelles, agreed on November 18, 1982 that Peñaloza would share the purchase price of one floor of the building, consisting of 552 square meters for the price of <s>P</s>3,105,838: <s>P</s>901,738, payable within sixty (60) days from November 20, 1982, and the balance payable in twenty (20) equal quarterly installments of <s>P</s>110,205.&nbsp; The parties further agreed that the payments of Peñaloza would be credited to her account in partial payment of her stock subscription in the ARC’s capital stock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Sometime in May 1983, Peñaloza took possession of the one-half portion of the second floor, with an area of 552 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> where she put up her office and operated the St. Michael International Institute of Technology.&nbsp; Unknown to her, ARC had executed a real estate mortgage over the lot and the entire building in favor of the China Banking Corporation as security for a loan on May 12, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The deed was annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 112269 on June 3, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> From February 23, 1983 to May 31, 1984, Peñaloza paid <s>P</s>1,175,124.59 for the portion of the second floor of the building she had purchased from the ARC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She learned that the property had been mortgaged to the China Banking Corporation sometime in July 1984.&nbsp; Thereafter, she stopped paying the installments due on the purchase price of the property.<br><br>Peñaloza wrote the China Banking Corporation on August 1, 1984 informing the bank that the ARC had conveyed a portion of the second floor of the building to her, and that she had paid <s>P</s>1,175,124.59 out of the total price of <s>P</s>3,105,838.&nbsp; She offered to open an account with the bank in her name in the amount of <s>P</s>300,000, and to make monthly deposits of <s>P</s>50,000 each, to serve as payments of the equivalent loan of the ARC upon the execution of the appropriate documents.&nbsp; She also proposed for the bank to assist her in requesting the ARC to execute a deed of absolute sale over the portion of the second floor she had purchased and the issuance of the title in her name upon the payment of the purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, the bank rejected her proposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She then wrote the ARC on August 31, 1984 informing it of China Banking Corporation’s rejection of her offer to assume its equivalent loan from the bank and reminded it that it had conformed to her proposal to assume the payment of its loan from the bank up to the equivalent amount of the balance of the purchase price of the second floor of the building as agreed upon, and the consequent execution by the ARC of a deed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of absolute sale over the property in her favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Peñaloza then sent a copy of a deed of absolute sale with assumption of mortgage for the ARC’s consideration, and informed the latter that, in the meantime, she was withholding installment payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On October 3, 1984, Peñaloza transferred the school to another building she had purchased, but retained her office therein.&nbsp; She later discovered that her office had been padlocked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> She had the office reopened and continued holding office thereat.&nbsp; To protect her rights as purchaser, she executed on November 26, 1984 an affidavit of adverse claim over the property which was annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 112269 on November 27, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, the adverse claim was cancelled on February 11, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>When the ARC failed to pay its loan to China Banking Corporation, the subject property was foreclosed extrajudicially, and, thereafter, sold at public auction to China Banking Corporation on August 13, 1986 for <s>P</s>13,953,171.07.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On April 29, 1987, the ARC and the Guarantee Development Corporation and Insurance Agency (GDCIA) executed a deed of conditional sale covering the building and the lot for <s>P</s>22,000,000, part of which was to be used to redeem the property from China Banking Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> With the money advanced by the GDCIA, the property was redeemed on May 4, 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> On May 14, 1987, the petitioner executed a deed of absolute sale over the lot and building in favor of the GDCIA for <s>P</s>22,000,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The ARC obliged itself under the deed to deliver possession of the property without any occupants therein.&nbsp; The Register of Deeds, thereafter, issued TCT No. 147846 in favor of the GDCIA over the property without any liens or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encumbrances on May 15, 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Of the purchase price of <s>P</s>22,000,000, the GDCIA retained <s>P</s>1,000,000 to answer for any damages arising from any suits of the occupants of the building.<br><br>On May 28, 1987, Peñaloza filed a complaint against the ARC, the GDCIA, and the Spouses Arguelles, with the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 61, for “specific performance or damages” with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Peñaloza prayed for the following reliefs:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that –<br><br><table style="text-align: justify;" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">1.-&nbsp;

This is so because the ownership by the seller of the thing sold at the time of the perfection of the contract of sale is not an element of its perfection.&nbsp; A perfected contract of sale cannot be challenged on the ground of non-ownership on the part of the seller at the time of its perfection.&nbsp; What the law requires is that the seller has the right to transfer ownership at the time the thing is delivered.&nbsp; Perfection <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> does not transfer ownership which occurs upon the actual or constructive delivery of the thing sold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In May 1983, respondent Peñaloza took possession of a portion of the second floor of the building sold to her with an area of 552 square meters.&nbsp;

The ownership of the thing sold shall be transferred to the vendee upon the actual or constructive delivery thereof.</blockquote>In a contract of sale, until and unless the contract is resolved or rescinded in accordance with law, the vendor cannot recover the thing sold even if the vendee failed to pay in full the initial payment for the property.&nbsp; The failure of the buyer to pay the purchase price within the stipulated period does not by itself bar the transfer of ownership or possession of the property sold, nor <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> rescind the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Such failure will merely give the vendor the option to rescind the contract of sale judicially or by notarial demand as provided for by Article 1592 of the New Civil Code:<blockquote>Art. 1592.&nbsp; In the sale of immovable property, even though it may have been stipulated that upon failure to pay the price at the time agreed upon the rescission of the contract shall of right take place, the vendee may pay, even after the expiration of the period, as long as no demand for rescission of the contract has been made upon him either judicially or by a notarial act.&nbsp; After the demand, the court may not grant him a new term.</blockquote>Admittedly, respondent Peñaloza failed to pay the downpayment on time.&nbsp; But then, the petitioner ARC accepted, <span style="font-style: italic;">without any objections</span>, the delayed payments of the respondent; hence, as provided in Article 1235 of the New Civil Code, the obligation of the respondent is deemed complied with:<blockquote>Art. 1235.&nbsp; When the obligee accepts the performance, knowing its incompleteness or irregularity, and without expressing any protest or objection, the obligation is deemed fully complied with.</blockquote>The respondent cannot be blamed for suspending further remittances of payment to the petitioner ARC because when she pushed for the issuance of her title to the property after taking possession thereof, the ARC failed to comply.&nbsp; She was aghast when she discovered that in July 1984, even before she took possession of the property, the petitioner ARC had already mortgaged the lot and the building to the China Banking Corporation; when she offered to pay the balance of the purchase price of the property to enable her to secure her title thereon, the petitioner ARC ignored her offer.&nbsp; Under Article 1590 of the New Civil Code, a vendee may suspend the payment of the price of the property sold:<blockquote>Art. 1590.&nbsp; Should the vendee be disturbed in the possession or ownership of the thing acquired, or should he have reasonable grounds to fear such disturbance, by a vindicatory action or a foreclosure of mortgage, he may suspend the payment of the price until the vendor has caused the disturbance or danger to cease, unless the latter gives security for the return of the price in a proper case, or it has been stipulated that, notwithstanding any such contingency, the vendee shall be bound to make the payment.&nbsp;
