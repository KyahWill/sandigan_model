Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It is not necessary, however, that conspiracy be proved by direct evidence of a prior agreement to commit the crime. Conspiracy may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated or inferred from the acts of the accused which show a joint or common purpose and design, a concerted action and a community of interest among the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>While there is no direct evidence to show that Factao and Labroda agreed to commit the crime, the acts of Factao and Labroda immediately before and after the shooting evince a commonality in design sufficient to make them co-principals to the killing. Vicente Manolos testified that as Factao prepared to shoot Fernando, Labrado was looking around to see if anyone else was about.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thereafter, the two fled together, running in the same direction, a fact to which Jose Manuel Sermona<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and Eduardo Sardoma<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> also testified.<br><br>The alibi of appellants Factao and Labroda cannot prosper in the face of the positive identification by prosecution witnesses Vicente Manolos and Jose Manuel Sermona, who were both familiar with the two appellants.&nbsp; Alibi, which is easy to concoct, cannot prevail over positive identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Moreover, for their alibi to prosper, the accused must not only prove that they were somewhere else when the offense was committed, but also that they were so far away that they could not have been physically present at the scene of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Appellants Factao and Labroda utterly failed to prove that it was physically impossible for them to be present at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. Factao and Labroda themselves testified that they were at the house of Labroda to celebrate the latter's birthday on 23 August 1991 at approximately the same time that Fernando Sardoma was killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Labroda's house was just more than a kilometer away from the place where the crime was committed, or approximately thirty (30) minutes on foot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Evidently, the accused-appellants were in a place near the crime scene.<br><br>On the other hand, the prosecution failed to establish appellant Tirso Servidad's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Yet Vicente categorically stated that he did not see Servidad as Factao fired the fatal shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>These irreconcilable discrepancies in the testimonies of the two prosecution witnesses cast doubt on the culpability of appellant Servidad.<br><br>Eduardo Sardoma's claim that he caught Servidad peeping into the hut as Factao and Labroda were fleeing defies human nature. If Servidad were at all present at the time of the shooting and conspired with his co-appellants to kill Fernando Sardoma, he would have immediately fled from the scene with his cohorts once the criminal deed was done. But as the defense would have it, Servidad separated form the other appellants and worst, even linger at the crime scene and risked arrest.<br><br>Senior Inspector Bonifacio Servano also said that he saw Tirso sometime after the killing, some distance from the crime scene:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q-</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you arrived at the place of the incident at around 9:25 in the evening on August 23, 1991 together with two (2) policemen, you saw Tirso Servidad in the place of the incident?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A-</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">….</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Witness: Correction please, your honor, I saw or met him but outside the place of the incident about 200 meters from the national highway of Brgy.

Again, as correctly pointed out by the defense, it is contrary to human experience for a guilty person, right after the commission of a crime, to roam the streets within the vicinity of the crime scene where police authorities could easily apprehend him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Even if Servidad were indeed present at the scene during the shooting, such fact by itself would not render him criminally liable. The mere presence of a person at the scene of the crime does not make him a co-conspirator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The prosecution did not offer any evidence that Servidad performed any act from which his conspiracy to the crime may be deduced.<br><br>In the face of the contradicting and unbelievable testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the alibi of appellant Servidad assumes strength and significance. According to appellant, he was on his way home when he met Sirawagan Barangay Captain Faustino Nierves at the precise time of the explosion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> a fact corroborated by the Barangay Captain himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> No ill motive has been attributed for this witness, a public officer, to testify falsely.<br><br>The crime committed by appellants Factao and Labroda is Murder, the killing being qualified by treachery.&nbsp; There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Treachery attended the killing of the victim Fernando Sardoma, where his assailant Factao first peeped into the bamboo wall, inserted the rifle through the bamboo wall and shot Fernando, who was then lying on his side in the relative security of his hut, utterly defenseless and completely unaware of the impending attack.<br><br>Evident premeditation, although alleged in the information, was not adequately proven.
