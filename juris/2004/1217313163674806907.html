				<BR><STRONG>AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by accused Joey Corsales, a.k.a. Antonio Corsanes, assailing the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 22, 1999 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 219, Quezon City (RTC for brevity) finding him together with his co-accused Antonio Rom guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, sentencing each of them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay damages to the heirs of victim Roy Tiozon.<br><br>Corsales and Rom were charged with the Murder of Roy Tiozon, under an Information which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 4th day of August, 1996 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, with intent to kill, qualified by evident premeditation and treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of ROY TIOZON Y RIGA, by then and there stabbing and hacking the latter with deadly weapons, hitting him on the different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon said ROY TIOZON Y RIGA serious and mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the said victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Rom was first arraigned and tried while Corsales was at-large. Corsales was subsequently arraigned and tried upon his arrest in 1997. On January 22, 1999, the RTC rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding Antonio Rom and Joey Corsales GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged in the Information, the Court hereby sentences each of them to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua; to pay the heirs of Roy Tiozon, jointly and severally, the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, P5,850.00 as actual damages; P50,000.00 as indemnity; and P1,247,400.00 as compensatory damages; and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Only Corsales appealed. He raises the following Assignment of Errors:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT <u>A-QUO</u> (sic) GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE INCREDULOUS TESTIMONY OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT <u>A-QUO</u> (sic) GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE COURT <u>A-QUO</u> (sic) GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THERE WAS CONSPIRACY IN THE CASE AT BAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>which may be compressed to the sole issue whether or not the RTC erred in ruling that the prosecution had established the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The trial court principally based its conviction of Rom and appellant on the testimony of prosecution witness Danilo Ancla, as narrated by it in its decision, to wit:<br><blockquote>Eyewitness Danilo Ancla testified that on the afternoon of August 4, 1996, he went to the house of Joey Corsales after he was told by Arturo Tiozon, the father of Roy Tiozon, that the latter was fetched by accused Antonio Rom, whom he has known for almost two years, for a drinking session; that before reaching the house of Joey Corsales at a distance of about 10 to 12 meters, he saw a commotion involving Antonio Rom, Joey Corsales and Roy Tiozon; that Antonio Rom, who was holding a bolo, and Joey Corsales who was holding a Batangas knife, were ganging up on Roy Tiozon by hacking and stabbing him despite his pleas for mercy (“Maawa na kayo hindi naman ako lalaban!”); that when Roy Tiozon was down, he noticed a wound in his stomach; that after both accused inclicted wounds on the victim, they went towards the house of Antonio Rom; that after witnessing the incident, he went away; that on that same day, August 4, 1996, he told Arturo Tiozon that it was the two accused who stabbed his son; and that he volunteered himself to be a witness when he learned sometime in October, 1996 that a certain Amelia, who also witnessed the incident, was afraid to testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>and on the testimony of the medico-legal officer as to the nature of the wounds sustained by Tiozon, to wit:<br><blockquote>The medico-legal officer, DRA. ROSALINE COSIDON, informed the Court that after the identification of the body as that of the victim, she proceeded to the autopsy proper by measuring the injuries and by marking their respective locations on the sketches of the human skull and body; that upon examination, she found that the victim sustained 6 stab wounds, 4 incise wounds and 6    abrasions or a total of 16 injuries; that from the nature of the wounds a sharp bladed instrument and a sharp pointed weapon were used, that of the 16 wounds, the stab wound located at the right breast and the wound located at the epigastric region were fatal wounds; and that she then reduced her findings into writing and prepared the death certificate. She added that it was possible that the victim was lying down when the injuries were inflicted on him; that two different persons used two kinds of instruments and that the abrasions on the body of the victim could have been caused by rubbing or hitting rough surfaces when he fell down; that the victim was attacked by a single person; that wound no. 6 was inflicted by a single knife; that there was a struggle between the victim and his assailant; and that immediate medical attention could have been saved the life of the victim.<br></blockquote>Appellant’s appeal is totally bereft of merit. First, he tried to impress to us that Ancla was not consistent in implicating him when Ancla testified that victim Tiozon was in the house of appellant when the incident allegedly occurred but changed his answer when he further stated that the incident happened near Rom’s house. A perusal of the entire testimony of Ancla readily reveals that he was only told by the father of Tiozon that he was fetched by Rom and appellant to have a drinking session at appellant’s house;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> but while on his way to appellant’s house, he saw both appellant and Rom hacking and stabbing Tiozon near the house of Rom. There is no contradiction on this matter. Further examination of his testimony discloses that the houses of Rom and appellant were only one and a half to two meters away from each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>    As to why they are all outside the house of appellant is another matter that does not make any difference and absolutely not relevant to the fact that Ancla actually saw Rom and appellant hacking and stabbing Tiozon near their houses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Second, appellant insists that the totality of Ancla’s testimony points to Rom as the lone assailant of Tiozon. A reproduction of Ancla’s testimony evidently shows that it does not support appellant’s claim, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

We are not convinced. Eyewitness Ancla positively identified him having stabbed Tiozon with a knife together with Rom who hacked Tiozon with a bolo. Proof of previous agreement among the malefactors to commit the crime would be unnecessary to establish conspiracy when by their overt acts it could be deduced that they conducted themselves in concert with one another in pursuing their unlawful design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Dr. Rosaline Cosidon, Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory testified that from the characteristics of the fatal wounds inflicted on the victim, “sharp bladed and sharp pointed instruments”, were possibly used, such as bolo or fan knife or balisong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Rom’s and appellant’s acts in helping or assisting each other in simultaneously stabbing or inflicting wounds on the victim are clear and indubitable proofs of a concerted effort to bring about the death of the victim, thus they are equally liable for the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the RTC did not err in finding appellant and Rom guilty of murder. The aggravating circumstances of taking advantage of superior strength qualified the act of killing Tiozon to Murder, under paragraph 15, Article 14, and paragraph 1, Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
