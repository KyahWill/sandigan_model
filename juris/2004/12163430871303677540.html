				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Despite their dismissal from the service, government employees are entitled to the leave credits that they have earned during the period of their employment. As a matter of fairness and law, they may not be deprived of such remuneration, which they have already earned prior to their dismissal.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></div><br>Before us is a “Petition for Equal Protection and Due Process”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 29, 2003, filed by Respondent Francisco S. Padua through counsel. It seeks the reversal of the forfeiture of his retirement and leave benefits for his 34 years of service in the Court of Appeals.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></div><br>This administrative case began on February 19, 1991, when retired Judge Ansberto Paredes filed a Complaint against his cousin, Respondent Padua, for having falsified the former’s signature on a document captioned “Authority to Sell” and for having obtained money with the use of that document. In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> promulgated May 17, 1993, the Court dismissed respondent from the service and forfeited his retirement benefits, as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, Francisco S. Padua is hereby DISMISSED from the service with prejudice to his reinstatement or appointment to any public office including government owned or controlled corporations and his retirement benefits, if any, are ordered forfeited. Let a copy of this Decision be forwarded to the Court of Appeals and the Civil Service Commission.”<br></blockquote>Thereafter, to obtain a reconsideration of his dismissal and of the forfeiture of his retirement and leave benefits, respondent filed several pleadings, enumerated below:<br><ol type="1"><li> Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 2, 1993, denied in the Resolution of June 20, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for its failure to raise any substantial argument to warrant the reversal of the questioned Decision.<br><br></li><li> Motion to Set Aside Decision or its Effects and/or to Lift Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated August 14, 1993, denied for lack of merit in the Resolution of March 10, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br></li><li> Motion for the Lifting of Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits and for Collection of Vacation and Sick or Leave Benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated November 26, 1994, denied in the Resolution of December 8, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br></li><li> Plea for Judicial Clemency and Compassion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated March 10, 1998, denied for lack of merit in the Resolution of April 28, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br></li><li> Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated June 17, 1998 of the Resolution of April 28, 1998, denied with finality in the Resolution of August 18, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for failure of respondent to present any substantial argument.<br><br></li><li> Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated October 6, 1998, treated by the Court as a Second Motion for Reconsideration and denied for lack of merit in the Resolution of November 10, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <br><br></li><li> Manifestation (for Judicial Clemency and Compassion)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated June 29, 1999, referred by the Court to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for evaluation, report and recommendation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> recommended for denial by then Court Administrator Alfredo L.

Velasco Jr. observed that twelve and one-half (12 ½) years had passed since the filing of the Complaint, and ten (10) years since the finality of respondent’s dismissal from the service. Throughout this period, the Supreme Court has remained steadfast in its resolve to deny the numerous Motions, Pleas, Manifestations and Petitions of respondent requesting modification or amendment of its adverse judgment. Indeed, the Court has consistently thrown its full weight and authority on erring court personnel who have flagrantly violated the norms of judicial conduct, and who have thus tainted the noble and venerable image of the judiciary.<br><br>The Court, however, has modified and even reduced the penalties already imposed on some offenders, owing to some intervening factors or    circumstances that merited the mitigation of their sentences.<br><br>In the present case, respondent served the judiciary for thirty-four years, during which he committed only a single offense. In view thereof, the OCA has recommended a reduction of the penalties to the extent that his retirement and leave benefits would be restored to him.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>As regards the leave benefits, we concur with the court administrator.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Administrative Liability</u></b><br></div><br>In his Petition, respondent demonstrates his sincere repentance and deep remorse for the wrong he committed in a moment of fallibility, to which every human being is subject. Realizing that judicial personnel must exhibit the highest sense of honesty and integrity in order to preserve the good name and standing of the courts, he is no longer questioning the wisdom of this Court in imposing upon him the disciplinary action he really deserves.<br><br>The dismissal of respondent has exposed him to the attendant humiliation and tremendous suffering and virtually stripped him of his dignity and livelihood. Further, his destitution is aggravated by the bad state of his health, considering that he is already in the twilight of his life.<br><br>Again, he pleads for clemency, this time for his minor children who have no source of support other than his leave and retirement benefits. Being also sickly and aging, he is in dire straits indeed. His present situation compels the Court to take a second look at the penalties imposed upon him.<br><br>In <i>Fojas Jr. v. Rollan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the respondent clerk of court was dismissed from the service for dishonesty, for which all retirement benefits except leave credits were forfeited. The same principle was followed in <i>Villaros v. Orpiano</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The Court noted therein that the forfeiture of leave credits was not imposed by Section 58 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, which states:<br><blockquote>“Section 58. Administrative Disabilities Inherent in Certain Penalties –<br><ol type="a"><li> The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it that of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and the perpetual disqualifications for reemployment in the government service, unless otherwise provided in the decision.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Furthermore, Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 41 -- Series of 1998 as amended by MC No. 14, Series of 1999 --provides thus:<br><blockquote>“Section 37. Payment of terminal leave.- Any official/employee of the government who retires, voluntarily resigns, or is separated from the service and who is not otherwise covered by special law, shall be entitled to the commutation of his leave credits exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays without limitation and regardless of the period when the credits were earned.”<br><br>“Section 65. Effect of decision in administrative case. – An official or employee who has been penalized with dismissal from the service is likewise not barred from entitlement to his terminal leave benefits.”<br></blockquote>In the interest of justice and in consideration of the present plight of respondent, the application of the aforementioned cases and of the amended Civil Service Rules is in order. He should be granted the leave credits that he earned during the period of his government service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> We allow him to claim such credits in order to provide him and his family a lifeline and possibly to keep him from again succumbing to the dark temptations sometimes caused by financial woes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <b><i>PARTLY GRANTED</i></b>. The accrued leave benefits of respondent are restored. The Fiscal Management and Budget Office is ordered to compute and immediately release those benefits to him.<br><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Puno, Vitug, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna</i>, and <i>Tinga, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 191-195.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Paredes v.
