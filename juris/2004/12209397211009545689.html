The Foundation rendered medical and nursing services to indigents from Pasay City, Las Piñas, Parañaque, Muntinlupa and Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>San Juan de Dios Educational Foundation Employees Union-Alliance of Filipino Workers (hereinafter referred to as the Union), is the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of the rank-and-file employees in the Foundation.<br><br>Rodolfo Calucin, Jr., then Executive Secretary of the Union, had been employed at the Foundation as a medical clerk for almost twelve years.  In a Letter dated January 14, 1994, the Foundation, through its Personnel Officer Teresita D. Doringo, informed him that, per its records, he had incurred five (5) sets<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of tardiness for 1993, in addition to the two other sets he had incurred in the year 1992, and that such tardiness had affected his efficiency.  He was required to explain, in writing, within seventy-two hours from receipt of the letter, why his services should not be terminated for <i>gross and habitual neglect of his duties,</i> under Article 282 of the Labor Code of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Calucin, Jr. expressed surprise over Doringo’s directive.  In his reply, he claimed that he had already served the maximum suspension of one week, from October 11 to 17, 1993, for his past tardiness.  He furthered that he had not incurred tardiness for the past four months. Moreover, his superior had given him a performance rating of FAIR, as of October 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 27, 1994, the Foundation, through then Acting Vice-President for Health Services Sister Lourdes S.

The petition was certified to the NLRC and was re-docketed as NLRC Case No. 00-09-07117-94.

However, she requested that those whose duties fell on the 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and the 2:00 p.m. to 10 p.m. shifts, be required to return to work on September 1, 1994, considering that they had been in the picket line for the past few days.<br><br>The Foundation denied the Union’s request. The twenty-seven employees who worked the said shifts were not allowed to go back to work.  In response to the manifestations and motions filed by the Union, the SOLE, on September 14 and 21 of 1994, ordered the Foundation to accept the said employees. The Foundation refused.<br><br>On October 5, 1994, the SOLE issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> directing the Foundation to comply with her September 14 and 21, 1994 directives. The dispositive portion of the order reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the San Juan de Dios Hospital, Inc. is strictly enjoined to fully and faithfully comply with the return-to-work Orders dated 14 and 21 September 1994.  More specifically, the Hospital is ordered to accept back to work the employees who were scheduled to report for work on 31 August 1994 and belonging to the 2:00 – 10:00 and 3:00 – 11:00 p.m. shifts without any condition or qualification under the same terms prevailing prior to the strike.<br><br>Sheriff Alfredo C. Antonio, this Department, is hereby directed to implement this Order without further delay.  If necessary, he may seek the assistance of the Pasay City Philippine National Police which is hereby deputized to assist in the peaceful and orderly implementation of this Order.<br></blockquote>The Foundation filed a petition with this Court assailing the October 5, 1994 Order of the SOLE.  The petition was docketed as G.R. No. 117226. In the meantime, the Foundation allowed the payroll reinstatement of the twenty-seven (27) employees, effective only on October 10, 1994, subject to the outcome of its petition filed with this Court in G.R. No. 117226. The Union agreed with this arrangement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On March 27, 1995, the Court, issued a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>    ruling that the SOLE did not act with grave abuse of discretion and affirmed her October 5, 1994 Order.

Torres,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> where it was held that employees who refused to go to work after the issuance of a return-to-work order were deemed to have abandoned their employment.

Nevertheless, the Foundation refused to give the twenty-seven employees the equivalent of their salaries for the period they were refused reinstatement.

However, the striking employees’ defiance of the August 26, 1994 RTWO of the SOLE rendered the strike illegal.  Consequently, under Article 264 (a) paragraph 2 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the officers and members of the Union who refused to return to work after the issuance of the certification/RTWO were deemed to have lost their employment status.  It was also held that considering that the Union members did not know the consequences of their refusal to return to work, only the ranking officers of the Union, i.e.,    the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and PROs, should be deemed to have lost their employment status.<br><br>The NLRC dismissed the claim of unfair labor practice arising from the illegal dismissal of Rogelio Calucin, Jr.  It ruled that Calucin, Jr.’s dismissal was based on his continued tardiness for the year 1992 to 1993, which affected his efficiency as reflected by his performance rating and, therefore, sanctioned by Article 282(b) of the Labor Code.<br><br>The NLRC found that the Union’s claim of discrimination amounting to unfair labor practice was unsubstantiated, particularly on the following matters: a) the treatment in the tardiness of union and non-union members; b) the meal break of dietary personnel; c) the hazard pay of midwives; d) the dismissal of Cachuela; and, e) the forced resignation of Francisco Rellevo, Nestor Centeno, Nemia Abregoso and Grace Isidro from the Union. It also found the explanation of the Foundation meritorious.  The Commission also ruled in favor of the Foundation on the Union’s claim of the harsh enforcement of the Company Code of Discipline on Fe Calucin,    Joan Balucos, Edgar Bas, Victor Estuya, the suspension of unmarried pregnant women, and the charge of violation of the CBA for failure to activate the grievance committee. However, the Commission found the Foundation’s refusal to continue to sustain the recreational activities of the Union invalid.<br><br>As regards the Foundation’s refusal to pay the money claims of the twenty-seven employees, the NLRC ruled that the same was sanctioned by law, considering that the aforesaid employees refused to return to work even after the SOLE already issued a RTWO effective August 31, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Union filed a motion for    reconsideration from the said decision.

However, the Foundation reneged on this agreement and terminated the services of the Union officers immediately after the new CBA was signed and approved on August 12, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On November 25, 1999, the CA rendered a Decision in CA-G.R.

It also ruled that for the Union officers’ and members’ failure to return to work as ordered, the strike was rendered illegal. Consequently, the said union officers and members were deemed to have lost their employment status.<br><br>The CA ruled that the petitioners failed to prove the allegation of unfair labor practice ascribed to the Foundation.  It also declared that the evidence on record shows that Calucin, Jr. was dismissed for gross and habitual neglect of duties for his continued tardiness and inefficiency.<br><br>However, the appellate court ruled that the August 30, 1994 Letter of the petitioner, Ma. Consuelo Maquiling requesting that the 2:00-10:00 p.m. and 3:00-11:00 p.m. shifts be made to report on September 1, 1994 was justified; hence, the refusal of the respondent Foundation to pay the money claims of the twenty-seven employees was unjust and unfair.<br><br>Dissatisfied, the petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the CA.  For its part, the respondent Foundation filed a partial motion for reconsideration of the decision, on the grant of the money claims of the twenty-seven employees.

Hence, they insist they were illegally dismissed by the respondent Foundation.<br><br>We do not agree.  The return of Sheriff Alfredo C.

The Hospital thru Counsel received a copy of the Order on 26 August 1994.

Alfredo Bentulan, but the latter refused to receive the same.  This can be gleaned from the following notation made by the sheriff:<br><blockquote>Served at his office at 11:05 a.m. of 27 August 1994 but his staff refused to receive the Order.  A copy of the order was left by the undersigned to his staff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>It bears stressing that the sheriff’s report is an official statement by him of his acts under the writs and processes issued by the court in obedience to its directive and in conformity with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In the absence of contrary evidence, a presumption exists that a sheriff has regularly performed his official duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> To controvert the presumption arising therefrom, there must be clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In this case, the petitioners failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption.  The bare denial by the petitioners of receiving copies of the order will not suffice.<br><br>The petitioners’ bare denial is even belied by their admission in their position paper before the NLRC and their motion for reconsideration of the decision of the NLRC, that while the sheriff served copies of the order on them, they refused to receive the same because they thought it was a “fake order.” In such case, it behooved the petitioners to verify its validity from the Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment. They failed to do so. The petitioners cannot, thus, feign ignorance of the said order.<br><br>Despite the receipt of an order from then SOLE to return to their respective jobs, the Union officers and members refused to do so and defied the same.  Consequently, then, the strike staged by the Union is a prohibited activity under Article 264 of the Labor Code. Hence, the dismissal of its officers is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The respondent Foundation was, thus, justified in terminating the employment of the petitioner Union’s officers.<br><br>On the last issue, the petitioners failed to prove their claim that the respondent Foundation committed unfair labor practices and discrimination of its employees. We agree with the following discerning findings and encompassing disquisitions of the Court of Appeals on this issue:<br><blockquote>However, the records of this case do not show any hint that Calucin’s [Jr.’s] dismissal is due to his trade union activities.  On the other hand, per findings of the public respondent, the Foundation was able to support with documents how Calucin [Jr.] declared himself irrelevant in the Foundation through his tardiness and shallow excuses such as fetching the water, cooking breakfast, seeing to it that his kids took breakfast before going to school, preparing packed lunch for himself and even the diversions from the usual route of jeepneys that he rode in on these days that he was absent are all lame excuses that amount to lack of interest in his work.  His lackluster work attitude reached his highest point when he filed for a leave of absence of three months to join his brother’s business venture.  Furthermore, it is not true that his attendance improved in 1993 because the records show that in 1993, his tardiness worsened to the point that his repeated tardiness went beyond the maximum contemplated in the Foundation’s Code of Discipline.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, Calucin, Jr.’s dismissal is valid.  (Meralco Workers’ Union vs. Meralco, G.R. No. L-11896, May 29, 1959; Laguna Transportation Employees’ Union versus Laguna Transport Co., Inc., G.R. No. L-23266, April 25, 1968; Cando v. NLRC, G.R. [No.] 91344, September 14, 1990).<br><br>The rest of the charges on discrimination amounting to unfair labor practice acts specifically those affecting the alleged tardiness of Edith Unlao, the meal breaks of the dietary personnel, hazard pay for midwives, the salary of Carmen Herrera including hiring through agency, the resignation of Cachuela, Francisco Rellevo, Nestor Centeno, Nemia Abregoso and Grace Isidro are all dismissed on the ground that the explanation of the Foundation per records of this case were found to be meritorious.<br><br>The same holds true as regard the charges of unfair labor practice through alleged harsh enforcement of the Code of Discipline, affecting Fe Calucin, Joan Balucos, Edgar Bas, Victor Estuya and the suspension of unmarried pregnant women; including the alleged violation of CBA provisions such as paying employees through BPI, refusal to activate grievance committee and failure to maintain recreational activities.<br><br>The Foundation was able to explain and exculpate itself from the charges of unfair labor practice and discrimination as shown in their written replies to these charges which are all in the records of this case.  Consequently, all the charges of unfair labor practice acts are dismissed.<br><br>Thus, in the case of <i>Castillo vs. NLRC, et al.,</i> L-104319, June 17, 1999, the Supreme Court ruled:<br><blockquote>“As earlier pointed out, findings of the NLRC are practically conclusive on this Court.  It is only when the NLRC’s findings are bereft of any substantial support from the records that the Court may step in and proceed to make its own independent evaluation of the facts.  The Court has found none.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, </b>the petition is <b>DENIED.  </b>The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
