SP No. 48171, as well as its Resolution dated 6 January 1999 denying the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal of the National Power Corporation (“NPC”), NPC’s President Pablo Malixi (“Malixi”), and the members of the Board of Inquiry and Discipline (“BID”) for non-observance of Section 10, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br><b><center><u>Antecedent Facts</u></center></b><br>In August 1990, Oscar R. Verdeflor of Nymex Industrial Corporation (“Nymex”) executed a sworn statement reporting alleged anomalous practices in the bidding for the Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (“FRP”) Ejector Headers of the Tiwi Geothermal Power Plant Units 1 and 4.&nbsp; The sworn statement identified Atty. Romy L. Fuentes (“Fuentes”) and Ramon Arel (“Arel”) as participants in the anomaly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; NPC’s Internal Audit Department (“IAD”) investigated the complaint and subsequently recommended the filing of a formal administrative charge against Fuentes, Arel, Lee Licup (“Licup”) and other members of the Bidding Committee.<br><br>NPC then proceeded to conduct a formal administrative investigation.&nbsp; The IAD submitted its report on 4 July 1991.&nbsp; NPC issued an order on 8 August 1991 administratively charging and preventively suspending Fuentes, Arel, Licup (“private respondents”), and other members of the Bidding Committee from the service.&nbsp; The next day, 9 August 1991, NPC issued an order banning private respondents from the NPC office premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Instead of immediately filing an answer within seventy-two hours (three days),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> private respondents requested for several motions for extension.&nbsp; Private respondents received their charge sheets on 8 August 1991, thus the seventy-two hour period should have expired on 11 August 1991.&nbsp; The first motion for extension filed on 9 August 1991 was for one hundred and twenty hours (five days) from the expiration of the original seventy-two hour period.&nbsp; NPC partially granted this by extending the period for ninety-six hours (four days), or until 15 August 1991.<br><br>On 14 August 1991, private respondents filed a second motion for extension for thirty days from 15 August 1991.&nbsp; NPC partially granted this by extending the period for five days, or until 20 August 1991, with a warning that the same is the final extension.&nbsp; Private respondents filed yet another motion for extension of thirty days.&nbsp; NPC denied this request and considered the case submitted for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Private respondents were effectively in default for failing to file their answer despite having been given an extension period of nine days.<br><br>On 4 September 1991, private respondents filed a petition against NPC before the Civil Service Commission (“CSC”), docketed as Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”) Case No. 91-1247.&nbsp; Private respondents prayed that the CSC take cognizance of the administrative case filed against them due to NPC’s partiality in conducting the investigation.&nbsp; On 21 October 1991, the MSPB-CSC dismissed the petition for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, NPC’s BID proceeded with its formal hearing and investigation against private respondents.&nbsp; On 23 September 1991, the BID ruled that:<br><blockquote>In accordance with the above-stated findings, the respondents have been found guilty as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="34%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="33%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="33%"><div align="center"><u>PENALTY</u> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1) Ramon Arel&nbsp;</td> <td>Gross Neglect of Duty</td> <td>Forced Resignation</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2) Romy L.

Licup</td> <td>Gross Neglect of Duty</td> <td>Forced Resignation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>Malixi approved the recommendation. <br><br>Sometime in September 1991, after having been in default before the NPC proceedings, private respondents filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus with a prayer for a temporary restraining order against NPC, Malixi, and members of the BID (“petitioners”) before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 101 (“trial court”), docketed as Sp. Civil Case No. Q-91-10192.&nbsp; Private respondents prayed that: (1) a writ of prohibition be issued commanding petitioners to desist from proceeding with the administrative cases; (2) judgment be rendered annulling the proceedings and the questioned orders; (3) a writ of mandamus be issued commanding petitioners to reinstate private respondents immediately, and to pay their backwages and other benefits retroactive as of 8 August 1991, and allowing availment of the early retirement package as granted by NPC management; and (4) petitioners solidarily pay each of private respondents not less than P1,000,000 as moral damages, P150,000 as attorney’s fees, P150,000 as litigation expenses and costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 2 October 1991, NPC implemented the BID recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court subsequently issued an order granting private respondents’ Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction on 17 October 1991.&nbsp; The order was premised on the supposed denial of due process of law and alleged persecution behind the filing of the administrative charges against private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 14 November 1991, the Office of the Solicitor General (“OSG”), filed on NPC’s behalf, an Answer to the petition pending before the trial court.&nbsp; NPC claimed that private respondents: (1) failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies;&nbsp; (2) do not have a valid and enforceable cause of action against NPC; and that (3) heads of government agencies have exclusive original jurisdiction to investigate and decide matters involving officers and employees under their employ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 10 February 1992, the BID recommended the exoneration of three of Licup’s companions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in the Bidding Committee.&nbsp; Malixi exonerated Aquino, Legados and Maranca soon thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It also appears in the records that Malixi filed a complaint against private respondents with the Office of the Ombudsman (“Ombudsman”), docketed as OMB Case No. 92-0753.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On 26 June 1996, the Ombudsman dismissed the complaint against the private respondents for lack of merit.&nbsp; The Ombudsman stated:<br><blockquote>Since the NPC Board of Inquiry and Discipline has found that the members of the Bidding Committee has [sic] acted properly in declaring the bidding in question a failure, then there is no basis for the charges against herein respondents Lee Licup who is also a member of the said Committee, and Romy L. Fuentes, who merely acted on the basis of said valid declaration of the second bidding.&nbsp; With more reason with respect to respondent Ramon V. Arel who had no participation in the declaration of failure of bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>On 19 March 1992, the trial court issued another order setting aside NPC’s implementation of the BID recommendation.&nbsp; The trial court stated that NPC’s act of placing private respondents “immediately under preventive suspension” was issued without jurisdiction and with abuse of authority.&nbsp; The trial court ordered NPC to reinstate private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioners later filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 27702.&nbsp; Petitioners sought to annul the 19 March 1992 trial court order and to prohibit Judge Pedro T. Santiago from proceeding with the case.&nbsp; On 18 May 1994, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution dismissing petitioners’ petition for lack of merit.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals found that the trial court did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing the 19 March 1992 order.&nbsp; Petitioners did not appeal the Court of Appeals’ 18 May 1994 resolution dismissing CA-G.R. SP No. 27702.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In accordance with the 18 May 1994 Court of Appeals resolution, NPC issued Office Order No. 94-1320 on 13 June 1994, reinstating private respondents to their former positions and ordering payment of their corresponding backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 28 November 1997, the trial court finally handed down its decision in Civil Case No. Q-91-10192.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the trial court’s decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><ol>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaring as permanent the writ of preliminary injunction, thereby barring and enjoining the respondents National Power Corporation and NPC Board of Inquiry and Discipline from further initiating, conducting, and proceeding with any administrative case against the petitioners involving their acts in the public biddings for the fabrication and installation of second stage FRP ejector headers for Units 3 and 4, Tiwi Geothermal Power Plant;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordering the immediate reinstatement and return to [sic] of petitioner Atty.
