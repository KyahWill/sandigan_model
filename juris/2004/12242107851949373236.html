				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Florence Teves Macarrubo (complainant), by herself and on behalf of her two children, filed on June 6, 2000 a verified complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for disbarment against Atty. Edmundo L. Macarubbo (respondent) with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), docketed as CBD Case No. 00-734-A, alleging that respondent deceived her into marrying him despite his prior subsisting marriage with a certain Helen Esparza.<br><br>Detailing the circumstances surrounding respondent’s complained act, complainant averred that he started courting her in April 1991, he representing himself as a bachelor; that they eventually contracted marriage which was celebrated on two occasions administered by Rev. Rogelio J. Bolivar, the first on December 18, 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in the latter’s Manila office, and the second on December 28, 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> at the Asian Institute of Tourism Hotel in Quezon City; and that although respondent admitted that he was married to Helen Esparza on June 16, 1982, he succeeded in convincing complainant, her family and friends that his previous marriage was void.<br><br>Complainant further averred that respondent entered into a third marriage with one Josephine T. Constantino; and that he abandoned complainant and their children without providing them any regular support up to the present time, leaving them in precarious living conditions.<br><br>Complainant submitted documentary evidence consisting of the marriage contract between respondent and Helen Esparza<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and that between her and respondent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and photographs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of their (complainant and respondent) nuptials and of captured moments in their life as a couple and a family.<br><br>Copy of the complaint could not be immediately served upon respondent owing to the difficulty of locating him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Complainant later filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> before the IBP, furnishing therein respondent’s address where he supposedly resided with his third wife Jo T. Constantino-Macarubbo.&nbsp; The IBP Commission on Bar Discipline thereupon thrice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> required respondent to file his Answer.&nbsp; He failed to do so, however, on motion of complainant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> he was declared in default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Complainant was thus allowed to present evidence <i>ex parte</i>.<br><br>The IBP Investigating Commissioner came out with a Report and Recommendation on January 22, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>By Resolution of May 26, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> however, the IBP Board of Governors remanded the case to the Investigating Commissioner to “ensure proper notice or another opportunity to serve notice to the respondent.”&nbsp; Subsequently or on September 5, 2001, respondent filed a Manifestation/<i>Ex Parte</i> Motion to Re-Open Proceedings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which was granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>By Comment of October 18, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> respondent denied employing deception in his marriage to complainant, insisting instead that complainant was fully aware of his prior subsisting marriage to Helen Esparza, but that she dragged him against his will to a “sham wedding” to protect her and her family’s reputation since she was then three-months pregnant.<br><br>Respondent submitted in evidence the final and executory October 30, 2000 Decision of Branch IV of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tuguegarao City in Civil Case No. 5617, “<i>Edmundo L.

Constantino;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that she resorted to forum-shopping in bringing both this administrative action and the civil case with the Quezon City RTC.<br><br>Stressing that he had always been the victim in his marital relations, respondent invoked the final and executory August 21, 1998 Decision of Branch 158 of the Pasig City RTC in JDRC Case No. 4320, “<i>Edmundo L. Macarubbo v. Helen C. Esparza</i>,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> declaring his first marriage void on the ground of his wife’s psychological incapacity.<br><br>After hearing during which both complainant and respondent took the witness stand, the Investigating Commissioner rendered a Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is <u>recommended</u> that respondent Atty.

Respondent cannot thus take refuge in the earlier mentioned finding in the decision of Tuguegarao City trial court in the annulment case he filed against complainant.&nbsp; The decision, <b>rendered in default of complainant</b>, cannot serve as <i>res judicata</i> on the final resolution of the present case.&nbsp; As this Court held in <i>In re Almacen</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> a disbarment case is <i>sui generis</i> for it is neither purely civil nor purely criminal but is rather an investigation by the Court into the conduct of its officers.&nbsp; Thus, if the acquittal of a lawyer in a criminal action is not determinative of an administrative case against him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> or if an affidavit of withdrawal of a disbarment case does not affect its course,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> then the judgment of annulment of respondent’s marriage does not also exonerate him from a wrongdoing actually committed.&nbsp; So long as the quantum of proof — clear preponderance of evidence — in disciplinary proceedings against members of the bar is met, then liability attaches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The disturbing fact that respondent was able to secure the annulment of his first two marriages and is in the process of procuring the annulment of his third bears noting.&nbsp;

Constantino which is again the subject of another annulment case.&nbsp; It would not come as a surprise if in that pending case, he would again put blame on his third wife in order to send the marriage to oblivion.<br><br>Respondent here has exhibited the vice of entering into multiple marriages and then leaving them behind by the mere expedient of resorting to legal remedies to sever them.&nbsp; The impact of respondent’s conduct is incalculable upon his ex-wives as well as the children he had by them, their lives having been dislocated beyond recall.<br><br>Respondent’s assertion that he has not failed to support his children by complainant is not totally supported by the evidence on record.&nbsp; He may have secured educational plans for them and doled out some sums of money in the past, but it appears that he has failed to provide them regular, monthly support.&nbsp; In fact, he admitted that even before he left complainant’s residence in 1995, he was only giving intermittent support to his children with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Such pattern of misconduct by respondent undermines the institutions of marriage and family, institutions that this society looks to for the rearing of our children, for the development of values essential to the survival and well-being of our communities, and for the strengthening of our nation as a whole.&nbsp; This must be checked if not stopped.<br><br>As officers of the court, lawyers must not only in fact be of good moral character but must also be perceived to be of good moral character and must lead a life in accordance with the highest moral standards of the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; The moral delinquency that affects the fitness of a member of the bar to continue as such, including that which makes a mockery of the inviolable social institution of marriage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> outrages the generally accepted moral standards of the community.<br><br>In sum, respondent has breached the following precepts of the Code of Professional Responsibility:<br><blockquote>Rule 1.01 — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.<br><br>CANON 7 — A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession, and support the activities of the Integrated Bar.<br><br>Rule 7.03 — A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.</blockquote>There can then be no other fate that awaits respondent, as a consequence of his grossly immoral conduct, than to be disbarred or suspended from the practice of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; The penalty of 3 months suspension recommended by the IBP is, not commensurate to the gravity of his conduct.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Edmundo L.
