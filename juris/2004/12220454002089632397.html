O. No. 279 by virtue of which order the questioned FTAA was forged.<br><center><br><b>I</b><br></center><br>Before going into the substantive issues, the procedural questions posed by respondents shall first be tackled.<br><center><br><b><u>REQUISITES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW</u></b><br></center><br>When an issue of constitutionality is raised, this Court can exercise its power of judicial review only if the following requisites are present:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; The existence of an actual and appropriate case;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; A personal and substantial interest of the party raising the constitutional question;<br><br>(3)&nbsp; The exercise of judicial review is pleaded at the earliest opportunity; and<br><br>(4)&nbsp; The constitutional question is the <i>lis mota</i> of the case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Respondents claim that the first three requisites are not present.<br><br>Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution states that “(j)udicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable.” The power of judicial review, therefore, is limited to the determination of actual cases and controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>An actual case or controversy means an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> lest the decision of the court would amount to an advisory opinion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The power does not extend to hypothetical questions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> since any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>“Legal standing” or <i>locus standi</i> has been defined as a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> alleging more than a generalized grievance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges “such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Unless a person is injuriously affected in any of his constitutional rights by the operation of statute or ordinance, he has no standing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Petitioners traverse a wide range of sectors.&nbsp; Among them are La Bugal B’laan Tribal Association, Inc., a farmers and indigenous people’s cooperative organized under Philippine laws representing a community actually affected by the mining activities of WMCP, members of said cooperative,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> as well as other residents of areas also affected by the mining activities of WMCP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> These petitioners have standing to raise the constitutionality of the questioned FTAA as they allege a personal and substantial injury.&nbsp; They claim that they would suffer “irremediable displacement”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> as a result of the implementation of the FTAA allowing WMCP to conduct mining activities in their area of residence.&nbsp; They thus meet the appropriate case requirement as they assert an interest adverse to that of respondents who, on the other hand, insist on the FTAA’s validity.<br><br>In view of the alleged impending injury, petitioners also have standing to assail the validity of <u>E.O. No. 279</u>, by authority of which the FTAA was executed.<br><br>Public respondents maintain that petitioners, being strangers to the FTAA, cannot sue either or both contracting parties to annul it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In other words, they contend that petitioners are not real parties in interest in an action for the annulment of contract.<br><br>Public respondents’ contention fails.&nbsp; The present action is not merely one for annulment of contract but for prohibition and mandamus.&nbsp; Petitioners allege that public respondents acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in implementing the FTAA, which they submit is unconstitutional.&nbsp; As the case involves constitutional questions, this Court is not concerned with whether petitioners are real parties in interest, but with whether they have legal standing.&nbsp; As held in <i>Kilosbayan v. Morato</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x.&nbsp; “It is important to note . . . that standing because of its constitutional and public policy underpinnings, is very different from questions relating to whether a particular plaintiff is the real party in interest or has capacity to sue.&nbsp; Although all three requirements are directed towards ensuring that only certain parties can maintain an action, standing restrictions require a partial consideration of the merits, as well as broader policy concerns relating to the proper role of the judiciary in certain areas.[”]&nbsp; (FRIEDENTHAL, KANE AND MILLER, CIVIL PROCEDURE 328 [1985])<br><br>Standing is a special concern in constitutional law because in some cases suits are brought not by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or by official action taken, but by concerned citizens, taxpayers or voters who actually sue in the public interest.&nbsp; Hence, the question in standing is whether such parties have “alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.”&nbsp; (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 7 L.Ed.2d 633 [1962].)<br></blockquote>As earlier stated, petitioners meet this requirement.<br><br>The challenge against the constitutionality of <u>R.A. No. 7942 and DAO No. 96-40</u> likewise fulfills the requisites of justiciability.&nbsp; Although these laws were not in force when the subject FTAA was entered into, the question as to their validity is ripe for adjudication.<br><br>The WMCP FTAA provides:<br><blockquote><br>14.3&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Future Legislation</u><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Any term and condition more favourable to Financial &amp;Technical Assistance Agreement contractors resulting from repeal or amendment of any existing law or regulation or from the enactment of a law, regulation or administrative order shall be considered a part of this Agreement.<br></div></blockquote>It is undisputed that R.A. No. 7942 and DAO No. 96-40 contain provisions that are more favorable to WMCP, hence, these laws, to the extent that they are favorable to WMCP, govern the FTAA.<br><br>In addition, R.A. No. 7942 explicitly makes certain provisions apply to pre-existing agreements.<br><blockquote>SEC. 112.<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; </span><i>Non-impairment of Existing Mining/Quarrying Rights</i>. – x x x&nbsp; That the provisions of Chapter XIV on government share in mineral production-sharing agreement and of Chapter XVI on incentives of this Act shall immediately govern and apply to a mining lessee or contractor unless the mining lessee or contractor indicates his intention to the secretary, in writing, not to avail of said provisions x x x&nbsp; <i>Provided, finally</i>, That such leases, production-sharing agreements, financial or technical assistance agreements shall comply with the applicable provisions of this Act and its implementing rules and regulations.<br></blockquote>As there is no suggestion that WMCP has indicated its intention not to avail of the provisions of Chapter XVI of R.A. No. 7942, it can safely be presumed that they apply to the WMCP FTAA.<br><br>Misconstruing the application of the third requisite for judicial review – that the exercise of the review is pleaded at the earliest opportunity – WMCP points out that the petition was filed only almost two years after the execution of the FTAA, hence, not raised at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>The third requisite should not be taken to mean that the question of constitutionality must be raised immediately after the execution of the state action complained of.&nbsp; That the question of constitutionality has not been raised before is not a valid reason for refusing to allow it to be raised later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> A contrary rule would mean that a law, otherwise unconstitutional, would lapse into constitutionality by the mere failure of the proper party to promptly file a case to challenge the same.<br><center><br><b><u>PROPRIETY OF PROHIBITION<br>AND MANDAMUS</u></b><br></center><br>Before the effectivity in July 1997 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, Section 2 of Rule 65 read:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2.&nbsp; <i>Petition for prohibition</i>. – When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial or ministerial, are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the defendant to desist from further proceeding in the action or matter specified therein.<br></blockquote>Prohibition is a preventive remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It seeks a judgment ordering the defendant to desist from continuing with the commission of an act perceived to be illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The petition for prohibition at bar is thus an appropriate remedy.

By fiction of law, the King was regarded as the original proprietor of all lands, and the true and only source of title, and from him all lands were held.&nbsp; The theory of <i>jura regalia</i> was therefore nothing more than a natural fruit of conquest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>The Philippines having passed to Spain by virtue of discovery and conquest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> earlier Spanish decrees declared that “all lands were held from the Crown.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>The Regalian doctrine extends not only to land but also to “all natural wealth that may be found in the bowels of the earth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Spain, in particular, recognized the unique value of natural resources, viewing them, especially minerals, as an abundant source of revenue to finance its wars against other nations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Mining laws during the Spanish regime reflected this perspective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]<br><br></sup><center><b><u>THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION AND<br>THE CONCESSION REGIME</u></b><br></center><br>By the <b>Treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898</b>, Spain ceded “the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands” to the United States.&nbsp;

Agabin, who was a member of the working group that prepared the U.P. Law draft, criticized service contracts for they “lodge exclusive management and control of the enterprise to the service contractor, which is reminiscent of the old concession regime.&nbsp; Thus, notwithstanding the provision of the Constitution that natural resources belong to the State, and that these shall not be alienated, the service contract system renders nugatory the constitutional provisions cited.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup> He elaborates:<br><blockquote>Looking at the Philippine model, we can discern the following vestiges of the concession regime, thus:<br><ol><li>Bidding of a selected area, or leasing the choice of the area to the interested party and then negotiating the terms and conditions of the contract; (Sec. 5, P.D. 87)<br><br></li><li><b>Management of the enterprise vested on the contractor, including operation of the field if petroleum is discovered;</b> (Sec. 8, P.D. 87)<br><br></li><li><b>Control of production and other matters such as expansion and development;<br><br></b></li><li><b>Responsibility for downstream operations – marketing, distribution, and processing may be with the contractor</b> (Sec. 8);<br><br></li><li>Ownership of equipment, machinery, fixed assets, and other properties remain with contractor (Sec. 12, P.D. 87);<br><br></li><li>Repatriation of capital and retention of profits abroad guaranteed to the contractor (Sec. 13, P.D. 87); and<br><br></li><li><b>While title to the petroleum discovered may nominally be in the name of the government, the contractor has almost unfettered control over its disposition and sale</b>, and even the domestic requirements of the country is relegated to a <u>pro rata</u> basis (Sec. 8).<br></li></ol>In short, our version of the service contract is just a rehash of the old concession regime x x x.&nbsp; Some people have pulled an old rabbit out of a magician’s hat, and foisted it upon us as a new and different animal.<br><br><b>The service contract as we know it here is antithetical to the principle of sovereignty over our natural resources restated in the same article of the [1973] Constitution containing the provision for service contracts.&nbsp; If the service contractor happens to be a foreign corporation, the contract would also run counter to the constitutional provision on nationalization or Filipinization, of the exploitation of our natural resources.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.&nbsp; Underscoring in the original.]<br></blockquote>Professor Merlin M. Magallona, also a member of the working group, was harsher in his reproach of the system:<br><blockquote>x x x the nationalistic phraseology of the 1935 [Constitution] was retained by the [1973] Charter, but the essence of nationalism was reduced to hollow rhetoric.&nbsp; The 1973 Charter still provided that the exploitation or development of the country’s natural resources be limited to Filipino citizens or corporations owned or controlled by them.&nbsp; However, the martial-law Constitution allowed them, once these resources are in their name, to enter into service contracts with foreign investors for financial, technical, management, or other forms of assistance.&nbsp; Since foreign investors have the capital resources, the actual exploitation and development, as well as the effective disposition, of the country’s natural resources, would be under their direction, and control, relegating the Filipino investors to the role of second-rate partners in joint ventures.<br><br><b>Through the instrumentality of the service contract, the 1973 Constitution had legitimized at the highest level of state policy that which was prohibited under the 1973 Constitution, namely: the exploitation of the country’s natural resources by foreign nationals.&nbsp; The drastic impact of [this] constitutional change becomes more pronounced when it is considered that the active party to any service contract may be a corporation wholly owned by foreign interests.&nbsp; In such a case, the citizenship requirement is completely set aside, permitting foreign corporations to obtain actual possession, control, and [enjoyment] of the country’s natural resources</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Accordingly, Professor Agabin recommends that:<br><blockquote><b>Recognizing the service contract for what it is, we have to expunge it from the Constitution and reaffirm ownership over our natural resources.</b>&nbsp; That is the only way we can exercise effective control over our natural resources.<br><br>This should not mean complete isolation of the country’s natural resources from foreign investment.&nbsp; <b>Other contract forms which are less derogatory to our sovereignty and control over natural resources – like technical assistance agreements, financial assistance [agreements], co-production agreements, joint ventures, production-sharing – could still be utilized and adopted without violating constitutional provisions.&nbsp; In other words, we can adopt contract forms which recognize and assert our sovereignty and ownership over natural resources, and where the foreign entity is just a pure contractor instead of the beneficial owner of our economic resources.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Still another member of the working group, Professor Eduardo Labitag, proposed that:<br><blockquote><ol start="2"><li><b>Service contracts as practiced under the 1973 Constitution should be discouraged, instead the government may be allowed, subject to authorization by special law passed by an extraordinary majority to enter into either technical or financial assistance.</b>&nbsp; This is justified by the fact that as presently worded in the 1973 Constitution, a service contract gives full control over the contract area to the service contractor, for him to work, manage and dispose of the proceeds or production.&nbsp; It was a subterfuge to get around the nationality requirement of the constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup>&nbsp; [Emphasis supplied.]<br></li></ol></blockquote>In the annotations on the proposed Article on National Economy and Patrimony, the U.P. Law draft summarized the rationale therefor, thus:<br><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>The last paragraph is a modification of the service contract provision found in Section 9, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution as amended.&nbsp; This 1973 provision shattered the framework of nationalism in our fundamental law (see Magallona, “Nationalism and its Subversion in the Constitution”).&nbsp; Through the service contract, the 1973 Constitution had legitimized that which was prohibited under the 1935 constitution—the exploitation of the country’s natural resources by foreign nationals.&nbsp; Through the service contract, acts prohibited by the Anti-Dummy Law were recognized as legitimate arrangements.&nbsp; <b>Service contracts lodge exclusive management and control of the enterprise to the service contractor, not unlike the old concession regime where the concessionaire had complete control over the country’s natural resources, having been given exclusive and plenary rights to exploit a particular resource and, in effect, having been assured of ownership of that resource at the point of extraction</b> (see Agabin, “Service Contracts: Old Wine in New Bottles”).&nbsp; Service contracts, hence, are antithetical to the principle of sovereignty over our natural resources, as well as the constitutional provision on nationalization or Filipinization of the exploitation of our natural resources.<br></li></ol><b>Under the proposed provision, only technical assistance or financial assistance agreements may be entered into, and only for large-scale activities.&nbsp; These are contract forms which recognize and assert our sovereignty and ownership over natural resources since the foreign entity is just a pure contractor and not a beneficial owner of our economic resources.&nbsp; The proposal recognizes the need for capital and technology to develop our natural resources without sacrificing our sovereignty and control over such resources by the safeguard of a special law which requires two-thirds vote of all the members of the Legislature.</b>&nbsp; This will ensure that such agreements will be debated upon exhaustively and thoroughly in the National Assembly to avert prejudice to the nation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>The U.P. Law draft proponents viewed service contracts under the 1973 Constitution as grants of beneficial ownership of the country’s natural resources to foreign owned corporations.&nbsp; While, in theory, the State owns these natural resources – and Filipino citizens, their beneficiaries – service contracts actually vested foreigners with the right to dispose, explore for, develop, exploit, and utilize the same.&nbsp; Foreigners, not Filipinos, became the beneficiaries of Philippine natural resources.&nbsp; This arrangement is clearly incompatible with the constitutional ideal of nationalization of natural resources, with the Regalian doctrine, and on a broader perspective, with Philippine sovereignty.<br><br>The proponents nevertheless acknowledged the need for capital and technical know-how in the large-scale exploitation, development and utilization of natural resources – the second paragraph of the proposed draft itself being an admission of such scarcity.&nbsp; Hence, they recommended a compromise to reconcile the nationalistic provisions dating back to the 1935 Constitution, which reserved all natural resources exclusively to Filipinos, and the more liberal 1973 Constitution, which allowed foreigners to participate in these resources through service contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a compromise called for the adoption of a new system in the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources in the form of technical agreements or financial agreements which, necessarily, are distinct concepts from service contracts.<br><br>The replacement of “service contracts” with “agreements… involving either technical or financial assistance,” as well as the deletion of the phrase “management or other forms of assistance,” assumes greater significance when note is taken that the U.P. Law draft proposed other equally crucial changes that were obviously heeded by the CONCOM.&nbsp; These include the abrogation of the concession system and the adoption of new “options” for the State in the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources.&nbsp; The proponents deemed these changes to be more consistent with the State’s ownership of, and its “full control and supervision” (a phrase also employed by the framers) over, such resources.&nbsp; The Project explained:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li> In line with the State ownership of natural resources, the State should take a more active role in the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources, than the present practice of granting licenses, concessions, or leases – hence the provision that said activities shall be under the full control and supervision of the State.&nbsp; There are three major schemes by which the State could undertake these activities: first, directly by itself; second, by virtue of co-production, joint venture, production sharing agreements with Filipino citizens or corporations or associations sixty per cent (60%) of the voting stock or controlling interests of which are owned by such citizens; or third, with a foreign-owned corporation, in cases of large-scale exploration, development, or utilization of natural resources through agreements involving either technical or financial assistance only.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>At present, under the licensing concession or lease schemes, the government benefits from such benefits only through fees, charges, ad valorem taxes and income taxes of the exploiters of our natural resources.&nbsp; Such benefits are very minimal compared with the enormous profits reaped by theses licensees, grantees, concessionaires.&nbsp; Moreover, some of them disregard the conservation of natural resources and do not protect the environment from degradation.&nbsp; The proposed role of the State will enable it to a greater share in the profits – it can also actively husband its natural resources and engage in developmental programs that will be beneficial to them.<br><br></li><li>Aside from the three major schemes for the exploration, development, and utilization of our natural resources, the State may, by law, allow Filipino citizens to explore, develop, utilize natural resources in small-scale.&nbsp; This is in recognition of the plight of marginal fishermen, forest dwellers, gold panners, and others similarly situated who exploit our natural resources for their daily sustenance and survival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Professor Agabin, in particular, after taking pains to illustrate the similarities between the two systems, concluded that the service contract regime was but a “rehash” of the concession system.&nbsp; “Old wine in new bottles,” as he put it.&nbsp; <b>The rejection of the service contract regime, therefore, is in consonance with the abolition of the concession system.</b><br><br>In light of the deliberations of the CONCOM, the text of the Constitution, and the adoption of other proposed changes, there is no doubt that the framers considered and shared the intent of the U.P. Law proponents in employing the phrase “agreements . . . involving either technical or financial assistance.”<br><br>While certain commissioners may have mentioned the term “service contracts” during the CONCOM deliberations, they may not have been necessarily referring to the concept of service contracts under the 1973 Constitution.&nbsp; As noted earlier, “service contracts” is a term that assumes different meanings to different people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup> The commissioners may have been using the term loosely, and not in its technical and legal sense, to refer, in general, to agreements concerning natural resources entered into by the Government with foreign corporations.&nbsp; These loose statements do not necessarily translate to the adoption of the 1973 Constitution provision allowing service contracts.<br><br>It is true that, as shown in the earlier quoted portions of the proceedings in CONCOM, in response to Sr. Tan’s question, Commissioner Villegas commented that, other than congressional notification, the only difference between “future” and “past” “service contracts” is the requirement of a general law as there were no laws previously authorizing the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> However, such remark is far outweighed by his more categorical statement in his exchange with Commissioner Quesada that the draft article “does not permit foreign investors to participate” in the nation’s natural resources – which was exactly what service contracts did – except to provide “technical or financial assistance.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup><br><br>In the case of the other commissioners, Commissioner Nolledo himself clarified in his work that the present charter prohibits service contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> Commissioner Gascon was not totally averse to foreign participation, but favored stricter restrictions in the form of majority congressional concurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, Commissioners Garcia and Tadeo may have veered to the extreme side of the spectrum and their objections may be interpreted as votes against any foreign participation in our natural resources whatsoever.<br><br>WMCP cites Opinion No. 75, s. 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> and Opinion No. 175, s. 1990<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> of the Secretary of Justice, expressing the view that a financial or technical assistance agreement “is no different in concept” from the service contract allowed under the 1973 Constitution.&nbsp; This Court is not, however, bound by this interpretation.&nbsp; When an administrative or executive agency renders an opinion or issues a statement of policy, it merely interprets a pre-existing law; and the administrative interpretation of the law is at best advisory, for it is the courts that finally determine what the law means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup><br><br>In any case, the constitutional provision allowing the President to enter into FTAAs with foreign-owned corporations is an exception to the rule that participation in the nation’s natural resources is reserved exclusively to Filipinos.

Article 2 (1) of said treaty states that it applies to investments whenever made and thus the fact that [WMCP’s] FTAA was entered into prior to the entry into force of the treaty does not preclude the Philippine Government from protecting [WMCP’s] investment in [that] FTAA.&nbsp;

The latter stipulation indicates that it was intended to impose an obligation upon a Party to afford fair and equitable treatment to the investments of the other Party and that a failure to provide such treatment by or under the laws of the Party may constitute a breach of the treaty.&nbsp; Simply stated, the Philippines could not, under said treaty, rely upon the inadequacies of its own laws to deprive an Australian investor (like [WMCP]) of fair and equitable treatment by invalidating [WMCP’s] FTAA without likewise nullifying the service contracts entered into before the enactment of RA 7942 such as those mentioned in PD 87 or EO 279.<br><br>This becomes more significant in the light of the fact that [WMCP’s] FTAA was executed not by a mere Filipino citizen, but by the Philippine Government itself, through its President no less, which, in entering into said treaty is assumed to be aware of the existing Philippine laws on service contracts over the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources.&nbsp;

the annulment of the FTAA would not constitute a breach of the treaty invoked.&nbsp; For this decision herein invalidating the subject FTAA forms part of the legal system of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[301]</sup> The equal protection clause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup> guarantees that such decision shall apply to all contracts belonging to the same class, hence, upholding rather than violating, the “fair and equitable treatment” stipulation in said treaty.<br><br>One other matter requires clarification.&nbsp; Petitioners contend that, consistent with the provisions of Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution, the President may enter into agreements involving “<b>either</b> technical <b>or</b> financial assistance” only.&nbsp; The agreement in question, however, is a technical <b>and</b> financial assistance agreement.<br><br>Petitioners’ contention does not lie.&nbsp; To adhere to the literal language of the Constitution would lead to absurd consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[303]</sup>&nbsp; As WMCP correctly put it:<br><blockquote>x x x such a theory of petitioners would compel the government (through the President) to enter into contract with two (2) foreign-owned corporations, one for financial assistance agreement and with the other, for technical assistance over one and the same mining area or land;&nbsp; or to execute two (2) contracts with only one foreign-owned corporation which has the capability to provide both financial and technical assistance, one for financial assistance and another for technical assistance, over the same mining area.&nbsp; Such an absurd result is definitely not sanctioned under the canons of constitutional construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[304]</sup> [Underscoring in the original.]<br></blockquote>Surely, the framers of the 1987 Charter did not contemplate such an absurd result from their use of “either/or.” A constitution is not to be interpreted as demanding the impossible or the impracticable;

Delegate Aruego expounds:<br><blockquote>At the time of the framing of the Philippine Constitution, Filipino capital had been known to be rather shy.&nbsp; Filipinos hesitated as a general rule to invest a considerable sum of their capital for the development, exploitation, and utilization of the natural resources of the country.&nbsp; They had not as yet been so used to corporate enterprises as the peoples of the West.&nbsp; This general apathy, the delegates knew, would mean the retardation of the development of the natural resources, unless foreign capital would be encouraged to come in and help in that development.&nbsp; They knew that the nationalization of the natural resources would certainly not encourage the investment of foreign capital into them.&nbsp; But there was a general feeling in the Convention that it was better to have such development retarded or even postponed altogether until such time when the Filipinos would be ready and willing to undertake it rather than permit the natural resources to be placed under the ownership or control of foreigners in order that they might be immediately developed, with the Filipinos of the future serving not as owners but at most as tenants or workers under foreign masters.&nbsp; By all means, the delegates believed, the natural resources should be conserved for Filipino posterity.<br><br>The nationalization of natural resources was also intended as an instrument of national defense.&nbsp; The Convention felt that to permit foreigner to own or control the natural resources would be to weaken the national defense.&nbsp; It would be making possible the gradual extension of foreign influence into our politics, thereby increasing the possibility of foreign control.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>Not only these.&nbsp; The nationalization of the natural resources, it was believed, would prevent making the Philippines a source of international conflicts with the consequent danger to its internal security and independence.&nbsp; For unless the natural resources were nationalized, with the nationals of foreign countries having the opportunity to own or control them, conflicts of interest among them might arise inviting danger to the safety and independence of the nation.&nbsp; (<i>Id</i>., at 605-606.)<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> <i>Palting v.

In such agreements, the State shall promote the development and use of local scientific and technical resources.<br><br>“The President shall notify the Congress of every contract entered into in accordance with this provision within thirty days from its execution.”<br></blockquote>After a careful reading of the provisions of Republic Act No. 7942, I join the majority in invalidating the following portions of the law: a) Section 3 (aq) which considers a foreign-owned corporation itself qualified, not only to enter into financial or technical assistance agreements, but also for an exploration or mineral processing permit; b) Section 35 (g), (I), (m) which state the rights and obligations of a foreign-owned corporations pursuant to its “mining operations”; and c) Section 56 which provides that foreign-owned or controlled corporations are eligible to be granted a mineral processing permit.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i>, so eloquently expressed and so well ratiocinated, would also say that the Philippine Mining Act and its implementing rules or decrees contain provisions which, in effect, authorize the Government to enter into service contracts with foreign-owned corporations, thereby granting beneficial ownership over natural resources to foreign contractors in violation of the fundamental law. Thus, it would strike down Sections 3 (aq), 23, 33 to 41, 56, 81, and 90 of the statute and related sections in DAO 96-40. The FTAA executed between the Government and WMCP is being invalidated for being in the nature of a service contract. The ponencia posits that the adoption of the terms “agreements x x x involving either technical or financial assistance” in the 1987 Constitution, in lieu of “service contracts” found in the 1973 Charter, reflects the intention of the framers to disallow the execution of service contracts with foreign entities for the exploration, development, exploitation and utilization of the country’s natural resources.<br><br>The proposition is one that I, most respectfully, cannot fully share. The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission do not disclose, in any evident manner, such intention on the part of the drafters, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>“MR. JAMIR. &nbsp;Yes, Madam President. With respect to the second paragraph of Section 3, my amendment by substitution reads: THE PRESIDENT MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH FOREIGN-OWNED CORPORATIONS INVOLVING EITHER TECHNICAL OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LARGE-SCALE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES ACCORDING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDED BY LAW.<br><br>“X X X<br><br>“MR. SUAREZ. Thank you, Madam President. Will Commissioner Jamir answer a few clarificatory questions?<br><br>“MR. JAMIR. Yes, Madam President.<br><br>“MR. SUAREZ. This particular portion of the section has reference to what was popularly known before as service contracts, among other things; is that correct?<br><br>“MR. JAMIR. Yes, Madam President.<br><br>“MR. SUAREZ. As it is formulated, the President may enter into service contracts but subject to the guidelines that may be promulgated by Congress?<br><br>“MR. JAMIR. <b>That is correct</b>.<br><br>“MR. SUAREZ. Therefore, the aspect of negotiation and consummation will fall on the President, not upon Congress?<br><br>“MR. JAMIR. That is also correct, Madam President.<br><br>“MR. SUAREZ. Except that all of these contracts, service or otherwise must be made strictly in accordance with guidelines prescribed by Congress?<br><br>“MR. JAMIR. That is also correct.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>The significance of the change in the terminology is clarified in the following exchanges during the deliberations:<br><blockquote>“SR. TAN. Am I correct in thinking that the only difference between these <b>future service contracts and the past service contracts under Mr. Marcos is the general law to be enacted by the legislature and the notification of Congress by the President?</b> That is the only difference, is it not?<br><br>“MR. VILLEGAS. <b>That is right.</b><br><br>“SR. TAN. So those are the safeguards.<br><br>“MR. VILLEGAS. Yes”, there was no law at all governing service contracts before.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>The Constitutional Commission has also agreed to include the additional requirement that said agreements must be “based on real contributions to the economic growth and general welfare of the country.” Upon the suggestion of then Commissioner Davide, the scope of “these service contracts” has likewise been limited to large-scale exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, petroleum, and other mineral oils. The then Commissioner, explains: “And so, we believe that we should really, if we want to grant service contracts at all, limit the same to only those particular areas where Filipino capital may not be sufficient x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The majority would cite the emphatic statements of Commissioners Villegas and Davide that the country’s natural resources are exclusively reserved for Filipino citizens<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and that, according to Commissioner Villegas, “the deletion of the phrase ‘service contracts’ (is the) first attempt to avoid some of the abuses in the past regime in the use of service contracts to go around the 60-40 arrangement”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> These declarations do not necessarily mean that the Government may no longer enter into service contracts with foreign entities. In order to uphold and strengthen the national policy of preserving and developing the country’s natural resources exclusively for the Filipino people, the present Constitution indeed has provided for safeguards to prevent the execution of service contracts of the old regime, but not of service contracts <i>per se</i>. It could not have been the object of the framers of the Charter to limit the contracts which the President may enter into, to mere “agreements for financial and technical assistance”. One would take it that the usual terms and conditions recognized and stipulated in agreements of such nature have been contemplated. Basically, the financier and the owner of know-how would understandably satisfy itself with the proper implementation and the profitability of the project. It would be abnormal for the financier and owner of the know-how not to assure itself that all the activities needed to bring the project into fruition are properly implemented, attended to, and carried out. Needless to say, no foreign&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; investor would readily lend financial or technical assistance without the proper incentives, including fair returns, therefor.<br><br>The Constitution has not prohibited the State from itself exploring, developing, or utilizing the country’s natural resources, and, for this purpose, it may, I submit, enter into the necessary agreements with individuals or entities in the pursuit of a feasible operation.<br><br>The fundamental law is deemed written in every contract. The FTAA entered into by the government and WMCP recognizes this vital principle. Thus, two of the agreement’s whereas clauses provide:<br><blockquote>“WHEREAS, the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines provides in Article XII, Section 2 that all lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other natural resources are owned by the State, and that the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State; and<br><br>“WHEREAS, the Constitution further provides that the Government may enter into agreements with foreign-owned corporations involving either technical or financial assistance for large scale exploration, development and utilization of minerals.”<br></blockquote>The assailed contract or its provisions must then be read in conformity with abovementioned constitutional mandate. Hence, Section 10.2 (a) of the FTAA, for instance, which states that “the Contractor shall have the exclusive right to explore for, exploit, utilize, process, market, export and dispose of all minerals and products and by-products thereof that may be derived or produced from the Contract Area and to otherwise conduct Mining Operations in the Contract Area in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, must be taken to mean that the foregoing rights are to be exercised by WMCP for and in behalf of the State and that WMCP, as the Contractor, would be bound to carry out the terms and conditions of the agreement acting for and in behalf of the State. In exchange for the financial and technical assistance, inclusive of its services, the Contractor enjoys an exclusivity of the contract and a corresponding compensation therefor.<br><br>Except as so expressed elsewhere above, I see, therefore, no constitutional impairment in the enactment of Republic Act No. 7942, as well as its implementing rules, and in the execution by the Government of the Financial and Technical Agreement with WMCP; and I so vote accordingly.<br><br>Just a word. While I cannot ignore an impression of the business community that the Court is wont, at times, to interfere with the economic decisions of Congress and the government’s economic managers, I must hasten to add, however, that in so voting as above, I have not been unduly overwhelmed by that perception. Quite the contrary, the Court has always proceeded with great caution, such as now, in resolving cases that could inextricably involve policy questions thought to be best left to the technical expertise of the legislative and executive departments.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> III Record of the Constitutional Commission 348.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id, p. 352.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id, p. 355.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Decision, pp, 69-71.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id., p. 69.<br><br><div align="justify"><br><hr align="center" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><center><br><u style="font-weight: bold;">SEPARATE OPINION</u><br></center><br>PANGANIBAN, J.:<br><br>Petitioners challenge the constitutionality of (1) RA 7942 (The Philippine Mining Act of 1995), (2) its Implementing Rules and Regulations (DENR Administrative Order [DAO] 96-40); and (3) the Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) dated March 30, 1995, by and between the government and Western Mining Corporation (Phils.), Inc. (WMCP).<br><br><center><b><i><u>Crux of the Controversy</u></i></b><br></center><br>The crux of the controversy is the fact that WMCP, <i>at the time it entered into the FTAA</i>, was wholly owned by WMC Resources International Pty., Ltd. (WMC), which in turn was a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Mining Corporation Holdings, Ltd., a publicly Listed major Australian mining and exploration company.<br><br>Petitioners thus argue that the FTAA was executed in violation of Section 2 of Article XII of the 1987 Constitution. Allegedly, according to the fourth paragraph thereof, FTAAs entered into by the government with <i>foreign-owned corporations</i> are limited to agreements involving merely <b>technical or financial assistance</b> to the State for large-scale exploration, development and utilization of minerals, petroleum and other mineral oils. The FTAA in question supposedly permits the foreign contractor to <i>manage and control the mining operations fully</i>, and is therefore no different from the “service contracts” that were prevalent under the martial law regime, and that are now disallowed by Section 2 of Article XII of the present Constitution.<br><br>On January 23, 2001, all the shares of WMC in WMCP -- according to the latter’s Manifestation subsequently filed with this Court -- had been sold to Sagittarius Mines, Inc., in which 60 percent of the equity is Filipino-owned. In the same Manifestation, the Court was further informed that the assailed FTAA had likewise been transferred from WMCP to Sagittarius.<br><br>The well-researched <i>ponencia</i> of esteemed Justice Conchita Carpio Morales nevertheless declares that the instant case has <i>not</i> been rendered moot by the FTAA’s transfer to and registration in the name of a <i>Filipino-owned corporation</i>, and that the validity of that transfer remains in dispute and awaits final judicial determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It then proceeds to decide the instant case on the assumption that WMCP remains a foreign corporation.<br><br><center><b><i><u>Controversy Now Moot</u></i></b><br></center><br>With due respect, I believe that the Court should dismiss the Petition on the ground of mootness. I submit that a decision on the constitutionality issue should await the wisdom of a new day when the Court would have a live case before it.<br><br>The nullity of the FTAA is unarguably premised upon the contractor being a <b>foreign</b> corporation. Had the FTAA been originally issued to a Filipino-owned corporation, we would have had no constitutionality issue to speak of. Upon the other hand, conveyance of the FTAA to a Filipino corporation can be likened to the sale of land to a foreigner who subsequently acquires Filipino citizenship, or who later re-sells the same land to a Filipino citizen. The conveyance would be validated, as the property in question would no longer be owned by a disqualified vendee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Since the FTAA is now to be implemented by a Filipino corporation, how can the Court still declare it unconstitutional? The CA case is a dispute between two Filipino companies (Sagittarius and Lepanto) both claiming the right to purchase the foreign shares in WMCP. So regardless of which side eventually wins, the FTAA would still be in the hands of a qualified Filipino company.<br><br>Furthermore, there being no more justiciable controversy, the plea to nullify the Mining Law has become a virtual petition for declaratory relief, over which the Supreme Court has no original jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><b>At bottom, I rely on the well-settled doctrine that this Court does not decide constitutional issues, unless they are the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]<br><br></sup><center><b><i><u>Not Limited to Technical or<br>Financial Assistance Only</u></i></b><br></center><br>At any rate, following the literal text of the present Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the <i>ponencia</i> limits to strict technical or financial only the assistance to be provided to the State by foreign-owned corporations for the large-scale exploration, development and utilization of minerals, petroleum, and mineral oils. Such assistance may not include “management or other forms of assistance” or other activities associated with the “service contracts” of the past unlamented regime. Precisely, “<i>the management or operation of mining activities by foreign contractors, which is the primary feature of service contracts, was x x x the evil that the drafters of the 1987 Constitution sought to eradicate</i>.”<br><br>Again, because of the mootness problem, it would be risky to take a <i>definitive</i> position on this question. The Court would be speculating on the contents of the FTAA of a prospective foreign company. The requirements of “case and controversy” would be lacking. Suffice it to say, at this point, that the issue even in a live case is not quite that easy to tackle.<br><br><i>First</i>, the drafters’ choice of words -- their use of the phrase “agreements x x x <b>involving</b> x x x technical or financial assistance” --does not absolutely indicate the intent to exclude other modes of assistance. Rather, the phrase signifies the possibility of the inclusion of other activities, provided they bear some <i>reasonable relationship to and compatibility with</i> financial or technical assistance.<br><br>If the intention of the drafters were strictly to confine foreign corporations to financial or technical assistance and <i>nothing more</i>, I am certain that their language would have been <b>unmistakably restrictive and stringent</b>. They would have said, for example: “Foreign corporations are <i>prohibited</i> from providing management or other forms of assistance,” or words to that effect. The conscious avoidance of restrictive wording bespeaks an intent not to employ --in an exclusionary, inflexible and limiting manner -- the expression “agreements involving technical or financial assistance.”<br><br><i>Second</i>, I believe the foregoing position is supported by the fact that our present Constitution <b>still recognizes and allows service contracts</b> (and has not rendered them taboo), albeit <i>subject to several restrictions and modifications aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of the past</i>. Below are <i>some</i> excerpts from the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission (Concom), showing that its members discussed “technical or financial agreements” in the same breath as “service contracts” and used the terms interchangeably:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td scope="col" width="15%">“MR.

I was shocked when I read a provision authorizing <b>service contracts</b> while we, in this Constitutional Commission, provided for Filipino control of the economy.

As far as I am concerned, if I should have my own way, I am for the complete deletion of this provision. However, we are presenting a compromise in the sense that we are requiring a two-thirds vote of all the Members of Congress as a safeguard. I think we should not mistrust the future Members of Congress by saying that the purpose of this provision is to avoid corruption. We cannot claim that they are less patriotic than we are. I think the Members of this Commission should know that entering into <b>service contracts</b> is an exception to the rule on protection of natural resources for the interest of the nation, and therefore, being an exception it should be subject whenever possible, to stringent rules.

Quoting the rest of their discussions would have taken up several more pages, and these have thus been omitted for the sake of brevity. <i>In any event, it would appear that the members of the Concom actually had in mind the</i> <b>Marcos-era service contracts</b> <i>that they were familiar with</i> (but which they duly modified and restricted so as to prevent abuses), <i>when they were crafting and polishing the provisions dealing with financial and/or technical assistance agreements. These provisions ultimately became the fourth and the fifth paragraphs of Section 2 of Article XII of the 1987 Constitution.</i> Put, differently, “technical and financial assistance agreements” were understood by the delegates to include service contracts <i>duly modified to prevent abuses</i>.<br><br>I respectfully submit that the statements of Commissioner Jose Nolledo, quoted above, are especially pertinent, since they refer specifically to service contracts in favor of aliens. From his perspective, it is clear to me that <i>the Concom discussions in their entirety</i> had to do with service contracts that might be given to foreign-owned corporations as exceptions to the general principle of Filipino control of the economy.<br><br>Commissioner Nolledo sums up these statements by saying: “<i>We are, therefore, providing for exceptional instances where aliens may circumvent Filipino control of our economy. And one way of circumventing the rule in favor of Filipino control of the economy is to recognise service contracts. As far as I am concerned, if I should have my own way, I am for the complete deletion of this provision. However, we are presenting a compromise in the sense that we are requiring a two-thirds vote of all the Members of Congress as a safeguard, x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x. I think the Members of this Commission should know that entering into service contracts is an exception to the rule on protection of natural resources for the interest of the nation, and therefore, being an exception it should be subject whenever possible, to stringent rules. It seems to me that we are liberalizing the rules in favor of aliens, x x x</i>.”<br><br>Since the drafters were referring only to service contracts to be granted to foreigners and to nothing else, this fact necessarily implies that we ought <i>not</i> treat the idea of “agreements involving either technical or financial assistance” as having any significance or existence apart from service contracts. In other words, in the minds of the commissioners, the concept of technical and financial assistance agreements did not exist at all apart from the concept of service contracts <i>duly modified to prevent abuses</i>.<br><center><br><b><i><u>Interpretation of the Constitution<br>in the Light of Present-Day Realities</u></i></b><br></center><br>Tantamount to closing one’s eyes to reality is the insistence that the term “agreements involving technical or financial assistance” refers only to <i>purely</i> technical or financial assistance to be rendered to the State by a foreign corporation (and must perforce exclude management and other forms of assistance). Nowadays, securing the kind of <i>financial assistance</i> required by large-scale explorations, which involve <i>hundreds of millions of dollars</i>, is not just a matter of signing a simple promissory note in favor of a lender. Current business practices often require borrowers seeking huge loans to allow creditors access to financial records and other data, and probably a seat or two on the former’s board of directors; or at least some participation in certain management decisions that may have an impact on the financial health or long-term viability of the debtor, which of course will directly affect the latter’s capacity to repay its loans. <i>Prudent lending practices necessitate a certain degree of involvement in the borrower’s management process</i>.<br><br>Likewise, <i>technical assistance</i>, particularly in certain industries like mining and oil exploration, would likely be from the industry’s leading players. It may involve the training of personnel and some form of supervision and oversight with respect to the correct and proper implementation of the technical assistance. The purpose is to ensure that the technical assistance rendered will not go to waste, and that the lender’s business reputation and successful track record in the industry will be adequately safeguarded. Thus the technical assistance arrangements often necessarily include interface with the management process itself.<br><br>The mining industry is in the doldrums, precisely because of lack of technical and financial resources in our country. If activated properly, the industry could meaningfully contribute to our economy and lead to the employment of many of our jobless compatriots. A hasty and premature decision on the constitutionality of the herein FTAA and the Philippine Mining Act could unnecessarily burden the recovery of the industry and the employment opportunities it would likely generate.<br><center><br><b><i><u>Oral Argument Needed</u></i></b><br></center><br>Given the modern-day reality that even the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) do not lend on the basis merely of bare promissory notes, but on some conditionalities designed to assure the borrowers’ financial viability, I would like to hear in an Oral Argument in a <i>live</i>, not a moot, <i>case</i> what these international practices are and how they impact on our constitutional restrictions. This is not to say that we should bend our basic law; rather, we should find out what kind of FTAA provisions are realistic vis-à-vis these international standards and our constitutional protection. Unless there is a <i>live</i> FTAA, the Court would not be able to analyze the provisions vis-à-vis the Constitution, the Mining Law and these modern day lending practices.<br><br>I mentioned the WB and the IMF, not necessarily because I agree with their oftentimes stringent policies, but because they set the standards that international and multinational financial institutions often take bearings from. The WB and IMF are akin (though not equivalent) to the <i>Bangko Sentral</i>, which all Philippine banks must abide by. <b><i>If this Court closes its doors to these international realities and unilaterally sets up its own concepts of strict technical and financial assistance, then it may unwittingly make the country a virtual hermit -- an economic isolationist --in the real world of finance.</i></b><br><br>I understand that a <i>live</i> case, challenging the Mining Law and an FTAA relevant thereto, is pending before the Second Division of this Court; where it is docketed as GR No. 157882 (<i>Dipdio Earth Savers Multi-Purpose Association v. Hon. Elisea Gozun</i>). Can we not consolidate that case with the current one, call an Oral Argument, and then decide the matter more definitively? During the Oral Argument, I believe that the Court should invite as <i>amid curiae</i> (1) a lawyer versed in international finance like retired Justice Florentino P. Feliciano, (2) a representative of the Banker’s Association of the Philippines, and (3) a leader of the University of the Philippines Law Constitution Project.<br><center><br><b><i><u>Constitutional Interpretation and the<br>Vagaries of Contemporary Events</u></i></b><br></center><br>Finally, I believe that the Concom did not mean to tie the hands of the President and restrict the latter only to agreements on rigid financial and technical assistance and <i>nothing else</i>. The commissioners fully realized that their work would have to withstand the test of time; that the Charter, though crafted with the wisdom born of past experiences and lessons painfully learned, would have <i>to be a living document that would answer the needs of the nation well into the future</i>. Thus, the unerring emphasis on flexibility and adaptability.<br><br>Commissioner Joaquin Bernas stressed that he voted in favor of the Article, “because it is flexible enough to allow future legislators to correct whatever mistakes we may have made.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Commissioner Felicitas Aquino noted that “unlike the other articles of this Constitution, this article whether we like it or not would have to yield to flexibility and elasticity which inheres in the interpretation of this provision. Why? Precisely because the forces of economics are dynamic and are perpetually in motion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Along the same line, the Court, in <i>Tañada v. Angara</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> stressed the need to interpret the Constitution to cover “refreshing winds of change necessitated by unfolding events”:<br><blockquote>“x x x. Constitutions are designed to meet not only the vagaries of contemporary events. They should be interpreted to cover even future and unknown circumstances. It is to the credit of its drafters that a Constitution can withstand the assaults of bigots and infidels but at the same time bend with the refreshing winds of change necessitated by unfolding events.”<br></blockquote>Accordingly, I vote to <b><i>DISMISS</i></b> the Petition.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> That is, the Court of Appeals’ resolution of the petition for review --docketed as CA-GR No. 74161 and lodged by Lepanto Consolidated Mining -- of the Decision of the Office of the President, which upheld the Order of the DENR secretary approving the transfer to, and the registration of the FTAA in the name of, Sagittarius Mines, Inc.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Chavez v.
