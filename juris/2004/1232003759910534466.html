				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Simple negligence of counsel binds the client.&nbsp; This is especially true in this case in which the client was as negligent as its lawyer.&nbsp; Hence, petitioner must bear the consequences and accept its defeat.&nbsp;

The dispositive part of the assailed Decision reads:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">“IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the appeal of the [petitioner] is partially <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span></span> in that the Decision appealed from is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> with the modification that the award for a broker’s fee in favor of the [respondent] is deleted.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The assailed Resolution denied reconsideration of the Decision.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span></span><br></div><br>The facts are narrated by the CA as follows:<br><blockquote>“The Air Philippines, Inc., <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">API for brevity</span>, was in need of the services of a business establishment to ferry its B-737 airplane, with Registry Number RP C1938, from the United States of America to the Philippines, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">via </span></span>Subic Bay International Airport, at Olongapo City.&nbsp; API, through Captain Alex Villacampa, its Vice-President for Operations, engaged the services of <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">International Business Aviation Services Phils., Inc., IBASPI for brevity</span>, as its agent to look for and engage, for API, a business enterprise to ferry the airplane.&nbsp; IBASPI did engage the services of Universal Weather [&amp;] Aviation, Inc., <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">UWAI for brevity</span>, to ferry the airplane x x x to the Philippines, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">via</span></span> the International Airport at Subic Bay, Olongapo City, where API took delivery of the plane.<br><br>“UWAI sent its ‘<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Billings</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">’</span> to API, through IBASPI, in the total amount of US$65,131.55 for its services for the ferry of the airplane.&nbsp; API failed to pay its account.&nbsp; On December 2, 1996, the [respondent] wrote a letter to the [petitioner] urging the payment of the bills of UWAI.&nbsp; The [petitioner] refused.&nbsp; Exasperated, UWAI blamed IBASPI for the intransigence of API.&nbsp; IBASPI was impelled to write a letter to UWAI ‘to clarify’ critical points of API’s account.&nbsp; Unable to bear the pressure of UWAI and to avoid corporate embarrassment for API’s intransigence, IBASPI was impelled to advance and pay to UWAI the said amount of US$65,131.55 for the account of API.&nbsp; The latter was informed by UWAI of the payment of said account by IBASPI <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">via</span> its letter dated May 12, 1997.<br><br>“IBASPI forthwith wrote a letter to API demanding refund to IBASPI the amount it advanced to UWAI for the account of API.&nbsp; IBASPI received, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">via</span> an informant, a copy of a ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Memorandum</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">’</span> of Rodolfo Estrellado, the President and Chief Executive Officer of API, dated July 29, 1997, to the President of API, recommending that the latter pay only the amount of US$27,730.60, with a recommendation that IBASPI be required to submit documentations/billings in support of the difference of US$37,400.00.&nbsp; However, no payment was effected by API.<br><br>“On November 6, 1997, IBASPI, through counsel, sent another letter to API demanding the payment of the said amount of US$65,131.55 and 10% commission.&nbsp; API ignored the letter.&nbsp; Another letter of demand was sent to API by IBASPI, on December 1, 1997, to no avail.&nbsp; On January 6, 1998, IBASPI wrote another letter of demand to API enclosing therein a ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Summary Statement of Account of Air Philippines, Inc</span>.’ on the disputed amount of US $37,400.00, appending thereto the documentations/billings in support of said claim and 10% commission.&nbsp; On February 26, 1998, API drew Check No. 0521300 against its account, with the Bank of Philippine Islands, in the amount of P200,000.00, payable to the order of IBASPI, and offered the same <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">in partial first payment</span> of its account with IBASPI for the amount of US$65,131.55 as stated in the letter of the [petitioner].&nbsp; The [respondent] accepted the said check with a simultaneous ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Receipt/Agreement</span>’ executed by IBASPI and API, the latter, through Atty. Manolito A. Manalo, the Officer-in-Charge of the Legal Department of the API, obliging itself to pay the balance of its account.&nbsp; API in the said Agreement waived demand by IBASPI.&nbsp; Despite demands of IBASPI, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">via</span> its letter, dated April 22, 1998, API refused to pay the balance of its account with IBASPI.<br><br>“On June 24, 1998, IBASPI filed a complaint against API, with the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, for the collection of its account, including a 10% broker’s fee, praying that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in its favor as follows:<br><blockquote>‘WHEREFORE, [respondent] respectfully prays of this Honorable Court to render judgment:<br><blockquote> 1) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] the sum of US$59,798.22 x x x or its equivalent in legal tender with interest at the legal rate from May 1997 until full payment;<br><br>2) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] further sum of US$6,513.00 or its equivalent in legal tender as intermediary’s commission;<br><br>3) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] another sum of US$13,026.00 or its equivalent in legal tender as actual damages in the form of attorney’s fees;<br><br>4) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] expenses of litigation as can be proved;<br><br>5) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the costs of the suit; and,<br><br>6) [Respondent] prays for such further or other relief as may be deemed just or equitable.’</blockquote> </blockquote> “The [respondent] appended to its complaint the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Receipt/Agreement</span>’ executed by the [petitioner], on March 20, 1998.&nbsp; In its ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Unverified Answer</span>’, API alleged, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">inter alia</span>, by way of ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Affirmative Allegations</span>’, that:<br><blockquote>‘8. In support of the foregoing denials and by way of affirmative allegations, [petitioner] states:<br><br>‘9. On 6 November 1997, we received a letter from [respondent] demanding payment of $65,131.00 allegedly for the ferry flight services rendered by Universal and brokered by [respondent].<br><br>‘10. On 1 December 1997 and 12 January 1998, we sent letters to [respondent] acknowledging receipt of their demand letter[.]&nbsp; However, we mentioned in the letters that we needed time to process the documents submitted by [respondent] to support their claim.<br><br>‘11. APC made it very clear that if an obligation on the part of [petitioner] is proven to exist, [petitioner] would be more than willing to settle the obligation.<br><br>‘12. In fact, as mentioned in the complaint, [petitioner] made a payment of <s>P</s>200,000.00 to cover claims which [petitioner] did not contest; [petitioner] opted not to settle the balance of the claim pending verification of the submitted supporting documents.<br><br>‘13. [Petitioner] verbally requested [respondent] to further substantiate its claim by sending their accountants to the offices of APC[.]<br><br>‘14. [Respondent] did not heed this request; thus, APC could not release any other amounts to cover the claim of [respondent.]<br><br>‘15. The documents sent by [respondent] were not accompanied by any explanation and were merely a loose collection of statements from various companies[.]<br><br>‘16. Thus, [petitioner] was surprised when [respondent] filed the instant complaint[,] for[,] as far as the former [was] concerned[,] the accounting of the claim was nowhere near definite nor clear[.]’ </blockquote> “On November 17, 1998, the Court issued a ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Pre-Trial Notice</span>’ setting the pre-trial conference on December 7, 1998, at 8:30 x x x in the morning, requiring the parties to file their respective ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Pre-Trial Brief</span>’ at least two (2) days before the scheduled pre-trial.&nbsp; The [respondent] did file its ‘Pre-Trial Brief’[,] but the [petitioner] did not.&nbsp; During the pre-trial, on December 7, 1998, Atty. Manolito Manalo, counsel of the [petitioner], appeared[,] but without any ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Special Power of Attorney</span>’ from the [petitioner].&nbsp; The Court granted the [petitioner] a period of ten (10) days, from said date, within which to file its ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Pre-Trial Brief</span>’ and ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Special Power of Attorney</span>’ executed by the [petitioner] in favor of its counsel.&nbsp; In the meantime, the pre-trial was reset to January 11, 1999 at the same time.&nbsp; However, the [petitioner] failed to file its ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Pre-Trial Brief</span>’.&nbsp; On January 11, 1999, at 9:20 x x x in the morning, the [petitioner] filed an ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for Extension of Time to File Pre-Trial Brief and For Resetting of Pre-Trial Conference</span>’, with a plea to the Branch Clerk of Court to submit the said motion for consideration of the Court immediately upon receipt thereof.&nbsp; When the case was called for pre-trial, there was no appearance for the [petitioner] and its counsel.&nbsp; The Court issued an Order denying the motion of the [petitioner] and allowing the [respondent] to adduce its evidence, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ex parte</span></span>, before the Branch Clerk of Court, who was designated, as Commissioner, to receive the evidence of the [respondent], <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">ex parte</span>.&nbsp; On January 13, 1999, the [petitioner] filed with the Court another ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for Extension of Time to File Pre-Trial Brief and for Resetting of Pre-Trial Conference</span>’.&nbsp; On January 15, 1999, the [petitioner] filed a ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>’ of the Order of the Court, dated January 11, 1999.&nbsp; The [petitioner] appended to its motion the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Affidavit</span>’ of Atty. Manolito Manalo, its counsel, stating the reason for his failure to appear at the pre-trial conference on January 11, 1999.&nbsp; On January 22, 1999, the Court issued an Order denying the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>’ of the [petitioner].&nbsp; On January 25, 1999, the [respondent] did adduce testimonial and documentary evidence in support of its complaint.<br><br>“Among the documentary evidence adduced by the [respondent] were the xerox copy of the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Certification</span>’ of Captain Alex Villacampa, and the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Memorandum</span>’ of Rodolfo Estrellado.<br><br>“On April 7, 1999, the Court rendered judgment in favor of the [respondent] and against the [petitioner], the decretal portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>‘WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING uncontroverted and substantiated evidences of the [respondent], judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the [respondent] and against the [petitioner] ordering the latter to pay the former the following:<br><blockquote> <ol><li>the amount of US59,798.22 dollars or its equivalent in legal tender plus interest at the legal rate from May, 1997 until fully paid;<br></li><br><li>the amount of US6,513.00 or its equivalent as intermediary’s commission;<br></li><br><li>[<s>P</s>]50,000.00 as and for attorney’s fees; and,</li> </ol> Costs of suit.<br></blockquote>‘SO ORDERED.’ </blockquote> “The [petitioner] filed a ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Motion for New Trial</span>’ on the grounds that:&nbsp; (a) it was deprived of its day in court due to the gross negligence of its former counsel, Atty. Manolito A. Manalo; (b) the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Receipt/Agreement</span>’ executed by Atty. Manolito A. Manalo, in behalf of the [petitioner], was unauthorized as there was no ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Resolution’</span> of the Board of Directors authorizing him to execute said ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Receipt/Agreement</span>’ and, hence, said counsel acted beyond the scope of his authority; (c) the claim of IBASPI was excessive and unjustified; [and] (d) the [petitioner] never agreed to pay the [respondent] a commission of 10% of the billings of UWAI.<br><br>“On July 26, 1999, the Court issued a ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Resolution</span>’ denying the ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Motion for New Trial</span>’ of the [petitioner].&nbsp; The latter forthwith interposed its appeal, from said Decision and Resolution of the Court <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">a quo</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Affirming the Decision of the lower court with some modification, the CA ruled that under the Rules of Civil Procedure, petitioner could not avail itself of a new trial, because its former counsel was guilty of only simple -- not gross -- negligence.&nbsp; In addition, petitioner, being equally negligent as its counsel, could not be relieved from the effects of its negligence.&nbsp; Thus, it was held liable for US$59,798.22 and attorney’s fees, but not for the 10 percent commission or broker’s fee, for which the requisite quantum of evidence in its favor had not been mustered by respondent.<br><br>Hence this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioner submits the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp; Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it upheld the ruling of the Honorable Trial Court denying the Motion for New Trial dated April 27, 1999 despite the fact that the gross negligence, incompetence and dishonesty of Petitioner APC’s former counsel, Atty. Manolito A. Manalo, have effectively denied Petitioner APC of its day in court.<br><br>“2.&nbsp; Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it took cognizance of and/or gave credence to the ‘Memorandum’ of Rodolfo Estrellado, and the ‘Billings’ of Universal Weather as well as the documents/receipts in support thereof despite the fact that they are clearly hearsay and have no probative value considering that Luisito Nazareno, the lone witness of Respondent IBAS, had no personal knowledge of the contents and/or factual bases thereof and failed to properly authenticate and/or identify the same.<br><br>“3.&nbsp; Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it took cognizance of and/or gave credence to the Receipt/Agreement dated March 20, 1998 despite the fact that Atty.

Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it upheld the ruling of the Honorable Trial Court that Respondent IBAS is entitled to legal interest and attorney’s fees despite the fact that it has failed to establish its claims against Petitioner APC.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </blockquote> These issues all boil down into two: <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, whether the Motion for New Trial should be denied; and <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, in the event of such denial, whether the monetary awards were duly proven.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">New Trial Not Warranted by<br>Simple Negligence of Counsel</span></span><br></div><br>Axiomatic is the rule that “negligence of counsel binds the client.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The basis is the tenet that an act performed by counsel within the scope of a “general or implied authority”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> is regarded as an act of the client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> “Consequently, the mistake or negligence of counsel may result in the rendition of an unfavorable judgment against the client.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>While the application of this general rule certainly depends upon the surrounding circumstances of a given case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> there are exceptions recognized by this Court: “(1) where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (2) when its application will result in outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> or (3) where the interests of justice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> so require.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Woefully none of these exceptions apply herein.&nbsp; Thus, the Court cannot “step in and accord relief”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to petitioner, even if it may have suffered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> by reason of its own arrant fatuity.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, as aptly determined by the appellate court, petitioner’s counsel is guilty of simple, not gross, negligence.&nbsp; We cannot consider as gross negligence his resort to dilatory schemes, such as (1) the filing of at least three motions to extend the filing of petitioner’s Answer; (2) his nonappearance during the scheduled pretrials; and (3) the failure to file petitioner’s pretrial Brief, even after the filing of several Motions to extend the date for filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; There was only a plain “disregard of some duty imposed by law,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> a slight want of care that “circumstances reasonably impose,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and a mere failure to exercise that degree of care<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that an ordinarily prudent person would take under the circumstances.&nbsp; There was neither a total abandonment or disregard of petitioner’s case nor a showing of conscious indifference to or utter disregard of consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Because “pre-trial is essential in the simplification and the speedy disposition of disputes,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> nonobservance of its rules “may result in prejudice to a party’s substantive rights.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Such rules are “not technicalities which the parties may ignore or trifle with.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The Rules of Court cannot be “ignored at will and at random to the prejudice of the orderly presentation and assessment of the issues and their just resolution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Counsel’s patent carelessness in citing conflicting reasons in his Motions for Reconsideration verily displays his lack of competence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> diligence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and candor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> but not his recklessness or total want of care.<br><br>Indeed, the lawyer’s failure to live up to the dictates of the canons of the legal profession makes him answerable to both his profession and his employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, the negligence of petitioner and that of its counsel are concurrent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; As an artificial being whose juridical personality is created by fiction of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> petitioner “can only exercise its powers and transact its business through the instrumentalities of its board of directors, and through its officers and agents, when authorized by resolution or its by-laws.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Atty. Manalo is an employee, not an outsider hired by petitioner on a retainer basis.&nbsp; In fact, he is the officer-in-charge of its Legal Department.<br><br>There is no showing that he was not authorized to exercise the powers of the corporation or to transact its business, particularly the handling of its legal affairs.&nbsp; Besides, it is presumed that the ordinary course of business has been followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Therefore, counsel’s corporate acts are supposed to be known and assented to by petitioner.<br><br>For petitioner to feign and repeatedly insist upon a lack of awareness of the progress of an important litigation is to unmask a penchant for the ludicrous.&nbsp; Although it expects counsel to amply protect its interest, it cannot just sit back, relax and await the outcome of its case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In keeping with the normal course of events, it should have taken the initiative “of making the proper inquiries from its counsel and the trial court as to the status of its case”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and of extending to him the “necessary assistance.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> For its failure to do so, it has only itself to blame.&nbsp; Indeed, from lethargy is misfortune born.<br><br>It is of no consequence that its Human Resources and Personnel Departments were not aware of the progress of its case.&nbsp; Of judicial notice is the fact that a corporation has much leeway in determining which of its units, singly or in consonance with others, is responsible for specific functions.&nbsp; Yet, it is unusual that these departments were tasked with monitoring the progress of legal matters involving petitioner.&nbsp; Nonetheless, having assigned these matters to them, it should have undertaken prompt and proper monitoring and reporting thereof.&nbsp; Again, for its failure to do so, it has only itself to blame.&nbsp; These departments do get involved in finance and accounting, especially in budget preparation and payroll computation, but billing and collection are hardly tangential to their concerns.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third</span>, there was no denial of due process<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to petitioner.&nbsp; Under the Rules of Court, an aggrieved party may ask for a new trial on the ground of excusable negligence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> but this was not proved in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> “Negligence, to be ‘excusable,’ must be one which ordinary diligence and prudence could not have guarded against”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and by reason of which the rights of an aggrieved party have probably been impaired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The test of excusable negligence is whether a party has acted “with ordinary prudence while x x x transacting important business.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The reasons raised by petitioner in urging for a new trial do not meet this test; they are flimsy.&nbsp; As we mentioned nearly thirty years ago, “[p]arties and counsel would be well advised to avoid such attempts to befuddle the issues as invariably they will be exposed for what they are, certainly unethical and degrading to the dignity of the law profession.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>“The essence of due process is to be found in the reasonable opportunity to be heard and submit any evidence one may have in support of one’s defense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Where the opportunity to be heard, either through verbal arguments or pleadings, is accorded, and the party can “present its side”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> or defend its “interest in due course,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> “there is no denial of procedural due process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Petitioner has been given its chance, and after being declared in default, judgment has not been automatically “rendered in favor of the non-defaulting party.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Rather, judgment was made only after carefully weighing the evidence presented.&nbsp; Substantive and adjective laws do complement each other<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> “in the just and speedy resolution of the dispute between the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner was not deprived of its day in court.&nbsp; Actually, it never even complained against the manner in which its counsel had handled the case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> until late in the day.&nbsp; It must therefore “bear the consequences”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of its faulty choice of counsel whom it hired itself and whom it had “full authority to fire at any time and replace with another.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Moreover, in all the pertinent cases cited by petitioner, the denial of due process was attributable to the gross negligence of retained counsels, who had either been single practitioners or law firms; none had referred to counsels who, like Atty.

Thus, the Receipt/Agreement is but an outright admission of petitioner of its obligation, after making partial payment, to pay the balance of its account.&nbsp; And even if we were to consider the same as a compromise, from its nature as a contract, the absence of an SPA does not render it void, but merely unenforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fourth</span>, in its Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> petitioner failed to deny under oath the genuineness and due execution of the Receipt/Agreement, which is thus deemed admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Indeed, before a private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved.&nbsp;

Petitioner’s Memorandum contained a recommendation to pay respondent the amount of US$27,730.60 and to require additional documentation in support of the balance.&nbsp; In compliance, a Summary of Statement of Account dated January 6, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> was sent to and received by petitioner, substantiating it to the extent of US$37,400.95.&nbsp; Not only did these amounts sum up to a total of US$65,131.55, the unsettled account indicated in the Billings, but these are also unrefuted by petitioner.&nbsp; In fact, the Receipt/Agreement executed two months later did not contest this balance, although unvalued therein.&nbsp; When a party fails to object to hearsay evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> such party is deemed to have waived its right to do so; thus, “the evidence offered may be admitted,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> though its weight must still be measured by the court.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Seventh</span>, the accounting required by petitioner was not a legal impediment to the obligation.&nbsp;
