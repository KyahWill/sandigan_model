				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 30, 1997, spouses Lorenzo and Feliciana Mateo filed before the Regional Trial Court of Balanga, Bataan a petition for “RECONSTITUTION OF THE ORIGINAL COPY AS WELL AS THE OWNER’S DUPLICATE COPY OF TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE NO. T-38769” issued on July 16, 1971 by the Registry of Deeds of Bataan in the name of one Jose Tan.<br><br>From the Mateos’ petition for reconstitution, it is gathered that Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-38769 covers two parcels of land forming part of Lot No. 979 of Bagac, Bataan Cadastre situated in barrio Cabog-Cabog, Bagac, Bataan, more particularly described as follows:<br><blockquote>2.a. A parcel of land Lot No. 1186 (before Lot No. 3 Sgs-3094 being a <u>portion of Lot No. 979</u>) of the Cadastral Survey of Bagac, Cad. Case No. 18, L.R.C. Cad. Rec.

Tombo” did not surrender the title to the Records Section and she did not know whether he is still alive.<br><br>Branch 2 of the RTC Balanga, holding as follows:<br><blockquote>Since this is a petition for the reconstitution of a transfer certificate of title the applicable provision is Sec. 3 of Republic No. 26, as amended by Rep. Act No. 6732.<br><br>That section provides that:<br><br>SEC. 3, <b><u>Transfer certificates</u></b> of title shall be reconstituted from such of the sources hereunder enumerated as may be available, in the following order:<br><blockquote>(a) The <u>owner’s duplicate</u> of the certificate of title;<br><br>(b) That <u>co-owner’s mortgagee’s, or lessee’s duplicate</u> of the certificate of title;<br><br>(c) A <u>certified copy of the certificate of title</u>, previously issued by the register of deeds or by a legal custodian thereof;<br><br>(d) The <u>deed of transfer or other document, on file in the Registry of Deeds</u>, containing the description of the property, <u>or an <b>authenticated</b> copy thereof</u>, showing that its original had been registered, and pursuant to which the lost or destroyed transfer certificate of title was issued;<br><br>(e) <u>A document on file in the Registry of Deeds by which the property</u>, the description of which is given in said document, is mortgaged, <u>leased, or incumbered, or an <b>authenticated</b></u> copy of said document showing that its original had been registered, and<br><br>(f) <u>Any other document which, in the judgment of the court, is sufficient and proper basis </u>for reconstituting the lost or destroyed certificate of title.<br></blockquote><b><u>None of these sources ha[s] been presented by the petitioners</u>.</b><br><br>It appears also that the <u>original certificate of title is still missing and has to be reconstituted on the basis of the sources enumerated in Sec. 2 of RA 26</u>. Thus, the authenticated decree of registration could be a basis for the reconstitution of the original certificate of title but not of the transfer certificate of title. In this case, <u>the decree was issued in the name of <b>Donato Exchivarria;</b> however, there is no showing how the parcels of land in question were transferred to Jose Tan</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>DENIED the petition by Decision of September 14, 1998.<br><br>The Mateos’ Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court’s decision having been denied, they appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) upon the following<br><blockquote><center><br>ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS<br></center><ol type="1"><li> The trial court – Regional Trial Court, Third Judicial Region, Branch 2, Balanga, Bataan, -- erred in declaring that the Original copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-38769 is “missing”;<br><br></li><li> The trial court erred in denying the instant petition, despite overwhelming evidence, documentary and oral, showing sufficient and proper basis for the reconstitution of the lost original and owner’s duplicate copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-38769;<br><br></li><li> And the trial court erred in dismissing the instant petition; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>By Decision of May 2, 2001, the appellate court, citing Section 3 of R.A. No. 26 which enumerates the sources from which TCTs shall be reconstituted, declared as follows:<br><blockquote>Since the provision contains the qualification – “as may be available” – the presentation of any of the sources enumerated above is sufficient.<br><br><u>The trial court erred in not giving weight to the <b>photocopy</b> of the owner’s duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-38769</u> (Exhibit “I”) as a secondary evidence falling under Section 3(a) or even Section 3(f) as abovequoted.<br><br>The Rules of Court has provided a procedure by which the copy of the original document is admissible as evidence, hence:<br><blockquote>Section 5. When original document is unavailable – When the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on his part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated. (Rule 130, Rules of Court)<br></blockquote>Based on jurisprudence, the aforecited provision requires compliance with the following order of proof: “existence; execution; loss; content.” A variation in the order may be allowed in the exercise of the court’s discretion. (De Vera vs. Aguilar, 218 SCRA 602, 606 [1993] and; Lazatin v. Campos, 92 SCRA 250, 262 [1979]).<br><br><u>The <i>existence</i>, <i>execution</i> and <i>contents</i> of the subject certificate were proven by the submission of the following evidence [of the Mateos]</u> . x x x<br><br>x x x<br><br><u>With respect to the <i>loss</i> of the owner’s copy of the subject certificate, petitioner Lorenzo Mateo testified [on how it was lost]</u>.<br><br>x x x<br><br><u>[T]he requirements of the rules of court have been complied [with] for the purpose of introducing secondary evidence</u> as the exception to the best evidence rule (Section 3 and 5, Rule 130, Rules of Court). <b>Appellants presented to the trial court a copy of the document (Exhibit “I”)</b>, the cause of its unavailability which is the <u>loss of the records while in the possession of the National Bureau of Investigation</u> and the testimonies of appellant Lorenzo Mateo, Jose Y. dela Cruz and Mona Liza Esguerra. The testimonies of the last two witnesses, being public officials, enjoy the disputable presumption of regularity of official duties which has remained unrebutted (Section 3(m), Rule 131, Rules of Court). <b><u>The photocopy of the subject certificate (Exhibit “I”), as a secondary evidence of the original thereof, is the source listed under Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 26</u> and thus, a legally-recognized basis for the reconstitution of the certificate.</b><br><br>Even a strict interpretation of section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 26 will not prevent Us from giving probative weight to the photocopy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 38769 (Exhibit “I”) <u>because the document may likewise fall under subparagraph (f) of the same provision</u>, that is, “Any other document which, in the judgment of the court, is sufficient and proper basis for reconstituting the lost or destroyed certificate of title.” In Heirs of Felicidad Dizon v. Discaya, 303 SCRA 197, 207 (1999), the provision of Section 2(f) which is identical to Section 3(f), both of Republic Act No. 26, has been interpreted to refer to similar documents previously enumerated therein, that is, those mentioned in Sections 2(a), (b), (c) and (d).” <b><u>Exhibit “I” is the photocopy of the owner’s copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 38769</u></b><u> expressly listed in Section 3(a) of the same law and being not only similar but identical thereto, thus satisfies the requirement of the law. Even Decree No. 133969 marked    as Exhibits “O”, “O-1” to “O-2”, is another available source under Section (f) thereof</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The CA accordingly rendered judgment in favor of the Mateos and disposed in this wise:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b> The Orders dated September 14, 1998 and January 22, 1999, are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and a new one entered <u>declaring the lost original copy of TCT No. T-38769</u> of the Register of Deeds of Balanga, Bataan, as well as the <u>lost owner’s duplicate copy</u> thereof, <u>as null and void</u>, and ordering the Land Registration Authority and/or the Register of Deeds to <u>reconstitute the original copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-38769 in the name of Jose Tan</u> for Lots Nos. 1186 and 1187, <u>on the basis of the decision dated March 17, 1969</u> (Exh. “M”), Decree No. N-133969 dated March 11, 1971 (Exh. “O”) <u>and xerox copy of TCT No. 38769</u> (Exh. “I”), and for aforenamed public officials to issue, upon payment of the lawful fees therefor to petitioners-appellants the owner’s duplicate copy of said TCT No. T-38769 in the name of Jose Tan in exactly the same terms and conditions in lieu of the lost one. No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED. (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari lodged by the REPUBLIC upon the sole ground that the CA erred “<u>in giving evidentiary weight to the <b>alleged photocopy</b> of the title</u>” — basis of its order for the reconstitution of the original and owner’s copy of the title.<br><br>Petitioner argues that “when the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence is admissible other than the original document itself except in the instances mentioned in Section 3, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court,” adding that <u>mere photocopies of documents are inadmissible pursuant to the best evidence rule</u>,” it citing <i>Heirs of Severa P. Gregorio v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further argues that before secondary evidence may be admitted, the proponent must first establish the former existence of the instrument, citing <i>Lazatin v. Campos et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner concludes that there being no showing that the TCT previously existed, <u>the photocopy not having been <b>authenticated</b></u> by the Registry of Deeds of Bataan, <u>admission of such copy violates the best evidence rule</u>, citing <i>People v. Sto. Tomas</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioner, passing on the receipt dated March 8, 1973 covering the pulling out of 93 documents from the Bataan Registry of Deeds including the TCT subject of the case and its mother title, the Original Certificate of Title (OCT), makes the following observations:<br><blockquote><u>The 1997 tax declarations</u> (Exhs. “U” and “U-1) as well as the tax receipts (Exhs. “K” to “K-7”) do not prove the prior valid existence of TCT No. 38769 since these evidence are <b>recent</b> documents that were prepared <b>after</b> both original and owner’s duplicate of said certificate of title were supposedly lost.<br><br>Neither does the receipt dated March 8, 1973 prove the prior <b>valid</b> existence of said TCT-38769. Said evidence, in fact, put to doubt such claim. <u>The receipt dated March 8, 1973 (Exh. “T” – “T-3”) shows that the said certificate of title is of doubtful origin since it was <b>being investigated</b> by the National Bureau of Investigation</u>. Curiously, <b>since the time the said title was taken by the NBI in 1969, there was no evidence of any effort from Jose Tan, the alleged registered owner, to cause its return to the Bataan Registry of Deeds.</b> <u>Such prolonged inaction may be deemed as an implied admission of the title’s dubious origin</u>.<br><br>Reconstitution requires that the subject title was <b>validly</b> existing at the time of the loss. <u>An invalid title cannot be reconstituted</u>.<br><br>The Decision [of Judge Tizon] dated March 17, 1969, (Exh. “M”) and the Decree dated March 11, 1971 issued pursuant thereto, do not constitute sufficient basis for granting the reconstitution of TCT No. T-38769 in the name of Jose Tan considering that, at most, these documents tend to establish the original registration of the subject property <u>in the name of Donato Echiverri</u> (<i>sic</i>). As correctly noted by the trial court [Branch 2 of the RTC of Balanga], “there is no showing <u>how the parcels of land in question were transferred to Jose Tan</u>” (p. 5, Decision dated September 14, 1998). The said order and decree, therefore, establish only the prior existence of OCT No. N-205 but not that of TCT No. T-38769 in the name of Jose Tan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The CA’s reliance, as another basis of reconstitution, on the March 17, 1969 certified photocopy of Judge Tizon’s decision awarding to Donato Echivarria from whose OCT the TCT subject of reconstitution was transferred does not lie for, in the first place, as noted by the trial court, “there is no showing how the parcels of land were transferred to Jose Tan,” the Mateos’ predecessor-in-interest.<br><br>Section 3 of R.A. No. 26, “AN ACT PROVIDING A SPECIAL PROCEDURE FOR THE RECONSTITUTION OF TORRENS CERTIFICATES OF TITLE LOST OR DESTROYED,” which has been quoted by the trial court in its decision, enumerates the sources-documents-bases of a reconstitution of a transfer certificate of title. To repeat, they are, in the following order:<br><ol type="1"><li> the owner’s duplicate of the title<br><br></li><li> the co-owner’s mortgagee’s, or lessee’s duplicate of the title<br><br></li><li> a <u>certified</u> copy of the title previously issued by the register of deeds or by a legal custodian<br><br></li><li> an <u>authenticated</u> copy of the decree of registration or patent, as the case may be, pursuant to which the OCT was issued<br><br></li><li> a document, <u>on file in the registry of deeds</u>, by which the property . . . is . . . encumbered or an <u>authenticated</u> copy of said document showing that its original had been registered; and any other document which, <u>in the judgment of the court, is sufficient and proper basis for reconstituting the lost or destroyed title</u>.<br></li></ol>Since, except for the last above-enumerated document, the Mateos have failed to present any of the other documents, the rule on secondary evidence under Sec. 5 of Rule 130 applies. Section 5 of the rule provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>When original document is unavailable</i>. — When the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on its part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated.<br></blockquote>As the immediately quoted provision of the Rules directs, the order of presentation of secondary evidence is: <u>existence, execution, loss, contents</u>. The order may, however, be changed if necessary in the discretion of the court. The sufficiency of the proof offered as a predicate for the admission of an allegedly lost document lies within the judicial discretion of the trial court under all the circumstances of the particular case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Assuming that the existence and execution of the original of the TCT has been satisfactorily shown, and that it was taken in 1973 by the Department of Justice and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in connection with the investigation of the judge on whose order the OCT from which the TCT was transferred, which OCT was also taken by said government agencies, there is no satisfactory showing that the TCT has been lost.<br><br>By Lorenzo Mateo’s own information, a year before he testified,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> he talked to the NBI agent, Ramon Befetel, who received the 93 documents for Vidal Tombo. Why said agent, who admittedly was “still in the NBI main office,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> was not presented to shed light on the whereabouts of the TCT, no reason has been proffered.<br><br>In fine, the Mateos have not satisfactorily shown that the original of the TCT has been lost or is no longer available. On this score alone, the Mateos’ petition for reconstitution fails.<br><br>In any event, even assuming that the original of the TCT was lost or is no longer available, not only is the photocopy of the alleged owner’s duplicate copy thereof – Exh. “1”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> partly illegible. When, where and under what circumstances the photocopy was taken and where it was kept to spare it from being also “lost” were not even shown.
