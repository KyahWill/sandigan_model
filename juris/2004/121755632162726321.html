The respondents then had three options: (a) file a motion to deny/dismiss the motion on the ground that the petitioner failed to discharge his burden to prove the factual and legal basis for his plea for a writ of preliminary injunction and, if the trial court denies his motion, for them to adduce evidence in opposition to the petitioner’s plea; (b) forgo their motion and adduce testimonial and/or documentary evidence in opposition to the petitioner’s plea for a writ of preliminary injunction; or, (c) waive their right to adduce evidence and submit the incident for consideration on the basis of the pleadings of the parties and the evidence of the petitioner. The respondents opted not to adduce any evidence, and instead filed a motion to deny or dismiss the petitioner’s plea for a writ of preliminary injunction against them, on their claim that the petitioner failed to prove his entitlement thereto.&nbsp; The trial court cannot compel the respondents to adduce evidence in opposition to the petitioner’s plea if the respondents opt to waive their right to adduce such evidence.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court should have resolved the respondents’ motion even without the latter’s opposition and the presentation of evidence thereon.<br><br><i>The RTC Committed a Grave <br>Abuse of Discretion Amounting <br>to Excess or Lack of Jurisdiction <br>in Issuing its February 13, 1997 <br>and April 16, 1997 Orders</i><br><br>In its February 13, 1997 Order, the trial court ruled that the petitioner was entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction against the respondents on the basis of the material averments of the complaint.&nbsp; In its April 16, 1997 Order, the trial court denied the respondents’ motion for reconsideration of the previous order, on its finding that the petitioner was entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction based on the material allegations of his complaint, the evidence on record, the pleadings of the parties, as well as the applicable laws: <blockquote> …&nbsp; For the record, the Court denied the LACSONS’ COMMENT/MOTION on the basis of the facts culled from the evidence presented, the pleadings and the law applicable unswayed by the partisan or personal interests, public opinion or fear of criticism (Canon 3, Rule 3.02, Code of Judicial Ethics).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </blockquote> Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, as amended, enumerates the grounds for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td><div align="justify">That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)</td> <td><div align="justify">That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary event calculated to preserve or maintain the <i>status quo</i> of things <i>ante litem</i> and is generally availed of to prevent actual or threatened acts, until the merits of the case can be heard.&nbsp; Injunction is accepted as the strong arm of equity or a transcendent remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; While generally the grant of a writ of preliminary injunction rests on the sound discretion of the trial court taking cognizance of the case, extreme caution must be observed in the exercise of such discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, in <i>Olalia v.

It is a condition offered or contract by which the owner stipulates with another that the latter shall have the right to buy the property at a fixed price within a certain time, or under, or in compliance with certain terms and conditions, or which gives to the owner of the property the right to sell or demand a sale.&nbsp; It imposes no binding obligation on the person holding the option, aside from the consideration for the offer.&nbsp; Until accepted, it is not, properly speaking, treated as a contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The second party gets <i>in praesenti</i>, not lands, not an agreement that he shall have the lands, but the right to call for and receive lands if he elects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> An option contract is a separate and distinct contract from which the parties may enter into upon the conjunction of the option.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, the defendants-tenants-subtenants, under the deeds of assignment, granted to the petitioner not only an option but the exclusive right to buy the landholding.&nbsp; But the grantors were merely the defendants-tenants, and not the respondents, the registered owners of the property.&nbsp; Not being the registered owners of the property, the defendants-tenants could not legally grant to the petitioner the option, much less the “exclusive right” to buy the property.&nbsp; As the Latin saying goes, “<i>NEMO DAT QUOD NON HABET</i>.”<br><br>Fourth.&nbsp; The petitioner impleaded the respondents as parties-defendants solely on his allegation that the latter induced or are inducing the defendants-tenants to violate the deeds of assignment, contrary to the provisions of Article 1314 of the New Civil Code which reads: <blockquote> Art. 1314.&nbsp; Any third person who induces another to violate his contract shall be liable for damages to the other contracting party. </blockquote> In <i>So Ping Bun v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> we held that for the said law to apply, the pleader is burdened to prove the following: (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) knowledge by the third person of the existence of the contract; and (3) interference by the third person in the contractual relation without legal justification.<br><br>Where there was no malice in the interference of a contract, and the impulse behind one’s conduct lies in a proper business interest rather than in wrongful motives, a party cannot be a malicious interferer.&nbsp; Where the alleged interferer is financially interested, and such interest motivates his conduct, it cannot be said that he is an officious or malicious intermeddler.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In fine, one who is not a party to a contract and who interferes thereon is not necessarily an officious or malicious intermeddler.&nbsp; The only evidence adduced by the petitioner to prove his claim is the letter from the defendants-tenants informing him that they had decided to sell their rights and interests over the landholding to the respondents, instead of honoring their obligation under the deeds of assignment because, according to them, the petitioner harassed those tenants who did not want to execute deeds of assignment in his favor, and because the said defendants-tenants did not want to have any problem with the respondents who could cause their eviction for executing with the petitioner the deeds of assignment as the said deeds are in violation of P.D. No. 27 and Rep. Act No. 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The defendants-tenants did not allege therein that the respondents induced them to breach their contracts with the petitioner.&nbsp; The petitioner himself admitted when he testified that his claim that the respondents induced the defendants-assignees to violate contracts with him was based merely on what “he heard,” thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q:&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Going to your last statement that the Lacsons induces (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) the defendants, did you see that the Lacsons were inducing the defendants?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify">I heard and sometime in [the] first week of August, sir, they went in the barrio (sic). As a matter of fact, that is the reason why they sent me letter that they will sell it to the Lacsons.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Incidentally, do you knew (sic) these Lacsons individually?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify">No, sir, it was only Mr. Espinosa who I knew (sic) personally, the alleged negotiator and has the authority to sell the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Even if the respondents received an offer from the defendants-tenants to assign and transfer their rights and interests on the landholding, the respondents cannot be enjoined from entertaining the said offer, or even negotiating with the defendants-tenants.&nbsp; The respondents could not even be expected to warn the defendants-tenants for executing the said deeds in violation of P.D. No. 27 and Rep. Act No. 6657.&nbsp; Under Section 22 of the latter law, beneficiaries under P.D. No. 27 who have culpably sold, disposed of, or abandoned their land, are disqualified from becoming beneficiaries.<br><br>From the pleadings of the petitioner, it is quite evident that his purpose in having the defendants-tenants execute the Deeds of Assignment in his favor was to acquire the landholding without any tenants thereon, in the event that the respondents agreed to sell the property to him.&nbsp; The petitioner knew that under Section 11 of Rep. Act No. 3844, if the respondents agreed to sell the property, the defendants-tenants shall have preferential right to buy the same under reasonable terms and conditions: <blockquote> SECTION 11.&nbsp; <i>Lessee’s Right of Pre-emption.</i> – In case the agricultural lessor desires to sell the landholding, the agricultural lessee shall have the preferential right to buy the same under reasonable terms and conditions: <i>Provided,</i> That the entire landholding offered for sale must be pre-empted by the Land Authority if the landowner so desires, unless the majority of the lessees object to such acquisition: <i>Provided, further</i>, That where there are two or more agricultural lessees, each shall be entitled to said preferential right only to the extent of the area actually cultivated by him. …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </blockquote> Under Section 12 of the law, if the property was sold to a third person without the knowledge of the tenants thereon, the latter shall have the right to redeem the same at a reasonable price and consideration.&nbsp; By assigning their rights and interests on the landholding under the deeds of assignment in favor of the petitioner, the defendants-tenants thereby waived, in favor of the petitioner, who is not a beneficiary under Section 22 of Rep. Act No. 6657, their rights of preemption or redemption under Rep. Act No. 3844.&nbsp; The defendants-tenants would then have to vacate the property in favor of the petitioner upon full payment of the purchase price.&nbsp; Instead of acquiring ownership of the portions of the landholding respectively tilled by them, the defendants-tenants would again become landless for a measly sum of P50.00 per square meter.&nbsp; The petitioner’s scheme is subversive, not only of public policy, but also of the letter and spirit of the agrarian laws.&nbsp; That the scheme of the petitioner had yet to take effect in the future or ten years hence is not a justification.&nbsp; The respondents may well argue that the agrarian laws had been violated by the defendants-tenants and the petitioner by the mere execution of the deeds of assignment.&nbsp; In fact, the petitioner has implemented the deeds by paying the defendants-tenants amounts of money and even sought their immediate implementation by setting a meeting with the defendants-tenants.&nbsp; In fine, the petitioner would not wait for ten years to evict the defendants-tenants.&nbsp; For him, time is of the essence.<br><br><i>The Appellate Court Erred <br>In Permanently Enjoining <br>The Regional Trial Court <br>From Continuing with the <br>Proceedings in Civil Case <br>No. 10910.</i><br><br>We agree with the petitioner’s contention that the appellate court erred when it permanently enjoined the RTC from continuing with the proceedings in Civil Case No. 10910.&nbsp; The only issue before the appellate court was whether or not the trial court committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction in denying the respondents’ motion to deny or dismiss the petitioner’s plea for a writ of preliminary injunction.&nbsp; Not one of the parties prayed to permanently enjoin the trial court from further proceeding with Civil Case No. 10910 or to dismiss the complaint.&nbsp; It bears stressing that the petitioner may still amend his complaint, and the respondents and the defendants-tenants may file motions to dismiss the complaint.&nbsp; By permanently enjoining the trial court from proceeding with Civil Case No. 10910, the appellate court acted arbitrarily and effectively dismissed the complaint <i>motu proprio</i>, including the counterclaims of the respondents and that of the defendants-tenants.&nbsp; The defendants-tenants were even deprived of their right to prove their special and affirmative defenses.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals nullifying the February 13, 1996 and April 16, 1997 Orders of the RTC is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.&nbsp; The writ of injunction issued by the Court of Appeals permanently enjoining the RTC from further proceeding with Civil Case No. 10910 is hereby <b>LIFTED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. &nbsp;The Regional Trial Court of Mabalacat, Pampanga, Branch 44, is <b>ORDERED</b> to continue with the proceedings in Civil Case No. 10910 as provided for by the Rules of Court, as amended.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Quisumbing, Austria-Martinez, </i>and <i>Tinga, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Demetrio G.
