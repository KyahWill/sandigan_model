It emphasized that nine days after the filing of the notice of strike and two days after the filing of the strike-vote report to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the members of the respondent had already engaged in concerted activities, such as picketing, in clear violation of Article 263(e) and (f) of the Labor Code.<br><br>The NLRC also stressed that the respondent did not have any personality to file a notice of strike because its petition for certification election before the BLR was still unresolved.&nbsp; It declared that pursuant to Article 253 of the Labor Code, the SWAT remained to be the exclusive bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of the petitioner until the resolution of the petition for certification election.<br><br>Finally, the NLRC ruled that the illegality of the strike was further heightened when the officers and members of the respondent union joined efforts in blockading the ingress to and egress from the petitioner’s factory.<br><br>The respondent union filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> but the NLRC issued a Resolution dated June 23, 1999 denying the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Case Before the Court of Appeals</span></div><br>Undaunted, respondent union filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) under Rule 65,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> asserting as follows:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span></div><br>RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT RULED THAT SWAT – FILCON EMPLOYEES UNION REMAINED THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING AGENT OF ALL THE RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span></div><br>RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT RULED THAT ONLY SWAT-FILCON EMPLOYEES UNION COULD VALIDLY DECLARE A STRIKE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER UNIONS AT THE COMPANY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span></div><br>RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER LMF-LMLC DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF A STRIKE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.</span></div><br>RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT UPHELD THE FINDING OF THE LABOR ARBITER THAT ILLEGAL ACTS WERE COMMITTED DURING THE STRIKE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">V.</span></div><br>RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT UPHELD THE RULING OF THE LABOR ARBITER DECLARING THAT THE MEMBERS OF PETITIONER LMF-LMLC HAD LOST THEIR EMPLOYMENT STATUS AS A RESULT OF THE ILLEGALITY OF THE STRIKE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>In its comment on the petition, the petitioner insisted that the decision of the Labor Arbiter was fully and substantially supported by the established facts and record based on applicable laws and jurisprudence.&nbsp; It reiterated that the respondent union lacked the legal personality to file a notice of strike, considering that the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of its rank-and-file employees was the SWAT.&nbsp; Moreover, by engaging in concerted activities without observing the cooling-off period, the respondent union thereby conducted an illegal strike.&nbsp; The petitioner also reiterated that the officers and members of the respondent union participated in the prohibited activities, particularly the blockage of the ingress to and egress from the factory.<br><br>On June 8, 2001, the CA promulgated a decision reversing the decision of the NLRC.&nbsp; The dispositive portion reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding merit in the Petition, this Court issues the writ of certiorari and sets aside the Decision of the respondent Commission dated December 29, 1997 and orders the dismissal of NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-0804521-90 and the reinstatement of the dismissed employees with full backwages and other benefits from the time they were dismissed up to the time of actual reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>While it agreed with the NLRC that the strike staged by the respondent union was illegal, the CA ruled that by reason of the compromise agreement entered into by the parties on August 30, 1990, the petitioner had, in effect, condoned the misconduct of the striking employees.&nbsp; The CA emphasized that, under the agreement, the petitioner agreed to accept all workers without reservation, as evidenced by the non-retaliatory clause contained therein.&nbsp; Citing Article 2036, in tandem with Article 2028 of the New Civil Code, the CA emphasized that a compromise agreement comprises not only those objects which are definitely stated, but also those that are, by necessary implication, included therein.&nbsp; It stressed that the dismissal of the complaint for illegal strike was necessarily included in the compromise agreement entered into by the parties.<br><br>The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that the CA erred when it gave due course to the petition, considering that the assailed decision had become final and executory by reason of the respondent union’s failure to include in its petition an explanation for resorting to service <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> registered mail in serving a copy of the petition on it, in violation of Section 11, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The petitioner further asserted that the CA erred in ruling that the ultimate intention of the parties in their compromise agreement was the condonation of the misconduct of its employees.<br><br>The CA denied the petitioner’s motion in its October 11, 2001 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Emphasizing the “Christian Dogma of preferential option for the poor,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the CA ruled that, in the interest of justice, equity and fair play, it had to decide the case on the merits, prescinding from the respondent’s procedural lapse.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Present Petition</span></div><br>The petitioner filed the instant petition, alleging as follows:<blockquote><ol type="A"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN REOPENING AND TAKING COGNIZANCE OF THE ISSUE ON THE EXISTENCE OF CONDONATION WHICH WAS NOT RAISED IN THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI AND HAD ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED IN THE NEGATIVE.&nbsp;

Ricafort</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the petitioner argues that the petition for certiorari of the respondent is deemed not to have been filed and, consequently, the decision of the NLRC became final and executory.<br><br>We agree with the petitioner.<br><br>Indeed, the records show that although the petition was filed personally with the CA, service of a copy thereof on the respondent was effected by registered mail without any explanation as to why resort to such mode was made.&nbsp; In its motion for reconsideration of the CA decision, the petitioner sought the dismissal of the petition because of the respondent’s failure to comply with Section 11, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The respondent was directed by the CA to comment on the motion, but the respondent failed to do so.&nbsp; The respondent even failed to comment on the petitioner’s allegation that the decision of the NLRC had become final and executory on such ground; neither did the respondent offer any explanation in its memorandum in the present case.&nbsp; Evidently then, the CA erred when it resolved to deny the motion for reconsideration of its decision and gave due course to the petition for certiorari.<br><br>Even on the substantial issues, we find the petition meritorious.<br><br>On the issue of whether or not the petitioner condoned the strike of the members of the respondent union and waived its right to assail the illegality of the said strike under the compromise agreement, the CA ruled:<blockquote>A careful reading of the Compromise Agreement in the context of the factual milieu convinces this Court that it was, indeed, a compact between the parties to end their dispute and restore their cordial and mutually beneficial relationship.&nbsp; The Agreement explicitly stipulated that the strikers would stop their strike, lift their picket lines and resume work and the company would accept them back.&nbsp; The parties most significantly agreed to maintain and promote industrial piece, and shall not commit any act which might be construed as acts of harassment and retaliation.&nbsp; Accordingly, the strikers returned to work and the company accepted them back.&nbsp; It is difficult to see how an amicable resolution of the dispute between the petitioner and the private respondents could be effected without the dismissal of the case for illegal strike when that case was precisely the sword of Democles which hang over the latter’s heads and consequently caused the instability and discord in the work place.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter and respondent Commission held that the dismissal of the said cases was not mentioned in the Agreement.&nbsp; True, but it should be remembered that the Agreement which was handwritten was made by the parties who are non-lawyers and cannot therefore be expected to be very precise in their terminology.&nbsp; Important to remember is the rule in Art. 2036 of the Civil Code which states that to be deemed included in the compromise agreement are not only those expressly stated therein but also those necessarily implied therefrom.&nbsp; This Court has no doubt that the parties intended to terminate the illegal strike case as implied from the expressly stipulated terms mentioned above.&nbsp; That subsequently, the respondent company pursued said case was nothing but a change of mind which cannot denigrate much less suppress the juridical effect of said Compromise Agreement.<br><br>The respondent Commission totally ignored the text and tenor of the Compromise Agreement and eskewed the clear intention of the parties resulting in severe prejudice to the petitioner and its members.&nbsp; Considering the seriousness of the mistake and gravity of the resulting injury, this Court holds that, indeed, the respondent Commission gravely abused its discretion.</blockquote>We do not agree with the CA.&nbsp; The compromise agreement executed by the parties attested by the NCMB reads:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A G R E E M E N T</span></div><ol><li>The parties agree to maintain <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> prevailing immediately on the date of strike as follows:</li><br><ol type="A"><li>The parties agree to immediately resume operations based upon the work schedules to be prepared by the Company and in the said work schedule.&nbsp; The 17 suspended workers shall be included.&nbsp; In the preparation of work schedules, no discrimination shall be committed and, if possible, all returning workers or employees be admitted to work within one (1) week from reliance of the schedules which will be released on the first week of September 1990;</li><li>The parties shall maintain and promote industrial peace, and shall not commit any acts which might be construed as acts of harassment and retaliation.</li><br></ol><li>The cases of Messrs.

A compromise under the said provision contemplates mutual concessions and mutual gains to avoid the expense and expenses of litigation or, when litigation has already begun, to end it because of the uncertainty of the result thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The caption of an agreement is not determinative of the true nature thereof.&nbsp; An agreement although captioned a compromise agreement may not, in fact and in law, be a compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed that when the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the parties, the literal meaning of such terms shall be controlling.&nbsp; The contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties shall also be principally considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In construing a written contract, the reason behind and the circumstance surrounding its execution are of paramount importance to place the interpreter in the situation occupied by the parties concerned at the time the contract was executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Even a cursory reading of the agreement of the parties will readily show that they did not thereby intend to write <span style="font-style: italic;">finis </span>or put an end to the cases filed against each other in the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the NLRC.&nbsp; They merely agreed to maintain their <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> before the commencement of the complaints filed by them, without prejudice to the resolution by the Labor Arbiter of the factual and legal issues raised after the presentation of their respective evidence.&nbsp; The parties merely agreed that the respondent would stop its strike against the petitioner and lift its picket within the latter’s premises, and, that the petitioner, in turn, would allow the members of the respondent union to return back to work to enable the petitioner to resume its business operations.&nbsp; The parties did not intend to put an end to the cases pending against each other.&nbsp; In point of fact, after the execution of the said agreement, the parties adduced their respective testimonial and documentary evidences on the factual and legal issues, instead of asking the Labor Arbiter and the DOLE to dismiss the complaints filed by the parties against each other.&nbsp; The parties’ presentation of their respective evidence <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">after</span> the execution of their compromise agreement is conclusive proof that the said agreement is not the compromise agreement envisaged in Article 2028 of the New Civil Code.&nbsp; The contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties belie the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the petitioner waived its right to assail the illegality of the strike.<br><br>Considering the terms of the compromise agreement, it cannot thereby be concluded that the petitioner waived its right to assail the illegality of the strike staged by the respondent and defend the validity of its termination of the employment of the members of the respondent who staged a strike.&nbsp; It must be underscored that a waiver to be valid and effective must be couched in clear and unequivocal terms which leave no doubt as to the intention of a party to give up a right or benefit which legally pertains to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC and the CA are one that the strike staged by the respondent was illegal.&nbsp; We agree with the ruling of the Labor Arbiter, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<blockquote>The right to strike is not absolute.&nbsp; It comes into being and is safeguarded by law only if the acts intended to render material aid or protection to a labor union <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arise</span> from a lawful ground, reason or motive.&nbsp; But if the motive which had impelled, prompted, moved or led members of a labor union or organization to stage a strike, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even if they had acted in good faith in staging it, be unlawful, illegitimate, unjust, unreasonable or trivial, the strike may be declared illegal</span>.&nbsp; (Interwood Employees Association vs. Interwood Hardwood and Veneer Company of the Philippines, 52 O.G. 3936) (underscoring supplied)&nbsp; For “the law, in protecting the rights of the laborer, authorizes neither oppression nor self-destruction of the employer.”&nbsp; (Elizalde Int’l. vs. C.A., 108 SCRA 247).&nbsp; Thus, “a company has the right to dismiss its erring employees if only as a measure of self-protection against acts inimical to its interest.”&nbsp; (Manila Trading and Supply Co. vs. Zulueta, 69 Phil. 403).<br><br>As borne out by the record, respondent SWAT was certified as the sole and (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) bargaining agent of all the rank-and-file employees of complainant Filcon Manufacturing Corporation whose Collective Bargaining Agreement expired last 15 January 1990 and was not renewed due to the filing of Petition for Certification Election by three (3) unions, namely: 1) Lakas Manggagawa sa Filcon-Lakas Manggagawa Labor Center; 2) Bisig ng Manggagawa; and 3) Kampli-Katipunan, which up to present is still pending before the Bureau of Labor Relations.&nbsp; In its Collective Bargaining Agreement, it provides that the provisions contained therein shall be in full force and effect until a new one has been entered into and one of the provisions therein reads that there shall be no strike nor lock-out.&nbsp; This provision must be given due respect by all the parties concerned.&nbsp; Thus, it is evident, therefore, that the contract bar rule applies, thereby, rendering the strike staged by respondent LMF-LMLC illegal.&nbsp; This is supported by evidence that respondent LMF-LMLC blocked the free ingress and egress of company premises during the course of their strike.&nbsp; (Exhs. “B,” “C,” “D,” “E,” “F,” “G,” “H,” “I,” and “J”), in violation of paragraph e, Article 264 of the Labor Code, as amended, to wit:<br><br>“Art. 264.&nbsp; PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. –<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div><br>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No person engaged in picketing shall commit any act of violence, coercion or intimidation or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">obstruct the free ingress or egress from the employer’s premises for the lawful purposes</span> or obstruct public thoroughfares.”&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that strikes may only be allowed on grounds of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CBA deadlock and unfair labor practices</span>.&nbsp; Neither of this exist in the case at bar, as respondent LMF-LMLC failed to adduce evidence to the contrary except the sweeping allegation of its only witness who was dismissed from employment in 1989 or almost a year before the staging of the strike.&nbsp; Clearly, therefore, this Office is of the opinion and so holds that the strike was declared more on the ground of inter-union and intra-union conflict which is a non-strikeable issue pursuant to paragraph (b) of Article 263 of the Labor Code, as amended, to wit:<blockquote>“Art. 263.&nbsp; Strikes, Picketing and Lock-outs. –<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers shall have the right to engage in concerted activities for purposes of collective bargaining or for their mutual benefit and protection.&nbsp; The right of legitimate labor organizations to strike and picket and of employers to lockout, consistent with the national interest shall continue to be recognized and protected.&nbsp; However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no labor union may strike and no employer may declare a lockout on grounds involving inter-union and intra-union disputes</span>.”&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that respondent LMF-LMLC before it staged the strike, had complied with all the legal requisites, namely: 1) Notice of Strike; 2) Strike Vote, thus rendering the same legal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote>The NLRC affirmed the finding of the Labor Arbiter, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<blockquote>There is no justification to disturb the factual findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter since these are amply supported by the evidence on record.<br><br>Thus, only nine (9) days after the respondent union filed its notice of strike, and two (2) days after the strike vote, the said respondent union engaged in concerted activities such as picketing and other acts which are clear indications of a strike.&nbsp; Quite evidently, the respondent failed to observe the cooling-off period as provided in Article 263, paragraphs (e) and (f) of the Labor Code, which ordains that a strike may only be conducted after fifteen (15) days from date of filing of the notice of strike, if the issue stated therein is one involving unfair labor practice, and after seven (7) days from strike voting.&nbsp; Even granting that one of the strikeable issues raised in the notice of strike was union busting allegedly committed through the dismissal of three (3) union officers and member, nonetheless, there is no proof that the very existence of the union was threatened due to the alleged acts of dismissals such that it was not justified of the respondent union to stage the questioned strike immediately even before the mandatory cooling-off period expired.<br><br>What appears insurmountable as a clear proof of the illegality of the strike is that while it has yet to prove its majority status through a certification election, and worse during the pendency of a petition to that effect, the respondent union already assumed the role of a sole and exclusive bargaining agent.&nbsp; True enough, not one of the petitioners including the respondent union are in the certification election as they failed to garner the required majority of the total votes cast.<br><br>As correctly found by the Labor Arbiter, the incumbent union, FEU-SWAT, remained to be the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of the company’s rank-and-file employees.&nbsp; This finds support in Article 253 of the Labor Code which, in part, states:<blockquote>“ART. 253.&nbsp; Duty to bargain collectively when there exists a collective bargaining agreement. – xxx.&nbsp; It shall be the duty of both parties (FILCON &amp; SWAT) to keep the <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> and to continue in full force and effect the terms and conditions of the existing agreement during the 60-day period and/or until a new agreement is reached by the parties.”</blockquote>Thus, the respondent falsely assumed its rule when it filed a notice of strike during the 60-day freedom period, and while a petition for certification election was pending.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, a strike during the pendency of such petition is patently illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>The findings of facts of the quasi-judicial tribunals, in this case the NLRC which affirmed the findings of the Labor Arbiter, when based on substantial evidence, have conclusive effect on this Court absent proof that the said findings are capricious or arbitrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is GRANTED.&nbsp;
