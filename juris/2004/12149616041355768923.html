				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Can a provision of law, initially valid, become <b>subsequently</b> unconstitutional, on the ground that its <b>continued operation</b> would violate the equal protection of the law? We hold that with the passage of the subsequent laws amending the charter of seven (7) other governmental financial institutions (GFIs), the continued operation of the last <i>proviso</i> of Section 15(c), Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, constitutes invidious discrimination on the <b>2,994 rank-and-file employees</b> of the <i><i>Bangko Sentral</i> ng Pilipinas</i> (BSP).<br><b><center><br>I.<br><br>The Case<br></center><br></b>First the facts.<br><br>On July 3, 1993, R.A. No. 7653 (the New Central Bank Act) took effect. It abolished the old Central Bank of the Philippines, and created a new BSP.<br><br>On June 8, 2001, almost <b>eight years after</b> the effectivity of R.A. No. 7653, petitioner Central Bank (now BSP) Employees Association, Inc., filed a petition for prohibition against BSP and the Executive Secretary of the Office of the President, to restrain respondents from further implementing the last <i>proviso</i> in Section 15(c), Article II of R.A. No. 7653, on the ground that it is unconstitutional.<br><br>Article II, Section 15(c) of R.A. No. 7653 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 15. <i>Exercise of Authority</i> -In the exercise of its authority, the Monetary Board shall:<br><center><br>xxx xxx xxx<br><br></center>(c) establish a human resource management system which shall govern the selection, hiring, appointment, transfer, promotion, or dismissal of all personnel. Such system shall aim to establish professionalism and excellence at all levels of the <i>Bangko Sentral</i> in accordance with sound principles of management.<br><br>A compensation structure, based on job evaluation studies and wage surveys and subject to the Board’s approval, shall be instituted as an integral component of the <i>Bangko Sentral</i>’s human resource development program: <i>Provided</i>, That the Monetary Board shall make its own system conform as closely as possible with the principles provided for under Republic Act No. 6758 [Salary Standardization Act]. <b><i>Provided, however</i>, That compensation and wage structure of employees whose positions fall under salary grade 19 and below shall be in accordance with the rates prescribed under Republic Act No. 6758.</b> [emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>The <b>thrust of petitioner’s challenge</b> is that the above <i>proviso</i> makes an <b>unconstitutional cut</b> between two classes of employees in the BSP, <i>viz</i>: (1) the BSP <b>officers</b> or those exempted from the coverage of the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) (exempt class); and (2) the <b>rank-and-file</b> (Salary Grade [SG] 19 and below), or those not exempted from the coverage of the SSL (non-exempt class). It is contended that this classification is “a classic case of class legislation,” allegedly not based on substantial distinctions which make real differences, but solely on the SG of the BSP personnel’s position. Petitioner also claims that it is not germane to the purposes of Section 15(c), Article II of R.A. No. 7653, the most important of which is to establish professionalism and excellence <b>at all levels</b> in the BSP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Petitioner offers the following sub-set of arguments:<br> <ol type="a"><li>the legislative history of R.A. No. 7653 shows that the questioned <i>proviso</i> does not appear in the original and amended versions of House Bill No. 7037, nor in the original version of Senate Bill No. 1235; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br> </li><li> subjecting the compensation of the BSP rank-and-file employees to the rate prescribed by the SSL actually defeats the purpose of the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of establishing professionalism and excellence <b>at all levels</b> in the BSP; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br><br> </li><li> the assailed <i>proviso</i> was the product of amendments introduced during the deliberation of Senate Bill No. 1235, without showing its relevance to the objectives of the law, and even admitted by one senator as discriminatory against low-salaried employees of the BSP;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br> </li><li> GSIS, LBP, DBP and SSS personnel are all exempted from the coverage of the SSL; thus within the class of rank-and-file personnel of government financial institutions (GFIs), the BSP rank-and-file are also discriminated upon;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and<br><br> </li><li> the assailed <i>proviso</i> has caused the demoralization among the BSP rank-and-file and resulted in the gross disparity between their compensation and that of the BSP officers’.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></li></ol>In sum, <b>petitioner posits</b> that the classification is not reasonable but arbitrary and capricious, and violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petitioner also stresses: (a) that R.A. No. 7653 has a separability clause, which will allow the declaration of the unconstitutionality of the <i>proviso</i> in question without affecting the other provisions; and (b) the urgency and propriety of the petition, as some<b> 2,994 BSP rank-and-file employees</b> have been <b>prejudiced since 1994</b> when the <i>proviso</i> was implemented. Petitioner concludes that: (1) since the inequitable <i>proviso</i> has no force and effect of law, respondents’ implementation of such amounts to lack of jurisdiction; and (2) it has no appeal nor any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course except through this petition for prohibition, which this Court should take cognizance of, considering the transcendental importance of the legal issue involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Respondent <b>BSP</b>, in its comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> contends that the provision does not violate the equal protection clause and can stand the constitutional test, provided it is construed in harmony with other provisions of the same law, such as “fiscal and administrative autonomy of BSP,” and the mandate of the Monetary Board to “establish professionalism and excellence at all levels in accordance with sound principles of management.”<br><br>The <b>Solicitor General</b>, on behalf of respondent Executive Secretary, also defends the validity of the provision. Quite simplistically, he argues that the classification is based on actual and real differentiation, even as it adheres to the enunciated policy of R.A. No. 7653 to establish professionalism and excellence within the BSP subject to prevailing laws and policies of the national government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><b><center><br>II.<br><br>Issue<br></center><br></b>Thus, the <b>sole</b> - albeit significant - <b>issue</b> to be resolved in this case is whether the last paragraph of Section 15(c), Article II of R.A. No. 7653, runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that "No person shall be. . . denied the equal protection of the laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><b></b><center><b><br>III.<br><br>Ruling</b><br> </center><ol type="A"><b></b><li><b> UNDER THE PRESENT STANDARDS OF EQUAL PROTECTION, SECTION 15(c), ARTICLE II OF R.A. NO. 7653 IS VALID.</b><br><br>Jurisprudential standards for equal protection challenges indubitably show that the classification created by the questioned <i>proviso</i>, on its face and in its operation, bears no constitutional infirmities.<br><br>It is settled in constitutional law that the "equal protection" clause does not prevent the Legislature from establishing classes of individuals or objects upon which different rules shall operate - so long as the classification is not unreasonable. As held in <b>Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers’ Union</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and reiterated in a long line of cases:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote>The guaranty of equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty of equality in the application of the laws upon all citizens of the state. It is not, therefore, a requirement, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition against inequality, that every man, woman and child should be affected alike by a statute. Equality of operation of statutes does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to the circumstances surrounding them. It guarantees equality, not identity of rights. The Constitution does not require that things which are different in fact be treated in law as though they were the same. The equal protection clause does not forbid discrimination as to things that are different. It does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate.<br><br>The equal protection of the laws clause of the Constitution allows classification. Classification in law, as in the other departments of knowledge or practice, is the grouping of things in speculation or practice because they agree with one another in certain particulars. A law is not invalid because of simple inequality. The very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality. All that is required of a valid classification is that it be reasonable, which means that the classification should be based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences, that it must be germane to the purpose of the law; that it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and that it must apply equally to each member of the class. This Court has held that the standard is satisfied if the classification or distinction is based on a reasonable foundation or rational basis and is not palpably arbitrary.<br><br>In the exercise of its power to make classifications for the purpose of enacting laws over matters within its jurisdiction, the state is recognized as enjoying a wide range of discretion. It is not necessary that the classification be based on scientific or marked differences of things or in their relation. Neither is it necessary that the classification be made with mathematical nicety. Hence, legislative classification may in many cases properly rest on narrow distinctions, for the equal protection guaranty does not preclude the legislature from recognizing degrees of evil or harm, and legislation is addressed to evils as they may appear. (<i>citations omitted</i>)<br></blockquote>Congress is allowed a wide leeway in providing for a valid classification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those persons falling within a specified class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> If the groupings are characterized by substantial distinctions that make real differences, one class may be treated and regulated differently from another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The classification must also be germane to the purpose of the law and must apply to all those belonging to the same class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it is clear in the legislative deliberations that the exemption of officers (SG 20 and above) from the SSL was intended to address the BSP’s lack of competitiveness in terms of attracting competent officers and executives. It was not intended to discriminate against the rank-and-file. If the end-result did in fact lead to a disparity of treatment between the officers and the rank-and-file in terms of salaries and benefits, the discrimination or distinction has a rational basis and is not palpably, purely, and entirely arbitrary in the legislative sense. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>That the provision was a product of amendments introduced during the deliberation of the Senate Bill does not detract from its validity. As early as 1947 and reiterated in subsequent cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> this Court has subscribed to the conclusiveness of an enrolled bill to refuse invalidating a provision of law, on the ground that the bill from which it originated contained no such provision and was merely inserted by the bicameral conference committee of both Houses.<br><br>Moreover, it is a fundamental and familiar teaching that all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> An act of the legislature, approved by the executive, is presumed to be within constitutional limitations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> To justify the nullification of a law, there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not a doubtful and equivocal breach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br> </li><li> <b>THE ENACTMENT, HOWEVER, OF SUBSEQUENT LAWS - EXEMPTING ALL OTHER RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES OF GFIs FROM THE SSL - RENDERS THE CONTINUED APPLICATION OF THE CHALLENGED PROVISION A VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE.</b><br></li></ol>While R.A. No. 7653 started as a valid measure well within the legislature’s power, we hold that <b>the enactment of subsequent laws exempting all rank-and-file employees of other GFIs leeched all validity out of the challenged <i>proviso</i>.</b><br> <ol type="1"><li> <b>The concept of relative constitutionality.</b><br><br>The constitutionality of a statute cannot, in every instance, be determined by a mere comparison of its provisions with applicable provisions of the Constitution, since the statute may be constitutionally valid as applied to one set of facts and invalid in its application to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>A statute valid at one time may become void at another time because of <span style="font-weight: bold;">altered circumstances.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus, if a statute in its practical operation becomes arbitrary or confiscatory, its validity, even though affirmed by a former adjudication, is open to inquiry and investigation in the light of <b>changed conditions.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Demonstrative of this doctrine is <b>Vernon Park Realty v. City of Mount Vernon</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where the Court of Appeals of New York declared as unreasonable and arbitrary a zoning ordinance which placed the plaintiff's property in a residential district, although it was located in the center of a business area. Later amendments to the ordinance then prohibited the use of the property except for parking and storage of automobiles, and service station within a parking area. The Court found the ordinance to constitute an invasion of property rights which was contrary to constitutional due process. It ruled:<br><blockquote>While the common council has the unquestioned right to enact zoning laws respecting the use of property in accordance with a well-considered and comprehensive plan designed to promote public health, safety and general welfare, such power is subject to the constitutional limitation that it may not be exerted arbitrarily or unreasonably and this is so whenever the zoning ordinance precludes the use of the property for any purpose for which it is reasonably adapted. <b>By the same token, an ordinance valid when adopted will nevertheless be stricken down as invalid when, at a later time, its operation under changed conditions proves confiscatory</b> such, for instance, as when the greater part of its value is destroyed, for which the courts will afford relief in an appropriate case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (<i>citations omitted, emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote><b>In the Philippine setting,</b> this Court declared the continued enforcement of a valid law as unconstitutional as a consequence of <b>significant changes</b> in circumstances. <b>Rutter v. Esteban</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> upheld the constitutionality of the moratorium law - its enactment and operation being a valid exercise by the State of its police power<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> - but also ruled that the <b>continued enforcement of the otherwise valid law would be unreasonable and oppressive.</b> It noted the subsequent changes in the country’s business, industry and agriculture. Thus, the law was set aside because its continued operation would be grossly discriminatory and lead to the oppression of the creditors. The landmark ruling states:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><blockquote>The question now to be determined is, is the period of <b>eight (8) years</b> which Republic Act No. 342 grants to debtors of a monetary obligation contracted before the last global war and who is a war sufferer with a claim duly approved by the Philippine War Damage Commission reasonable under the present circumstances?<br><br>It should be noted that Republic Act No. 342 only extends relief to debtors of prewar obligations who suffered from the ravages of the last war and who filed a claim for their losses with the Philippine War Damage Commission. It is therein provided that said obligation shall not be due and demandable for a period of eight (8) years from and after settlement of the claim filed by the debtor with said Commission. The purpose of the law is to afford to prewar debtors an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves by giving them a reasonable time within which to pay their prewar debts so as to prevent them from being victimized by their creditors. While it is admitted in said law that since liberation conditions have gradually returned to normal, this is not so with regard to those who have suffered the ravages of war and so it was therein declared as a policy that as to them the debt moratorium should be continued in force (Section 1).<br><br>But we should not lose sight of the fact that these obligations had been pending since 1945 as a result of the issuance of Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32 and at present their enforcement is still inhibited because of the enactment of Republic Act No. 342 and would continue to be unenforceable during the eight-year period granted to prewar debtors to afford them an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, which in plain language means that the creditors would have to observe a vigil of at least twelve (12) years before they could effect a liquidation of their investment dating as far back as 1941. his period seems to us unreasonable, if not oppressive. While the purpose of Congress is plausible, and should be commended, the relief accorded works injustice to creditors who are practically left at the mercy of the debtors. Their hope to effect collection becomes extremely remote, more so if the credits are unsecured. And the injustice is more patent when, under the law, the debtor is not even required to pay interest during the operation of the relief, unlike similar statutes in the United States.<br><center><br>xxx xxx xxx<br></center><br>In the face of the foregoing observations, and consistent with what we believe to be as the only course dictated by justice, fairness and righteousness, we feel that the only way open to us under the present circumstances is to declare that the continued operation and enforcement of Republic Act No. 342 at <b>the present time is unreasonable and oppressive, and should not be prolonged a minute longer, and, therefore, the same should be declared null and void and without effect.</b> (emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br> </blockquote></li><li> <b>Applicability of the equal protection clause.<br><br>In the realm of equal protection</b>, the U.S. case of <b>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Ivey</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> is illuminating. The Supreme Court of Florida ruled against the continued application of statutes authorizing the recovery of double damages plus attorney's fees against railroad companies, for animals killed on unfenced railroad right of way without proof of negligence. Competitive motor carriers, though creating greater hazards, were not subjected to similar liability because they were <b>not yet in existence</b> when the statutes were enacted. The Court ruled that the statutes became invalid as denying “equal protection of the law,” in view of <b>changed conditions since their enactment.</b><br><br>In another U.S. case, <b>Louisville &amp; N.R. Co. v. Faulkner,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court of Appeals of Kentucky declared unconstitutional a provision of a statute which imposed a duty upon a railroad company of proving that it was free from negligence in the killing or injury of cattle by its engine or cars. <b>This, notwithstanding that the constitutionality of the statute, enacted in 1893, had been previously sustained.</b> Ruled the Court:<br><blockquote>The constitutionality of such legislation was sustained because it applied to all similar corporations and had for its object the safety of persons on a train and the protection of property…. Of course, there were no automobiles in those days. The <b>subsequent</b> inauguration and development of transportation by motor vehicles on the public highways by common carriers of freight and passengers created even greater risks to the safety of occupants of the vehicles and of danger of injury and death of domestic animals. Yet, under the law the operators of that mode of competitive transportation are not subject to the same extraordinary legal responsibility for killing such animals on the public roads as are railroad companies for killing them on their private rights of way.<br><br>The Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Brandeis in Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Walters, 294 U.S. 405, 55 S.Ct. 486, 488, 79 L.Ed. 949, stated, “<b>A statute valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied.</b> The police power is subject to the constitutional limitation that it may not be exerted arbitrarily or unreasonably.” A number of prior opinions of that court are cited in support of the statement. The State of Florida for many years had a statute, F.S.A. § 356.01 et seq. imposing extraordinary and special duties upon railroad companies, among which was that a railroad company was liable for double damages and an attorney's fee for killing livestock by a train without the owner having to prove any act of negligence on the part of the carrier in the operation of its train. In Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Ivey, it was held that the changed conditions brought about by motor vehicle transportation rendered the statute unconstitutional since if a common carrier by motor vehicle had killed the same animal, the owner would have been required to prove negligence in the operation of its equipment. Said the court, “This certainly is not equal protection of the law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote><b>Echoes of these rulings resonate in our case law,</b> <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>[C]ourts are not confined to the language of the statute under challenge in determining whether that statute has any discriminatory effect. <b>A statute nondiscriminatory on its face may be grossly discriminatory in its operation.</b> Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (<i>emphasis supplied, citations omitted</i>)<br><br>[W]e see <b>no difference between a law which denies equal protection and a law which permits of such denial.</b> A law may appear to be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it permits of unjust and illegal discrimination, it is within the constitutional prohibition…..

Is Congress’ power to classify so unbridled as to sanction unequal and discriminatory treatment, simply because the inequity manifested itself, not instantly through a single overt act, but gradually and progressively, through seven separate acts of Congress? Is the right to equal protection of the law bounded in time and space that: (a) the right can only be invoked against a classification made directly and deliberately, as opposed to a discrimination that arises indirectly, or as a consequence of several other acts; and (b) is the legal analysis confined to determining the validity within the parameters of the statute or ordinance (where the inclusion or exclusion is articulated), thereby proscribing any evaluation vis-à-vis the grouping, or the lack thereof, among several similar enactments made over a period of time?<br><br>In this <b>second level of scrutiny</b>, the inequality of treatment cannot be justified on the mere assertion that each exemption (granted to the seven other GFIs) rests “on a policy determination by the legislature.” <b>All legislative enactments necessarily rest on a policy determination</b> - even those that have been declared to contravene the Constitution. Verily, if this could serve as a magic wand to sustain the validity of a statute, then no due process and equal protection challenges would ever prosper.

At bottom, the second challenge to the constitutionality of Section 15(c), Article II of Republic Act No. 7653 is <b>premised precisely on the irrational discriminatory policy adopted by Congress in its treatment of persons similarly situated.</b> In the field of equal protection, the guarantee that "no person shall be … denied the equal protection of the laws” includes the prohibition against enacting laws that allow invidious discrimination, <b>directly or indirectly.</b> If a law has the effect of denying the equal protection of the law, or permits such denial, it is unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>It is against this standard that the disparate treatment of the BSP rank-and-file from the other GFIs cannot stand judicial scrutiny. For as regards the exemption from the coverage of the SSL, there exist no substantial distinctions so as to differentiate, the BSP rank-and-file from the other rank-and-file of the seven GFIs. On the contrary, <b>our legal history shows that GFIs have long been recognized as comprising one distinct class, separate from other governmental entities.</b><br><br><b>Before the SSL</b>, Presidential Decree <b>(P.D.) No. 985 (1976)</b> declared it as a State policy (1) to provide equal pay for substantially equal work, and (2) to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions. P.D. No. 985 was passed to address disparities in pay among similar or comparable positions which had given rise to dissension among government employees. <b>But even then, GFIs and government-owned and/or controlled corporations (GOCCs) were already identified as a distinct class among government employees.</b> Thus, Section 2 also provided, “[t]hat notwithstanding a standardized salary system established for all employees, additional financial incentives may be established by government corporation and financial institutions for their employees to be supported fully from their corporate funds and for such technical positions as may be approved by the President in critical government agencies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The same favored treatment is made for the GFIs and the GOCCs under the SSL.

The need for the scope of exemption necessarily varies with the particular circumstances of each institution, and the corresponding variance in the benefits received by the employees is merely incidental.</i>”<br><br>The fragility of this argument is manifest. First, the BSP is the <b>central monetary authority,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the <b>banker of the government and all its political subdivisions.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It has the sole power and authority to issue currency;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> provide policy directions in the areas of money, banking, and credit; and supervise banks and regulate finance companies and non-bank financial institutions performing quasi-banking functions, <b>including the exempted GFIs.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Hence, the argument that the rank-and-file employees of the seven GFIs were exempted because of the importance of their institution’s mandate cannot stand any more than an empty sack can stand.<br><br>Second, it is certainly misleading to say that “<i>the need for the scope of exemption necessarily varies with the particular circumstances of each institution.</i>” Nowhere in the deliberations is there a cogent basis for the exclusion of the BSP rank-and-file from the exemption which was granted to the rank-and-file of the other GFIs and the SEC. As point in fact, the BSP and the seven GFIs are similarly situated in so far as Congress deemed it necessary for these institutions to be exempted from the SSL. True, the SSL-exemption of the BSP and the seven GFIs was granted in the amended charters of each GFI, enacted separately and over a period of time. But it bears emphasis that, while each GFI has a mandate different and distinct from that of another, the deliberations show that the <i>raison d’être</i> of the SSL-exemption was <i>inextricably linked to and for the most part</i> based on factors common to the eight GFIs, <i>i.e.</i>, (1) the pivotal role they play in the economy; (2) the necessity of hiring and retaining qualified and effective personnel to carry out the GFI’s mandate; and (3) the recognition that the compensation package of these GFIs is not competitive, and fall substantially below industry standards. Considering further that (a) the BSP was the first GFI granted SSL exemption; and (b) the subsequent exemptions of other GFIs did not distinguish between the officers and the rank-and-file; it is patent that <b>the classification made between the BSP rank-and-file and those of the other seven GFIs</b> was inadvertent, and NOT intended, <i>i.e.</i>, it was not based on any substantial distinction vis-à-vis the particular circumstances of each GFI. Moreover, the exemption granted to two GFIs makes express reference to <i>allowance and fringe benefits similar to those extended to and currently enjoyed by the employees and personnel of other GFIs,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> underscoring that GFIs are a particular class within the realm of government entities.<br><br>It is precisely this unpremeditated discrepancy in treatment of the rank-and-file of the BSP - made manifest and glaring with each and every consequential grant of blanket exemption from the SSL to the other GFIs - that cannot be rationalized or justified. Even more so, when the SEC - which is not a GFI - was given leave to have a compensation plan that “shall be comparable with the prevailing compensation plan in the [BSP] and other [GFIs],”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> then granted a blanket exemption from the SSL, and its rank-and-file endowed a more preferred treatment than the rank-and-file of the BSP.<br><br>The violation to the equal protection clause becomes even more pronounced when we are faced with this undeniable truth: that if Congress had enacted a law for the sole purpose of exempting the eight GFIs from the coverage of the SSL, the exclusion of the BSP rank-and-file employees would have been devoid of any substantial or material basis. It bears no moment, therefore, that the unlawful discrimination was not a direct result arising from one law. “<i>Nemo potest facere per alium quod non potest facere per directum.</i>” No one is allowed to do indirectly what he is prohibited to do directly.<br><br>It has also been proffered that “similarities alone are not sufficient to support the conclusion that rank-and-file employees of the BSP may be lumped together with similar employees of the other GOCCs for purposes of compensation, position classification and qualification standards. The fact that certain persons have some attributes in common does not automatically make them members of the same class with respect to a legislative classification.” Cited is the ruling in <b>Johnson v. Robinson</b>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> “this finding of similarity ignores that a common characteristic shared by beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries alike, is not sufficient to invalidate a statute when other characteristics peculiar to only one group rationally explain the statute’s different treatment of the two groups.”<br><br>The reference to <b>Johnson</b> is <i>inapropos</i>. In <b>Johnson</b>, the US Court sustained the validity of the classification <b>as there were quantitative and qualitative distinctions, expressly recognized by Congress, which formed a rational basis for the classification</b> limiting educational benefits to military service veterans as a means of helping them readjust to civilian life. The Court listed the peculiar characteristics as follows:<br><blockquote>First, the disruption caused by military service is quantitatively greater than that caused by alternative civilian service.

The distinction made by the law is not only superficial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> but also arbitrary. It is not based on substantial distinctions that make real differences between the BSP rank-and-file and the seven other GFIs.<br><br>Moreover, the issue in this case is not - as the dissenting opinion of Mme. Justice Carpio-Morales would put it - whether “being an employee of a GOCC or GFI is reasonable and sufficient basis for exemption” from R.A. No. 6758. <b>It is Congress itself that distinguished the GFIs from other government agencies,</b> not once but eight times, through the enactment of R.A. Nos. 7653, 7907, 8282, 8289, 8291, 8523, 8763, and 9302. These laws may have created a “preferred sub-class within government employees,” but the present challenge is not directed at the wisdom of these laws. Rather, it is a legal conundrum involving the exercise of legislative power, the validity of which must be measured not only by looking at the specific exercise <i>in and by itself</i> (R.A. No. 7653), but also as to the <i>legal effects</i> brought about by seven separate exercises - albeit indirectly and without intent.<br><br>Thus, even if petitioner had not alleged “a comparable change in the factual milieu as regards the compensation, position classification and qualification standards of the employees of the BSP (whether of the executive level or of the rank-and-file) since the enactment of the new Central Bank Act” is of no moment. In <i>GSIS v. Montesclaros</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> this Court resolved the issue of constitutionality notwithstanding that claimant had manifested that she was no longer interested in pursuing the case, and even when the constitutionality of the said provision was not squarely raised as an issue, because the issue involved not only the claimant but also others similarly situated and whose claims GSIS would also deny based on the challenged <i>proviso</i>. The Court held that social justice and public interest demanded the resolution of the constitutionality of the <i>proviso</i>. And so it is with the challenged <i>proviso</i> in the case at bar.<br><br>It bears stressing that the exemption from the SSL is a <b>“privilege”</b> fully within the legislative prerogative to give or deny. However, its subsequent grant to the rank-and-file of the seven other GFIs and continued denial to the BSP rank-and-file employees breached the latter’s right to equal protection. In other words, while the granting of a privilege <i>per se</i> is a matter of policy exclusively within the domain and prerogative of Congress, <i>the validity or legality of the exercise</i> of this prerogative is subject to judicial review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> So when the distinction made is superficial, and not based on substantial distinctions that make real differences between those included and excluded, it becomes a matter of arbitrariness that this Court has the duty and the power to correct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> As held in the United Kingdom case of <b>Hooper v.

For the principle is that equal protection and security shall be given to every person under circumstances which, if not identical, are analogous.

The Warren Court did not abandon the deferential ingredients of the old equal protection: in most areas of economic and social legislation, the demands imposed by equal protection remained as minimal as ever…But the Court launched an equal protection revolution by finding large new areas for strict rather than deferential scrutiny. A sharply differentiated <b>two-tier approach evolved</b> by the late 1960s: in addition to the deferential “old” equal protection, a “new” equal protection, connoting <b>strict scrutiny</b>, arose…. The intensive review associated with the new equal protection imposed two demands - <b>a demand not only as to means but also one as to ends.</b> Legislation qualifying for strict scrutiny required a far closer fit between classification and statutory purpose than the rough and ready flexibility traditionally tolerated by the old equal protection: <b>means had to be shown “necessary” to achieve statutory ends, not merely “reasonably related” ones.</b> Moreover, equal protection became a source of ends scrutiny as well: legislation in the areas of the new equal protection had to be justified by “compelling” state interests, not merely the wide spectrum of “legitimate” state ends.<br><br>The <b>Warren Court</b> identified the <b>areas appropriate for strict scrutiny</b> by searching for <b>two characteristics:</b> the presence of a “suspect” classification; or an impact on “fundamental” rights or interests. In the category of “suspect classifications,” the Warren Court’s major contribution was to intensify the strict scrutiny in the traditionally interventionist area of racial classifications. But other cases also suggested that there might be more other suspect categories as well: illegitimacy and wealth for example.

A number of justices sought formulations that would blur the sharp distinctions of the two-tiered approach or that would narrow the gap between strict scrutiny and deferential review. The most elaborate attack came from Justice Marshall, whose frequently stated position was developed most elaborately in his dissent in the <i>Rodriguez</i> case: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><blockquote>The Court apparently seeks to establish [that] equal protection cases fall into one of two neat categories which dictate the appropriate standard of review - <b>strict scrutiny or mere rationality.</b> But this (<i>sic</i>) Court’s [decisions] defy such easy categorization. A principled reading of what this Court has done reveals that it has applied a spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination allegedly violative of the equal protection clause. This spectrum clearly comprehends variations in the degree of care with which Court will scrutinize particular classification, depending, I believe, on the constitutional and societal importance of the interests adversely affected and the recognized invidiousness of the basis upon which the particular classification is drawn.<br></blockquote>Justice Marshall’s <b>“sliding scale” approach</b> describes many of the modern decisions, although it is a formulation that the majority refused to embrace. <b>But the Burger Court’s results indicate at least two significant changes in equal protection law: <i>First</i>,</b> invocation of the “old” equal protection formula no longer signals, as it did with the Warren Court, an extreme deference to legislative classifications and a virtually automatic validation of challenged statutes. Instead, several cases, even while voicing the minimal “rationality” “hands-off” standards of the old equal protection, proceed to find the statute unconstitutional. <b><i>Second,</i></b> in some areas the <b>modern Court</b> has put forth standards for equal protection review that, while clearly more intensive than the deference of the “old” equal protection, are less demanding than the strictness of the “new” equal protection. Sex discrimination is the best established example of an <b>“intermediate” level of review.</b> Thus, in one case, the Court said that “classifications by gender must serve <b><i>important</i></b> governmental objectives and must be <i><b>substantially related</b></i> to achievement of those objectives.” That standard is “intermediate” with respect to both ends and means: where ends must be “compelling” to survive strict scrutiny and merely “legitimate” under the “old” mode, “important” objectives are required here; and where means must be “necessary” under the “new” equal protection, and merely “rationally related” under the “old” equal protection, they must be “substantially related” to survive the “intermediate” level of review.

In the <b>Belgian Linguistics</b> case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the European Court set the standard of justification at a low level: discrimination would contravene the Convention only if it had no legitimate aim, or there was no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> B<b>ut over the years, the European Court has developed a hierarchy of grounds covered by Article 14 of the ECHR, a much higher level of justification being required in respect of those regarded as “suspect” (sex, race, nationality, illegitimacy, or sexual orientation) than of others.</b> Thus, in <b>Abdulaziz</b>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the European Court declared that:<br><blockquote>. . . [t]he advancement of the equality of the sexes is today a major goal in the member States of the Council of Europe.

The Dutch government submitted that discrimination in social security benefit provision was not within the scope of Article 26, as the right was contained in the ICESCR and not the ICCPR. They accepted that Article 26 could go beyond the rights contained in the Covenant to other civil and political rights, such as discrimination in the field of taxation, but contended that Article 26 did not extend to the social, economic, and cultural rights contained in ICESCR. The Committee rejected this argument. In its view, Article 26 applied to rights beyond the Covenant including the rights in other international treaties such as the right to social security found in ICESCR:<br><blockquote>Although Article 26 requires that legislation should prohibit discrimination, it does not of itself contain any obligation with respect to the matters that may be provided for by legislation. Thus it does not, for example, require any state to enact legislation to provide for social security. However, when such legislation is adopted in the exercise of a State's sovereign power, then such legislation must comply with Article 26 of the Covenant.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[89]</sup></font><br></blockquote>Breaches of the right to equal protection occur directly or indirectly. A classification may be struck down if it has the <b>purpose or effect</b> of violating the right to equal protection. International law recognizes that <b>discrimination may occur indirectly</b>, as the Human Rights Committee[90] took into account the definitions of discrimination adopted by CERD and CEDAW in declaring that:<br><blockquote>. . . “discrimination” as used in the [ICCPR] should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is <b>based on any ground such as</b> race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or <b>social origin</b>, property, birth <b>or other status</b>, and which has the <b>purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise</b> by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[91]</sup></font> (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote><b>Thus, the two-tier analysis made in the case at bar of the challenged provision, and its conclusion of unconstitutionality by subsequent operation, are in cadence and in consonance with the progressive trend of other jurisdictions and in international law.</b> There should be no hesitation in using the equal protection clause as a major cutting edge to eliminate every conceivable irrational discrimination in our society. Indeed, the social justice imperatives in the Constitution, coupled with the special status and protection afforded to labor, compel this approach.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[92]</sup></font><br><br>Apropos the special protection afforded to labor under our Constitution and international law, we held in <b>International School Alliance of Educators v. Quisumbing</b>:<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[93]</sup></font><br><blockquote>That public policy abhors inequality and discrimination is beyond contention. Our Constitution and laws reflect the policy against these evils. The Constitution in the Article on Social Justice and Human Rights exhorts Congress to "give highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of all people to human dignity, reduce social, economic, and political inequalities." The very broad Article 19 of the Civil Code requires every person, "in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, [to] act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith."<br><br>International law, which springs from general principles of law, likewise proscribes discrimination. General principles of law include principles of equity, <i>i.e.</i>, the general principles of fairness and justice, based on the test of what is reasonable. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Discrimination in Education, the Convention (No. 111) Concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation - all embody the general principle against discrimination, the very antithesis of fairness and justice. The Philippines, through its Constitution, has incorporated this principle as part of its national laws.<br><br>In the workplace, where the relations between capital and labor are often skewed in favor of capital, inequality and discrimination by the employer are all the more reprehensible.<br><br>The Constitution specifically provides that labor is entitled to "humane conditions of work." These conditions are not restricted to the physical workplace - the factory, the office or the field - but include as well the manner by which employers treat their employees.<br><br>The Constitution also directs the State to promote "equality of employment opportunities for all." Similarly, the Labor Code provides that the State shall "ensure equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race or creed." It would be an affront to both the spirit and letter of these provisions if the State, in spite of its primordial obligation to promote and ensure equal employment opportunities, closes its eyes to unequal and discriminatory terms and conditions of employment.<br><center><br>xxx xxx xxx<br></center><br>Notably, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, in Article 7 thereof, provides:<br><blockquote>The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and [favorable] conditions of work, which ensure, in particular:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. Remuneration which provides all workers, as a minimum, with:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">i. Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work;<br></div></div></blockquote><center>xxx xxx xxx<br></center><br>The foregoing provisions impregnably institutionalize in this jurisdiction the long honored legal truism of "equal pay for equal work." Persons who work with substantially equal qualifications, skill, effort and responsibility, under similar conditions, should be paid similar salaries. (citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Congress retains its wide discretion in providing for a valid classification, and its policies should be accorded recognition and respect by the courts of justice except when they run afoul of the Constitution.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[94]</sup></font> <b>The deference stops where the classification violates a fundamental right, or prejudices persons accorded special protection by the Constitution.</b> When these violations arise, this Court must discharge its primary role as the vanguard of constitutional guaranties, <b>and require a stricter and more exacting adherence to constitutional limitations.</b> Rational basis should not suffice.<br><br>Admittedly, the view that prejudice to persons accorded special protection by the Constitution requires a stricter judicial scrutiny finds no support in American or English jurisprudence. Nevertheless, these foreign decisions and authorities are not <i>per se</i> controlling in this jurisdiction. At best, they are persuasive and have been used to support many of our decisions.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[95]</sup></font> We should not place undue and fawning reliance upon them and regard them as indispensable mental crutches without which we cannot come to our own decisions through the employment of our own endowments.

More importantly, they must be construed to serve our own public interest which is the be-all and the end-all of all our laws. And it need not be stressed that our public interest is distinct and different from others.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[97]</sup></font><br><br>In the 2003 case of <i>Francisco v. House of Representatives</i>, this Court has stated that: “[A]merican jurisprudence and authorities, much less the American Constitution, are of dubious application for these are no longer controlling within our jurisdiction and have only limited persuasive merit insofar as Philippine constitutional law is concerned....[I]n resolving constitutional disputes, [this Court] should not be beguiled by foreign jurisprudence some of which are hardly applicable because they have been dictated by different constitutional settings and needs.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[98]</sup></font> Indeed, although the Philippine Constitution can trace its origins to that of the United States, their paths of development have long since diverged.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[99]</sup></font><br><br>Further, the quest for a better and more “equal” world calls for the use of equal protection as a tool of effective judicial intervention.<br><blockquote>Equality is one ideal which cries out for bold attention and action in the Constitution. The Preamble proclaims “equality” as an ideal precisely in protest against crushing inequities in Philippine society. The command to promote social justice in Article II, Section 10, in “all phases of national development,” further explicitated in Article XIII, are clear commands to the State to take affirmative action in the direction of greater equality.… [T]here is thus in the Philippine Constitution no lack of doctrinal support for a more vigorous state effort towards achieving a reasonable measure of equality.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[100]</sup></font><br></blockquote>Our present Constitution has gone further in guaranteeing vital social and economic rights to marginalized groups of society, including labor.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[101]</sup></font> Under the policy of social justice, the law bends over backward to accommodate the interests of the working class on the humane justification that those with less privilege in life should have more in law.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[102]</sup></font> And the obligation to afford protection to labor is incumbent not only on the legislative and executive branches but also on the judiciary to translate this pledge into a living reality.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[103]</sup></font> Social justice calls for the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[104]</sup></font><br><b><center><br>V.<br><br>A Final Word<br></center><br></b>Finally, concerns have been raised as to the propriety of a ruling voiding the challenged provision. It has been proffered that the remedy of petitioner is not with this Court, but with Congress, which alone has the power to erase any inequity perpetrated by R.A. No. 7653. Indeed, a bill proposing the exemption of the BSP rank-and-file from the SSL has supposedly been filed.<br><br>Under most circumstances, the Court will exercise judicial restraint in deciding questions of constitutionality, recognizing the broad discretion given to Congress in exercising its legislative power. Judicial scrutiny would be based on the “rational basis” test, and the legislative discretion would be given deferential treatment.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[105]</sup></font><br><br><b>But if the challenge to the statute is premised on the denial of a fundamental right, or the perpetuation of prejudice against persons favored by the Constitution with special protection, judicial scrutiny ought to be more strict.</b> A weak and watered down view would call for the abdication of this Court’s solemn duty to strike down any law repugnant to the Constitution and the rights it enshrines. This is true whether the actor committing the unconstitutional act is a private person or the government itself or one of its instrumentalities. Oppressive acts will be struck down regardless of the character or nature of the actor.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[106]</sup></font><br><blockquote>Accordingly, when the grant of power is qualified, conditional or subject to limitations, the issue on whether or not the prescribed qualifications or conditions have been met, or the limitations respected, is justiciable or non-political, the crux of the problem being one of legality or validity of the contested act, not its wisdom. Otherwise, said qualifications, conditions or limitations - particularly those prescribed or imposed by the Constitution - would be set at naught. What is more, the judicial inquiry into such issue and the settlement thereof are the main functions of courts of justice under the Presidential form of government adopted in our 1935 Constitution, and the system of checks and balances, one of its basic predicates. As a consequence, <b>We have neither the authority nor the discretion to decline passing upon said issue, but are under the ineluctable obligation - made particularly more exacting and peremptory by our oath, as members of the highest Court of the land, to support and defend the Constitution - to settle it.</b> This explains why, in Miller v. Johnson, it was held that courts have a "duty, rather than a power", to determine whether another branch of the government has "kept within constitutional limits." Not satisfied with this postulate, the court went farther and stressed that, if the Constitution provides how it may be amended - as it is in our 1935 Constitution - "then, unless the manner is followed, the judiciary as the interpreter of that constitution, will declare the amendment invalid." In fact, this very Court - speaking through Justice Laurel, an outstanding authority on Philippine Constitutional Law, as well as one of the highly respected and foremost leaders of the Convention that drafted the 1935 Constitution - declared, as early as July 15, 1936, that "(i)n times of social disquietude or political excitement, the great landmarks of the Constitution are apt to be forgotten or marred, if not entirely obliterated. In cases of conflict, the judicial department is the only constitutional organ which can be called upon to determine the proper allocation of powers between the several departments" of the government.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[107]</sup></font> (<i>citations omitted; emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the challenged <i>proviso</i> operates on the basis of the salary grade or officer-employee status. <b>It is akin to a distinction based on economic class and status,</b> with the higher grades as recipients of a benefit specifically withheld from the lower grades. Officers of the BSP now receive higher compensation packages that are competitive with the industry, while the poorer, low-salaried employees are limited to the rates prescribed by the SSL. The implications are quite disturbing: BSP rank-and-file employees are paid the strictly regimented rates of the SSL while employees higher in rank - possessing higher and better education and opportunities for career advancement - are given higher compensation packages to entice them to stay. <b>Considering that majority, if not all, the rank-and-file employees consist of people whose status and rank in life are less and limited, especially in terms of job marketability, it is they - and not the officers - who have the real economic and financial <i>need</i> for the adjustment</b> This is in accord with the policy of the Constitution "to free the people from poverty, provide adequate social services, extend to them a decent standard of living, and improve the quality of life for all.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[108]</sup></font> <b>Any act of Congress that runs counter to this constitutional <i>desideratum</i> deserves strict scrutiny by this Court before it can pass muster.</b><br><br>To be sure, <b>the BSP rank-and-file employees merit greater concern from this Court.</b> They represent the more impotent rank-and-file government employees who, unlike employees in the private sector, have no specific right to organize as a collective bargaining unit and negotiate for better terms and conditions of employment, nor the power to hold a strike to protest unfair labor practices. Not only are they impotent as a labor unit, but their efficacy to lobby in Congress is almost nil as R.A. No. 7653 effectively isolated them from the other GFI rank-and-file in compensation. <b>These BSP rank-and-file employees represent the politically powerless and they should not be compelled to seek a political solution to their unequal and iniquitous treatment.</b> Indeed, they have waited for many years for the legislature to act. They cannot be asked to wait some more for discrimination cannot be given any waiting time. Unless the equal protection clause of the Constitution is a mere platitude, it is the Court’s duty to save them from reasonless discrimination.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> we hold that the continued operation and implementation of the last <i>proviso</i> of Section 15(c), Article II of Republic Act No. 7653 is unconstitutional.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Austria-Martinez, Azcuna, Tinga,</i> and <i>Chico-Nazario, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Panganiban, Carpio, Carpio-Morales</i>, and <i>Garcia, JJ.</i>, see dissenting.<br><i>Corona</i>, and <i>Callejo, Sr., JJ.</i>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>i.e.</i>, (1) make the salary of the BSP personnel competitive to attract highly competent personnel; (2) establish professionalism and excellence at all levels in the BSP; and (3) ensure the administrative autonomy of the BSP as the central monetary authority<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Rollo, pp. 8-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 10-12, <i>quoting</i> Former Senator Maceda, Record of the Senate, First Regular Session, March 15 to June 10, 1993, Vol. IV, No. 86, p. 1087.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 12-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 2-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 14-15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 62-75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 76-90.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 1987 Constitution, Art.

Convention No. 100 has been ratified by no less than 159 countries and Convention No. 111 by 156 (these being two of the eight fundamental Conventions the ratification of which is all but compulsory).

Article 15 of the African Charter provides a right for "every individual" to "equal pay for equal work," which, like Article 7 of the ICESCR, applies whether an individual is employed by the state or by a private body. The Council of Europe's Revised Social Charter provides for the "right to equal opportunities and equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation without discrimination on the grounds of sex" and to the protection of workers with family responsibilities. The Social Charter of the Council of Europe also incorporates a commitment on the part of Contracting States to "recognise the right of men and women workers to equal pay for work of equal value" as well as that of children, young persons and women to protection in employment (the latter group in connection with pregnancy and childbirth), and rights for migrant workers. Article 5 CERD does not merely require Contracting States to eliminate race discrimination in their own practices but also obliges them to prohibit race discrimination "in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights," in particular, employment rights including rights to "just and favourable conditions of work", protection against unemployment, "just and favourable remuneration" and to form and join trade unions. <i>See</i> Aileen McColgan, <i>Principles of Equality and Protection from Discrimination</i>, 2 E.H.R.L.R. 157 (2003).<br><br><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[86]</sup></font> Tufyal Choudhury, <i>Interpreting the Right to Equality under Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political</i> Rights, 1 E.H.R.L.R. 24-52 (2003).<br><br><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[87]</sup></font> SWM Broeks v. the Netherlands (172/1984).<br><br><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[88]</sup></font> F.H.

And in <i>Thlimmenos v Greece</i>, 31 E.H.R.R. 15 (2001), the European Court ruled that discrimination contrary to the European Convention had occurred when a man who had been criminalised because of his refusal (as a Jehovah's Witness and, therefore, a pacifist) to wear a military uniform during compulsory military service, was subsequently refused access to the chartered accountancy profession because of a rule which barred those with criminal convictions from being chartered. According to the Court:<br><br>“[We have] so far considered that the right under Article 14 not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is violated when States treat differently persons in analogous situations without providing an objective and reasonable justification ... However, the Court considers that this is not the only facet of the prohibition of discrimination in Article 14.

Even given the wide discretion vested in Congress to make classifications, it is nonetheless clear that the lawmaking body abused its discretion in making such classification.<br><br>It is not disputed that all that is required for a valid classification is that it must be reasonable, <i>i.e.</i>, that it must be based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences; it must be germane to the purpose of the law; it must not be limited to existing conditions and it must apply equally to each member of the class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the classification was justified on the need of the BSP to compete in the labor market for economists, accountants, lawyers, experts in security, printing, commercial and rural banking, financial intermediation fund management, and other highly technical and professional personnel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which it could not do unless personnel occupying top positions are exempted from the coverage of Rep.

In the instant case, however, SG 20 and up do not differ from SG 19 and down in terms of technical and professional expertise needed as the entire range of positions all “require intense and thorough knowledge of a specialized field usually acquired from completion of a bachelor’s degree or higher courses.”<br><br>Consequently, if BSP needs an exemption from Rep. Act No. 6758 for key positions in order that it may hire the best and brightest economists, accountants, lawyers and other technical and professional people, the exemption must not begin only in SG 20.<br><br>Under the circumstances, <b>the cut-off point, the great divide, between SG 19 and 20 is entirely arbitrary</b> as it does not have a reasonable or rational foundation. This conclusion finds support in no less than the records of the congressional deliberations, the bicameral conference committee having pegged the cut-off period at SG 20 despite previous discussions in the Senate that the “executive group” is “probably” SG 23 and above.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Moreover, even assuming that the classification is reasonable, nonetheless, its continued operation will result in hostile discrimination against those occupying grades 19 and below.<br><br>As pointed out by Mr. Justice Puno, some other government corporations, by law, now exempt all their employees from the coverage of Rep. Act No. 6758. BSP employees occupying SG 19 and below, however, shall remain under Rep.

Thus, while BSP employees from SG 19 down will continue to be covered under Rep.

In the <i>first place</i>, the assailed provision is not unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied, and the theory of <i>relative constitutionality</i> finds no application to the case at bar. In the <i>second place</i>, a becoming respect on the part of this Court for Congress as a coequal and coordinate branch of government dictates that Congress should be given ample opportunity to study the situation, weigh its options and exercise its constitutional prerogative to enact whatever legislation it may deem appropriate to address the alleged inequity pointed out by petitioner.<br><br>For the record, I am not against the exemption from the Salary Standardization Law of the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> (BSP) rank and file employees (with Salary Grade 19 and below).

The theory says that a statute valid at one time may become unconstitutional at another, because of <i>altered circumstances</i> or <i>changed conditions</i> that make the practical operation of such a statute arbitrary or confiscatory. Thus, the provisions of that statute, which may be valid <u>as applied to one set of facts</u> but <u>invalid as applied to another</u>, cannot be merely compared with those applicable under the Constitution.<br><br>From the manner in which it has been utilized in American and Philippine jurisprudence, however, this novel theory finds relevance only <i>when the factual situation covered by an assailed law changes</i>, not when another law is passed pertaining to subjects not directly covered by the former.

The defendant pointed out that the original Florida Act of 1889 and its later amendments in the 1940s had required railroad companies to fence their tracks for the protection and safety of the traveling public and their property against livestock roaming at large. Thus, the defendant averred that -- without imposing a similar fencing requirement on the owners of automobiles, trucks and buses that carry passengers upon unfenced public highways of the state where such vehicles operated -- the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions would be violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Reversing the lower court’s judgment for the plaintiff, the Supreme Court of Florida held that the application of the contested statutes under then existing conditions was violative of the equal protection clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Citing <i>Nashville</i>, that Court took judicial notice of the fact that there were no motor carriers on public roads when the statutes were originally enacted.

Although motor-driven vehicles and railroad carriers were under a similar obligation to protect everyone against accidents to life and property when conducting their respective businesses, the hazard of accidents by reason of cattle straying onto the line of traffic of motor-driven vehicles was greater than that which arose when cattle strayed onto the line of traffic of railroad carriers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Yet the burden of expenses and penalties that were rendered in favor of individuals who were neither shippers nor passengers was imposed only on railroad carriers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In addition, the railroad carriers would be held liable for attorney’s fees and double the value of the animals killed in their railways, without even requiring the plaintiffs who had sued them to prove the negligence of such carriers in operating their equipment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Although it was argued that motor-driven vehicles had no authority to fence on state and county highways over which they operated, the legislature could nevertheless authorize and require them to provide similar protection; or, in default thereof, to suffer similar penalties that were incidental to using such public roads for generating profit and serving the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><i><u>Louisville</u></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The plaintiff in <i>Louisville v.

The court recognized the fact that, in the 1950s, the inauguration and development of transportation by motor vehicles on public highways created even greater risks, not only to the occupants of such vehicles but also to domestic animals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Yet, the operators of these vehicles were not subjected to the same extraordinary legal responsibility of proving that for the killing of those animals on public roads, they were free from negligence, unlike railroad companies that struck and killed such animals on private rights of way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><i><u>Vernon</u></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The plaintiff in <i>Vernon v.

General damages were declared exempt; the law allowing their exemption was constitutional. <i>Cook</i> simply affirmed <i>Medill</i> when the same contested provision was applied to an issue similar to that which was raised in the latter case, but then declared that provision unconstitutional when applied to another issue. Thus, while general damages were also declared exempt, the claims for special damages filed prior to the filing of a petition for relief were not, and the law allowing the latter’s exemption was unconstitutional.<br><br>The court’s action was to be expected, because the issue on special damages in <i>Cook</i> was not at all raised in <i>Medill</i>, and there was no precedent on the matter in Minnesota, other than the <i>obiter dictum</i> -- if it can be called one -- in the latter case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Had that issue been raised in <i>Medill</i>, a similar conclusion would inevitably have been reached.

Such “<i>altered circumstances</i>” or “<i>changed conditions</i>” in these two cases refer to the non-exemption of special damages -- a subject matter distinct and separable, although covered by the same assailed statute. In fact, <i>Cook</i> precisely emphasized that “<i>where a statute is not inherently unconstitutional, it may be found constitutional as applied to some separable subject matters, and unconstitutional as applied to others.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> In other words, it was the <i>application</i> of the contested provision therein to an entirely different and separable subject matter -- not the contested provision itself --that was declared unconstitutional, but the statute itself was not inherently unconstitutional to begin with.<br><br>Equally important, <i>Nashville</i> skirted the issue on constitutionality. The “<i>changed conditions</i>” referred to in that case, as well as in <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Louisville</i>, were the revolutionary changes in the mode of transportation that were specifically covered by the statutes respectively imposing additional costs upon railroad companies only, requiring the fencing of their tracks, or solely compelling them to present evidence to rebut the presumption of their negligence. In <i>Vernon</i>, these “<i>changed conditions</i>” were deemed to be the economic changes in the 1950s, through which the normal business use of the land was unduly limited by the zoning ordinance that was intended to address the acute traffic problem in the community.<br><br><i>Nashville</i> simply took judicial notice of the change in conditions which, together with the continued imposition of statutory charges and fees, caused deprivation of property without due process of law. <i>Atlantic, Louisville</i> and <i>Vernon</i> all relied upon <i>Nashville</i>, but then went further by rendering their respective contested provisions unconstitutional, because -- in the application of such provisions under “<i>changed conditions</i>” -- those similarly situated were no longer treated alike.<br><br>Finally, <i>Murphy</i> -- obviously misplaced because it made no reference at all to the quoted sentence in the <i>ponencia</i> -- even upheld the validity of its contested provision. There was no trace, either, of any “<i>changed conditions</i>.” If at all, the legislative classification therein was declared constitutional, because it was in fact a valid economic response to a legislatively perceived crisis concerning the availability and cost of liability insurance.<br><br>In the present case, no “<i>altered circumstances</i>” or “<i>changed conditions</i>” in the application of the assailed provision can be found. It verily pertains to only one subject matter, not separable subject matters as earlier pointed out in both <i>Medill</i> and <i>Cook</i>. <i>Hence, its application remains and will remain consistent. Not inherently unconstitutional to begin with, it cannot now be declared unconstitutional</i>. Moreover, herein petitioner miserably fails to demonstrate -- unlike in <i>Nashville, Atlantic, Louisville</i>, and <i>Vernon</i> -- how those similarly situated have not been treated alike in the application of the assailed provision.<br><br><b><u>Ponencia’s Reference to<br>“<i>Changed Conditions</i>” Misplaced</u></b><br><br>From <i>Nashville</i> to <i>Murphy</i>, it can be seen that all the contested statutes were passed in the exercise of police power -- the inherent power of the State to regulate liberty and property for the promotion of the general welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The police measure may be struck down when an activity or property that ought to be regulated does not affect the public welfare; or when the means employed are not reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the statute’s purpose, and they become unduly oppressive upon individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> As Justice Brandeis stresses in Nashville, “<i>it may not be exerted arbitrarily or unreasonably.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In the case before us today, the assailed provision can be considered a police measure that regulates the income of BSP employees. Indisputably, the regulation of such income affects the public welfare, because it concerns not only these employees, but also the public in general -- from whose various credits the banks earn their income, the CB generates its revenues, and eventually these employees get their salaries and other emoluments.<br><br>Additionally, with the passage of RAs 6758 and 7653, the means employed by the State to accomplish its objectives are not unduly oppressive. <b>They are in fact reasonably necessary, not only to attract the best and brightest bank regulatory personnel, but also to establish professionalism and excellence within the BSP in accordance with sound principles of management. Nothing, therefore, is arbitrary in the assailed provision; it cannot be stricken down.</b><br><br>With due respect, the <i>ponencia</i>’s reference to “<i>changed conditions</i>” is totally misplaced. In the above-cited US cases, <i>this phrase never referred to subsequent laws or executive pronouncements</i>, but rather to the <i>facts and circumstances</i> that the law or ordinance specifically addressed upon its passage or adoption. A statute that is declared invalid because of a change in circumstances affecting its validity belongs only to a class of emergency laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Being a manifestation of the State’s exercise of its police power, it is valid at the time of its enactment.<br><br><b>In contrast thereto, RA 7653 cannot be regarded as an emergency measure that is merely temporary in operation. It is not even a statute limited to the exigency that brought it about. The facts and circumstances it specifically addressed upon its passage have not been shown to have changed at all. Hence, the assailed provision of such a declaratory statute cannot be invalidated.</b><br><br>Unlike congested traffic or motor-driven vehicles on public roads, the payment of salaries at differing scales in various GFIs vis-à-vis in the BSP, is not such a change in conditions as would cause deprivation of property without due process of law. Petitioner’s members have <i>not been deprived</i> of their right to income as mandated by law. They have <i>not received less</i> than what they were entitled to ever since RA 7653 was passed eleven years ago.<br><br><b>To repeat, the factual situation that the assailed provision specifically addressed upon passage of this law has not changed. The same substantive rights to a competitive and structured human resource development program existing then still exist now. Only the laws <u>external to and not amendatory</u> of this law did. Even if these new laws were to be considered as “<i>changed conditions</i>,” those who have been affected in the BSP (as will be shown later) are not at all similarly situated as those in the GFIs to compel their like treatment in application.</b><br><br>In addition, the rulings in all the above-cited American cases --although entitled to great weight<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> -- are merely of persuasive effect in our jurisdiction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and cannot be <i>stare decisis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> These are not direct rulings of our Supreme Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> that form part of the Philippine legal system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Granting <i>gratia argumenti</i> that the cited cases are to be considered binding precedents in our jurisdiction, <i>Nashville</i> -- the only one federal in character -- does not even make a categorical declaration on constitutionality.

In the said case, appellant instituted an action to recover the balance, and interest thereon, of a contract of sale entered into barely four months prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[77]</sup></font> The lower court, however, rendered judgment<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[78]</sup></font> for appellee who set up as defense<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[79]</sup></font> the moratorium clause embodied in RA 342.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[80]</sup></font> The lower court reasoned further that the obligation sought to be enforced was not yet demandable under that law.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[81]</sup></font><br><br>Reversing the judgment, this Court invalidated<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[82]</sup></font> the moratorium clause,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[83]</sup></font> not because the law was unconstitutional, but because both its continued operation and enforcement had become unreasonable and oppressive under postwar circumstances of observable reconstruction, rehabilitation and recovery of the country’s general financial condition.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[84]</sup></font> The forced vigil suffered by prewar creditors was not only unwittingly extended from eight to twelve years, but was also imposed without providing for the payment of the corresponding interest in the interim.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[85]</sup></font><br><br>Thus, the success of their collection efforts, especially when their credits were unsecured, was extremely remote.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[86]</sup></font> Moreover, the settlement of claims filed with the United States-Philippine War Damage Commission was not only uncertain but was also practically futile, for it depended entirely on the appropriations to be made by the US Congress.<br><br>The contested clause in <i>Rutter</i> was definitely a remedial measure passed to accord prewar debtors who suffered the ravages of war an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves within a reasonable time and to pay their prewar debts thereafter, thus preventing them from being victimized in the interim by their prewar creditors. The purpose having been achieved during the eight-year period, there was therefore no more reason for the law. <i>Cessante ratione legis cessat et ipsa lex</i>. When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself <i>ceases. But it does not become unconstitutional.</i><br><br>The <i>altered circumstances</i> or <i>changed conditions</i> in <i>Rutter</i> were specifically the very circumstances that the law addressed at its passage; they were not at all extraneous circumstances like subsequent laws or executive pronouncements. The eight-year moratorium period having lapsed, the debtors’ concerns had been adequately addressed. It was now the turn of the creditors to be protected for the pre-war loans they granted.<br><br>In stark contrast, the contested proviso in the instant case is not a remedial measure. It is not subject to a period within which a right of action or a remedy is suspended. <i>Since the reason for the law still subsists, the law itself including the challenged proviso must continue in existence and operation.</i><br><br><i><b><u>Relative Constitutionality<br>Not Based on Positive Law</u></b></i><br><br>Applying the concept of <i>relative constitutionality</i> strongly advocated in the <i>ponencia</i>, therefore, not only goes beyond the parameters of traditional constitutionalism, but also finds no express basis in positive law.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[87]</sup></font> While it has been asserted that “<i>a statute valid when enacted may become invalid by change in conditions to which it is applied</i>,”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[88]</sup></font> the present case has shown no such change in conditions that would warrant the invalidation of the assailed provision if applied under such conditions. Hence, no semblance of constitutional impuissance, other than its conjured possibility, can be seen. <i>In a constitutional order that commands respect for coequal branches of government, speculation by the judiciary becomes incendiary and deserves no respectable place in our judicial chronicles</i>.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> further contends that the principles of international law can operate to render a valid law unconstitutional. The generally accepted definition states that international law is a body of legal rules that apply between sovereign states and such other entities as have been granted international personality.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[89]</sup></font> Government employees at the BSP with salary grades 19 and below are not such entities vested with international personality; any possible discrimination as to them, in the light of the principles and application of international law would be too far-fetched.<br><br>The dangerous consequences of the majority’s Decision in the present case cannot and should not be ignored. Will there now be an automatic SSL exemption for employees of other GFIs and financial regulatory agencies? Will such exemption not infringe on Congress’ prerogative? The <i>ponencia</i> overlooks the fact that the Bangko Sentral is not a GFI, but a regulatory body of GFIs and other financial/banking institutions. <i>Therefore, it should not be compared with them</i>. There is no parity. The Bangko Sentral is more akin to the Insurance Commission, the National Telecommunications Commission, and the Energy Regulatory Commission. Should not more appropriate comparisons be made with such regulatory bodies and their employees?<br><br><b><i><u>Respect for<br>Coequal Branch</u></i></b><br><br>The trust reposed in this Court is “<i>not to formulate policy but to determine its legality as tested by the Constitution.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[90]</sup></font> “<i>It does not extend to an unwarranted intrusion into that broad and legitimate sphere of discretion enjoyed by the political branches to determine the policies to be pursued. This Court should ever be on the alert lest, without design or intent, it oversteps the boundary of judicial competence</i>.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[91]</sup></font> Judicial activism should not be allowed to become judicial exuberance. “<i>As was so well put by Justice Malcolm: ‘Just as the Supreme Court, as the guardian of constitutional rights, should not sanction usurpations by any other department of the government, so should it as strictly confine its own sphere of influence to the powers expressly or by implication conferred on it by the Organic Act.’</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[92]</sup></font><br><br>Since Congress itself did not commit any constitutional violation or gravely abusive conduct when it enacted RA 7653, it should not be summarily blamed for what the <i>ponencia</i> calls “altered circumstances.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[93]</sup></font> Congress should be given the opportunity to correct the problem, if any. I repeat, I am not against exemption from the SSL of Bangko Sentral employees with salary grades 19 and below. Neither am I against increases in their pay. However, it is Congress, not this Court, that should provide a solution to their predicament, at least in the first instance.<br><br>The remedy against any perceived legislative failure to enact corrective legislation is a resort, not to this Court, but to the bar of public opinion. The electorate can refuse to return to Congress members who, in their view, have been remiss in the discharge of their constitutional duties.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[94]</sup></font> Our Constitution presumes that, absent any inference of antipathy, improvident legislative decisions “<i>will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes;</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[95]</sup></font> and that judicial intervention is unwarranted, no matter how unwisely a political branch may have acted.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[96]</sup></font><br><br>It is only the legislature, not the courts, that “<i>must be appealed to for the change</i>.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[97]</sup></font> If, however, Congress decides to act, the choice of appropriate measure lies within its discretion. Once determined, the measure chosen cannot be attacked on the ground that it is not the best solution, or that it is unwise or inefficacious.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[98]</sup></font> A law that advances a legitimate governmental interest will be sustained, even if it “<i>works to the disadvantage of a particular group, or x x x the rationale for it seems tenuous.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[99]</sup></font> To compel this Court to make a more decisive but unnecessary action in advance of what Congress will do is a downright derogation of the Constitution itself, for it converts the judiciary into a super-legislature and invests it with a power that to it has never belonged.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[100]</sup></font><br><br>In the words of the great Sir William Blackstone, “<i>there is no court that has power to defeat the intent of the Legislature, when couched in such evident and express words, as leave no doubt whether it was the intent of the Legislature, or no[t].</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[101]</sup></font> As Rousseau further puts it, “<i>according to the fundamental compact, only the general will can bind the individuals, and there can be no assurance that a particular will is in conformity with the general will, until it has been put to the free vote of the people.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[102]</sup></font> Thus, instead of this Court invalidating a sovereign act, Congress should be given the opportunity to enact the appropriate measure to address the so-called “<i>changed conditions.</i>”<br><br><b>We cannot second-guess the mind of the legislature as the repository of the sovereign will.

Moreover, the <i>ponencia</i> has assumed without proof that the BSP rank and file employees are factually and actually similarly situated as the rank and filers of Land Bank, SSS, GSIS, etc., and it is clear from the discussion in Mme.

One such canon is that the Court must “<i>not anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it x x x. It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[127]</sup></font> In addition, the Court must not “<i>pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[128]</sup></font><br><br>Applying to this case the contours of constitutional avoidance Brandeis brilliantly summarized, this Court may choose to ignore the constitutional question presented by petitioner, since there is indeed some other ground upon which this case can be disposed of -- <i>its clear lack of urgency, by reason of which Congress should be allowed to do its primary task of reviewing and possibly amending the law</i>.<br><br>Taking cognizance of this case and disposing of, or altogether ignoring, the constitutional question leads us to the same inevitable conclusion: the assailed provision should not be declared “<i>unconstitutional, unless it is clearly so.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[129]</sup></font> Whichever path is chosen by this Court, I am of the firm belief that such provision cannot and should not be declared unconstitutional. Since the authority to declare a legal provision void is of a “<i>delicate and awful nature,</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[130]</sup></font> the Court should “<i>never resort to that authority, but in a clear and urgent case.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[131]</sup></font> If ever there is doubt -- and clearly there is, as manifested herein by a sharply divided Court -- “<i>the expressed will of the legislature should be sustained.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[132]</sup></font><br><br><i>Indeed, this Court is of the unanimous opinion that the assailed provision was at the outset constitutional; however, with recent amendments to related laws,</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[133]</sup></font> <i>the majority now feels that said provision could no longer pass constitutional muster</i>. To nail my colors to the mast, such proclivity to declare it immediately unconstitutional not only imprudently creeps into the legislative sphere, but also sorely clings to the strands of obscurantism. Future changes in both legislation and its executive implementation should certainly not be the benchmark for a preemptive declaration of unconstitutionality, especially when the said provision is not even constitutionally infirm to begin with.<br><br>Moreover, the congressional enactment into law of pending bills<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[134]</sup></font> on the compensation of BSP employees -- or even those related thereto -- will certainly affect the assailed provision. This Court should bide its time, for it has neither the authority nor the competence to contemplate laws, much less to create or amend them.<br><br>Given the current status of these pending bills, the arguments raised by petitioner against the assailed provision become all the more tenuous and amorphous. <i>I feel we should leave that provision untouched, and instead just accord proper courtesy to our legislators to determine at the proper time and in the manner they deem best the appropriate content of any modifications to it</i>.

Whatever doubts there may be as to the validity of any provision therein must necessarily be resolved in its favor.<br><br><b><i><u>Brief Background of the<br>Equal Protection Clause</u></i></b><br><br>Despite the egalitarian commitment in the Declaration of Independence that “<i>all men are created equal,</i>” the framers of the original Constitution of the United States omitted any constitutional rule of equal protection. Not until 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment thereto was ratified by the legislatures of the several states of the Union,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[158]</sup></font> did the concept of equal protection have a constitutional basis;<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[159]</sup></font> and not until the modern era did the United States Supreme Court give it enduring constitutional significance.<br><br>From its inception, therefore, the equal protection clause in “the broad and benign provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[160]</sup></font> already sought “<i>to place all persons similarly situated upon a plane of equality and to render it impossible for any class to obtain preferred treatment.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[161]</sup></font> Its original understanding was the proscription only of certain discriminatory acts based on <i>race</i>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[162]</sup></font> although its proper construction, when called to the attention of the US Supreme Court in the Slaughter-House Cases, first involved exclusive privileges.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[163]</sup></font> Eventually, other disfavored bases of governmental action were identified. Labeled as morally irrelevant traits, <i>gender, illegitimacy</i> and <i>alienage</i> were included in this list.<br><br>Today, this clause is “<i>the single most important concept x x x for the protection of individual rights.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[164]</sup></font> It does not, however, create substantive rights.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[165]</sup></font> Its guaranty is merely “<i>a pledge of the protection of equal laws.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[166]</sup></font> Its “<i>promise that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[167]</sup></font><br><br>As mirrored in our Constitution,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[168]</sup></font> this clause enjoys the interpretation given by its American framers<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[169]</sup></font> and magistrates. In fact, a century ago, this Court already enunciated that “<i>the mere act of cession of the Philippines to the United States did not extend the [US] Constitution here, except such parts as fall within the general principles of fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights formulated in the [US] Constitution and its amendments, and which exist rather by inference and the general spirit of the [US] Constitution, and except those express provisions of the [US] Constitution which prohibit Congress from passing laws in their contravention under any circumstances x x x.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[170]</sup></font> Being one such limitation in favor of personal rights enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment, equal protection is thus deemed extended to our jurisdiction.<br><br>Notably, Justice Malcolm himself said that the constitutional law of Spain, then in effect, was “<i>entirely abrogated by the change of sovereignty</i>.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[171]</sup></font> As a result, it was the constitutional law of the United States that was transposed to our fledgling political and legal system. To be precise, the principal organic acts of the Philippines included President McKinley’s Instructions to the Second Philippine Commission of April 7, 1900, to which this Court recognized the United States Constitution as a limitation<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[172]</sup></font> upon the powers of the military governor then in charge of the Philippine Islands.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[173]</sup></font><br><br>In a catena of constitutional cases decided after the change in sovereignty, this Court consistently held that the equal protection clause requires all persons or things similarly situated to “<i>be treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed.

The legislature in fact enjoys a wide berth in continually classifying whenever it enacts a law,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[189]</sup></font> provided that no persons similarly situated within a given class are treated differently. To contend otherwise is to be presumptuous about the legislative intent or lack of it.<br><br>Whether it would have been a better policy to make a more comprehensive classification “<i>is not our province to decide.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[190]</sup></font> The absence of legislative facts supporting a classification chosen has no significance in the <i>rational basis test</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[191]</sup></font> In fact, “<i>a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[192]</sup></font> Requiring Congress to justify its efforts may even “<i>lead it to refrain from acting at all.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[193]</sup></font> In addition, Murphy holds that the statutory classification “<i>enjoys a strong presumption of constitutionality, and a reasonable doubt as to its constitutionality is sufficient to sustain it</i>.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[194]</sup></font><br><br>Respectfully, therefore, I again differ from the <i>ponencia’s</i> contention that the amendments of the charters of the seven GFIs from 1995 to 2004<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[195]</sup></font> have already “unconstitutionalized” the continued implementation of the BSP proviso. Be it remembered that the first six GFIs mentioned by Mr. Justice Puno -- namely the LBP, SSS, SBGFC, GSIS, DBP and HGC -- do not stand in the same class and category as the BSP.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[196]</sup></font><br><br>While the BSP, as mentioned earlier, is a <i>regulatory</i> agency performing <i>governmental</i> functions, the six aforementioned GFIs perform <i>proprietary</i> functions that chiefly compete with private banks and other non-bank financial institutions. Thus, the so-called concept of <i>relative constitutionality</i> again finds no application. Under the <i>rational relationship test</i>, there can be no unequal protection of the law between employees of the BSP and those of the GFIs. Further, the equal protection clause “<i>guarantees equality, not identity of rights.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[197]</sup></font> A law remains valid even if it is limited “<i>in the object to which it is directed.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[198]</sup></font><br><br>“<i>Defining the class of persons subject to a regulatory requirement x x x inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line, and the fact that the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[199]</sup></font> In fact, as long as “<i>the basic classification is rationally based, uneven effects upon particular groups within a class are ordinarily of no constitutional concern.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[200]</sup></font> “<i>It is not the province of this Court to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[201]</sup></font><br><br>On the other hand, the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) is also a government regulatory agency almost on the same level of importance as the BSP. However, its charter was only amended very recently --to be more precise, on July 27, 2004.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[202]</sup></font> Consequently, it would be most unfair to implicitly accuse Congress of inaction, discrimination and unequal treatment. <i>Comity with and courtesy to a coequal branch dictate that our lawmakers be given sufficient time and leeway to address the alleged problem of differing pay scales. “Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[203]</sup></font> Besides, it is a cardinal rule that courts first ascertain whether construction of a statute is fairly possible by which any constitutional question therein may be avoided.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[204]</sup></font><br><br>To explain further, while the possible changes contemplated by Congress in HB 00123 are similar, if not identical, to those found in the amended charters of the seven other GFIs already mentioned, the governmental objectives as explicitly stated in the explanatory note remain -- to ascertain BSP’s effectiveness and to strengthen its supervisory capability in promoting a more stable banking system. This fact merely confirms that the present classification and distinction under the assailed provision still bear a rational relationship to the same legitimate governmental objectives and should, therefore, not be invalidated.<br><br>The validity of a law is to be determined not by <i>its effects on a particular case or by an incidental result arising therefrom, but by the purpose and efficacy of the law in accomplishing that effect or result</i>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[205]</sup></font> This point confirms my earlier position that the enactment of a law is not the same as its operation. Unlike Vera in which the Court invalidated the law on probation because of the unequal effect in the operation of such law,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[206]</sup></font> <i>the assailed provision in the present case suffers from no such invidious discrimination. It very well achieves its purpose, and it applies equally to all government employees within the BSP. Furthermore, the application of this provision is not made subject to any discretion, uneven appropriation of funds, or time limitation. Consequently, such a law neither denies equal protection nor permits of such denial.</i><br><br><i><u><b>The Strict Scrutiny Test</b></u></i><br><br>Under the <u>second tier</u> or the <i>strict scrutiny test</i>, the Court will require the government to show a compelling or overriding end to justify (1) the limitation on fundamental rights or (2) the implication of suspect classes.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[207]</sup></font> Where a statutory classification impinges upon a fundamental right or burdens a suspect class, such classification is subjected to strict scrutiny.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[208]</sup></font> It will be upheld only if it is shown to be “<i><u>suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest</u></i>.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[209]</sup></font><br><br>Therefore, all legal restrictions that curtail the civil rights of a suspect class, like a single racial or ethnic group, are immediately suspect. “<i>That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional.

The assailed provision thus cannot be invalidated via the strict scrutiny gauntlet. “<i>In areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[231]</sup></font><br><br><b><i><u>The Intensified Means Test</u></i></b><br><br>Under the <u>third tier</u> or the <i>intensified means test</i>, the Court should accept the legislative end, but should closely scrutinize its relationship to the classification made.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[232]</sup></font> There exist classifications that are subjected to a higher or intermediate degree of scrutiny than the deferential or traditional <i>rational basis test</i>. These classifications, however, have not been deemed to involve suspect classes or fundamental rights; thus, they have not been subjected to the strict <i>scrutiny test</i>. In other words, such classifications must be “<i><u>substantially related to a sufficiently important governmental interest</u></i>.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[233]</sup></font> Examples of these so-called “quasi-suspect” classifications are those based on gender,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[234]</sup></font> legitimacy under certain circumstances,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[235]</sup></font> legal residency with regard to availment of free public education, civil service employment preference for armed forces veterans who are state residents upon entry to military service, and the right to practice for compensation the profession for which certain persons have been qualified and licensed.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[236]</sup></font><br><br>Non-exempt government employees may be a <i>sensitive</i> but not a suspect class, and their employment status may be <i>important</i> although not fundamental.

I respectfully submit that the assailed provision is not unconstitutional either on its face or as applied.<br><br><i>First</i>, the theory of relative constitutionality is inapplicable to and not in <i>pari materia</i> with the present facts. It pertains only to the circumstances that an assailed law specifically addressed upon its passage, and not to extraneous circumstances.<br><br>The American cases cited in the <i>ponencia</i> prove my point. The laws therein that have been declared invalid because of “<i>altered circumstances</i>” or “<i>changed conditions</i>” are of the emergency type passed in the <i>exercise of the State’s police power</i>, unlike the law involved in the present case. Moreover, our ruling in <i>Rutter</i> does not apply, because the assailed provision in the present case is not a remedial measure subject to a period within which a right of action or a remedy is suspended. Since the reason for the passage of the law still continues, the law itself must continue.<br><br><i>Second</i>, this Court should respect Congress as a coequal branch of government. No urgency has been shown as to require the peremptory striking down of the assailed provision, and no injuries have been demonstrated to have been sustained as to require immediate action on the judiciary’s part.<br><br>The legislative classification of BSP employees into exempt and non-exempt, based on the salary grade of their positions, and their further distinction (albeit perhaps not by design) from the employees of various GFIs are nevertheless valid and reasonable in achieving the standards of professionalism and excellence within the BSP -- standards that are in accordance with sound principles of management and the other principles provided for under RA 6758. They are employees not subjected to the same levels of difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements. Besides, the BSP performs <i>primarily governmental or regulatory</i> functions, while the GFIs cited in the <i>ponencia</i> execute <i>purely proprietary</i> ones.<br><br>Congress is in fact presently deliberating upon possible amendments to the assailed provision. Since there is no question that it validly exercised its power and did not gravely abuse its discretion when it enacted the law, its will must be sustained. Under the doctrine of separation of powers with concomitant respect for coequal and coordinate branches of government, this Court has neither the authority nor the competence to create or amend laws.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the assailed provision passes the three-tiered standard of review for equal protection. It is both a social and an economic measure rationally related to a governmental end that is not prohibited. Since salary grade, class of position, and government employment are not fundamental or constitutional rights, and non-exempt government employees or their financial need are not suspect classes, the government is not at all required to show a compelling state interest to justify the classification made. The provision is also substantially related to the achievement of sufficiently important governmental objectives. A law does not become invalid because of simple inequality, or because it did not strike at all evils at the same time.<br><br><b>At bottom, whichever constitutional test is used, the assailed provision is not unconstitutional. Moreover, a thorough scrutiny of the Petition reveals that the issue of equal protection has been raised only in regard to the unconstitutionality of the proviso at its inception,</b><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[245]</sup></font> <b>and not by reason of the alleged “changed conditions” propounded by the <i>ponencia</i>. With greater reason then that the Petition should be denied.</b><br><br>In our jurisdiction, <i>relative constitutionality</i> is a rarely utilized theory having radical consequences; hence, I believe it should not be imposed by the Court unilaterally. Even in the US, it applies only when there is a change in <i>factual circumstances</i> covered by the law, <i>not when there is an enactment of another law pertaining to subjects not directly covered by the assailed law</i>. Whether factual conditions have so changed as to call for a partial or even a total abrogation of the law is a matter that rests primarily within the constitutional prerogative of Congress to determine.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[246]</sup></font> To justify a judicial nullification, the constitutional breach of a legal provision must be very clear and unequivocal, not doubtful or argumentative.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[247]</sup></font><br><br>In short, this Court can go no further than to inquire whether Congress had the power to enact a law; it cannot delve into the wisdom of policies it adopts or into the adequacy under existing conditions of measures it enacts.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[248]</sup></font> The equal protection clause is not a license for the courts “<i>to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices.</i>”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[249]</sup></font> Since <i>relative constitutionality</i> was not discussed by the parties in any of their pleadings, <b>fundamental fairness and evenhandedness still dictate that Congress be heard on this concept before the Court imposes it in a definitive ruling.</b><br><br>Just a final observation at this juncture. It seems to me that when RA 7653 was enacted, the real focus of the second paragraph of Section 15(c) of Chapter 1 of Article II of the statute was to enable the <u>officers and executives of the BSP</u> to enjoy a <u>wider scope of exemption</u> from the Compensation Classification System than that stated in the last part of Section 9 of the Salary Standardization Law. As can be gleaned from the deliberations on the bill, the mention of BSP employees with salary grade 19 and below seems to have been purely incidental in the process of defining who were part of the executive and officer corps. It appears that the “classification” (if we can call it that) of the rank and filers with salary grade 19 and below, via the challenged proviso, came about not by design. And it was only after the later pieces of legislation were promulgated affecting the charters of the LBP, GSIS, SSS, DBP, etc. that the proviso came to be considered as “discriminatory.”<br><br>In these trying times, I cannot but sympathize with the BSP rank and filers on account of the situation they have found themselves in, and I do not mean to begrudge them the opportunity to receive a higher compensation package than what they are receiving now. However, they are operating on the simplistic assumption that, being rank and file employees employed in a GFI, they are automatically entitled to the same benefits, privileges, increases and the like enjoyed by any other rank and file employee of a GFI, seeing as they are all working for one and the same government anyway.<br><br>It could also have something to do with the fact that Central Bank employees were quite well paid in the past. They may have overlooked the fact that the different GFIs are regulated by their respective charters, and are mandated to perform different functions (governmental or proprietary). Consequently, their requirements and priorities are likewise different, and differ in importance in the overall scheme of things, thus necessitating some degree of differentiation and calibration in respect of resource allocation, budgets and appropriations, and the like. <br><br>The long and short of it is that there can be no such thing as an automatic entitlement to increases in compensation, benefits and so forth, whether we consider the BSP rank and filers similarly situated along with other rank and filers of GFIs, or as being in a class by themselves. This is because the BSP is, strictly speaking, not a GFI but rather, the regulatory agency of GFIs.<br><br>The foregoing becomes even more starkly clear when mention is again made of the fiscal/budget deficit hobbling the national government, which has, not surprisingly, triggered waves of belt tightening measures throughout every part of the bureaucracy. This particular scenario puts Congress somewhat at odds with itself. On the one hand, it is studying HB 00123 with the end in view of precisely addressing the principal concern of the petitioner. On the other hand, it is also looking into how the various exemptions from the Salary Standardization Law can be rationalized or done away with, in the hope of ultimately reducing the gargantuan deficit.<br><br>Thankfully, the Court is not the one having to grapple with such a conundrum. It behooves us to give Congress, in the exercise of its constitutional mandate and prerogative, as much elbow room and breathing space as it needs in order to tackle and perhaps vanquish the many headed monster.<br><br>And while we all watch from the sidelines, we can all console ourselves and one another that after all, whether we find ourselves classified-out as BSP rank and filers, or officers and executives, or employees and members of the judiciary, we are -- all of us -- in the same boat, for we have all chosen to be in “public service,” as the term is correctly understood. And what is public service if it does not entail a certain amount of personal sacrifice on the part of each one of us, all for the greater good of our society and country. We each make our respective sacrifices, sharing in the burden today, in the hope of a better tomorrow for our children and loved ones, and our society as a whole. It makes us strong. For this we can be thankful as well.<br><br>WHEREFORE, I vote to <b><i>DISMISS</i></b> the Petition. I maintain that the last proviso of the second paragraph of Section 15(c) of Chapter 1 of Article II of Republic Act No. 7653 is constitutional. Congress should be given adequate opportunity to enact the appropriate legislation that will address the issue raised by petitioner and clear the proviso of any <i>possible</i> or <i>perceived</i> infringement of the equal protection clause. <b>At the very least, Congress and herein respondents should be given notice and opportunity to respond to the possible application of the theory of <i>relative constitutionality</i> before it is, if at all, imposed by this Court.<br><br></b><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See <i>ponencia</i> footnote nos. 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Medill v.

The majority opinion invades the legislative domain by enacting into law a bill that the 13th Congress is now considering for approval. The majority opinion does this in the guise of annulling a proviso in Section 15(c), Article II of Republic Act No. 7653 (“RA 7653”).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second,</span> the majority opinion erroneously classifies the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span> (“BSP”), a regulatory agency exercising sovereign functions, in the same category as non-regulatory corporations exercising purely commercial functions like Land Bank of the Philippines (“LBP”), Social Security System (“SSS”), Government Service Insurance System (“GSIS”), Development Bank of the Philippines (“DBP”), Small Borrowers Guarantee Fund Corporation (“SBGFC”), and Home Guarantee Corporation (“HGC”).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Usurpation of Legislative Power</span><br><br>There is a bill now pending in Congress, House Bill No. 123, seeking to exempt the rank-and-file employees of BSP from the Salary Standardization Law (“SSL”). A similar bill was filed in the 12th Congress together with the bill exempting from the SSL all officials and employees of Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (“PDIC”). The bill exempting PDIC employees from SSL was approved on 27 July 2004 in the dying days of the 12th Congress. However, due to lack of time, the bill exempting BSP rank-and-file employees did not reach third reading.<br><br>What the majority opinion wants is to preempt Congress by declaring through a judicial decision that BSP rank-and-file employees are now exempt from the SSL. The majority opinion seeks to legislate the exemption from SSL by declaring void the proviso in Section 15(c), Article II of RA 7653 (“proviso”), which states:<br><blockquote>A compensation structure, based on job evaluation studies and wage surveys and subject to the Board’s approval, shall be instituted as an integral component of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral’s</span> human resource development program: Provided, That the Monetary Board shall make its own system conform as closely as possible with the principles provided for under Republic Act No. 6758. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however</span>, That compensation and wage structure of employees whose positions fall under salary grade 19 and below shall be in accordance with the rates prescribed under Republic Act No. 6758.</span> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The majority opinion justifies its action by saying that <span style="font-weight: bold;">while the proviso was valid when first enacted, it is now invalid</span> because its continued operation is discriminatory against BSP rank-and-file employees. All officials and employees of other government financial institutions (“GFIs”) like GSIS, LBP, DBP, SSS, SBGFC, HGC and PDIC are now exempt from the SSL. Congress granted the exemptions over the years, for LBP in 1995, SSS in 1997, GSIS in 1997, SBGFC in 1997, DBP in 1998, HGC in 2000, and PDIC in 2004.<br><br>Among the GFIs granted exemption from SSL, only PDIC is a regulatory agency. PDIC received its SSL exemption only this year - 2004. <span style="font-weight: bold;">PDIC is the first regulatory GFI whose rank-and-file employees are exempt from the SSL</span>. Rank-and-file employees of BSP, a GFI exercising regulatory functions, cannot at this time claim any unreasonable or oppressive delay in securing legislative exemption from SSL, assuming Congress is disposed to grant an exemption.<br><br>At this time, this Court cannot say that the continued validity of the proviso in Section 15(c) of RA 7653 is unreasonable and oppressive on BSP rank-and-file employees. This Court cannot say that Congress gravely abused its jurisdiction in not exempting BSP rank-and-file employees from the SSL at the same time as PDIC. Congress is now considering BSP’s exemption, and this Court cannot imperiously conclude that Congress had more than enough time to act on BSP’s exemption.<br><br>Even if Congress does not act on BSP’s exemption for more than one year, it does not follow that this Court should then exempt BSP rank-and-file employees from the SSL. As the law now stands, PDIC is the only regulatory GFI whose rank-and-file employees are exempt from SSL. All other GFIs exercising regulatory functions are not exempt from the SSL, including BSP whose rank-and file employees are subject to the SSL.<br><br>The grant of exemption to PDIC is the legislative act that is questionable for being discriminatory against all other self-sustaining government agencies exercising regulatory functions. Such grant to one regulatory agency, without a similar grant to other regulatory agencies whose incomes exceed their expenses, creates a class of exemption that has dubious basis. In short, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">singular exemption</span> of PDIC from the SSL discriminates against all other self-sustaining government agencies that exercise regulatory functions.<br><br>The grant of SSL exemption to GFIs has ramifications on the deepening budget deficit of the government. Under Republic Act No. 7656<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, all GFIs are required to remit to the National Treasury at least 50% of their annual net earnings. This remittance forms part of the government revenues that fund the annual appropriations act. If the remittances from GFIs decrease, the national revenues funding the annual appropriations act correspondingly decrease. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This results in widening even more the budget deficit.</span><br><br>A bigger budget deficit means there are no revenues to fund salary increases of <span style="font-weight: bold;">all government employees</span> who are paid out of the annual appropriations act. The exemption of GFIs from SSL may delay or even prevent a general increase in the salary of all government employees, including rank-and-file employees in the judiciary. This Court cannot simply ordain an exemption from SSL without considering serious ramifications on fiscal policies of the government. This is a matter better left to the Executive and Legislative Departments. This Court cannot intrude into fiscal policies that are the province of the Executive and Legislative Departments.<br><br>Indeed, Congress should pass a law rationalizing the exemptions of all government agencies from the SSL. The piecemeal grant of exemptions is creating distortions in the salary structure of government employees similarly situated. Such rationalization, however, is not the function of the Court. Even as a practical matter, this Court does not have the necessary data to rationalize the exemptions of all government agencies from the SSL.<br><br>The power of judicial review of legislative acts presumes that Congress has enacted a law that may violate the Constitution. This Court cannot exercise its power of judicial review <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> Congress has enacted the questioned law. In this case, Congress is still considering the bill exempting BSP rank-and-file employees from the SSL. There is still no opportunity for this Court to exercise its review power because there is nothing to review.<br><br>The majority opinion, however, claims that because of the failure of Congress to enact the bill exempting BSP rank-and-file employees from the SSL, this Court should now annul the proviso in Section 15(c) of RA 7653 to totally exempt BSP from the SSL. This is no longer an exercise of the power of judicial review but an exercise of the power of legislation - a power that this Court does not possess. The power to exempt a government agency from the SSL is a legislative power, not a judicial power. By annulling a prior valid law that has the effect of exempting BSP from the SSL, this Court is exercising a legislative power.<br><br>The power of judicial review is the power to strike down an unconstitutional act of a department or agency of government, not the power to initiate or perform an act that is lodged in another department or agency of government. If this Court strikes down the law exempting PDIC from the SSL because it is discriminatory against other government agencies similarly situated, this Court is exercising its judicial review power. The effect is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">revert PDIC to its previous situation</span> of being subject to the SSL, the same situation governing BSP and other agencies similarly situated.<br><br>However, by annulling the proviso in Section 15(c) of RA 7653, <span style="font-weight: bold;">BSP is not reverted to its previous situation but brought to a new situation that BSP cannot attain without a new legislation</span>. Other government agencies similarly situated as BSP remain in their old situation – still being subject to the SSL. This is not an annulment of a legislative act but an enactment of legislation exempting one agency from the SSL without exempting the remaining agencies similarly situated.<br><br>The majority opinion cites <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Rutter v. Esteban</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> as precedent for declaring the proviso in Section 15(c) of RA 7653 unconstitutional. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Rutter</span> is not applicable to the present case. In Rutter, the Court declared on 18 May 1953 that while the Debt Moratorium Law was valid when enacted on 26 July 1948, its “continued operation and enforcement x x x is unreasonable and oppressive, and should not be prolonged a minute longer.” With the discontinuance of the effectivity of the Debt Moratorium Law, the debtors who benefited from the law were returned to their <span style="font-weight: bold;">original situation</span> prior to the enactment of the law. This meant that the creditors could resume collecting from the debtors the debts the payment of which was suspended by the Debt Moratorium Law. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The creditors and debtors were restored to their original situation before the enactment of the Debt Moratorium Law. No debtor or creditor was placed in a new situation that required the enactment of a new law</span>.<br><br>In the present case, declaring the proviso in Section 15(c) of RA 7653 no longer legally effective <span style="font-weight: bold;">does not restore the BSP rank-and-file employees to their original situation,</span> which subjected them to the SSL. Instead, the discontinuance of the validity of the proviso brings the BSP rank-and-file employees to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">new situation that they are not entitled without the enactment of a new law</span>. The effect of the majority decision is to legislate a new law that brings the BSP rank-and–file employees to a new situation. Clearly, the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Rutter</span> doctrine does not apply to the present case.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Erroneous Classification of BSP as GFI</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Similar to LBP, DBP and Others</span><br><br>The majority opinion classifies BSP as a GFI just like GSIS, LBP, DBP, SSS, SBGFC, HGC and PDIC. Here lies the basic error of the majority opinion. <span style="font-weight: bold;">GSIS, LBP, DBP, SSS, SBGFC and HGC are GFIs but are not regulatory agencies. BSP and PDIC are GFIs but are also regulatory agencies just like other governmental regulatory agencies.</span> The majority opinion is comparing apples with oranges. GFIs that do not exercise regulatory functions operate just like commercial financial institutions. However, GFIs that exercise regulatory functions, like BSP and PDIC, are unlike commercial financial institutions. BSP and PDIC exercise sovereign functions unlike the other non-regulatory GFIs.<br><br>Non-regulatory GFIs derive their income <span style="font-weight: bold;">solely</span> from commercial transactions. They compete head on with private financial institutions. Their operating expenses, including employees’ salaries, come from their own <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-generated income from commercial activities</span>. However, regulatory GFIs like BSP and PDIC derive their income from <span style="font-weight: bold;">fees, charges and other impositions that all banks are by law required to pay</span>. Regulatory GFIs have no competitors in the private sector. Obviously, BSP and PDIC do not belong to the same class of GFIs as LBP, SSS, GSIS, SBGFC, DBP and HGC.<br><br>Exempting non-regulatory GFIs from the SSL is justified because these GFIs operate just like private commercial entities. Their revenues, from which they pay the salaries of their employees, come solely from commercial operations. <span style="font-weight: bold;">None of their revenues comes from mandatory government exactions.</span> This is not the case of GFIs like BSP and PDIC which impose regulatory fees and charges.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span><br><br>Under the Constitution, Congress is an independent department that is a co-equal of the Supreme Court. This Court has always accorded Congress the great respect that it deserves under the Constitution. The power to legislate belongs to Congress. The power to review enacted legislation belongs to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has no power to declare a pending bill in Congress as deemed enacted into law. That is not the power to review legislation but the power to usurp a legislative function.<br><br>The majority opinion is leading this Court into usurping the primary jurisdiction of Congress to enact laws. The majority opinion brings this Court and Congress into a needless clash of powers - whether the power of judicial review of legislative acts includes the power to initiate legislative acts if this Court becomes impatient with the pace of legislative process. Clearly, this Court does not have the power to legislate. Congress has a right to guard zealously its primary power to enact laws as much as this Court has a right to guard zealously its power to review enacted legislations.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to dismiss the petition.<br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Sections 2 and 3 of Republic Act No. 7656 provide:<br><br>Section 3.

No. 6758 (the Salary Standardization Law), amending Presidential Decree No. 985 (the Old Salary Standardization Law), was enacted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in response to the mandate to provide for a standardized compensation scale for all government employees, including those employed in GOCCs, under Section 5, Article IX-B, of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5.

Moreover, through court decisions and the opinions of the Secretary of Justice, the so-called proprietary corporations are no longer subject to the Plans Through collective bargaining, employees of government corporations have been able to secure not only higher salaries but liberal fringe benefits as well. As revealed by the 1970 Presidential Committee to Study Corporate Salary Scales, the average compensation in some of these corporations, using the average compensation of positions covered by the WAPCO Plans as base (100%), is as follows: DBP - 203%, CB - 196%, GSIS -147%, SSS -150%, and NWSA - 111%.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the stated policy behind the Salary Standardization Law is to provide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions, while giving due regard to, among others, prevailing rates in the private sector for comparable work:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2.

Definition of Terms. — As used in this Decree, the following shall mean:<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>c. Class (of position) — The basic unit of the Position Classification System. A class consists of all those positions in the system which are sufficiently similar as to (1) kind or subject matter of work, (2) level of difficulty and responsibility, and (3) the qualification requirements of the work, to warrant similar treatment in personnel and pay administration.<br><br>d. Class Specification or Standards — A written description of a class of position(s). It distinguishes the duties, responsibilities and qualification requirements of positions in a given class from those of other classes in the Position Classification System.<br><br>e. Classification — The act of arranging positions according to broad occupational groupings and determining differences of classes within each group.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>g. Compensation or Pay System — A system for determining rates of pay for positions and employees based on equitable principles to be applied uniformly to similar cases. It consists, among others, of the Salary and Wage Schedules for all positions, and the rules and regulations for its administration.<br><br>h. Grade — Includes all classes of positions which, although different with respect to kind or subject matter of work, are sufficiently equivalent as to level of difficulty and responsibility and level of qualification requirements of the work to warrant the inclusion of such classes of positions within one range of basic compensation.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>m. Position — A set of duties and responsibilities, assigned or delegated by competent authority and performed by an individual either on full-time or part-time basis. A position may be filled or vacant.<br><br>n. Position Classification — The grouping of positions into classes on the basis of similarity of kind and level of work, and the determination of the relative worth of those classes of positions.<br><br>o. Position Classification System — A system for classifying positions by occupational groups, series and classes, according to similarities or differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements. It consists of (1) classes and class specifications and (2) the rules and regulations for its installation and maintenance and for the interpretation, amendment and alternation of the classes and class specifications to keep pace with the changes in the service and the positions therein.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>q. Reclassification or Reallocation — A change in the classification of a position either as a result of a change in its duties and responsibilities sufficient to warrant placing the position in a different class, or as result of a reevaluation of a position without a significant change in duties and responsibilities.<br><br>r. Salary or Wage Adjustment — A salary or wage increase towards the minimum of the grade, or an increase from a non-prescribed rate to a prescribed rate within the grade.<br><br>s. Salary or Wage Grade — The numerical place on the salary or Wage Schedule representing multiple steps or rates which is assigned to a class.<br><br>t. Salary or Wage Schedule — A numerical structure in the Compensation System consisting of several grades, each grade with multiple steps with a percentage differential throughout the pay table. A classified position is assigned a corresponding grade in the Schedule.<br><br>u. Salary or Wage Step Increment — An increase in salary or wage from one step to another step within the grade from the minimum to maximum. Also known as within grade increase.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center></blockquote>At the same time, Section 16 of the Salary Standardization Law <u>expressly repealed</u> all laws, decrees, executive orders, corporate charters, and other issuances or parts thereof that exempted government agencies, including GOCCs and GFIs from the coverage of the new Compensation and Position Classification System:<br><blockquote>Sec. 16.

Thus, if any reasonable basis may be conceived which supports the statute, the same should be upheld. Consequently, the burden is squarely on the shoulders of the one alleging unconstitutionality to prove invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt by negating all possible bases for the constitutionality of a statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Verily, to doubt is to sustain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><i><br><br></i>The rationale for this presumption in favor of constitutionality and the corresponding restraint on the part of the judicial branch was expounded upon by Justice Laurel in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.

"The question of the validity of every statute is first determined by the legislative department of the government itself." (U. S. vs. Ten Yu [1912], 24 Phil., 1, 10; Case vs. Board of Health and Heiser [1913], 24 Phil., 250, 276; U. S. vs. Joson [1913], 26 Phil., 1.) And a statute finally comes before the courts sustained by the sanction of the executive. <b>The members of the Legislature and the Chief Executive have taken an oath to support the Constitution and it must be presumed that they have been true to this oath and that in enacting and sanctioning a particular law they did not intend to violate the Constitution. The courts cannot but cautiously exercise its power to overturn the solemn declarations of two of the three grand departments of the government.</b> (6 R. C. L., p. 101.) Then, <b><u>there is that peculiar political philosophy which bids the judiciary to reflect the wisdom of the people as expressed through an elective Legislature and an elective Chief Executive.

Feeney</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> is illuminating:<i><br></i><blockquote>The equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the States all power of classification. <b>Most laws classify, and many affect certain groups unevenly, even though the law itself treats them no differently from all other members of the class described by the law.</b> When the basic classification is rationally based, uneven effects upon particular groups within a class are ordinarily of no constitutional concern. <b>The calculus of effects, the manner in which a particular law reverberates in a society is a legislative and not a judicial responsibility.</b> In assessing an equal protection challenge, a court is called upon only to measure the basic validity of the legislative classification. <b>When some other independent right is not at stake and when there is no "reason to infer antipathy," it is presumed that "even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process</b> ...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Hence, in enacting laws, the legislature is accorded the widest scope of discretion within the bounds of the Constitution; and the courts, in exercising their power of judicial review, do not inquire into the wisdom of the law.

On the other hand, courts, although zealous guardians of individual liberty and right, have nevertheless evinced a reluctance to interfere with the exercise of the legislative prerogative.

Arbitrariness in general may be challenged on the basis of the due process clause. But if the particular act assailed partakes of an unwarranted partiality or prejudice, the sharper weapon to cut it down is the equal protection clause.<br><br>According to a long line of decisions, <b>equal protection simply requires that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed.

The Senate Report declared: "Public policy demands an end to the food stamp subsidization of all strikers who become eligible for the program solely through the temporary loss of income during a strike. Union strike funds should be responsible for providing support and benefits to strikers during labor-management disputes." It was not part of the purposes of the Food Stamp Act to establish a program that would serve as a weapon in labor disputes; the Act was passed to alleviate hunger and malnutrition and to strengthen the agricultural economy. The Senate Report stated that "allowing strikers to be eligible for food stamps has damaged the program's public integrity" and thus endangers these other goals served by the program. Congress acted in response to these problems.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>It is true that in terms of the scope and extent of their ineligibility for food stamps, § 109 is harder on strikers than on "voluntary quitters." But the concern about neutrality in labor disputes does not arise with respect to those who, for one reason or another, simply quit their jobs. As we have stated in a related context, even if the statute "provides only 'rough justice,' its treatment ... is far from irrational." <b>Congress need not draw a statutory classification to the satisfaction of the most sharp-eyed observers in order to meet the limitations that the Constitution imposes in this setting. And we are not authorized to ignore Congress' considered efforts to avoid favoritism in labor disputes, which are evidenced also by the two significant provisos contained in the statute.</b> The first proviso preserves eligibility for the program of any household that was eligible to receive stamps "immediately prior to such strike." The second proviso makes clear that the statutory ineligibility for food stamps does not apply "to any household that does not contain a member on strike, if any of its members refuses to accept employment at a plant or site because of a strike or lockout."

Surely, whether the corpse comes from without or within the City limits, and whether interment is to be made in private or public cemeteries, the City police must regulate traffic, and must use their City cars or motorcycles to maintain order; and the City streets must suffer some degree of erosion.

In analyzing the questioned legislative classification, the Court concluded that the only reasonable criteria for classification vis-à-vis the grant of the franking privilege was "the perceived need of the grantee for the accommodation, which would justify a waiver of substantial revenue by the Corporation in the interest of providing for a smoother flow of communication between the government and the people."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court then went on to state that:<br><blockquote>Assuming that basis, we cannot understand why, of all the departments of the government, it is the Judiciary that has been denied the franking privilege. There is no question that if there is any major branch of the government that needs the privilege, it is the Judicial Department, as the respondents themselves point out.

If it recognizes the need of the President of the Philippines and the members of Congress for the franking privilege, there is no reason why it should not recognize a similar and in fact greater need on the part of the Judiciary for such privilege. While we may appreciate the withdrawal of the franking privilege from the Armed Forces of the Philippines Ladies Steering Committee, we fail to understand why the Supreme Court should be similarly treated as that Committee. And while we may concede the need of the National Census and Statistics Office for the franking privilege, we are intrigued that a similar if not greater need is not recognized in the courts of justice.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>We are unable to agree with the respondents that Section 35 of R.A.

On the contrary, we find its repealing clause to be a discriminatory provision that denies the Judiciary the equal protection of the laws guaranteed for all persons or things similarly situated. The distinction made by the law is superficial. It is not based on substantial distinctions that make real differences between the Judiciary and the grantees of the franking privilege.<br><br>This is not a question of wisdom or power into which the Judiciary may not intrude.

Montesclaros</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> this Court ruled that the proviso in Section 18 of P.D. No.1146,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which prohibited a dependent spouse from receiving survivorship pension if such dependent spouse married the pensioner within three years before the pensioner qualified for the pension, was unconstitutional for, among others, violating the equal protection clause. Said the Court:<br><blockquote>The surviving spouse of a government employee is entitled to receive survivor's benefits under a pension system. However, statutes sometimes require that the spouse should have married the employee for a certain period before the employee's death to prevent sham marriages contracted for monetary gain. One example is the Illinois Pension Code which restricts survivor's annuity benefits to a surviving spouse who was married to a state employee for at least one year before the employee's death. The Illinois pension system classifies spouses into those married less than one year before a member's death and those married one year or more. The classification seeks to prevent conscious adverse risk selection of deathbed marriages where a terminally ill member of the pension system marries another so that person becomes eligible for benefits. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Sneddon v. The State Employee's Retirement System of Illinois</span>, the Appellate Court of Illinois held that such classification was based on difference in situation and circumstance, bore a rational relation to the purpose of the statute, and was therefore not in violation of constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.<br><br>A statute based on reasonable classification does not violate the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the law. The requirements for a valid and reasonable classification are: (1) it must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) it must be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) it must apply equally to all members of the same class. Thus, the law may treat and regulate one class differently from another class provided there are real and substantial differences to distinguish one class from another.<br><br>The proviso in question does not satisfy these requirements. The proviso discriminates against the dependent spouse who contracts marriage to the pensioner within three years before the pensioner qualified for the pension. Under the proviso, even if the dependent spouse married the pensioner more than three years before the pensioner's death, the dependent spouse would still not receive survivorship pension if the marriage took place within three years before the pensioner qualified for pension. The object of the prohibition is vague. There is no reasonable connection between the means employed and the purpose intended. The law itself does not provide any reason or purpose for such a prohibition. If the purpose of the proviso is to prevent "<span style="font-style: italic;">deathbed marriages</span>," then we do not see why the proviso reckons the three-year prohibition from the date the pensioner qualified for pension and not from the date the pensioner died. The classification does not rest on substantial distinctions. Worse, the classification lumps all those marriages contracted within three years before the pensioner qualified for pension as having been contracted primarily for financial convenience to avail of pension benefits.

Cleburne Living Center,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> a city's zoning ordinance requiring a special permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded was challenged on equal protection grounds. The American Court, ruling that the Rational Basis Test was applicable and limiting itself to the facts of the particular case, held that there was no rational basis for believing that the mentally retarded condition of those living in the affected group home posed any special threat to the city's legitimate interests any more than those living in boarding houses, nursing homes and hospitals, for which no special permit was required.

West Virginia</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the American Supreme Court in striking down a West Virginia statute which prohibited a "colored man" from serving in a jury, traced the roots of the Equal Protection Clause:<br><blockquote>This is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose; namely, securing to a race recently emancipated, a race that through many generations had been held in slavery, all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy. The true spirit and meaning of the amendments, as we said in the <u style="font-style: italic;">Slaughter-House Cases</u><u> (16 Wall. 36)</u>, cannot be understood without keeping in view the history of the times when they were adopted, and the general objects they plainly sought to accomplish. At the time when they were incorporated into the Constitution, it required little knowledge of human nature to anticipate that those who had long been regarded as an inferior and subject race would, when suddenly raised to the rank of citizenship, be looked upon with jealousy and positive dislike, and that State laws might be enacted or enforced to perpetuate the distinctions that had before existed, xxx To quote the language used by us in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Slaughter-House Cases</span>, "No one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in all the amendments, lying at the foundation of each, and without which none of them would have been suggested,--we mean the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the newly made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over them." So again: "The existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated negroes resided, which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class, was the evil to be remedied, and by it [the Fourteenth Amendment] such laws were forbidden. If, however, the States did not conform their laws to its requirements, then, by the fifth section of the article of amendment, Congress was authorized to enforce it by suitable legislation." And it was added, "We doubt very much whether any action of a State, not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes, as a class, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision."<br><br>x x x It ordains that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. What is this but declaring that the law in the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color? The words of the amendment, it is true, are prohibitory, but they contain a necessary implication of a positive immunity, or right, most valuable to the colored race,--the right to exemption from unfriendly legislation against them distinctively as colored,--exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, lessening the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy, and discriminations which are steps towards reducing them to the condition of a subject race.<br><br>That the West Virginia statute respecting juries--the statute that controlled the selection of the grand and petit jury in the case of the plaintiff in error--is such a discrimination ought not to be doubted. Nor would it be if the persons excluded by it were white men. If in those States where the colored people constitute a majority of the entire population a law should be enacted excluding all white men from jury service, thus denying to them the privilege of participating equally with the blacks in the administration of justice, we apprehend no one would be heard to claim that it would not be a denial to white men of the equal protection of the laws. Nor if a law should be passed excluding all naturalized Celtic Irishmen, would there by any doubt of its inconsistency with the spirit of the amendment. The very fact that colored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute all right to participate in the administration of the law, as jurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may be in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon them, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a stimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing to individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to secure to all others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br></blockquote>Over the years however, the Equal Protection Clause has been applied against unreasonable governmental discrimination directed at any identifiable group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In what Laurence H.

The Court apparently seeks to establish today that equal protection cases fall into one of two neat categories which dictate the appropriate standard of review--strict scrutiny or mere rationality. But this Court's decisions in the field of equal protection defy such easy categorization. A principled reading of what this Court has done reveals that it has applied a spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination allegedly violative of the Equal Protection Clause. This spectrum clearly comprehends variations in the degree of care with which the Court will scrutinize particular classifications, depending, I believe, on the constitutional and societal importance of the interest adversely affected and the recognized invidiousness of the basis upon which the particular classification is drawn. I find in fact that many of the Court's recent decisions embody the very sort of reasoned approach to equal protection analysis for which I previously argued--that is, an approach in which 'concentration (is) placed upon the character of the classification in question, the relative importance to individuals in the class discriminated against of the governmental benefits that they do not receive, and the asserted state interests in support of the classification.' <u>Dandridge v.

Thus, in assessing the validity of the classification between executive and rank and file employees in Section 15 (c) of The New Central Bank Act, the Rational Basis Test was applied. In evaluating the distinction between the rank and file employees of the BSP and the rank and file employees of the LBP, DBP, SSS and GSIS, the Strict Scrutiny Test was employed.<br><br>Despite my best efforts, I fail to see the justification for the use of this "double standard" in determining the constitutionality of the questioned proviso. Why a "deferential test" for one comparison (between the executives and rank and file of the BSP) and a "strict test" for the other (between the rank and file of the BSP and the rank and file of the other GOCCs/GFIs)?<br><br>As the preceding review of the standards developed by the U.S. Federal Supreme Court shows, the choice of the appropriate test for evaluating a legislative classification is dependent on the nature of the rights affected (<i>i.e.</i> whether "fundamental" or not) and the character of the persons allegedly discriminated against (<i>i.e.</i> whether belonging to a "suspect class" or not). As determined by these two parameters, the scope of application of each standard is distinct and exclusive of the others. Indeed, to my knowledge, the American Court has never applied more than one standard to a given set of facts, and where one standard was found to be appropriate, the U.S. Supreme Court has deliberately eschewed any discussion of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>Assuming that the equal protection standards evolved by the U.S. Supreme Court may be adopted in this jurisdiction, there is no reason why the exclusive manner of their application should not be adopted also.<br><br>In the present case, <u>the persons allegedly discriminated against</u> (<i>i.e.</i> the rank and file employees of the BSP) <u>and the rights they are asserting</u> (to be exempted from the Compensation Classification System prescribed by the Salary Standardization Law) <u>remain the same</u>, whether the classification under review is between them and the executive officers of the BSP or the rank and file employees of the LBP, DBP, SSS and GSIS.<br><br>It therefore stands to reason that the test or standard — whether Rational Basis, Strict Scrutiny or Intermediate Scrutiny - against which petitioner's claims should be measured should likewise be the same, regardless of whether the evaluation pertains to the constitutionality of (1) the classification expressly made in Section 15 (c) of The New Central Bank Act or (2) the classification resulting from the amendments of the charters of the other GOCCs/GFIs.<br><br>To illustrate further, if petitioner's constitutional challenge is premised on the denial of a "fundamental right" or the perpetuation of prejudice against a "suspect class," as suggested (but not fully explicated) in the closing pages of the main opinion; then, following the trend in American jurisprudence, the Strict Scrutiny Test would be applicable, whether the classification being reviewed is that between the officers and rank and file of the BSP or between the rank and file of the BSP and the rank and file of the other GOCCs/GFIs.<br><br>But certainly, the same group of BSP rank and file personnel cannot be considered a "non-suspect class" when compared to the BSP executive corps, but members of a "suspect class" when compared to the rank and file employees of the other GOCCs/GFIs. Neither could the rights they assert be simultaneously "fundamental" and "less than fundamental." Consequently, it would be improper to apply the Rational Basis Test as the standard for one comparison and the Strict Scrutiny Test for the other.

Thus, the main opinion holds that the "subsequent enactments, however, constitute significant changes in circumstance that considerably alter the reasonability of the continued operation of the last <i>proviso</i> of Section 15 (c), Article II of Republic Act No. 7653, and exposes the <i>proviso</i> <u>to more serious scrutiny</u>."<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> likewise invites this Court to reflect on the following questions: "Given that Congress chose to exempt other GFIs (aside the BSP) from the coverage of the SSL, can the exclusion of the rank-and-file employees of the BSP stand constitutional scrutiny in the light of the fact that Congress did not exclude the rank-and-file employees of the other GFIs? Is Congress' power to classify unbridled as to sanction unequal and discriminatory treatment, simply because the inequity manifested not instantly through a single overt act, but gradually through seven separate acts? Is the right to equal protection bounded in time and space that: (a) the right can be invoked only against classification made directly and deliberately, as opposed to discrimination that arises indirectly as a consequence of several other acts? and (b) is the legal analysis confined to determining the validity within the parameters of the statute x x x thereby proscribing any evaluation vis-à-vis the groupings or the lack thereof among several similar enactments made over a period of time?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>To clarify, it was never suggested that judicial review should be confined or limited to the questioned statute itself without considering other related laws.

As was expressed categorically by Justice Malcolm: "The presumption is all in favor of validity . . . . The action of the elected representatives of the people cannot be lightly set aside. The councilors must, in the very nature of things, be familiar with the necessities of their particular municipality and with all the facts and circumstances which surround the subject and necessitate action.

The state and debtors argue that the judicial determination of general damages in a personal injury action is based on objective criteria; therefore, the amount of the exemption is reasonable and "determined by law" under article 1, section 12.

In remanding the case to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, the U.S. Federal Supreme Court declared:<br><blockquote>The Supreme Court [of Tennessee] declined to consider the Special facts relied upon as showing that the order, and the statute as applied, were arbitrary and unreasonable; and did not pass upon the question whether the evidence sustained those findings. It held that the statute was, upon its face, constitutional; that when it was passed the state had, in the exercise of its police power, authority to impose upon railroads one-half of the cost of eliminating existing or future grade crossings; and that the court could not "any more" consider "whether the provisions of the act in question have been rendered burdensome or unreasonable by changed economic and transportation conditions," than it "could consider changed mental attitudes to determine the constitutionality or enforceability of a statute." A rule to the contrary is settled by the decisions of this Court. A statute valid as to one set of facts may be invalid as to another. <b><u>A statute valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied</u></b>.

The railroad company alleged that several changes in economic, transportation and safety conditions had occurred since these statutes were passed in 1899<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> and that, in view of these changes, it was unfair, unjust and inequitable to require railroad companies to fence their tracks to protect against livestock roaming at large without making a similar requirement for the owners of automobiles, trucks and buses carrying passengers on the unfenced public highways. In ruling that the questioned statutes violated the equal protection guaranty, the Supreme Court of Florida reasoned:<br><blockquote>It stands adjudicated that the purpose of the statutes, supra, is the protection against accidents to life and property in conducting public transportation and that such statutes are in the exercise of the police power. It cannot be questioned that those transportation companies engaged as common carriers on the public roads and those so engaged on their privately owned roads such as railroad companies, owe like duties to the public and are under like obligations for the protection against accidents to life and property in conducting such business.<br><br><b><u>It is well settled that a statute valid when enacted may become invalid by. change in conditions to which it is applied</u></b>. The allegations of the pleas are sufficient to show, and the demurrer admits, that compliance with the statute places a burden of expense on the railroad company to provide for the safety of life and property of those whom it assumes to serve which is not required to be borne by competitive motor carriers which subject the lives and property of those whom they assume to serve to greater hazards of the identical character which the railroad is required to so guard against and it is also shown that under the statutes penalties are imposed on the railway carrier in favor of individuals who are neither shippers nor passengers.<br><br>Under the statutes, as shown by the record here, the railway common carrier is not only required to carry the burden of fencing its traffic line for the protection of the persons and property it transports, while other-common carriers are not required to provide the like protection, but in addition to this, there is another gross inequality imposed by the statute, viz: <b>Under the statutes the plaintiff to whom the carrier, as such, was under no obligations, was allowed to recover double the value of the animal killed, plus $50 as attorney's fees, and was not required to prove any act of negligence on the part of the carrier in the operation of its equipment, while if a common carrier bus or truck had by the operation of its equipment killed the same animal in the same locality, the plaintiff would have been required to prove negligence in the operation of the equipment and the common carrier would have been liable only for the value of the animal.

The Kentucky Supreme Court, following the rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Nashville</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlantic Coast, </span>adjudged the questioned statute to be unconstitutional, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span><br><blockquote>The present statute which places the duty upon a railroad company to prove it was free from negligence in killing an animal upon its track is an act of 1893.

In <u>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v.

We can see it and feel it as we gaze around to observe the wave of reconstruction and rehabilitation that has swept the country since liberation thanks to the aid of America and the innate progressive spirit of our people. This aid and this spirit have worked wonders in so short a time that it can now be safely stated that in the main the financial condition of our country and our people, individually and collectively, has practically returned to normal notwithstanding occasional reverses caused by local dissidence and the sporadic disturbance of peace and order in our midst. Business, industry and agriculture have picked up and developed at such stride that we can say that we are now well on the road to recovery and progress.

Nor, to my knowledge, are there any relevant <u>factual changes</u> of which this Court may take judicial knowledge. Hence, it is difficult to see how relative constitutionality may be applied to the instant petition.<br><br>Moreover, even if such factual changes were alleged and proved or judicially discoverable, still there is <u>absolutely nothing</u> in any of the cases above-cited which would justify the <u>simultaneous application</u> of both the Rational Basis Test and the Strict Scrutiny Test.

However, these subsequent amendments <u>do not</u> constitute <u>factual</u> changes in the context of relative constitutionality. Rather, they involve <u>subsequent legislative classifications</u> which should be evaluated in accordance with the appropriate standard.<br><br>To assess the validity of the questioned proviso in the light of subsequent legislation, all that need be applied is the familiar rule that statutes that are in <span style="font-style: italic;">pari materia</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[155]</sup></font> should be read together. As this Court declared in <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Naga v.

It will also be noted that Section 2309 of the Revised Administrative Code and Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act) refer to the same subject matter — enactment and effectivity of a tax ordinance. In this respect they can be considered in <span style="font-style: italic;">pari materia</span>. <u><b>Statutes are said to be in <span style="font-style: italic;">pari materia</span> when they relate to the same person or thing, or to the same class of persons or things, or have the same purpose or object</b></u><b>. When statutes are in <span style="font-style: italic;">pari materia</span>, the rule of statutory construction dictates that they should be construed together. This is because <u>enactments of the same legislature on the same subject matter are supposed to form part of one uniform system</u>; that later statutes are supplementary or complimentary to the earlier enactments and in the passage of its acts the legislature is supposed to have in mind the existing legislation on the same subject and to have enacted its new act with reference thereto. Having thus in mind the previous statutes relating to the same subject matter, whenever the legislature enacts a new law, it is deemed to have enacted the new provision in accordance with the legislative policy embodied in those prior statutes unless there is an express repeal of the old and they all should be construed together.</b><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[157]</sup></font> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, it can be said that the Salary Standardization Law, the New Central Bank Act, and the amended charters of the other GOCCs and GFIs are in <span style="font-style: italic;">pari materia</span> insofar as they pertain to <u>compensation and position classification system(s)</u> covering <u>government employees</u>. Consequently, the provisions of these statutes concerning compensation and position classification, including the legislative classifications made therein, should all be read and evaluated together in the light of the equal protection clause. Consequently, the relevant question is whether these statutes, taken together as one uniform system of compensation for government employees, comply with the requisites of the equal protection guaranty.<br><br><b>Rational Basis Test Appropriate to the<br>Case at Bar</b><i><br><br></i>Turning then to the determination of the standard appropriate to the issues presented by the instant petition, it is immediately apparent that Intermediate Scrutiny, inasmuch as its application has been limited only to classifications based on gender and illegitimacy, finds no application to the case at bar.<br><br>The choice of the appropriate standard is thus narrowed between Strict Scrutiny and the Rational Basis Test. As has been observed, Strict Scrutiny has been applied in the American context when a legislative classification intrudes upon a fundamental right or classifies on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic.<br><br>Strict Scrutiny cannot be applied in the case at bar since nowhere in the petition does petitioner allege that Article II, Section 15 (c) of the New Central Bank Act burdens a fundamental right of its members. The petition merely states that "the proviso in question <b>violates <u>the right to equal protection of the laws</u> of the BSP rank and file employees</b> who are members of the petitioner."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[158]</sup></font> While it is true that the Equal Protection Clause is found in the Bill of Rights of both the American and Philippine Constitutions, for strict scrutiny to apply there must be a violation of a Constitutional right other than the right to equal protection of the laws.

While Section 3 of Article XIII enumerates the seven basic rights of workers - the right to organize, the right to conduct collective bargaining or negotiation with management, the right to engage in peaceful concerted activities including the right to strike in accordance with law, the right to enjoy security of tenure, the right to work under humane conditions, the right to receive a living wage, and the right to participate in policy and decision-processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law - I fail to see how Article II, Section 15 (c) of the New Central Bank Act can impinge on any of these seven rights.<br><br>Another reason why Strict Scrutiny is inappropriate is the absence of a classification which is based on an inherently suspect characteristic. There is no suspect class involved in the case at bar. By no stretch of the imagination can the rank and file employees of the BSP be considered a suspect class - a class saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process. As examined earlier, in applying this definition of suspect class, the U.S. Supreme Court has labeled very few classifications as suspect. In particular, the Court has limited the term suspect class to classifications based on race or national origin, alienage and religion. It is at once apparent that Article II, Section 15 (c) of the New Central Bank Act, in exempting the BSP officers from the coverage of the Salary Standardization Law and not exempting the rank and file employees of the BSP, does not classify based on race, national origin, alienage or religion.<br><br>The main opinion however seeks to justify the application of Strict Scrutiny on the theory that the rank and file employees of the BSP constitute a suspect class "considering that majority (if not all) of the rank and file employees consist of people whose status and rank in life are less and limited, especially in terms of job marketability, it is they - and not the officers - who have the real economic and financial need for the adjustment." The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia </span>concludes that since the challenged proviso operates on the basis of the salary grade or office-employee status a distinction based on economic class and status is created.<br><br>With all due respect, the main opinion fails to show that financial need is an inherently suspect trait. The claim that the rank and file employees of the BSP are an economically disadvantaged group is unsupported by the facts on record. Moreover, as priorly discussed, classifications based on financial need have been characterized by the U.S. Supreme Court as not suspect. Instead, the American Court has resorted to the Rational Basis Test.<br><br>The case of <span style="font-style: italic;">San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[164]</sup></font> is instructive. In the said case, the financing of public elementary and secondary schools in Texas is a product of state and local participation. Almost half of the revenues are derived from a largely state-funded program designed to provide a basic minimum educational offering in every school. Each district supplements state aid through an ad valorem tax on property within its jurisdiction. A class action suit was brought on behalf of school children said to be members of poor families who reside in school districts having a low property tax base. They argue that the Texas system's reliance on local property taxation favors the more affluent and violates the equal protection clause because of substantial inter-district disparities in per pupil expenditures resulting primarily from differences in the value of assessable property among the districts. The Court held that wealth discrimination alone does not provide adequate basis for invoking strict scrutiny.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[165]</sup></font><br><blockquote>The wealth discrimination discovered by the District Court in this case, and by several other courts that have recently struck down school-financing laws in other States, is quite unlike any of the forms of wealth discrimination heretofore reviewed by this Court. Rather than focusing on the unique features of the alleged discrimination, the courts in these cases have virtually assumed their findings of a suspect classification through a <b><u>simplistic process of analysis: since, under the traditional systems of financing public schools, some poorer people receive less expensive educations than other more affluent people, these systems discriminate on the basis of wealth</u>. This approach largely ignores the hard threshold questions, including whether it makes a difference for purposes of consideration under the Constitution that the class of disadvantaged 'poor' cannot be identified or defined in customary equal protection terms, and whether the relative--rather than absolute--nature of the asserted deprivation is of significant consequence.</b> Before a State's laws and the justifications for the classifications they create are subjected to strict judicial scrutiny, we think these threshold considerations must be analyzed more closely than they were in the court below.<br><br><b>The case comes to us with no definitive description of the classifying facts or delineation of the disfavored class.</b> Examination of the District Court's opinion and of appellees' complaint, briefs, and contentions at oral argument suggests, however, at least three ways in which the discrimination claimed here might be described. <b>The Texas system of school financing might be regarded as discriminating (1) against 'poor' persons whose incomes fall below some identifiable level of poverty or who might be characterized as functionally 'indigent, or (2) against those who are relatively poorer than others, or (3) against all those who, irrespective of their personal incomes, happen to reside in relatively poorer school districts.</b> Our task must be to ascertain whether, in fact, the Texas system has been shown to discriminate on any of these possible bases and, if so, whether the resulting classification may be regarded as suspect.<br><br>The precedents of this Court provide the proper starting point. <b>The individuals, or groups of individuals, who constituted the class discriminated against in our prior cases shared two distinguishing characteristics: <u>because of their impecunity they were completely unable to pay for some desired benefit, and as a consequence, they sustained an absolute deprivation of a meaningful opportunity to enjoy that benefit</u>.</b> In <u>Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956)</u>, and its progeny the Court invalidated state laws that prevented an indigent criminal defendant from acquiring a transcript, or an adequate substitute for a transcript, for use at several stages of the trial and appeal process. The payment requirements in each case were found to occasion de facto discrimination against those who, because of their indigency, were totally unable to pay for transcripts. And the Court in each case emphasized that no constitutional violation would have been shown if the State had provided some 'adequate substitute' for a full stenographic transcript.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>Only appellees' first possible basis for describing the class disadvantaged by the Texas school-financing system--discrimination against a class of defineably 'poor' persons--might arguably meet the criteria established in these prior cases. Even a cursory examination, however, demonstrates that neither of the two distinguishing characteristics of wealth classifications can be found here. <b><u>First, in support of their charge that the system discriminates against the 'poor,' appellees have made no effort to demonstrate that it operates to the peculiar disadvantage of any class fairly definable as indigent, or as composed of persons whose incomes are beneath any designated poverty level.</u></b> Indeed, there is reason to believe that the poorest families are not necessarily clustered in the poorest property districts. xxx<br><br><b><u>Second, neither appellees nor the District Court addressed the fact that, unlike each of the foregoing cases, lack of personal resources has not occasioned an absolute deprivation of the desired benefit.</u></b> The argument here is not that the children in districts having relatively low assessable property values are receiving no public education; rather, it is that they are receiving a poorer quality education than that available to children in districts having more assessable wealth. Apart from the unsettled and disputed question whether the quality of education may be determined by the amount of money expended for it, a sufficient answer to appellees' argument is that, <b><u>at least where wealth is involved, the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages.</u></b> Nor indeed, in view of the infinite variables affecting the educational process, can any system assure equal quality of education except in the most relative sense. Texas asserts that the Minimum Foundation Program provides an 'adequate' education for all children in the State. By providing 12 years of free public-school education, and by assuring teachers, books, transportation, and operating funds, the Texas Legislature has endeavored to 'guarantee, for the welfare of the state as a whole, that all people shall have at least an adequate program of education. xxx<br><br><b>For these two reasons--<u>the absence of any evidence that the financing system discriminates against any definable category of 'poor' people or that it results in the absolute deprivation of education--the disadvantaged class is not susceptible of identification in traditional terms</u>.</b><br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>This brings us, then, to the third way in which the classification scheme might be defined--district wealth discrimination. Since the only correlation indicated by the evidence is between district property wealth and expenditures, it may be argued that discrimination might be found without regard to the individual income characteristics of district residents. Assuming a perfect correlation between district property wealth and expenditures from top to bottom, the disadvantaged class might be viewed as encompassing every child in every district except the district that has the most assessable wealth and spends the most on education. Alternatively, as suggested in Mr. Justice MARSHALL'S dissenting opinion the class might be defined more restrictively to include children in districts with assessable property which falls below the statewide average, or median, or below some other artificially defined level.<br><br><b>However described, it is clear that appellees' suit asks this Court to extend its most exacting scrutiny to review a system that allegedly discriminates against a large, diverse, and amorphous class, <u>unified only by the common factor of residence in districts that happen to have less taxable wealth than other districts. The system of alleged discrimination and the class it defines have none of the traditional indicia of suspectness: the class is not saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process</u>.</b><br><br>We thus conclude that the Texas system does not operate to the peculiar disadvantage of any suspect class. But in recognition of the fact that <b><u>this Court has never heretofore held that wealth discrimination alone provides an adequate basis for invoking strict scrutiny,</u></b> appellees have not relied solely on this contention. x x x<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[166]</sup></font> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations and footnotes omitted)<i><br></i></blockquote>To further bolster the theory that a classification based on financial need is inherently suspect, the main opinion cites a number of international conventions as well as foreign and international jurisprudence, but to no avail.<br><br>The reliance by the main opinion on these international conventions is misplaced. The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> cites the American Convention on Human Rights, the African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter of 1996 and the Arab Charter on Human Rights of 1994. It should be noted that the Philippines is not a signatory to any of these conventions.<br><br>The main opinion also cites the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. While it is true that these instruments which the Philippines is a party to include provisions prohibiting discrimination, none of them explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of financial need.<br><br>While certain conventions mention that distinctions based on "other status" is prohibited, the scope of this term is undefined. Even Gay Moon, on whom the main opinion relies, explains thus:<br><blockquote>The [UN Human Rights] Committee provides little guidance on how it decides whether a difference in treatment comes within the rubric of "other status". Its approach to this issue lacks consistency and transparency.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[167]</sup></font><br></blockquote>Furthermore, the U.K. cases cited in the main opinion are not in point since these cases do not support the thesis that classification based on financial need is inherently suspect. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Hooper v. Secretary of State for Work and Pension</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[168]</sup></font> the discrimination in question was based on gender, that is, whether the widowers are entitled to the pension granted by the State to widows. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. United Kingdom</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[169]</sup></font> the discrimination was based on sex and race; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Wilson and Others v. United Kingdom</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[170]</sup></font> the questioned law allows employers to discriminate against their employees who were trade union members.<br><br>Notably, the main opinion, after discussing lengthily the developments in equal protection analysis in the United States and Europe, and finding no support thereto, incongruously concluded that "in resolving constitutional disputes, this Court should not be beguiled by foreign jurisprudence some of which are hardly applicable because they have been dictated by different constitutional settings and needs."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[171]</sup></font> After an excessive dependence by the main opinion to American jurisprudence it contradicted itself when it stated that "American jurisprudence and authorities, much less the American Constitution, are of dubious application for these are no longer controlling within our jurisdiction and have only limited persuasive merit."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[172]</sup></font><br><br><b>Intrinsic Constitutionality of Section 15(c)<br>of the New Central Bank Act</b><br><br>Is the classification between the officers and rank and file employees in Section 15 (c) of the New Central Bank Act in violation of the equal protection clause?<br><br>Petitioner, contending that there are no substantial distinctions between these two groups of BSP employees, argues that it is.<br><br>On the other hand, the main opinion, applying the Rational Basis Test, finds the classification between the executive level and the rank and file of the BSP to be based on substantial and real differences which are germane to the purpose of the law. Thus, it concludes:<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, it is clear in the legislative deliberations that the exemption of officers (SG 20 and above) from the SSL was intended to address the BSP's lack of competitiveness in terms of attracting competent officers and executives. It was not intended to discriminate against the rank-and-file. If the end-result did in fact lead to a disparity of treatment between the officers and the rank-and-file in terms of salaries and benefits, the discrimination or distinction has a rational basis and is not palpably, purely, and entirely arbitrary in the legislative sense.<br></blockquote>and declines to grant the petition on this ground.<br><br>For her part, Justice Chico-Nazario, in her separate concurring opinion, sides with petitioner believing that the difference in treatment is "purely arbitrary" and thus violates the Constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the laws.<br><br>On this point, I am in accord with the main opinion.<br><br>For ease of reference, Section 15 (c) is reproduced hereunder:<br><blockquote>SEC. 15. <span style="font-style: italic;">Exercise of Authority</span>. — In the exercise of its authority, the Monetary Board shall:<br><center>x x x<br></center><br>(c) establish a human resource management system which shall govern the selection, hiring, appointment, transfer, promotion, or dismissal of all personnel.

Moreover, this classification must also have a rational relationship to the purpose of the New Central Bank Act.<br><br>An examination of the legislative history of the New Central Bank Act may thus prove useful.<br><br><b>Legislative History of the New<br>Central Bank Act</b><br><br>An examination of the legislative deliberations of both the House of Representatives and the Senate shows that it was never the intention of both houses to provide all BSP personnel with a blanket exemption from the coverage of the Salary Standardization Law.<br><br>Thus, while House Bill No. 7037 (the House of Representatives version of the New Central Bank Act) did not expressly mention that the Salary Standardization Law was to apply to a particular category of BSP employees, the deliberations in the lower house show that the position and compensation plans which the BSP was authorized to adopt were to be in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws, including the Salary Standardization Law:<br><blockquote>MR. JAVIER (E.). No, Mr. Speaker, we have that phrase in Section 14 (c).

ARROYO. To cut the argument short, Mr. Speaker, in effect, he is now saying that the proposed bill will authorize the Bangko Sentral to fix its own salary scale for its employees?<br><br>MR. JAVIER (E.). That is correct, Mr. Speaker, but in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws.<br><br>MR. ARROYO. I am only asking if it will be able to fix its own salary scale.<br><br>MR.

LACSON. <b>Mr. Speaker, Section 12 mentions only the remuneration of the governor and the members of the monetary board.</b><br><br>MR.

But these are matters pertaining to the wisdom of the legislative classification and not to its constitutional validity as measured against the requirements of the equal protection clause. As this Court stated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichong v. Hernandez</span>:<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[183]</sup></font><br><blockquote>x x x <b><u>Some may disagree with the wisdom of the legislature's classification. To this we answer, that this is the prerogative of the law-making power</u>. Since the Court finds that the classification is actual, real and reasonable, and all persons of one class are treated alike, and as it cannot be said that the classification is patently unreasonable and unfounded,</b> it is on duty bound to declare that the legislature acted within its legitimate prerogative and it cannot declare that the act transcends the limit of equal protection established by the Constitution.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[184]</sup></font> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>At this juncture, it is curious to note that while the main opinion initially states that the classification contained in Section 15 (c) of the New Central Bank Act "has a rational basis and is not palpably, purely, and entirely arbitrary in the legislative sense," and is thus valid on its face; the same opinion subsequently opines that:<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, <b>the challenged <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso </span>operates on the basis of salary grade or officer-employee status. <u>It is a distinction based on economic class and status</u>,</b> with the higher grades as recipients of a benefit specifically withheld from the lower grades. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Significantly, petitioner never advanced this argument anywhere in its pleadings. Moreover, there is absolutely nothing in the pleadings or records of this petition to suggest that: (1) petitioner's members belong to a separate economic class than those with SG 20 and above; and (2) that the distinction between the officers and the rank and file in Section 15(c) is based on such economic status.<br><br>What is more, the foregoing statement flies in the face of a basis of classification well-established in our law and jurisprudence.<br><br>Indeed, the distinction between "officers" and "employees" in the government service was clearly established as early as 1917 with the enactment of the Old Revised Administrative Code and later incorporated into the language of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>In terms of personnel, the system includes both "officers and employees." The distinction between these two types of government personnel is expressed by Section 2 of the Old Revised Administrative Code (1917) thus:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Employee</span>, when generally used in reference to persons in the public service, includes any person in the service of the Government or any branch thereof of whatever grade or class. <b><span style="font-style: italic;">Officer,</span> as distinguished from  or <span style="font-style: italic;">clerkemployee</span>, refers to those officials whose duties, not being of a clerical or manual nature, may be considered to involve the exercise of discretion in the performance of the functions of government, whether such duties are precisely defined by law or not.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Officer,</span> when used with reference to a person having authority to do a particular act or perform a particular function in the exercise of governmental power, shall include any Government employee, agent, or body having authority to do the act or exercise of the function in question.<br></blockquote><b>It is in these senses that the terms "officers and employees" are used in the Constitution and it is this sense which should also be applied, <span style="font-style: italic;">mutatis mutandis,</span> to officers and employees of government-owned and or controlled corporations with original charter.</b><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[185]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Clearly, classification on the basis of salary grade or between officers and rank and file employees within the civil service are intended to be rationally and objectively based on merit, fitness and degree of responsibility, and not on economic status. As this Court summarized in <span style="font-style: italic;">Rodrigo v. Sandiganbayan:</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[186]</sup></font><br><blockquote>Section 5, Article IX-C of the Constitution provides that:<br><br>The Congress shall provide for the standardization of compensation of government officials and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, taking into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required for their positions.<br><br>This provision is not unique to the 1987 Constitution. The 1973 Constitution, in Section 6, Article XII thereof, contains a very similar provision pursuant to which then President Marcos, in the exercise of his legislative powers, issued Presidential Decree No. 985.<br><br>However, with the advent of the new Constitution, and in compliance therewith, Congress enacted R.A. No. 6758. Section 2 thereof declares it the policy of the State "to provide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions."<br><br>To give life to this policy, as well as the constitutional prescription to "(take) into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required" for the positions of government officials and employees, Congress adopted the scheme employed in P.D. No. 985 for classifying positions with comparable responsibilities and qualifications for the purpose of according such positions similar salaries. This scheme is known as the "Grade," defined in P.D. No. 985 as:<br><blockquote>Includ[ing] all classes of positions which, although different with respect to kind or subject matter of work, are sufficiently equivalent as to level of difficulty and responsibilities and level of qualification requirements of the work to warrant the inclusion of such classes of positions within one range of basic compensation.<br></blockquote>The Grade is therefore a means of grouping positions "sufficiently equivalent as to level of difficulty and responsibilities and level of qualification requirements of the work" so that they may be lumped together in "<u>one range</u> of basic compensation."<br><br>Thus, Congress, under Section 8 of R.A. No. 6758, fixed the Salary Grades of officials holding constitutional positions, as follows xxx<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>x x x Congress delegated the rest of this tedious task (of fixing Salary Grades) to the DBM, subject to the standards contained in R.A. No. 6758, by authorizing the DBM to "determine the officials who are of equivalent rank to the foregoing officials, where applicable," and to assign them the same Salary Grades subject to a set of guidelines found in said section.<br><br>For positions below those mentioned under Section 8, Section 9 directs the DBM to prepare the "Index of Occupational Services" guided by (a) the Benchmark Position prescribed in Section 9, and (b) the following factors:<br><blockquote>(1) the education and experience required to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position;<br><br>(2) nature and complexity of the work to be performed;<br><br>(3) the kind of supervision received;<br><br>(4) mental and/or physical strain required in the completion of the work;<br><br>(5) nature and extent of internal and external relationships;<br><br>(6) kind of supervision exercised;<br><br>(7) decision-making responsibility;<br><br>(8) responsibility for accuracy of records and reports;<br><br>(9) accountability for funds, properties and equipment; and<br><br>(10) hardship, hazard and personal risk involved in the job.<br></blockquote>Pursuant to such authority, the DBM drafted the 1989 Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades, later revised in 1997. x x x<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[187]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In view of the foregoing, the statement in the latter portion of the main opinion to the effect that the classification between the officers and the rank and file of the BSP is founded on economic status, and not on the level of difficulty and responsibility as well as the qualification requirements of the work to be performed, must be considered extremely suspect - a conclusion without legal or factual tether bordering on sophistry.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">En passant,</span> it may be observed that the distinction between the managerial personnel and the rank and file of the BSP in the New Central Bank Act is similar to the distinction between Justices, Judges and those of equivalent judicial rank on the one hand and other court personnel on the other hand in R.A.

(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Following this second line of argument, it appears that petitioner bases its claim to exemption from the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law not only on (1) a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso</span> in Section 15(c) of The New Central Bank Act, which expressly places the rank and file employees of the BSP under the coverage of the former; but also on (2) an indirect assertion that the rank and file employees of the BSP are entitled to benefit from the subsequent exemptions of the rank and file personnel of certain GOCCs/GFIs from the coverage of the Salary Standardization Law.<br><br>This second argument, that the rank and file employees of the BSP may benefit from subsequent classifications in <u>other statutes pertaining to other GFI employees</u>, on the theory that the former and the latter are identically or analogously situated (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>. members of the same class), is not entirely new and is apparently founded on the fourth requisite of the Rational Basis Test - that is, that <u>a reasonable classification must apply equally to all members of the same class</u>.<br><br>Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Rubio v People's Homesite &amp; Housing Corporation</span>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[193]</sup></font> the Court applied Section 76 of B.P. Blg. 337, the old Local Government Code, to benefit employees of the People's Homesite &amp; Housing Corporation who had been illegally dismissed some 23 years earlier, even though the latter were not local government employees. The Court, speaking through Justice (later Chief Justice) Andres Narvasa held:<br><blockquote>Batas Pambansa Bilang 337, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, was passed by the legislature and became effective on February 10, 1983. Section 76 thereof (under Title Four: Personnel Administration) provides as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 76. Abolition of Position. — When the position of an official or employee under the civil service is abolished by law or ordinance the official or employee so affected shall be reinstated in another vacant position without diminution of salary. Should such position not be available, the official or employee affected shall be granted a separation pay equivalent to one month salary for every year of service over and above the monetary privileges granted to officials and employees under existing law.<br></blockquote><b>To be sure, the provision on its face is apparently intended for the benefit only of officers and employees in the local political subdivisions. The Court however sees no reason why it should not be applied as well to other personnel of the government, including those in the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation, which was then considered part of the Civil Service. A contrary conclusion would make the provision questionable under the equal protection clause of the Constitution as there appears to be no substantial distinction between civil servants in the local government and those in other branches of government to justify their disparate treatment.</b> Since the petitioners are "employees under the civil service," the matter of their reinstatement to their former positions at this time should logically and justly be governed by the above cited statute although enacted many years after the abolition of their positions. And since, too, it may reasonably be assumed that reinstatement to their former positions is no longer possible, or feasible, or even desired or desirable, the petitioners or their heirs must be deemed entitled to receive the separation pay provided by said BP Blg. 337.[194] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><b>Some Basic Principles of<br>Legislative Classification</b><br><br>Considering that the thrust of petitioner's second argument is that its members belong to the <u>same class</u> as other GFI employees (such that they are also entitled to exemption from the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law), a brief discussion on legislative classification is in order.<br><br>As adverted to earlier, classification has been defined as "the grouping of persons or things similar to each other in certain particulars and different from all other in these same particulars."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup> To this may be added the following observations of Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek in their influential article<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup> on The Equal Protection of the Laws,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></sup><span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span><br><blockquote>We begin with an elementary proposition: <b>To define a class is simply to designate a quality or characteristic or trait or relation, or any combination of these, the possession of which, by an individual, determines his membership in or inclusion within the class.</b> A legislature defines a class, or "classifies," when it enacts a law applying to "all aliens ineligible for citizenship," or "all persons convicted of three felonies," or "all citizens between the ages of 19 and 25" or "foreign corporations doing business within the state."<br><br>This sense of "classify" (i.e., "to define a class") must be distinguished from the sense in which "to classify" refers to the act of determining whether an individual is a member of a particular class, that is, whether the individual possesses the traits which define the class. x x x<br><br><b>It is also elementary that membership in a class is determined by the possession of the traits which define that class.</b> Individual <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span> is a member of class <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span> if, and only if, <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span> possesses the traits which define class <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>. Whatever the defining characteristics of a class may be, every member of that class will possess those characteristics<br><br>Turning now to the reasonableness of legislative classifications, the cue is to be taken from our earlier reference to the requirement that those similarly situated be similarly treated. <b>A reasonable classification is one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not. The question is, however, what does that ambiguous and crucial phrase "similarly situated" mean? And in answering this question we must first dispose of two errors into which the Court has sometimes fallen.<br><br>First, "similarly situated" cannot mean simply "similar in the possession of the classifying trait." All members of any class are similarly situated in this respect and consequently, any classification whatsoever would be reasonable by this test.</b> x x x<br><center><br>x x x<br><br></center><b>The second error in the interpretation of the meaning of similarly situated arises out of the notion that some classes are unnatural or artificial. That is, a classification is sometimes held to be unreasonable if it includes individuals who do not belong to the same "natural" class.</b> We call this an error without pausing to fight the ancient controversy about the natural status of classes. All legislative classifications are artificial in the sense that they are artifacts, no matter what the defining traits may be. And they are all real enough for the purposes of law, whether they be the class of American citizens of Japanese ancestry, or the class of makers of margarine, or the class of stockyards receiving more than one hundred head of cattle per day, or the class of feeble-minded confined to institutions.<br><br>The issue is not whether, in defining a class, the legislature has carved the universe at a natural joint. If we want to know if such classifications are reasonable, it is fruitless to consider whether or not they correspond to some "natural" grouping or separate those who naturally belong together.<br><br>But if we avoid these two errors, where are we to look for the test of similarity of situation which determines the reasonableness of a classification? <b>The inescapable answer is that we must look beyond the classification to the purpose of the law. A reasonable classification is one which includes all persons who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law.</b><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[198]</sup></font> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Moreover, Tussman and tenBroek go on to describe the task of the courts in evaluating the reasonableness of a legislative classification:<br><blockquote><b>Since it is impossible to judge the reasonableness of a classification without relating it to the purpose of the law, the first phase of the judicial task is the identification of the law's purpose.</b> x x x<br><br><center>x x x<br><br></center>It is thus evident that the attempt to identify the purpose of a law - an attempt made mandatory by the equal protection requirement - involves the Court in the thornier aspects of judicial review. At best, the Court must uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at its face value. Wt worst, it must challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference. Having accepted or discovered the elusive "purpose" the Court must then, under the discriminatory legislation doctrine, make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and, under substantive equal protection, determine the legitimacy of the end. Only after the purpose of the law has thus been discovered and subjected to this scrutiny can the Court proceed with the classification problem.<br><br>x x x Except when the class in the law is itself defined by the mischief [to be eliminated], <b>the assertion that any particular relation holds between the [classifying trait and the purpose] is an empirical statement.</b> The mere assertion that a particular relation exists does not establish the truth of the assertion. A legislature may assert that all "three-time felons" are "hereditary criminals" and that all "hereditary criminals" are "three-time felons." But whether this is the case is a question of fact, not fiat.<br><br><b>Consequently, the Court, in determining the actual relation between the classes</b> [i.e. the classifying trait and the purpose of the law] <b>is engaged in fact-finding or in criticism of legislative fact finding.</b> Thus the Court is confronted with a number of alternative formulations of the question: 1) what is the legislative belief about the relation between the classes? and, 2) is this belief reasonable? or simply, 3) what relation exists between the two classes?<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[199]</sup></font><br></blockquote>With the foregoing in mind, the relevant question then (as regards petitioner's second line of argument) is whether in fact petitioner's members and the other GFI employees are so similarly situated as to members of a single class for purposes of compensation and position classification.<br><br><b>There is no Basis for the Classification of<br>GFI Employees as a Discrete Class, entitled<br>to "Special Treatment" with respect to<br>Compensation Classification</b><i><br><br></i>Without identifying the legislative purpose for exemption from the coverage of the Compensation Classification System mandated by the Salary Standardization Law, the main opinion concludes that the <u>classifying trait</u> among those exempted from the coverage is their <u>status as GFI employees</u>. On this basis, it would grant the instant petition upon the assumption that "there exist no substantial distinctions so as to differentiate the BSP rank and file from the other rank and file of the [other] GFIs."<br><br>The foregoing tacitly rests on the assumptions that, <u>with respect to their compensation, position classification and qualifications standards</u>, (1) the rank-and-file employees of the BSP together with the rank-and-file employees of the LBP, SSS, GSIS and DBP belong to a single class; and (2) there are no reasonable distinctions between the rank-and-file employees of the BSP and the exempted employees of the other GOCCs/GFIs.<br><br>However, these assumptions are unfounded, and the assertion that "GFIs have long been recognized as one distinct class, separate from other governmental entities" is demonstrably false.<br><br>As previously discussed, Section 2 of P.D. 985<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[200]</sup></font> cited in support of the foregoing proposition has been expressly repealed by Section 16 of Salary Standardization Law.<br><blockquote>Sec. 16. Repeal of Special Salary Laws and Regulations. — <b>All laws, decrees, executive orders, corporate charters, and other issuances or parts thereof, that exempt agencies from the coverage of the System,</b> or that authorize and fix position classification, salaries, pay rates or allowances of specified positions, or groups of officials and employees or of agencies, which are inconsistent with the System, <b>including the proviso under Section 2,</b> and Section 16 o<b>f Presidential Decree No. 985 are hereby repealed.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Moreover, neither the text nor the legislative record of the Salary Standardization Law manifests the intent to provide "favored treatment" for GOCCs and GFIs. Thus, Section 3 (b), erroneously cited by the main opinion, provides for the general principle that compensation <u>for all government personnel, whether employed in a GOCC/GFI or not</u>, should generally be comparable with that in the private sector, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. General Provisions. — The following principles shall govern the Compensation and Position Classification System of the Government:<br><br>(a) All government personnel shall be paid just and equitable wages; and while pay distinctions must necessarily exist in keeping with work distinctions, the ratio of compensation for those occupying higher ranks to those at lower ranks should be maintained at equitable levels, giving due consideration to higher percentage of increases to lower level positions and lower percentage increases to higher level positions;<br><br>(b) <b>Basic compensation for <u>all personnel in the government and government-owned or controlled corporations and financial institutions</u> shall generally be comparable with those in the private sector doing comparable work, and must be in accordance with prevailing laws on minimum wages;</b><br><br>(c) The total compensation provided for government personnel must be maintained at a reasonable level in proportion to the national budget;<br><br>(d) A review of government compensation rates, taking into account possible erosion in purchasing power due to inflation and other factors, shall be conducted periodically. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Indeed, Section 4 of the Salary Standardization Law expressly provides the general rule that GFIs, like other GOCCs and all other members of the civil service, are within the coverage of the law:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. Coverage. — <b>The Compensation and Position Classification System herein provided shall apply to all positions, appointive or elective, on full or part-time basis, now existing or hereafter created in the government, <u>including government-owned or controlled corporations and government financial institutions</u>.</b><br><br>The term "government" refers to the Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial Branches and the Constitutional Commissions and shall include all, but shall not be limited to, departments, bureaus, offices, boards, commissions, courts, tribunals, councils, authorities, administrations, centers, institutes, state colleges and universities, local government units, and the armed forces. <b>The term "government-owned or controlled corporations and financial institutions" shall include all corporations and financial institutions owned or controlled by the National Government, whether such corporations and financial institutions perform governmental or proprietary functions.</b> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, a reading of the deliberations on what eventually became the Salary Standardization Law leaves no doubt that one of its goals was to provide for a common compensation system for all so that the stark disparities in pay between employees of the GOCCs and GFIs and other government employees would be minimized if not eliminated, as the following excerpt plainly shows:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Guingona.</b> Mrs. President, the PNB and DBP transferred nonperforming assets and liabilities to the National Government in the sum of over P120 billion in 1986. They are reportedly having profits of, I think over P1 billion. They have not declared dividends so that the National Government is the one that absorbed the indebtedness. The financial institutions are enjoying clean books and increased profits. Yet, employees of these institutions are receiving far more, whereas, the employees of the National Government which absorbed the nonperforming assets are receiving less. And the Central Bank is dumping into the National Government liabilities of more than P5 billion...<br><br><b>Senator Romulo.</b> Eventually P34 billion.<br><br><b>Senator Guingona.</b> And, yet, the janitor in the Central Bank is receiving a higher rate of salary than the clerk or even the minor executives in some National Government agencies and bureaus. This does not seem just and violates the equal pay for equal work principle which the distinguished Sponsor has nobly established in the policy statement.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[201]</sup></font><br></blockquote>Thus, during the Bicameral Conference Committee deliberations, the sentiment was that exemptions from the general Compensation Classification System applicable to all government employees would be limited only to <u>key positions</u> in order not to lose these personnel to the private sector. A provision was moreover inserted empowering the President to, <u>in truly exceptional cases</u>, approve higher compensation, exceeding Salary Grade 30, to the chairman, president, general manger, and the board of directors of government-owned or controlled corporations and financial institutions:<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[202]</sup></font><br><blockquote><b>SEC.

I believe it is not strictly a proprietary function - NIA and NAWASA. But there are government corporations that are engaged in very obviously proprietary type of function. For example, transportation companies of the government; banking institution; insurance functions. <b>I feel that they have to be competitive with the private sector, not with respect to all positions.

In other words, when she said "the President may," it is the discretion of the President rather than automatic.<br><br><b>SEC.CARAGUE.</b> Yes.

No. 3844) otherwise known as the "Agrarian Reform Code" created the Land Bank which is mandated to be the financing arm of the Agrarian Reform Program of the government. More specifically, the Land Bank is tasked to be the primary government agency in the mobilization and the provision of credit to the small farmers and fisher folk sector in their various economic activities such as production, processing, storage, transport and the marketing of farm produce. Since its inception, the Land Bank has transformed into a universal bank, seeking to continually fortify the agricultural sector by delivering countryside credit and support services.<br><br>In order to continue performing its mandate of providing non-traditional banking services and developmental assistance to farmers and fishermen, Congress saw the need to strengthen the bank by introducing amendments to R.A. No. 3844. Republic Act No. 7907 (R.A. No. 7907) amended R.A. No. 3844 by strengthening the Land Bank not only for the purpose of implementing agrarian reform, but also to make it more competitive with foreign banks.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[209]</sup></font><br><br>One of the salient points of R.A. No. 7907 is the exemption of all of the Land Bank's personnel from the Salary Standardization Law, authorizing at the same time its board of directors to provide compensation, position classification system and qualification standards.<br><br>The discussion of the House of Representatives' Committee on Banks and Financial Intermediaries reveals the surrounding circumstances then prevailing, which prompted Congress to exempt the Land Bank from the Salary Standardization Law. The Committee likewise recognized the* role of the rank and file employees in fulfilling its unique task of providing credit to support the agricultural sector.<br><blockquote><b>MR. GOLEZ.</b> Madam Speaker, the points of the distinguished sponsor are very well taken. But what I would like to emphasize is that the Land Bank as already stated, is not just almost unique, it is unique. It cannot be likened to a conventional commercial bank even in the case of the Philippine National Bank where its employees can very easily move from one bank to another. An employee, an average employee in the Philippine National Bank can easily transfer to a private commercial bank and vice-versa. <b>So in fact we are witnessing almost on a daily basis these periodic transfers, piracy of executives, employees from one commercial bank to another. However, in the case of the Land Bank precisely because of its very unique operations, the very life of the viability of the Land Bank of the Philippines depends decisively and critically on its core group, which in this particular case would be the rank and file, the technical employee below the level of managers. They are not substitutable at all. They are very critical.</b> And as such, the position of this Representation, Madam Speaker, Your Honor, is that that critical role gives them the importance as well as the inherent right to be represented in the highest policy making body of the bank.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[210]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br><b>MR.

FUENTEBELLA.</b> Are we now in Section 87, your Honor?<br><br><b>MR. APOSTOL.</b> Yes.<br><br><b>MR. FUENTEBELLA. The present compensation package of the employees of the bank are no longer competitive with the banking industry. In fact, the turnover of bank personnel is concerned, I think they had a turnover of more than 127 rank and file and more than 43 or 50 officer level.</b> For the reason that the present compensation through bank officers and personnel are no longer competitive with the other banks despite the fact that there is a provision in our Constitution and this is sanctioned by existing provisions of the Civil Service, that we ma enact laws to make the position classification of certain sectors in the government comparable with the same industry. That is the reason why...<br><br><b>MR. APOSTOL.</b> Is it not that the compensation of officials and employees of the Land Bank must be similar or comparable to the salaries and compensation of government banks or financial institutions?<br><br><b>MR. FUENTEBELLA.</b> Yes. In fact, the Philippine National Bank has a better financial compensation package compared to the Land Bank.<br><br><b>MR. APOSTOL.</b> Yes, it should and it must because PNB is already privatized, Land Bank is not yet.<br><br><b>MR. FUENTEBELLA.</b> Not yet, your Honor.<br><br><b>MR. APOSTOL.</b> If the compensation package of the employees of Land Bank should be similar to PNB, then why not privatize so that Land Bank will be exempted from this...<br><br><b>MR. FUENTEBELLA.</b> Well, as I said, your Honor, in due time, we can go into that aspect of privatization. We are not closing our eyes to that possibility. But for the moment that the bank is still tasked with numerous problems, particularly on agrarian reform, and for as long as the bank has not been able to perform its major task in helping the government provide the necessary mechanisms to solve and address the problems of agrarian reform, then we cannot talk about privatization yet. Because the function of the bank is not purely for profit orientation, your Honor. Whatever profits are generated under the commercial banking transactions are channeled to the agrarian sector, which is a losing proposition actually.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[211]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<i><br></i></blockquote>Like the Land Bank, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the country's premier development bank, was also exempt from the Salary Standardization Law. Republic Act No. 8523 (RA 8523) amended Executive Order No. 81 otherwise known as the "1986 Revised Charter of the Development Bank of the Philippines" to enable DBP to effectively contribute to the nation's attainment of its socio-economic objectives and fill the gaps left by the private sector which might be unwilling or unprepared to take on critical projects and programs.<br><blockquote>The bottom line of this bill which seeks to amend the existing charter of the Development Bank of the Philippines is to enable the DBP as the country's premier development bank to effectively contribute to the nation's attainment of its socio-economic objectives, such as the alleviation of poverty, creation of employment opportunities, and provision of basic needs such as food, shelter, health and education.<br><br>Given the present state of financial intermediation and capital markets in the Philippines, economic activities and projects still remain which private financial institutions may not be willing to finance because of the risks involves. And even if some of these private institutions are willing to do so, they may not have the capability to assist such projects and activities. Development lending is much more than simply providing medium to long-term funds to economically viable projects.<br><br>The proposed DBP charter amendment will help remodel DBP in the financial community as a predominantly development bank that works closely with individuals, institutions and associations which can provide resources and other types of assistance to projects with clearly-defined development impact.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[212]</sup></font><br></blockquote>In order to achieve DBP's vision as the country's premier development bank in a rapidly growing economic environment, the legislature sought to (1) increase the authorized capital of DBP from P5 billion to P10 billion; and (2) restructure DBP's organization into one which is market-responsive, product focused, horizontally aligned, and with a lean, highly motivated work force by removing the DBP from the coverage of the Salary Standardization Law. The DBP's exemption from the Salary Standardization Law was justified by the fact that it is an institution engaged in development activities which should be given the same opportunities as the private sector to compete.[213]<br><br>The exemption from the Salary Standardization Law does not only involve banks but government entities that manage pension funds such as the SSS and the GSIS.<br><br>Republic Act No. 1161 (R.A. No. 1161) established the SSS pursuant to a state policy of providing meaningful protection to members and their beneficiaries against the hazards of disability, sickness, maternity, old age, death, and other contingencies, resulting in loss of income or financial burden. Republic Act No. 8282 amended R.A. No. 1161 by providing for better benefit packages, expansion of coverage, flexibility in investments, stiffer penalties for violators of the law, condonation of penalties of delinquent employers and the establishment of a voluntary provident fund for members.<br><br>The fund that the SSS administers comes from the compulsory remittances of the employer on behalf of his employees. The House of Representatives noted that the fund in 1996 amounted 5.5 billion dollars, the sheer enormity of which necessitated that it be exempt from the Salary Standardization Law in order for it to attract quality personnel to ensure that the funds will not be mismanaged, abused or dissipated due to the negligence of its personnel. Moreover, the SSS, like the Land Bank and the DBP, was facing a massive exodus of its personnel who were migrating to greener pastures.<br><blockquote><b>MR. VALENCIA.</b> x x x Now, the other law refers to the law on salary standardization. <b>Again, we are in a situation where we are competing for personnel with the private sector, especially the financial institutions. We compete with banks, we compete with insurance companies for people. So what happens invariably is we lost our people after we have trained them, after they have proven themselves with a track record, with the very low pay that is being given to our people. We believe that with the magnitude of the accountability that we have, (We are accountable for 5.5 billion dollars, some 132 million pesos) ah, we think that we deserve the quality of people to ensure that these funds...and the pay out by the billions of pesos in terms of benefits and we collect by the billions of pesos, we believe that the magnitude of money and accountability we have is even higher than that of the local financial institutions.</b> And the pay, for example, of the Administrator is similar to a small branch in a bank. So, I don't think our pay will be very competitive but certainly it's too low considering the accountability that is on the shoulder of the employees. If we end up with poor quality of personnel, what would happen is these funds could be mismanaged, abused or just out of pure negligence could be dissipated.<br><br><b>HON. PADILLA.</b> Mr. Chairman.<br><br><b>THE CHAIRMAN.</b> Congressman Padilla.<br><br><b>HON. PADILLA.</b> With the Standardization Law, how can we resolve that problem just mentioned by the Administrator?<br><br><b>MR. VALENCIA.</b> What will happen, Sir, is that we will ask outside assistance to work out a salary structure that would be modest but at the same time at least make it more difficult (sic) that will attract new people, new blood to the System - quality personnel, and will also help make it a bit more difficult for private sector to pirate from the institution.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[214]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As the SSS exercises the same functions as the GSIS - the handling of sensitive and important funds - the GSIS' exemption from the Salary Standardization Law was easily justifiable, viz:<br><blockquote>HON. TUAZON. xxx Now, the GSIS and the SSS, they are more or less performing the same functions. So I am asking whether in the proposed amendments on the charter of the GSIS they also have similar proposal, because if I still recall, there was a time when the GSIS employees were the envy - not the SSS because the SSS has never been the envy of government employees because they really never have been paid very good salaries. — There was a time when the GSIS was the envy of other government employees because they had fat bonuses, they had quarterly bonus, they had mid-year bonus, they had 3 months bonus, Christmas bonus and their salaries were very much higher than their counterparts in the government and they are saying, "By golly, the GSIS, they are only using the funds of the government employees and yet they are receiving fat salaries from the contributions of the government employees. That was one of the complaints I was hearing at that time - I was still First Year College -, so the next time I realized, all these fat salaries of the Central Bank... Central Bank was also the envy of the other government employees, PNB, but SSS has never been noted to be paying fat salaries that will be sufficient to attract well qualified employees from the other sectors. So, the reason for my question is that, if we grant SSS, we have also to grant GSIS on the rationale that they are both performing the same functions.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[215]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In sum, the basis for the exemption of certain employees of GOCCs or GFIs from the coverage of the Salary Standardization Law rests not on the mere fact that they are employees of GOCCs or GFIs, but on a <u>policy determination by the legislature</u> that such exemption is <u>needed</u> to fulfill the mandate of the institution concerned considering, among others, that: (1) the GOCC or GFI is essentially proprietary in character; (2) the GOCC or GFI is in direct competition with their counterparts in the private sector, not only in terms of the provision of goods or services, but also in terms of hiring and retaining competent personnel; and (3) the GOCC or GFI are or were experiencing difficulties filling up plantilla positions with competent personnel and/or retaining these personnel. The need for and the scope of exemption necessarily varies with the particular circumstances of each institution, and the corresponding variance in the benefits received by the employees is merely incidental.<br><br><b>There are real differences between the Rank &amp;<br>File of the BSP and the Exempted Rank &amp; File<br>Employees of the other GOCCs/GFIs</b><br><br>There can be no doubt that the employees of the BSP share a common attribute with the employees of the LBP, SSS, GSIS and DBP in that all are employees of GOCCs performing fiduciary functions. It may also be reasonable to assume that BSP employees with SG 19 and below perform functions analogous to those carried out by employees of the other GOCCs with the corresponding salary grades.<br><br>Nonetheless, these similarities alone are not sufficient to support the conclusion that rank-and-file employees of the BSP may be lumped together with similar employees of the other GOCCs for purposes of compensation, position classification and qualifications standards. The fact that certain persons have some attributes in common does not automatically make them members of the same class with respect to a legislative classification. Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, et al. v. Robison, et al</span>,.,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[216]</sup></font> involving the alleged violation of a conscientious objector's right to equal protection, the U.S. Supreme Court had occasion to observe:<br><blockquote>Of course, merely labeling the class of beneficiaries under the Act as those having served on active duty in the Armed Services cannot rationalize a statutory discrimination against conscientious objectors who have performed alternative civilian service, if, in fact, the lives of the latter were equally disrupted and equally in need of readjustment. The District Court found that military veterans and alternative service performers share the characteristic during their respective service careers of "inability to pursue the educational and economic objectives that persons not subject to the draft law could pursue." But this finding of similarity ignores that <u>a common characteristic shared by beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries alike, is not sufficient to invalidate a statute <b>when other characteristics peculiar to only one group rationally explain the statute's different treatment of the two groups.</b></u> Congress expressly recognized that significant differences exist between military service veterans and alternative service performers, particularly in respect of the Act's purpose to provide benefits to assist in readjusting to civilian life. These differences "afford the basis for a different treatment within a constitutional framework."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[217]</sup></font> (Underscoring and emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Indeed, from the foregoing examination of the legislative records of the amended charters of the exempt GOCCs and GFIs, the following real and material differences are readily manifest:<br><br>First, unlike the LBP, DBP, SSS and GSIS, the BSP, in particular the Central Monetary Authority,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[218]</sup></font> performs a primarily government function, not a proprietary or business function. In this respect it is more similar to the other government agencies involved in the management of the economy, such as the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), than a commercial bank.<br><br>Second, while the importance of its functions is undoubted, the BSP, unlike the LBP, DBP, SSS and GSIS, is not subject to cut throat competition or the pressures of either the financial or job markets.<i><br><br></i>Third, there is no indication in the record that the BSP, unlike the LBP, DBP, SSS and GSIS, is experiencing difficulty in filling up or maintaining competent personnel in the positions with SG 19 and below.<br><br><b>The Questioned <span style="font-style: italic;">Proviso</span> Cannot be<br>Considered Oppressive or Discriminatory<br>in Its Implementation</b><i><br><br></i>Given the factual basis for the classification between exempt and non-exempt employees (i.e. real distinctions as to the proprietary or governmental character of the GOCC/GFI, competition with the private sector, and difficulty in attracting and maintaining competent personnel) and the reasonable relationship of this classification to the attainment of the objectives of the laws involved, the questioned <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso</span> cannot be considered oppressive or discriminatory in its implementation.<br><br>Significantly, neither the petitioner nor the main opinion demonstrates what injuries petitioner's members have sustained as a result of the <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso</span> in Section 15 (c) of The New Central Bank Act, whether or not the same is read together with subsequent legislative enactments. This is unsurprising for how could a provision which places the BSP rank and file at par with all other government employees in terms of compensation and position classification be considered oppressive or discriminatory?<br><br>Moreover, Congressional records show that House Bill 123 has been filed with the present Thirteenth Congress<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[219]</sup></font> seeking to amend The New Central Bank Act by, among other things, exempting all positions in the BSP from the Salary Standardization Law. Thus, it cannot be said that Congress has closed its mind to all possibility of amending the New Central Bank Act to provide for the exemption of the BSP rank and file from the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law.<br><br>In fine, judged under the Rational Basis Test, the classification in Section 15 (c) of the New Central Bank Act complies with the requirements of the equal protection clause, even taken together with the subsequent amendments of the charters of the other GOCCs and GFIs.<br><br><b>Petitioner's Members' Remedy is with Congress and<br>Not With The Courts</b><br><br>While the main opinion acknowledges the propriety of judicial restraint "under most circumstances" when deciding questions of constitutionality, in recognition of the "broad discretion given to Congress in exercising its legislative power," it nevertheless advocates active intervention with respect to the exemption of the BSP rank and file employees from the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law.<br><br>Considering, however, that the record fails to show (1) that the statutory provision in question affects either a fundamental right or a suspect class, and, more importantly, (2) that the classification contained therein was completely bereft of any possible rational and real basis, it would appear that judicial restraint is not merely preferred but is in fact mandatory, lest this Court stray from its function of adjudication and trespass into the realm of legislation.<br><br>To be sure, inasmuch as exemption from the Salary Standardization Law requires a factually grounded policy determination by the legislature that such exemption is necessary and desirable for a government agency or GOCC to accomplish its purpose, the appropriate remedy of petitioner is with Congress and not with the courts. As the branch of government entrusted with the plenary power to make and amend laws,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[220]</sup></font> it is well within the powers of Congress to grant exceptions to, or to amend where necessary, the Salary Standardization Law, where the public good so requires. At the same time, in line with its duty to determine the proper allocation of powers between the several departments,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[221]</sup></font> this Court is naturally hesitant to intrude too readily into the domain of another co-equal branch of government where the absence of reason and the vice of arbitrariness are not clearly and unmistakably established.<br><br>The contention in the main opinion that herein petitioner represents the "politically powerless," and therefore should not be compelled to seek a political solution, rings hollow.<br><br>First, as pointed out by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Cleburne Texas v. Cleburne Living Center</span>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[222]</sup></font> "[a]ny minority can be said to be powerless to assert direct control over the legislature, but if that were a criterion for higher level scrutiny by the courts, much economic and social legislation would now be suspect."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[223]</sup></font><br><br>Second, there is nothing of record which would explain why the rank and file employees of the BSP in particular should be considered more "powerless" than the rank and file employees of the other GOCCs and GFIs, particularly those to whom Congress has granted exemption.<br><br>Third, as already mentioned, House Bill 123, providing for, among others, the exemption of all BSP employees from the coverage of the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law is already pending in Congress. Thus, it would seem that the petitioner and its members are not without any support from within that legislative body.<br><br>Moreover, in view of the tight fiscal and budgetary situation confronting the national government, both the executive and legislative branches of the government are actively reassessing the statutes which have exempted certain GOCCs and GFIs from the Salary Standardization Law, as reported in a number of newspapers of general circulation.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[224]</sup></font><br><br>Thus, in line with the austerity program set under Administrative Order 130 issued by the President on August 31, 2004, the Department of Budget and Management is reviewing the pay packages of 1,126 GOCCs and their subsidiaries,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[225]</sup></font> particularly those which have been exempted from the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[226]</sup></font> to bring their salaries at par with national agencies.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[227]</sup></font> Additionally, the Department of Budget has moved for the removal of all the exemptions of the GOCCs from the Salary Standardization law and the slashing of salaries of some GOCC officials to help ease the government's financial problems.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[228]</sup></font><br><br>There have also been suggestions to shift to a performance-based compensation structure,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[229]</sup></font> or to amend the charters of the GOCCs exempted from the Salary Standardization Law to allow the President to set limits on the compensation<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[230]</sup></font> received by their personnel. Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin has also disclosed that the President had mandated "a cut in pay of members of the board and officers of GOCCs that are not competing with the private sector," adding that those who "d[o] not compete with the private sector would have to observe the Salary Standardization Law."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[231]</sup></font><br><br>Together with these developments, House Majority Leader Prospero Nograles has called on Congress to step in and institute amendments to existing charters of GFI’s and GOCCs<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[232]</sup></font> which have been exempted from the Compensation Classification System of the Salary Standardization Law; and, thereafter, pass a law standardizing the salaries of GOCC and GFI employees and executives.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[233]</sup></font> Other members of the House of Representatives, particularly the party-list lawmakers, have suggested a cut on the salary schemes of GOCC executives, with the funds saved to be channeled to a "special fund" for giving lowly paid government employees a salary increase.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[234]</sup></font><br><br>Whether any of the foregoing measures will actually be implemented by the Congress still remains to be seen. However, what is important is that Congress is actively reviewing the policies concerning GOCCs and GFIs with respect to the Salary Standardization Law.<br><br>Hence, for this Court to intervene now, when no intervention is called for, would be to prematurely curtail the public debate on the issue of compensation of the employees of the GOCCs and GFIs, and effectively substitute this Court's policy judgments for those of the legislature, with whom the "power of the purse" is constitutionally lodged. Such would not only constitute an improper exercise of the Court's power of judicial review, but may also effectively stunt the growth and maturity of the nation as a political body as well.<br><br>In this regard, it may be worthwhile to reflect upon the words of Mr. Chief Justice Berger of the American Court in his dissenting opinion in <span style="font-style: italic;">Plyler v. Doe</span>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[235]</sup></font> to wit:<br><blockquote><b>The Court makes no attempt to disguise that it is acting to make up for Congress' lack of "effective leadership"</b> in dealing with the serious national problems caused by the influx of uncountable millions of illegal aliens across our borders. The failure of enforcement of the immigration laws over more than a decade and the inherent difficulty and expense of sealing our vast borders have combined to create a grave socioeconomic dilemma. It is a dilemma that has not yet been fully assessed, let alone addressed. <b>However, it is not the function of the Judiciary to provide "effective leadership" simply because the political branches of government fail to do so.<br><br>The Court's holding today manifests the justly criticized judicial tendency to attempt speedy and wholesale formulation of "remedies" for the failures - or simply the laggard pace - of the political processes of our system of government. <u>The Court employs, and in my view abuses, the Fourteenth Amendment in an effort to become an omnipotent and omniscient problem solver</u>. That the motives for doing so are noble and compassionate does not alter the fact that the Court distorts our constitutional function to make amends for the defaults of others.</b><br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br><b>The Constitution does not provide a cure for every social ill, nor does it vest judges with a mandate to try to remedy every social problem. <u>Moreover, when this Court rushes to remedy what it perceives to be the failing of the political processes, it deprives those processes of an opportunity to function</u>. When the political institutions are not forced to exercise constitutionally allocated powers and responsibilities, those powers, like muscles not used, tend to atrophy. Today's cases, I regret to say, present yet another example of unwarranted judicial action which in the long run tends to contribute to the weakening of our political processes</b>.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[236]</sup></font>(Emphasis supplied; citations and footnotes omitted)<br></blockquote><b>The Social Justice Provisions of the Constitution do<br>not Justify the Grant of the Instant Petition</b><br><br>May this Court depart from established rules in equal protection analysis to grant a group of government employees, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' rank and file, adjustments in their salaries and wages? Can the exemption from a law mandating the salary standardization of all government employees be justified based on the economic and financial needs of the employees, and on the assertion that those who have less in life should have more in law? Can the social justice provisions in the Constitution override the strong presumption of constitutionality of the law and place the burden, under the test of "strict scrutiny", upon the government to demonstrate that its classification has been narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests?<br><br>Notwithstanding the lack of support from both local and foreign jurisprudence to justify the grant of the instant petition, the main opinion maintains that the policy of social justice and the special protection afforded to labor<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[237]</sup></font> require the use of equal protection as a tool of effective intervention, and the adoption of a less deferential attitude by this Court to legislative classification.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[238]</sup></font><br><br>The citation of the social justice provisions of the Constitution are non sequitur. As previously discussed, neither the petitioner nor the main opinion has clearly explained how a provision placing the rank and file of the BSP on equal footing with all other government employees in terms of compensation and position classification can be considered oppressive or discriminatory.<br><br>In this regard, the citation of <span style="font-style: italic;">International School Alliance of Educators v. Quisumbing</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[239]</sup></font> is doubly ironic. For to demonstrate the institutionalization of the principle of "equal pay for equal work" in our legal system, footnote 22 of the decision refers specifically to the Salary Standardization Law as embodying said principle:<br><blockquote>Indeed, the government employs this rule "equal pay for equal work" in fixing the compensation of government employees. Thus, Republic Act No. 6758 (An Act Prescribing a Revised Compensation and Position Classification System in Government and for Other Purposes) declares it "the policy of the State to provide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions. See also the Preamble of Presidential Decree No. 985 (A Decree Revising the Position Classification and Compensation Systems in the National Government, and Integrating the same)<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[240]</sup></font><br></blockquote>At the same time, the General Provisions of the Salary Standardization Law clearly incorporate the spirit and intent of the social justice provisions cited in the main opinion, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. General Provisions. — The following principles shall govern the Compensation and Position Classification System of the Government:<br><br>(a) All government personnel shall be paid just and equitable wages; and while pay distinctions must necessarily exist in keeping with work distinctions, the ratio of compensation for those occupying higher ranks to those at lower ranks should be maintained at equitable levels, giving due consideration to higher percentage of increases to lower level positions and lower percentage increases to higher level positions;<br><br>(b) Basic compensation for all personnel in the government and government-owned or controlled corporations and financial institutions shall generally be comparable with those in the private sector doing comparable work, and must be in accordance with prevailing laws on minimum wages;<br><br>(c) The total compensation provided for government personnel must be maintained at a reasonable level in proportion to the national budget;<br><br>(d) A review of government compensation rates, taking into account possible erosion in purchasing power due to inflation and other factors, shall be conducted periodically.<br></blockquote>How then are the aims of social justice served by removing the BSP rank and file personnel from the ambit of the Salary Standardization Law? In the alternative, what other public purpose would be served by ordering such an exemption? Surely to grant the rank and file of the BSP exemption solely for the reason that other GOCC or GFI employees have been exempted, without regard for the reasons which impelled the legislature to provide for those exemptions, would be to crystallize into our law what Justice Holmes sardonically described as "merely idealizing envy."<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[241]</sup></font><br><br>Similarly, the justification that petitioner and its members represent "the more impotent rank and file government employees who, unlike employees in the private sector, have no specific rights to organize as a collective bargaining unit and negotiate for better terms and conditions for employment, nor the power to hold a strike to protest unfair labor practices" is unconvincing. This Court's discussion of the differences between employment in the GOCCs/GFIs and the private sector, to my mind, is more insightful:<br><blockquote>The general rule in the past and up to the present is that "the terms and conditions of employment in the Government, including any political subdivision or instrumentality thereof are governed by law" (Section 11, the Industrial Peace Act, R.A. No. 875, as amended and Article 277, the Labor Code, P.D. No. 442, as amended). <b>Since the terms and conditions of government employment are fixed by law, government workers cannot use the same weapons employed by workers in the private sector to secure concessions from their employers. <u>The principle behind labor unionism in private industry is that industrial peace cannot be secured through compulsion by law</u>. Relations between private employers and their employees rest on an essentially voluntary basis. Subject to the minimum requirements of wage laws and other labor and welfare legislation, the terms and conditions of employment in the unionized private sector are settled through the process of collective bargaining. <u>In government employment, however, it is the legislature and, where properly given delegated power, the administrative heads of government which fix the terms and conditions of employment. And this is effected through statutes or administrative circulars, rules, and regulations, not through collective bargaining agreements</u>.</b><br><center>x x x<br><br></center><b>Personnel of government-owned or controlled corporations are now part of the civil service. It would not be fair to allow them to engage in concerted activities to wring higher salaries or fringe benefits from Government even as other civil service personnel such as the hundreds of thousands of public school teachers, soldiers, policemen, health personnel, and other government workers are denied the right to engage in similar activities.</b><br><br>To say that the words "all employers" in P.D. No. 851 includes the Government and all its agencies, instrumentalities, and government-owned or controlled corporations would also result in nightmarish budgetary problems.<br><br>For instance, the Supreme Court is trying its best to alleviate the financial difficulties of courts, judges, and court personnel in the entire country but it can do so only within the limits of budgetary appropriations. Public school teachers have been resorting to what was formerly unthinkable, to mass leaves and demonstrations, to get not a 13th-month pay but promised increases in basic salaries and small allowances for school uniforms. The budget of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports has to be supplemented every now and then for this purpose. The point is, salaries and fringe benefits of those embraced by the civil service are fixed by law. Any increases must come from law, from appropriations or savings under the law, and not from concerted activity.<br><br>The Government Corporate Counsel, Justice Manuel Lazaro, in his consolidated comment for respondents GSIS, MWSS, and PVTA gives the background of the amendment which includes every government-owned or controlled corporation in the embrace of the civil service:<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><blockquote>'"Moreover, determination of employment conditions as well as supervision of the management of the public service is in the hands of legislative bodies. It is further emphasized that government agencies in the performance of their duties have a right to demand undivided allegiance from their workers and must always maintain a pronounced esprit de corps or firm discipline among their staff members. It would be highly incompatible with these requirements of the public service, if personnel took orders from union leaders or put solidarity with members of the working class above solidarity with the Government. This would be inimical to the public interest.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<i><br></i></div><i><br></i>"Similarly, Delegate Leandro P. Garcia, expressing support for the inclusion of government-owned or controlled corporations in the Civil Service, argued:<br><br><b>"’It is meretricious to contend that because Government-owned or controlled corporations yield profits, their employees are entitled to better wages and fringe benefits than employees of Government other than Government-owned and controlled corporations which are not making profits. There is no gainsaying the fact that the capital they use is the people's money.'</b> (see: Records of the 1971 Constitutional Convention).<br><br>"Summarizing the deliberations of the 1971 Constitutional Convention on the inclusion of Government-owned or controlled corporations, Dean Joaquin G. Bernas, SJ., of the Ateneo de Manila University Professional School of Law, stated that <b>government-owned corporations came under attack as milking cows of a privileged few enjoying salaries far higher than their counterparts in the various branches of government, while the capital of these corporations belongs to the Government and government money is pumped into them whenever on the brink of disaster, and they should therefore come under the stric[t] surveillance of the Civil Service System.</b> (Bernas, The 1973 Philippine Constitution, Notes and Cases, 1974 ed., p. 524)."<br></blockquote><center>x x x<br></center><br><b>Section 6, Article XII-B of the Constitution gives added reasons why the government employees represented by the petitioners cannot expect treatment in matters of salaries different from that extended to all others government personnel.</b> The provision states:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 6. The National Assembly shall provide for the standardization of compensation of government officials and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, taking into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required for the positions concerned."<br></blockquote><b>It is the legislature or, in proper cases, the administrative heads of government and not the collective bargaining process nor the concessions wrung by labor unions from management that determine how much the workers in government-owned or controlled corporations may receive in terms of salaries, 13th month pay, and other conditions or terms of employment.</b> There are government institutions which can afford to pay two weeks, three weeks, or even 13th-month salaries to their personnel from their budgetary appropriations. However, these payments must be pursuant to law or regulation.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[242]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Certainly, social justice is more than picking and choosing lines from Philippine and foreign instruments, statutes and jurisprudence, like ripe cherries, in an effort to justify preferential treatment of a favored group. In the immortal words of Justice Laurel in <span style="font-style: italic;">Calalang v. Williams</span>:<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[243]</sup></font><br><blockquote>The petitioner finally avers that the rules and regulations complained of infringe upon the constitutional precept regarding the promotion of social justice to insure the well-being and economic security of all the people. <b><u>The promotion of social justice, however, is to be achieved not through a mistaken sympathy towards any given group</u>. Social justice is "neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy," but the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated.</b> Social justice means the promotion of the welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society, through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise of powers underlying the existence of all governments on the time-honored principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">salus populi est suprema lex</span><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[244]</sup></font> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><b>Postscript</b><br><br>I agree wholeheartedly with the main opinion's statement that "[t]here should be no hesitation in using the equal protection clause as a major cutting edge to eliminate every conceivable irrational discrimination in our society."<br><br>However, because I find that the classification contained in the questioned <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso</span> is based on real differences between the executive level and the rank and file of the BSP; is rationally related to the attainment of the objectives of the new Central Bank Act; and, further, that the subsequent amendments to the charters of certain other GOCCs and GFIs did not materially affect the rational basis for this classification, I do not believe that the classification in the case at bar is impressed with the vice of irrationality.<br><br>The mere fact that petitioner's members are employees of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas,</span> admittedly perhaps the biggest among the GFIs, does not, to my mind, automatically justify their exemption from the Compensation Classification System provided for by the Salary Standardization Law. In my humble view, the equal protection clause ought not to be used as a means of "reserving greener pastures to sacred cows" in contravention of the Constitutional mandate to "provide for the standardization of compensation of government officials and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, taking into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required for their positions."<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> I vote to deny the instant petition.<br><i><br><br></i><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Entitled "AN ACT PRESCRIBING A REVISED COMPENSATION AND POSITION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IN THE GOVERNMENT AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Salary Standardization Law took effect on July 1, 1989 pursuant to Section 23 thereof:<br><blockquote><i>Sec. 23.Effectivity. — This Act shall take effect July 1, 1989.

We cannot say that Amendment 2 is directed to any identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective.

While the treatment of the aged in this Nation has not been wholly free of discrimination, such persons, unlike, say, those who have been discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin, have not experienced a "history of purposeful unequal treatment" or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities. The class subject to the compulsory retirement feature of the Massachusetts statute consists of uniformed state police officers over the age of 50. It cannot be said to discriminate only against the elderly. Rather, it draws the line at a certain age in middle life.

Instead, it marks a stage that each of us will reach if we live out our normal span.

Pena</i> (515 U.S. 200, 237 [1995]) said:<br><blockquote>Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." <i>Fullilove, supra</i>, at 519, 100 S.Ct., at 2795 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety's "pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct" justified a narrowly tailored race-based remedy. See <i>United States v. Paradise</i>, 480 U.S., at 167, 107 S.Ct., at 1064 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); <i>id.</i>, at 190, 107 S.Ct., at 1076 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.</i>, at 196, 107 S.Ct., at 1079-1080 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the "narrow tailoring" test this Court has set out in previous cases.<br></blockquote>And in <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i> (539 U.S. 306, 326-327 [2003]), the same Court said:<br><blockquote>Strict scrutiny is not "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, supra</i>, at 237, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. As we have explained, "whenever the government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection." 515 U.S., at 229-230, 115 S.Ct. 2097. But that observation "says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny." <i>Id.</i>, at 230, 115 S.Ct. 2097. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Gunther, Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection, 86 HARV.

Edmonds</i>, 601 A. 2d 102 (1992), decided by the Maryland Supreme Court, is cited in the main opinion in support of the proposition that "a statute valid at one time may become void at another time because of altered circumstances." However, the text of the decision does not appear to touch on relative constitutionality. In <i>Murphy</i>, appellants challenged the constitutionality of a statute providing for a US$350,000 statutory cap on non-economic damages in personal injury actions. The Maryland Supreme Court held:<br><blockquote>We reject the plaintiffs' contention that the classification created by § 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article is subject to any level of scrutiny higher than the traditional, deferential rational basis test. Moreover, we disagree with the holdings in the above-cited cases applying heightened scrutiny to legislative caps upon recoverable damages. Whatever may be the appropriate mode of equal protection analysis for some other statutory classifications, in our view a legislative cap of $350,000 upon the amount of noneconomic damages which can be awarded to a tort plaintiff does not implicate such an important "right" as to trigger any enhanced scrutiny. Instead, the statute represents the type of economic regulation which has regularly been reviewed under the traditional rational basis test by this Court and by the Supreme Court.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>The General Assembly's objective in enacting the cap was to assure the availability of sufficient liability insurance, at a reasonable cost, in order to cover claims for personal injuries to members of the public. This is obviously a legitimate legislative objective. A cap on noneconomic damages may lead to greater ease in calculating premiums, thus making the market more attractive to insurers, and ultimately may lead to reduced premiums, making insurance more affordable for individuals and organizations performing needed services. The cap, therefore, is reasonably related to a legitimate legislative objective.<br><br>Since, the General Assembly had before it several studies which concluded that $250,000 would cover most noneconomic damage claims, the Legislature did not act arbitrarily in enacting the cap at $350,000. It is also significant that the cap applies to all personal injury claimants equally rather than singling out one category of claimants. Therefore, we hold that the legislative classification drawn by § 11-108 between tort claimants whose noneconomic damages are less that $350,000 and tort claimants whose noneconomic damages are greater than $350,000, and who are thus subject to the cap, is not irrational or arbitrary. It does not violate the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.
