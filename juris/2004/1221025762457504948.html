He pointed out that said decision is, in fact, the subject of an appeal. Respondent submitted that the charges against him had become moot.<br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), however, found no merit in respondent’s contention that the administrative complaint against the latter had been mooted by the decision he rendered in Case No. 137. The OCA observed that said decision was rendered out of time, in breach of Rule 70, Section 11 of the Rules of Court, which mandates that judgment must be rendered within thirty (30) days after receipt of the affidavits and position papers or the expiration of the period for filing the same. The OCA also found respondent omitted to come up with a satisfactory explanation as to his failure to decide the case within the prescribed period. Nor did he ask for an extension of time within which to decide the case. Thus, in its report dated February 6, 2003, the OCA held respondent liable for undue delay in rendering judgment in violation of the Rules of Court and recommended that he be fined the amount of P5,000.00. It was further recommended that respondent judge be admonished to be more conscientious and prompt in the performance of his duties.<br><br>On March 30, 2003, respondent retired from the judiciary.<br><br>After a careful perusal of the records of this administrative matter, we find no reason to disagree with the findings of the OCA.&nbsp; Respondent indeed violated Rule 70, Section 11 of the Rules of Court for undue delay in rendering judgment. The records show that the parties in Special Civil Action Case No. 137 had filed their respective position papers as early as February 2, 2000. Thus, respondent had until March 4, 2000 to render judgment. Had there been circumstances which prevented him from handing down his decision within the prescribed period, respondent should have at least requested from this Court for an extension of time within which to render judgment. As respondent himself admitted, Case No. 137 was decided only on June 2, 2002 or two (2) years and some three (3) months beyond the reglementary period. Moreover, he could not even come up with an explanation for the delay.<br><br>We cannot overemphasize the Court’s policy on prompt resolution of disputes. Justice delayed is justice denied. Failure to resolve cases submitted for decision within the period fixed by law constitutes a serious violation of Article III, Section 16<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the Constitution.<br><br>The honor and integrity of the judicial system is measured not only by the fairness and correctness of decisions rendered, but also by the efficiency with which disputes are resolved. Thus, judges must perform their official duties with utmost diligence if public confidence in the judiciary is to be preserved. There is no excuse for mediocrity in the performance of judicial functions. The position of judge exacts nothing less than faithful observance of the law and the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in the discharge of official duties. <br><br>Nevertheless, we are aware of the heavy case load of first level courts.&nbsp; Thus, we have, on numerous occasions, allowed reasonable extensions of time within which to decide cases.&nbsp; But such extensions must first be sought from this Court.&nbsp; A judge cannot by himself prolong the period for deciding cases beyond that authorized by law.&nbsp; Without any order of extension granted by this Court, failure to decide a case within the prescribed period constitutes gross inefficiency that merits administrative sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The OCA recommended that respondent judge be fined in the amount of P5,000.00 for his failure to decide on time Case No. 137, with admonition to be more conscientious and prompt in the performance of judicial duties.&nbsp; We agree that a fine must be imposed, but not in the amount recommended by the OCA.&nbsp; Under Rule 140, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Court, undue delay in rendering a decision in a case is a less serious charge that merits, under Section 10(B) of the same Rule, either suspension from office or a fine beginning at P10,000.00 but below P20,000.00.&nbsp; This being his first administrative case brought to our attention and there being no special circumstance to warrant the imposition of a higher penalty, we find it reasonable and appropriate to impose upon respondent a fine of P10,000.00 only.&nbsp; Now, considering that he already retired from the service, said amount ought to be deducted from his retirement pay and benefits.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge Juanillo M.
