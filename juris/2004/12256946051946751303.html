				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner filed an Application for Free Patent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 6, 1978 before the Bureau of Lands District Office, Region III-2 at Cabanatuan City which was docketed as Application No. 12409. The application covered a parcel of land in Lupao, Nueva Ecija “[i]dentical to Lot No. <b>1035-B</b> of Plan Csd-03-000514-D” alleged to contain an area of 7 hectares, 22 ares and 55 centares.<br><br>In the application, petitioner stated that, inter alia, the land was first occupied and cultivated in May 1941 by her father Policarpio Valte who died on February 10, 1963.<br><br>To the application was attached a July 6, 1978 Joint Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> executed by Procopio Vallega and herein respondent Pedro Mendoza declaring:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> That we personally know [herein petitioner] Reynosa Valte who has filed Free Patent Application No. 2409 for a tract of land located in the Municipality of Lupao, Province of N.

The <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> which was executed on September 12, 1978 reads:<br><br><center><u>SINUMPAANG SALAYSAY</u></center><blockquote>AKO si MIGUELA DELA FUENTE, 86 na taong gulang, Pilipino, biyuda ni Policarpio Valte, at kasalukuyang nakatira sa 1826 Kalimbas, Sta.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>By Order of December 28, 1978, the then Director of Lands Ramon M. Casanova noting, inter alia, the report of Land Investigator Celedonio P. Bacena that petitioner herself and/or through her predecessor-in-interest occupied and cultivated the lot applied for since 1945, approved petitioner’s application covering <b>Lot No. 1035-B</b> alleged to contain an area of 7.2293 hectares. A free patent was subsequently issued by the Register of Deeds for Nueva Ecija on January 16, 1979 in the name of petitioner. The Technical Descriptions of Lot No. 1035-B, Csd-03-000514-D is reflected in the title which therein notes that the lot is <b>identical to Lot 2391, portion of Lot 1035-B, Csd 144</b> and is covered by I.P.A. No. (III-2) 12409.<br><br>Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-10119 covering Free Patent No. 586435 was thereupon issued to petitioner.<br><br>It appears that on November 29, 1982, herein respondents Jose Gonzales and Pedro Mendoza (who jointly executed the above-quoted Joint    Affidavit along with Procopio Vallega in support of petitioner’s application for free patent) filed a “Protest”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to the grant of the free patent to petitioner on the ground of fraud. The protest was amended on March 30, 1983 alleging:<br><blockquote>that the actual area of the lot which is the subject of the protest is seven and 2255/10,000 (7.2255) hectares, and<br><br>claimant claimant-protestant Mendoza is in actual possession and cultivation of an area of four (4) hectares, more or less,<br><br>claimant protestant Gonzales two (2) hectares, more or less, and<br><br>one PROCOPIO VALLEGA [the co-affiant of Mendoza in the Joint Affidavit] the rest of the area.</blockquote>The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), by then Secretary Angel C. Alcala, by Decision of January 20, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> gave due course to and approved the protest of respondents and disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises duly considered, the Regional Executive Director (RED) of DENR Region III is hereby directed to cause the REVERSION of the area covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-10119 of Reynosa Valte, through the Office of the Solicitor General in accordance with the pertinent provisions of Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 141, as amended. Claimants-Protestants Pedro Mendoza and Jose Gonzales and Procopio Vallega are hereby <b>ADJUDGED</b> to have the preferential right over the land in question pro rata to their area of actual occupation. Hence <u>they are GIVEN SIXTY (60) DAYS from the termination of the reversion proceedings <b>to FILE their respective appropriate public land applications.</b></u> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Petitioner seasonably filed an appeal to the Office of the President which, by Decision of February 10, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> set aside the DENR January 20, 1994 decision and declared that there was patent failure of due process, the investigation conducted by the DENR investigator having been done <i>ex parte</i> without petitioner having been given an opportunity to be heard.<br><br>The Office of the President thus ordered the conduct of “another formal hearing and thorough investigation of the case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Acting on the directive of the Office of the President, a pre-trial conference was held by the DENR at the Community Environment Regional Office in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija.<br><br>By Decision of March 11, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the DENR, this time by then Secretary Antonio H. Cerillas, dismissed the protest of respondents in this wise:<br><blockquote>After a careful review of the pertinent documents of this case, these Office rules in favor of Reynosa Valte. The evidence on record preponderates to the fact that Reynosa Valte has preferential rights over the controverted lot. In fact, <u>as early as 1978, in the report of Land Investigator Celedonio P. Bacena, it was found that the controverted land has been occupied and cultivated by Reynosa Valte, and previously by her predecessors-in-interest since 1945.</u> Herein protestants, <u>Pedro Mendoza</u> and Procopio Vallega, <u>thru an affidavit dated July 6, 1978 supported Reynosa Valte’s application for free patent</u> over the controverted land and, under oath, confirmed that the latter has continuously occupied and cultivate the land since 1945 by herself and by her predecessors-in-interest. <u>The aforestated joint-affidavit is a very convincing document to strengthen Reynosa Valte’s assertions that, indeed, the protestants are tenants</u> and that their rights on the controverted lot cannot rise higher that its source, that of Reynosa Valte.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Protest of Jose Gonzales and Pedro Mendoza against Free Patent Application No. (III-2) 120461 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-10119 in the name of Reynosa Valte is hereby dismissed for lack of merit. (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Respondents appealed to the Office of the President which by Decision of April 26, 2000 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> reversed that of the DENR.<br><br>In deciding the case, upon the issue of “who among [respondents] Mendoza and Gonzales and [petitioner] had actually cultivated and had prior possession of the land,” the Office of the President held:<br><blockquote>After going through the evidence presented by the parties, we find the protest of appellants to be credible. <u>The positive testimony of their witnesses</u>, namely the Barangay captain, the Barangay officials as well as neighbors, <u>to the effect that appellee was hardly or never seen cultivating nor possessing the subject premises, cannot simply be disregarded.</u> Rather, these testimonies should be accorded great weight and respect, as they come from individuals who could very well attest to the truth or falsity or appellee’s claim that she was in “open, continuous, exclusive and peaceful” possession of the property in dispute.<br><br><u>The declaration of appellee[-herein petitioner] that she actually possessed the subject property and had cultivated the same, <b>despite her full knowledge that Mendoza and Gonzales were the actual possessors and occupants,</b> simply constitutes fraud</u> as she failed to state this material fact in her application for free patent. Hence, the cancellation of OCT No. P-10119 issued in her favor is in order, pursuant to the doctrine laid down in Republic vs. Mina (114 SCRA 945) which was aptly quoted by then DENR Secretary Angel C. Alcala in his decision dated January 20, 1994, namely:<br><blockquote>A certificate of title that is void may be ordered cancelled. And, a title will be considered void if it is procured through fraud, as when a person applies for registration of the land on the claim that he has been occupying and cultivating it. In the case of disposable public lands, failure on the part of the grantee to comply with the condition imposed by law is a ground for holding such title void (Director of Lands v. CA, 17 SCRA 71). The lapse of the one (1) year period within which a decree of title may be reopened for fraud would not prevent the cancellation thereof for to hold that a title may become indefeasible by registration, even if such title had been secured through fraud or in violation of the law, would be the height of absurdity. Registration should not be a shield of fraud in securing title (Republic vs. Animas, 56 SCRA 499).</blockquote><u>Our conclusion is essentially an affirmation of the DENR findings as embodied in its decision dated January 20, 1994</u> that <u>appellee Valte committed fraud and misrepresentation in procuring Free Patent No. 586435,</u> which became the basis for issuing OCT No. P-10119, consisting of her <u><b>omission to state in her application that appellants Mendoza and Gonzales were in actual possession and occupation of the subject lot.</b></u> Such findings were supported by substantial evidence, hence, must perforce be reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The Office of the President accordingly disposed as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the questioned decision dated March 11, 1999 is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE.</b> The decision dated January 20, 1994 is hereby <b>REINSTATED</b> directing the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, through the Solicitor General, to cause the reversion of the area covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-10119 of Reynosa    Valte. Appellants Mendoza and Gonzales are hereby adjudged to have the preferential right over the subject land, <i>pro rata</i> to their area of actual occupation, <u>entitling them to file their respective public land applications within sixty (60) days after the termination of the reversion proceeding.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Underscoring supplied, emphasis in the original).</blockquote>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration of the Office of the President’s decision having been denied, she lodged a petition for review before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>By Resolution of September 8, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court of Appeals, finding that the petition suffered from the following defects:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">1)</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify"><u>The certification of non-forum shopping is incomplete</u> in violation of Rule 7, Sec. 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2)</td><td><div align="justify"><u>Failure to attach registry receipts in the affidavit of service</u> as proof of service in violation of Rule 13, Sec. 13, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3)</td><td><u>No certified true copies of such material portions of the record</u> referred to in the petition, viz:</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">a)</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify"><u>Decision/resolution of the Bureau of Lands,</u> dated December 28, 1978, approving petitioner’s application for patent;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">b)</td><td><div align="justify"><u>Decision of the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources,</u> dated January 20, 1994, ordering the Regional Executive Director of DENR Region III to cause the reversion of OCT No. P-10119 of petitioner in favor of respondents;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">c)</td><td><div align="justify"><u>Complete copy of the Resolution of July 14, 2000</u> denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>Contrary to the provisions of Rule 43, Sec. 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. (Underscoring supplied),</blockquote>dismissed the same.<br><br>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration of the resolution of dismissal of the Court of Appeals having been denied by Resolution of January 12, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> she comes to this Court on what she style as a petition for certiorari.<br><br>By Resolution of April 4, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> this Court denied the present petition due to late filing, lack of certification against    forum shopping and failure to sufficiently show that the appellate court committed any reversible error. On motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of petitioner, however, the petition was, by Resolution of June 25, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> reinstated.<br><br>Upon this Court’s directive in the same Resolution of June 25, 2001, respondents filed their comment. Also upon this Court’s directive,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the parties filed their respective memoranda. Petitioner subsequently filed her reply memorandum dated April 22, 2003.<br><br>Petitioner submits as “the only issues to be resolved” the following:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE BY THE PETITIONER IN HER INCOMPLETE CERTIFICATION OF NON-FORUM SHOPPPING [ AND]<br><br></li><li> WHETHER OR NOT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS CORRECT IN ITS DECISION IN FAVOR OF PEDRO MENDOZA AND JOSE GONZALES</li></ol></blockquote>On the first issue, petitioner admits having failed to undertake to report to the appellate court within 5 days from knowledge of any case involving the same issues filed in other courts or tribunals. She argues, however, that such failure maybe overlooked provided there is actually no forum shopping, she citing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> this Court’s ruling in, <i>inter alia, Cabardo v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>Lastly, petitioner’s failure to state in the certificate of non-forum shopping that he undertakes to inform the Court of any petition which might be filed, as required under Revised Circular No. 28-91, may be overlooked since it does not appear that any petition related to this case has ever been filed in any other court. On the other hand, to dismiss the petition on this ground would be to uphold technicality over substantial justice</blockquote>She hastens to add that she had not filed in any court, tribunal or agency any action or petition involving the same issues as those presented in the case at bar, hence, she asserts that she had not committed any act of forum shopping.<br><br>With respect to the other grounds-bases of the appellate court’s dismissal of her petition as specified in its above-quoted Resolution of September 8, 2000, petitioner submits as follows:<br><blockquote>[A]s to the other grounds why the petition for review was dismissed . . . , they must have been cured by the motion for reconsideration in which the required true copies were submitted. That must have been the reason why the Honorable Court of Appeals merely cited the non-compliance with certification on non-forum shopping as ground for the dismissal of the petition for review in its Resolution of the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>. . . [A]s regards the registry receipts proving notice to the other parties, said receipts were indeed attached to the petition for review, but not on the proper page where they would be attached. They were wrongly attached to page 4 of the Decision of the DENR dated March 11, 1999 . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>On the merits, petitioner argues that while only questions of law may be raised in a “petition for certiorari,” there are instances when questions of fact may be considered therein. And she draws attention to what she alleges to be erroneous factual findings of the Office of the President.<br><br>In their Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> to the petition, respondents, who are silent on the procedural aspect of the case, quote the entire decision of the Office of the President and contend that the decision was “based [o]n evidence that supports the factual circumstances.”<br><br>Special circumstances or compelling reasons have been held to justify relaxing the rule requiring certification on forum-shopping. For<br><blockquote>Technical rules of procedure should be used to promote, not frustrate justice. While the swift unclogging of court dockets is a laudable objective, granting substantial justice is an even more urgent ideal. The certificate of non-forum shopping is a mandatory requirement. Nonetheless, this requirement must not be interpreted too literally to defeat the ends of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>Considering that the resolution of the controversy between the parties revolves admittedly on factual issues and that these issues involve the regularity and legality of the disposition under the Public Land Law of 7.2293 hectares of public land to petitioner, this Court relaxes the rule on certification on forum shopping and directs the remand of the case to the Court of Appeals for decision on the merits.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed Court of Appeals Resolutions of September 8, 2000 and January 12, 2001 are hereby <b>SET ASIDE.</b><br><br>Let the case be <b>REMANDED</b> to the Court of Appeals for decision on the merits.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez,</i> and <i>Corona, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Vitug, (Chairman), J.,</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 60.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 95-96.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 108-113.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 112.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 115-118.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 119-123.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 122-123.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 123.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 57.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 167-168.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 169-176.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 177.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Resolution of December 2, 2002, Id. at 241.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 290 SCRA 131 (1998).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 38-39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> _________________<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Twin Towers Condominium Corporation v.
