				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present case involves a dispute between parents and children.&nbsp; The children were invited by the parents to occupy the latter’s two lots, out of parental love and a desire to foster family solidarity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, an unresolved conflict terminated this situation.&nbsp; Out of pique, the parents asked them to vacate the premises.&nbsp; Thus, the children lost their right to remain on the property.&nbsp; They have the right, however, to be indemnified for the useful improvements that they constructed thereon in good faith and with the consent of the parents.&nbsp; In short, Article 448 of the Civil Code applies.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the March 22, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the June 26, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP Nos. 56205 &amp; 56467.&nbsp; The challenged Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote><b>“WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed Decision is <span style="font-style: italic;"><b>AFFIRMED</b></span> with the following <span style="font-style: italic;"><b>MODIFICATIONS</b></span>: <br><blockquote>‘1.

T-78521 and T-103141, situated at Banay-banay, Lipa City; that by way of a verbal lease agreement, Ismael and Teresita occupied these lots in March 1992 and used them as their residence and the situs of their construction business; and that despite repeated demands, petitioners failed to pay the agreed rental of <s>P</s>500 per week.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Ismael and Teresita denied the existence of any verbal lease agreement.&nbsp; They claimed that respondents had invited them to construct their residence and business on the subject lots in order that they could all live near one other, employ Marivic (the sister of Ismael), and help in resolving the problems of the family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> They added that it was the policy of respondents to allot the land they owned as an advance grant of inheritance in favor of their children. Thus, they contended that the lot covered by TCT No. T-103141 had been allotted to Ismael as advance inheritance.&nbsp; On the other hand, the lot covered by TCT No. T-78521 was allegedly given to petitioners as payment for construction materials used in the renovation of respondents’ house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The MTCC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> ruled in favor of respondents and ordered petitioners to vacate the premises.&nbsp; It opined that Ismael and Teresita had occupied the lots, not by virtue of a verbal lease agreement, but by tolerance of Vicente and Rosario.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As their stay was by mere tolerance, petitioners were necessarily bound by an implied promise to vacate the lots upon demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The MTCC dismissed their contention that one lot had been allotted as an advance inheritance, on the ground that successional rights were inchoate.&nbsp; Moreover, it disbelieved petitioners’ allegation that the other parcel had been given as payment for construction materials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the regional trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (RTC) upheld the findings of the MTCC.&nbsp; However, the RTC allowed respondents to appropriate the building and other improvements introduced by petitioners, after payment of the indemnity provided for by Article 448 in relation to Articles 546 and 548 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It added that respondents could oblige petitioners to purchase the land, unless its value was considerably more than the building.&nbsp; In the latter situation, petitioners should pay rent if respondents would not choose to appropriate the building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Upon denial of their individual Motions for Reconsideration, the parties filed with the CA separate Petitions for Review, which were later consolidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>The CA sustained the finding of the two lower courts that Ismael and Teresita had been occupying the subject lots only by the tolerance of Vicente and Rosario.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, possession of the subject lots by petitioners became illegal upon their receipt of respondents’ letter to vacate it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Calubayan v.

font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition is partly meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ejectment</span></span><br></div><br>Who is entitled to the physical or material possession of the premises?&nbsp; At the outset, we stress that this is the main issue in ejectment proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In the present case, petitioners failed to justify their right to retain possession of the subject lots, which respondents own.&nbsp; Since possession is one of the attributes of ownership,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> respondents clearly are entitled to physical or material possession.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Allegations of the Complaint</span></span><br><br>Petitioners allege that they cannot be ejected from the lots, because respondents based their Complaint regarding the nonpayment of rentals on a verbal lease agreement, which the latter failed to prove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Petitioners contend that the lower courts erred in using another ground (tolerance of possession) to eject them.<br><br>In actions for unlawful detainer, possession that was originally lawful becomes unlawful upon the expiration or termination of the defendant’s right to possess, arising from an express or implied contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In other words, the plaintiff’s cause of action comes from the expiration or termination of the defendant’s right to continue possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The case resulting therefrom must be filed within one year from the date of the last demand.<br><br>To show a cause of action in an unlawful detainer, an allegation that the defendant is illegally withholding possession from the plaintiff is sufficient.&nbsp; The complaint may lie even if it does not employ the terminology of the law, provided the said pleading is&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;couched in a language adequately stating that the withholding of possession or&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the refusal to vacate has become unlawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It is equally settled that the jurisdiction of the court, as well as the nature of the action, is determined from the averments of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Complaint alleged that despite demands, petitioners “refused to pay the accrued rentals and [to] vacate the leased premises.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It prayed that judgment be rendered “[o]rdering [petitioners] and all those claiming rights under them to vacate the properties x x x and remove the structures x x x constructed thereon.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Effectively then, respondents averred that petitioners’ original lawful occupation of the subject lots had become unlawful.<br><br>The MTCC found sufficient cause to eject petitioners.&nbsp; While it disbelieved the existence of a verbal lease agreement, it nevertheless concluded that petitioners’ occupation of the subject lots was by mere tolerance of respondents.&nbsp; Basing its conclusion on the fact that the parties were close relatives, the MTCC ruled thus:<br><blockquote>“x x x [T]he parties herein are first degree relatives.&nbsp; Because of this relationship, this Court takes judicial notice of the love, care, concern and protection imbued upon the parents towards their [children], i.e., in the instant case, the love, care, concern and protection of the [respondents] to the [petitioners].&nbsp; With this in mind, this Court is inclined to believe the position of the [petitioners] that there was no such verbal lease agreement between the parties herein that took place in 1992.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>“From the allegations of the [petitioners], this Court is convinced that their stay and occupancy of the subject premises was by mere tolerance of the [respondents], and not by virtue of a verbal lease agreement between them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </blockquote> Having found a cause of action for unlawful detainer, the MTCC (as well as the RTC and the CA) did not err in ordering the ejectment of petitioners as prayed for by respondents.&nbsp; There was no violation of Section 17 of Rule 70<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; As earlier explained, unlawful detainer was sufficiently alleged in the Complaint and duly proven during the trial.&nbsp; Significantly, the issue of whether there was enough ground to eject petitioners was raised during the preliminary conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Not Merely Tolerated<br>Possession</span></span><br><br>Petitioners dispute the lower courts’ finding that they occupied the subject lots on the basis of mere tolerance.&nbsp; They argue that their occupation was not under such condition, since respondents had invited, offered and persuaded them to use those properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>This Court has consistently held that those who occupy the land of another at the latter’s tolerance or permission, without any contract between them, are necessarily bound by an implied promise that the occupants will vacate the property upon demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> A summary action for ejectment is the proper remedy to enforce this implied obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession is to be counted from the date of the demand to vacate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Toleration is defined as “the act or practice of permitting or enduring something not wholly approved of.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarona v. Villegas</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> described what <span style="font-style: italic;">tolerated acts</span> means, in this language:<br><blockquote>“Professor Arturo M. Tolentino states that acts merely tolerated are ‘those which by reason of neighborliness or familiarity, the owner of property <span style="font-style: italic;">allows</span> his neighbor or another person to do on the property; they are generally those particular services or benefits which one’s property can give to another without material injury or prejudice to the owner, who <span style="font-style: italic;">permits</span> them out of friendship or courtesy.’&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; And, Tolentino continues, even though ‘this is <span style="font-style: italic;">continued</span> for a long time, no right will be acquired by prescription.” x x x.&nbsp; Further expounding on the concept, Tolentino writes: ‘There is tacit consent of the possessor to the acts which are merely tolerated.&nbsp; Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">not every case of knowledge and silence</span> on the part of the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;possessor <span style="font-style: italic;">can be considered mere tolerance</span>.&nbsp; By virtue of tolerance that is considered as an authorization, permission or license, acts of possession are realized or performed.&nbsp; The question reduces itself to the existence or non-existence of the permission.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>We hold that the facts of the present case rule out the finding of possession by mere tolerance.&nbsp; Petitioners were able to establish that respondents had invited them to occupy the subject lots in order that they could all live near one other and help in resolving family problems.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> By occupying those lots, petitioners demonstrated their acceptance of the invitation.&nbsp; Hence, there was a meeting of minds, and an agreement regarding possession of the lots impliedly arose between the parties.<br><br>The occupancy of the subject lots by petitioners was not merely “something not wholly approved of” by respondents.&nbsp; Neither did it arise from what Tolentino refers to as “neighborliness or familiarity.” In point of fact, their possession was upon the invitation of and with the complete approval of respondents, who desired that their children would occupy the premises.&nbsp; It arose from familial love and a desire for family solidarity, which are basic Filipino traits.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Right to Use the Lots Terminated</span></span><br><br>That Ismael and Teresita had a right to occupy the lots is therefore clear.&nbsp; The issue is the duration of possession.&nbsp; In the absence of a stipulation on this point, Article 1197 of the Civil Code allows the courts to fix the duration or the period.<br><blockquote>“Article 1197.&nbsp; If the obligation does not fix a period, but from its nature and the circumstances it can be inferred that a period was intended, the courts may fix the duration thereof.<br><br>“The courts shall also fix the duration of the period when it depends upon the will of the debtor.<br><br>“In every case the courts shall determine such period as may under the circumstances have been probably contemplated by the parties.&nbsp; Once fixed by the courts, the period cannot be changed by them.” </blockquote> Article 1197, however, applies to a situation in which the parties intended a period.&nbsp; Such qualification cannot be inferred from the facts of the present case.<br><br>To repeat, when Vicente and Rosario invited their children to use the lots, they did so out of parental love and a desire for solidarity expected from Filipino parents.&nbsp; No period was intended by the parties.&nbsp; Their mere failure to fix the duration of their agreement does not necessarily justify or authorize the courts to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Based on respondents’ reasons for gratuitously allowing&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;petitioners to use the lots, it can be safely concluded that the agreement subsisted as long as the parents and the children mutually benefited from the arrangement.&nbsp; Effectively, there is a resolutory condition in such an agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, when a change in the condition existing between the parties occurs --like a change of ownership, necessity, death of either party or unresolved conflict or animosity -- the agreement may be deemed terminated.&nbsp; Having been based on parental love, the agreement would end upon the dissipation of the affection.<br><br>When persistent conflict and animosity overtook the love and solidarity between the parents and the children, the purpose of the agreement ceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, petitioners no longer had any cause for continued possession of the lots.&nbsp; Their right to use the properties became untenable.&nbsp; It ceased upon their receipt of the notice to vacate.&nbsp; And because they refused to heed the demand, ejectment was the proper remedy against them.&nbsp; Their possession, which was originally lawful, became unlawful when the reason therefor -- love and solidarity -- ceased to exist between them.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">No Right to Retain<br>Possession</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br><br></span></span> Petitioners have not given this Court adequate reasons to reverse the lower courts’ dismissal of their contention that Lots T-78521 and T-103141, respectively, were allegedly allotted to them as part of their inheritance and given in consideration for past debts.<br><br>The right of petitioners to inherit from their parents is merely inchoate and is vested only upon the latters’ demise.&nbsp; Indisputably, rights of succession are transmitted only from the moment of death of the decedent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Assuming that there was an “allotment” of inheritance, ownership nonetheless remained with respondents.&nbsp; Moreover, an intention to confer title to certain persons in the future is not inconsistent with the owners’ taking back possession in the meantime for any reason deemed sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Other than their self-serving testimonies and their affidavits, petitioners offered no credible evidence to support their outlandish claim of inheritance “allocation.”<br><br>We also agree with the lower courts that petitioners failed to prove the allegation that, through a dation in payment, Lot T-78521 had been transferred to the latter as payment for respondents’ debts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The evidence presented by petitioners related only to the alleged indebtedness of the parents arising from the latter’s purported purchases and advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> There was no sufficient proof that respondents had entered into a contract of dation to settle the alleged debt.&nbsp; Petitioners even stated that there was a disagreement in the accounting of the purported debt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> a fact that disproves a meeting of the minds with the parents.<br><br>Petitioners also admitted that a portion of the alleged debt is the subject matter of a collection case against respondents (Civil Case No. 0594-96).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, the former’s allegation that the indebtedness has been paid through a dation cannot be given credence, inconsistent as it is with their action to recover the same debt.<br><br>Despite their protestations, petitioners recognized the right of the parents to recover the premises when they admitted in their Position Paper filed with the MTCC that respondents had a title to the lots.<br><blockquote>“The [respondents] want to get their property because the title is theirs, the [petitioners] do not object but what is due the [petitioners] including the reparation for the tarnish of their dignity and honor must be given the [petitioners] for the benefits of their children before the premises will be turned over.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>As a rule, the right of ownership carries with it the right of possession.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Second Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Appearance at the Preliminary Conference<br><br></span> </span></div> Section 8 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court requires the appearance of the plaintiff and the defendant during the preliminary conference.&nbsp; On the basis of this provision, petitioners claim that the MTCC should have dismissed the case upon the failure of respondents to attend the conference.&nbsp; However, petitioners do not dispute that an attorney-in-fact with a written authorization from respondents appeared during the preliminary conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The issue then is whether the rules on ejectment allow a representative to substitute for a party’s personal appearance.<br><br>Unless inconsistent with Rule 70, the provisions of Rule 18 on pretrial applies to the preliminary conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Under Section 4 of this Rule, the nonappearance of a party may be excused by the showing of a valid cause; or by the appearance of a representative, who has been fully authorized in writing to enter into an amicable settlement, to submit to alternative modes of dispute resolution, and to enter into stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Section 4 of Rule 18 may supplement Section 8 of Rule 70.&nbsp; Thus, the spirit behind the exception to personal appearance under the rules on pretrial is applicable to the preliminary conference.&nbsp; If there are valid reasons or if a representative has a “special authority,” a party’s appearance may be waived.&nbsp; As petitioners are challenging only the applicability of the rules on pretrial to the rule on preliminary conference, the written authorization from respondents can indeed be readily considered as a “special authorization.”<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Third Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rights of a Builder in Good Faith<br><br></span> </span></div> As applied to the present case, accession refers to the right of the owner to everything that is incorporated or attached to the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Accession industrial</span> -- building, planting and sowing on an immovable -- is governed by Articles 445 to 456 of the Civil Code.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Articles 447 and 1678 of the<br>Civil Code Inapplicable</span></span><br><br>To buttress their claim of reimbursement for the improvements introduced on the property, petitioners cite Article 447.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> They allege that the CA erred in applying Article 1678, since they had no lease agreement with respondents.<br><br>We clarify.&nbsp; Article 447 is not applicable, because it relates to the rules that apply when the owner of the property uses the materials of another.&nbsp; It does not refer to the instance when a possessor builds on the property of another, which is the factual milieu here.<br><br>In view of the unique factual setting of the instant case, the contention of petitioners regarding the inapplicability of Article 1678 deserves attention.&nbsp; The CA applied the provisions on lease, because it found their possession by mere tolerance comparable with that of a lessee, per the pronouncement in <span style="font-style: italic;">Calubayan v.
