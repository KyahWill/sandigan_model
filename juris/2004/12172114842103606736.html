				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At bottom, the present petition inquires into the essential nature of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> and questions the extent of the power of Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), as <span style="font-style: italic;">alter ego</span> of the President.&nbsp; More immediately, the petition disputes the validity of the appointment of the DILG as the <span style="font-style: italic;">interim caretaker</span> of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span>.<br><br>On 11 June 1997, private respondent Manuel A. Rayos [as petitioner therein], <span style="font-style: italic;">Punong Barangay</span> of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Barangay </span>52, District II, Zone 5, District II, Caloocan City, filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus, with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order and damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> alleging that respondent therein Alex L. David [now petitioner], <span style="font-style: italic;">Punong Barangay</span> of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Barangay </span>77, Zone 7, Caloocan City and then president of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapter of Caloocan City and of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> National Chapter, committed certain irregularities in the notice, venue and conduct of the proposed synchronized <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> elections in 1997.&nbsp; According to the petition, the irregularities consisted of the following: (1) the publication of the notice in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila Bulletin</span> but without notifying in writing the individual <span style="font-style: italic;">punong barangays</span> of Caloocan City;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (2) the Notice of Meeting dated 08 June 1997 for the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapter of Caloocan City did not specify whether the meeting scheduled on 14 June 1997 was to be held at 8:00 a.m. or 8:00 p.m., and worse, the meeting was to be held in Lingayen, Pangasinan;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and (3) the deadline for the filing of the Certificates of Candidacy having been set at 5:00 p.m. of the third “day prior to the above election day”, or on 11 June 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Rayos failed to meet&nbsp; said deadline since he was not able to obtain a certified true copy of the COMELEC Certificate of Canvas and Proclamation of Winning Candidate, which were needed to be a delegate, to vote and be voted for in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> election.&nbsp; On 13 June 1997, the Executive Judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO), effective for seventy-two (72) hours, enjoining the holding of the general membership and election meeting of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapter of Caloocan City on 14 June 1975.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>However, the TRO was allegedly not properly served on herein petitioner David, and so the election for the officers of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>-Caloocan was held as scheduled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Petitioner David was proclaimed President of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>-Caloocan, and thereafter took his oath and assumed the position of <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-officio</span> member of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Panlungsod</span> of Caloocan.<br><br>On 17 July 1997, respondent Rayos filed a second petition, this time for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>, mandamus and prohibition, with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order and damages, against David, Nancy Quimpo, Presiding Officer of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Panlungsod</span> of Caloocan City, and Secretary Barbers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Rayos alleged that he was elected President of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Caloocan Chapter in the elections held on 14 June 1997 by the members of the Caloocan Chapter pursuant to their Resolution/Petition No. 001-97.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On 18 July 1997, the presiding judge granted the TRO, enjoining therein respondents David, Quimpo and Secretary Barbers from proceeding with the synchronized elections for the Provincial and Metropolitan Chapters of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> scheduled on 19 July 1997, but only for the purpose of maintaining the <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> and effective for a period not exceeding seventy-two (72) hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Eventually, on 18 July 1997, at petitioner David’s instance, Special Civil Action (SCA) No. C-512 pending before Branch 126 was consolidated with SCA No. C-508 pending before Branch 124.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Before the consolidation of the cases, on 25 July 1997, the DILG through respondent Secretary Barbers, filed in SCA No. C-512 an <span style="font-style: italic;">Urgent Motion</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> invoking the President’s power of general supervision over all local government units and seeking the following reliefs:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the interest of the much-needed delivery of basic services to the people, the maintenance of public order and to further protect the interests of the forty-one thousand barangays all over the country, herein respondent respectfully prays: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">a) </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">That the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), pursuant to its delegated power of general supervision, be appointed as the Interim Caretaker to manage and administer the affairs of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>, until such time that the new set of National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Officers shall have been duly elected and assumed office; ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></blockquote></blockquote>The prayer for injunctive reliefs was anchored on the following grounds: (1) the DILG Secretary exercises the power of general supervision over all government&nbsp; units by virtue of Administrative Order No. 267 dated 18 February 1992; (2) the Liga ng mga Barangay is a government organization; (3) undue interference by some local elective officials during the Municipal and City Chapter elections&nbsp; of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span>; (4) improper issuance of confirmations of the elected<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapter officers by petitioner David and the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board; (5) the need for the DILG to provide remedies measured in view of the confusion and chaos sweeping the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> and the incapacity of the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board to address the problems properly.<br><br>On 31 July 1997, petitioner David opposed the DILG’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Urgent Motion</span>, claiming that the DILG, being a respondent in the case, is not allowed to seek any sanction against a co-respondent like David, such as by filing a cross-claim, without first seeking leave of court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He also alleged that the DILG’s request to be appointed interim caretaker constitutes undue interference in the internal affairs of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>, since the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> is not subject to DILG control and supervision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Three (3) days after filing its <span style="font-style: italic;">Urgent Motion</span>, on 28 July 1997, and before it was acted upon by the lower court, the DILG through then Undersecretary Manuel Sanchez, issued Memorandum Circular No. 97-176.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It cited the reported violations of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> Constitution and By-Laws by David and “widespread chaos and confusion” among local government officials as to who were the qualified ex-officio<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> members in their respective <span style="font-style: italic;">sangunians</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Pending the appointment of the DILG “as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Interim Caretaker</span> of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> by the court and until the officers and board members of the national<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapter have been elected and have assumed office,” the Memorandum Circular directed all provincial governors, vice governors, city mayors, city vice mayors, members of the <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang panlalawigan</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">panlungsod</span>, DILG regional directors and other concerned officers, as follows:<blockquote><ol><li>All concerned are directed not to recognize and/or honor any Liga Presidents of the Provincial and Metropolitan Chapters as ex-officio members of the sanggunian concerned until further notice from the Courts or this Department;</li><br><li>All concerned are directed to disregard any pronouncement and/or directive issued by Mr. Alex David on any issue or matter relating to the affairs of the Liga ng mga Barangay until further notice from the Courts or this Department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>On 04 August 1997, public respondent Judge Victoria Isabel A. Paredes issued the assailed order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the pertinent portions of which read, thus:<blockquote>The authority of the DILG to exercise general supervisory jurisdiction over local government units, including the different leagues created under the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) finds basis in Administrative Order No. 267 dated February 18, 1992.&nbsp; Specifically, Section 1 (a) of the said Administrative Order provides a broad premise for the supervisory power of the DILG.&nbsp; Administratively, the DILG’s supervision has been tacitly recognized by the local barangays, municipalities, cities and provinces as shown by the evidences presented by respondent David himself (See Annexes “A” to “C”).&nbsp; The fact that the DILG has sought to refer the matters therein to the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board/Directorate does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> mean that it has lost jurisdiction to act directly therein.&nbsp; Jurisdiction is conferred by law and cannot be claimed or lost through agreements or inaction by individuals.&nbsp; What respondent David may term as “interference” should caretakership be allowed, this Court would rather view as a necessary and desirable corollary to the exercise of supervision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Political motivations must not preclude, hamper, or obstruct the delivery of basic services and the perquisites of public service.&nbsp; In this case, the fact of confusion arising from conflicting appointments, non-action, and uninformed or wavering decisions of the incumbent National Liga Board/Directorate, having been satisfactorily established, cannot simply be brushed aside as being politically motivated or arising therefrom.&nbsp; It is incumbent, therefore, that the DILG exercise a more active role in the supervision of the affairs and operations of the National Liga Board/ Directorate at least until such time that the regular National Liga Board/Directorate may have been elected, qualified and assumed office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>xxx<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Urgent Motion of the DILG for appointment as interim caretaker, until such time that the regularly elected National Liga Board of Directors shall have qualified and assumed office, to manage and administer the affairs of the National Liga Board, is hereby GRANTED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>On 11 August 1997, petitioner David filed an urgent motion for the reconsideration of the assailed order and to declare respondent Secretary Barbers in contempt of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> David claimed that the 04 August 1997 order divested the duly elected members of the Board of Directors of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> National Directorate of their positions without due process of law.&nbsp; He also wanted Secretary Barbers declared in contempt for having issued, through his Undersecretary, Memorandum Circular No. 97-176, even before respondent judge issued the questioned order, in mockery of the justice system.&nbsp; He implied that Secretary Barbers knew about respondent judge’s questioned order even before it was promulgated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On 11 August 1997, the DILG issued Memorandum Circular No. 97-193,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> providing supplemental guidelines for the 1997 synchronized elections of the provincial and metropolitan chapters and for the election of the national chapter of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span>. The Memorandum Circular set the synchronized elections for the provincial and metropolitan chapters on 23 August 1997 and for the national chapter on 06 September 1997.<br><br>On 12 August 1997, the DILG issued a Certificate of Appointment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in favor of respondent Rayos as president of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span> of Caloocan City.&nbsp; The appointment purportedly served as Rayos’s “legal basis for <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-officio</span> membership in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Panlungsod</span> of Caloocan City” and “to qualify and participate in the forthcoming National Chapter Election of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On 23 August 1997, the DILG conducted the synchronized elections of Provincial and Metropolitan<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapters. Thereafter, on 06 September 1997, the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Chapter held its election of officers and board of directors, wherein James Marty L. Lim was elected as President of the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On 01 October 1997, public respondent judge denied David’s motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> ruling that there was no factual or legal basis to reconsider the appointment of the DILG as interim caretaker of the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board and to cite Secretary Barbers in contempt of court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On 10 October 1997, petitioners filed the instant <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition for Certiorari</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking to annul public respondent judge’s orders of 04 August 1997 and 01 October 1997.&nbsp; They dispute the latter’s opinion on the power of supervision of the President under the Constitution, through the DILG over local governments, which is the same as that of the DILG’s as shown by its application of the power on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liga ng mga Barangay</span>.&nbsp; Specifically, they claim that the public respondent judge’s&nbsp; designation of the DILG as interim caretaker and the acts which the DILG&nbsp; sought to implement pursuant to its designation as such are beyond the scope of the Chief Executive’s power of supervision.<br><br>To support the petition, petitioners argue that under Administrative Order No. 267, Series of 1992, the power of general supervision of the President over local government units does not apply to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> and its various chapters precisely because the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> is not a local government unit, contrary to the stance of the respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Section 507 of the Local Government Code (Republic Act No. 7160)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> provides that the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> shall be governed by its own Constitution and By-laws.&nbsp; Petitioners posit that the duly elected officers and directors of the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> elected in 1994 had a vested right to their positions and could only be removed therefrom for cause by affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the entire membership pursuant to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Constitution and By-Laws, and not by mere issuances of the DILG, even if bolstered by the dubious authorization of respondent judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, petitioners claim that the questioned order divested the then incumbent officers and directors of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> of their right to their respective offices without due process of law.<br><br>Assuming the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> could be subsumed under the term “local governments,” over which the President, through the DILG Secretary, has the power of supervision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> petitioners point out that still there is no legal or constitutional basis for the appointment of the DILG as interim caretaker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> They stress that the actions contemplated by the DILG as interim caretaker go beyond supervision, as what it had sought and obtained was authority to alter, modify, nullify or set aside the actions of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board of Directors&nbsp; and even to substitute its judgment over that of the latter — which are all clearly one of control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Petitioners question the appointment of Rayos as<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>-Caloocan President since at that time petitioner David was occupying that position which was still the subject of the quo <span style="font-style: italic;">warranto</span> proceedings Rayos himself had instituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Petitioners likewise claim that DILG Memorandum Circular No. 97-193, providing supplemental guidelines for the synchronized elections of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>, replaced the implementing rules adopted by the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> pursuant to its Constitution and By-laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In fact, even before its appointment as interim caretaker, DILG specifically enjoined all heads of government units from recognizing petitioner David and/or honoring any of his pronouncements relating to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioners rely on decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Taule v. Santos</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which, they claim, already passed upon the “extent of authority of the then Secretary of Local Government over the <span style="font-style: italic;">katipunan ng mga</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> barangay </span>or the barangay councils,” as it specifically ruled that the “Secretary [of Local Government] has no authority to pass upon the validity or regularity of the election of officers of the katipunan.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>For his part, respondent Rayos avers that since the Secretary of the DILG supervises the acts of local officials by ensuring that they act within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions and since members of the various leagues, such as the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> in this case, are themselves officials of local government units, it follows that the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> members are subject to the power of supervision of the DILG.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> He adds that as the DILG’s management and administration of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> affairs was limited only to the conduct of the elections, its actions were consistent with its rule-making power and power of supervision under existing laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He asserts that in assailing the appointment of the DILG as interim caretaker, petitioners failed to cite any provision of positive law in support of their stance. Thus, he adds, “if a law is silent, obscure or insufficient, a judge may apply a rule he sees fit to resolve the issue, as long as the rule chosen is in harmony with general interest, order, morals and public policy,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> in consonance with Article 9 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, it is quite significant that the Solicitor General has shared petitioners’ position.&nbsp; He states that the DILG’s act of managing and administering the affairs of the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board are not merely acts of supervision but plain manifestations of control and direct takeover of the functions of the National<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> Board,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> going beyond the limits of the power of general supervision of the President over local governments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Moreover, while the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Liga</span> may be deemed a government organization, it is not strictly a local government unit over which the DILG has supervisory power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on 24 September 1998, James Marty L.

The amendment of the GUIDELINES is more than an exercise of the power of supervision but is an exercise of the power of control, which the President does not have over the LIGA.&nbsp; Although the DILG is given the power to prescribe rules, regulations and other issuances, the Administrative Code limits its authority to merely “monitoring compliance by local government units of such issuances.&nbsp; To monitor means to “watch, observe or check” and is compatible with the power of supervision of the DILG Secretary over local governments, which is limited to checking whether&nbsp; the local government unit concerned or the officers thereof perform their duties as per statutory enactments.&nbsp; Besides, any doubt as to the power of the DILG Secretary to interfere with local affairs should be resolved in favor of the greater autonomy of the local government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Taule</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> the Court ruled that the Secretary of Local Government had no authority to pass upon the validity or regularity of the election of officers of <span style="font-style: italic;">katipunan ng mga</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> barangay </span>or barangay councils. &nbsp;In that case, a protest was lodged before the Secretary of Local Government regarding several irregularities in, and seeking the nullification of, the election of officers of the Federation of Associations of Barangay Councils (FABC) of Catanduanes.

The Court ruled:<blockquote>Construing the constitutional limitation on the power of general supervision of the President over local governments, We hold that respondent Secretary has no authority to pass upon the validity or regularity of the officers of the <span style="font-style: italic;">katipunan</span>. &nbsp;To allow respondent Secretary to do so will give him more power than the law or the Constitution grants.&nbsp; It will in effect give him control over local government officials for it will permit him to interfere in a purely democratic and non-partisan activity aimed at strengthening the barangay as the basic component of local governments so that the ultimate goal of fullest autonomy may be achieved.&nbsp; In fact, his order that the new elections to be conducted be presided by the Regional Director is a clear and direct interference by the Department with the political affairs of the barangays which is not permitted by the limitation of presidential power to general supervision over local governments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></blockquote>All given, the Court is convinced that the assailed order was issued with grave abuse of discretion while the acts of the respondent Secretary, including DILG Memorandum Circulars No. 97-176 and No. 97-193, are unconstitutional and <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra vires</span>, as they all entailed the conferment or exercise of control — a power which is denied by the Constitution even to the President.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span> is GRANTED.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> of the Regional Trial Court dated 04 August 1997 is SET ASIDE for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
