				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us on automatic appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Lemery, Batangas, Branch 5, in Criminal Case No. 13-95, convicting the appellant of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of “reclusion perpetua to death.”<br><br>The Information charging the appellant with the aforesaid offense alleges as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 19th day of December, 1994, at about 12:00 noon, at Brgy. Mahabang Parang, Municipality of San Luis, Province of Batangas, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a bolo (gulukan) and a knife (balisong), conspiring and confederating together acting in common accord and mutually helping each other, with intent to gain and by means of violence and intimidation against person, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, rob and carry away from one Natividad Yuzon Mendoza pieces of jewelry and cash money in the total amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), Philippine Currency, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the aforementioned amount; and that on the occasion of and by reason of the said robbery, the said accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and strangle to death said Natividad Yuzon Mendoza.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>The accused Nestor Catapang and the appellant, assisted by counsel, were arraigned for the crime charged and pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued. During the trial, accused Catapang was shot dead while attempting to escape from the Batangas Provincial Jail. Trial continued as against the appellant Lito Hernandez.<br><br><center><u>The Case for the Prosecution</u></center><br>At about 7:00 a.m. on December 19, 1994, Cesar Yuzon, a forty-four-year-old sweepstakes ticket vendor, went to the Rural Health Center of Banoyo, San Luis, Batangas, to seek medical treatment for his ailment. After receiving his daily medication from the nurse, he left the health center and went to a nearby store to wait for a ride back to his house in Barangay Mahabang Parang, San Luis, Batangas. When no public utility jeepney passed by, he started walking towards the direction of Barangay Mahabang Parang. It was about 11:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Upon reaching the boundary of Banoyo and Mahabang Parang at around 12:00 noon, he saw his cousin-in-law, the appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and Catapang dragging his seventy-two-year-old auntie, Natividad Yuzon Mendoza,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>    in the direction of a forested area where there were also mango and coconut trees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Cesar shouted, <i>“Hoy, bakit ninyo kinakaladkad ang aking tiya?”</i> Catapang and the appellant approached and told him not to interfere. Then Catapang pointed a knife at Cesar and, with the appellant, warned him not to reveal what he saw to anyone; otherwise, they would kill him and his family, including his children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The appellant and Catapang then returned to the place where Natividad was. Cesar followed them and concealed himself behind a mango tree about ten arm’s length away, and saw them forcibly taking money, a pair of earrings and a necklace from the bag of his aunt, who was lying prostrate on the ground. Catapang and the appellant positioned themselves at Natividad’s right and left side, and strangled her with the use of a white rope made of buri or vine string.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She pleaded, <i>“Huwag po, huwag po,”</i> to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Cesar hurriedly left the place on foot and went home. He kept the gory incident to himself for    fear of retaliation from the accused and the appellant.<br><br>That afternoon, Natividad’s son, Nemensio Mendoza, had already started looking for his mother. Cesar joined the search at 5:00 p.m. together with the barangay captain and some of the barangay folks. The cadaver of Natividad was found at about 11:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>SPO3 Ronald C. Macatangay and other police officers of the San Luis Police Station arrived at the scene of the crime and found the cadaver of Natividad wrapped in a piece of cloth. After taking pictures of the cadaver at different angles, it was brought to the De Guia Funeral Parlor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Dr. Antonio S. Vertido, the NBI Medico-Legal Officer, performed an autopsy on the cadaver of the victim and found injuries on the face, neck, and index finger. He also found a hematoma on the victim’s chin, possibly caused by a bladed instrument,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and a ligature mark on her neck. He concluded that the victim died because of asphyxia by ligature strangulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Cesar’s fear was heightened when Catapang and the appellant warned him anew on Christmas Eve that if he divulged to anyone what he had witnessed on December 19, 1994, they would kill him and his children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> However, on February 7, 1995, Cesar finally decided to tell his cousin, Nemensio, how Natividad died and who the perpetrators were. He narrated how he saw Catapang and the appellant rob Natividad of her money and jewelry, and then strangled her to death. He and Nemensio forthwith went to the police station where they gave their respective sworn statements to SPO3 Macatangay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Cesar and Nemensio also informed the barangay captain that Catapang and the appellant were the culprits in the killing of Natividad.<br><br><center><u>The Defense of the Appellant</u></center><br>The appellant denied killing Natividad and divesting her of her money and jewelry. He testified that he eked out a living as a sweepstakes ticket vendor, while his wife, Natividad’s niece, earned a living as a sewer of baby dresses. He also revealed that his wife’s father was the brother of Natividad.<br><br>December 19, 1994, a Sunday, was his birthday. At 12:00 noon, he had lunch at the Fresh Food restaurant in Parañaque. The following day, December 20, 1994, Juanito Yuzon informed him of Natividad’s death. He then attended Natividad’s wake, for two nights and two days. He only learned that Cesar had implicated him in the crime charged when he was arrested by policemen on April 18, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On February 8, 1999, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><ol type="1"><li> Finding the accused LITO HERNANDEZ GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of Robbery With Homicide and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA to DEATH, considering the presence of aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength, disregard of age, sex of the victim and the absence of any mitigating circumstance.<br><br></li><li> Ordering Lito Hernandez to indemnify the heirs of the deceased:<br><br>P50,000.00 – Death of Natividad Yuzon<br>61,000.00 – Actual damages, jewelries (sic) and money<br>75,000.00 – Attorney’s fees<br>50,000.00 – Moral damages<br><br></li><li> Cost of suit.</li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>On automatic appeal before this Court, the appellant contends as follows:<br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE SPECIAL COMPLEX CRIME OF RAPE (SIC) WITH HOMICIDE DESPITE THE UNCORROBORATED, INCONSISTENT AND CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED EYEWITNESS CESAR YUZON.<br><br><center>II</center><br>ASSUMING SANS ADMITTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT PERPETRATED THE SUBJECT OFFENSE, THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN APPRECIATING AGAINTS HIM THE GENERIC AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF ABUSE OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH, DISREGARD OF AGE AND SEX OF THE VICTIM.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE IN ACCUSED-APPELLANT’S FAVOR THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>The appellant avers that the trial court’s reliance on the testimony of Cesar Yuzon in convicting him of the crime charged is erroneous, because the latter failed to immediately report the incident to the barangay and police authorities and to his cousin, Nemensio, without any valid justification therefore. Cesar even joined Nemensio and the barangay officers in searching for Natividad in the afternoon of December 19, 1994; yet, he failed to reveal to them that he saw Catapang and the appellant strangle the victim and rob her of her jewelry and money.  According to the appellant, Cesar’s conduct after witnessing the crime is contrary to human experience; hence, his testimony is barren of probative weight. The appellant furthers that Cesar could not have seen the killing from a distance of thirteen or fourteen meters, as his view was blocked by tall grasses, as well as the leaves of a mango tree. Furthermore, the appellant points out that the testimony of Cesar is inconsistent on material points. Thus, the appellant concludes, the prosecution failed to prove that he and Catapang brought the victim’s money and jewelry with them when they left the crime scene.<br><br>We agree with the appellant that the natural reaction of one who witnessed the commission of a crime, especially if the victim is his kin, is to immediately and spontaneously report the case to the police authorities so that the perpetrators are charged, prosecuted and punished if found guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The principle, however, is not iron-clad.<br><br>Fear of reprisal and the natural reluctance of a witness to get involved in a criminal case are sufficient explanations for a witness’ delay in reporting the crime to the authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Such failure in making a prompt report to the proper authorities does not destroy the truth per se of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Likewise, the natural hesitance of the witnesses in this country to volunteer information about a criminal case, and their unwillingness to be involved or    dragged into a criminal investigation is common, and has been judicially    declared not to affect their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In this case, Cesar testified that when he shouted at the appellant and Catapang to stop dragging his aunt Natividad, the two confronted him and ordered him not to interfere. Then, Catapang pulled out his balisong and pointed it at Cesar. He was then warned not to reveal what he had just seen; otherwise, he and his family would be killed. Afraid for his life and those of his family, he kept the horrid    crime to himself:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td

We have ruled that where the conditions of visibility are favorable and the witness does not appear to harbor any ill motive against the malefactors, his testimony as to how the crime was committed and on the identities of perpetrators must be accepted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> There is no evidence on record of any ill motive on the part of Cesar to falsely implicate Catapang and the appellant in the heinous crime for which the latter could be sentenced to the capital penalty.<br><br>The well-entrenched rule in this jurisdiction is that the matter of ascribing substance to the testimonies of witnesses is best discharged by the trial court, and the appellate courts will not generally disturb the findings of the trial court in this respect. The rationalism is quite simple: the trial judge is in a better position to ascertain the conflicting testimonies of witnesses after having heard them and observed their deportment and mode of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Cesar’s positive identification of the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime, absent any showing of ill motive, must prevail over the appellant’s lame and obviously fabricated defenses of denial and alibi. Denials, as negative and self-serving evidence, do not deserve as much weight in law as positive and affirmative testimonies. Prevalently repeated is the rule that for alibi to countervail the evidence of the prosecution confirming the appellant’s guilt, he must prove that he was not at the locus delicti when the crime was committed and that it was also physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was perpetrated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In the case at bar, the defense utterly failed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br>Remarkable is the fact that the defense had no corroborating witness to strengthen the testimony of the appellant that he was at the Fresh Food restaurant in Parañaque at the time of the commission of the crime. Strangely, the appellant even testified that he was certain that December 19, 1994 was a Sunday, because it also happened to be his birthday. The trial court, however, took judicial notice of the fact that December 19, 1994 was a Monday, thereby further debilitating the appellant’s defense.<br><br>The appellant’s claim that he cannot be convicted of robbery because the prosecution failed to prove that, after divesting Natividad of her money and jewelry, he and Catapang carried the same with them when they left the <i>situs criminus</i> is barren of merit.<br><br>In robbery, there must be an unlawful taking or apoderamiento which is defined as the taking of items without the consent of the owner, or by means of violence against or intimidation of persons, or by using force upon things.

It is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in the commission of the crime that has to be taken into consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> There is no such felony of robbery with homicide through reckless imprudence or simple negligence. The constitutive elements of the crime, namely, robbery and homicide, must be consummated.<br><br>When homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion of robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery would also be held liable as principals of the single and indivisible felony of robbery with homicide although they did not actually take part in the killing, unless it clearly appears that they endeavored to prevent the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>All those who conspire to commit robbery with homicide are guilty as principals of such crime, although not all profited and gained from the robbery. One who joins a criminal conspiracy adopts the criminal designs of his co-conspirators and can no longer repudiate the conspiracy once it has materialized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Homicide is said to have been committed by reason or on the occasion of robbery if, for instance, it was committed to (a) facilitate the robbery or the escape of the culprit; (b) to preserve the possession by the culprit of the loot; (c) to prevent discovery of the commission of the robbery; or, (d) to eliminate witnesses in the commission of the crime. As long as there is a nexus between the robbery and the homicide, the latter crime may be committed in a place other than the situs of the robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In this case, the appellant conspired with Catapang in committing the crime charged in the light of the evidence on record. The original design of the appellant and his cohort was to rob the victim. They did rob the victim, and then strangled her to death.<br><br>We disagree with the trial court’s finding that abuse of superior strength, disregard of sex and age, were attendant in the commission of the crime. Section 8, Rule 110 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure now explicitly requires the complaint or information to “state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and <i>specify the qualifying and aggravating circumstances.”</i> Under the old rule, only the qualifying circumstances were needed to be alleged in order to be considered by the court. The present rules, however, require even the aggravating circumstances to be alleged in the complaint or information. The information in the present case failed to precisely aver that abuse of superior strength and disregard of age and sex attended the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Although the rule took effect only on December 1, 2000 and it was the old law that was in effect at the time of the commission of the crime, the same may be applied retroactively insofar as it benefits the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and disregard of age and sex cannot be appreciated as no evidence was presented to prove the same. To establish the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, there must be a deliberate intent on the part of the malefactors to take advantage of their greater number. They must have nefariously selected and made use of superior strength in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As an aggravating circumstance, what should be considered is not that there are two or more assailants as against one victim, but whether the aggressors took advantage of their combined strength in order to consummate the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>With respect to disregard of age and sex, the Court has pronounced in the case of People v. Collado<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that the same may be appreciated only in crimes against persons or honor. It is not correct to consider this aggravating circumstance in crimes against property. Besides, robbery with homicide is principally a crime against property and not against persons. Homicide is a mere incident of the robbery, the latter being the main purpose and object of the criminal. Moreover, it has not been proven that in committing the crime, the appellant determinedly intended to offend or insult the age and sex of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender is not present in the case at bar. To benefit an accused, the following requisites of this circumstance must be proven, namely: (1) <i>the offender has not actually been arrested;</i> (2) <i>the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority; and (3) the surrender was voluntary.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> A surrender is said to be voluntary when it is done by the accused spontaneously and made in such manner that it shows the intent of the accused to surrender unconditionally to authorities, either because he acknowledges his guilt or he wishes to save them the trouble and expense necessarily incurred in his search and capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In this case, there is no indication in the record that the appellant, of his own accord, came forward and presented himself before the authorities, manifesting his desire to spare the Government the time, effort and expense of pursuing him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The appellant surrendered only after the warrant of arrest was served upon him. The fact that the appellant did not defy but went peacefully with the arresting officer does not mean that he voluntarily surrendered. Hence, this mitigating circumstance can not be appreciated in favor of the appellant.<br><br>There being neither aggravating nor modifying circumstances that attended the commission of robbery with homicide, the appellant should be meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> conformably to Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The award of P50,000 as civil indemnity for the death of Natividad Yuzon Mendoza should be upheld without need of proof for being in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence. Similarly, the appellant is liable to pay P50,000 as moral damages to the heirs of the victim for the pain and sorrow they suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The prosecution in this case adduced evidence to prove the factual basis for an award therefor.<br><br>However, we find that the grant of P61,000 as actual damages is not properly supported by the evidence on record. The trial court relied exclusively on the testimony of Nemensio Mendoza, the victim’s son, with respect to the amount of burial expenses. Further, there was insufficient basis for the award as only the receipt of Funeraria De Guia (Contract Invoice No. 333) amounting to P11,000 as proof of funeral expenses, was presented in evidence. Thus, this award should be reduced accordingly. Nevertheless, the heirs are entitled to temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Likewise, nothing on the record manifests the actual expenses incurred by the heirs of Natividad for attorney’s fees. Attorney’s fees are in the concept of actual or compensatory damages allowed under the circumstances provided for in Article 2208 of the Civil Code, one of which is when the court deems it just and equitable that attorney’s fees should be recovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In this case, we find the award of P75,000 as attorney’s fees unsupported by evidence and, therefore, should be deleted for lack of basis.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed Decision dated February 8, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Lemery, Batangas, Branch 5, in Criminal Case No. 13-95 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATIONS</b>.
