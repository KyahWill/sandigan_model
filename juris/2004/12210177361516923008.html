				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner David B. Dedel met respondent Sharon L. Corpuz Dedel while he was working in the advertising business of his father.  The acquaintance led to courtship and romantic relations, culminating in the exchange of marital vows before the City Court of Pasay on September 28, 1966.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  The civil marriage was ratified in a church wedding on May 20, 1967.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The union produced four children, namely: Beverly Jane, born on September 18, 1968;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Stephanie Janice born on September 9, 1969;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Kenneth David born on April 24, 1971;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and Ingrid born on October 20, 1976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  The conjugal partnership, nonetheless, acquired neither property nor debt.<br><br>Petitioner avers that during the marriage, Sharon turned out to be an irresponsible and immature wife and mother.  She had extra-marital affairs with several men: a dentist in the Armed Forces of the Philippines; a Lieutenant in the Presidential Security Command and later a Jordanian national.<br><br>Sharon was once confirmed in the Manila Medical City for treatment by Dr. Lourdes Lapuz, a clinical psychiatrist.  Petitioner alleged that despite the treatment, Sharon did not stop her illicit relationship with the Jordanian national named Mustafa Ibrahim, whom she married and with whom she had two children.  However, when Mustafa Ibrahim left the country, Sharon returned to petitioner bringing along her two children by Ibrahim.  Petitioner accepted her back and even considered the two illegitimate children as his own.  Thereafter, on December 9, 1995, Sharon abandoned petitioner to join Ibrahim in Jordan with their two children.  Since then, Sharon would only return to the country on special occasions.<br><br>Finally, giving up all hope of a reconciliation with Sharon, petitioner filed on April 1, 1997 a petition seeking the declaration of nullity of his marriage on the ground of psychological incapacity, as defined in Article 36 of the Family Code, before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 149.  Summons was effected by publication in the <i>Pilipino Star Ngayon</i>, a newspaper of general circulation in the country considering that Sharon did not reside and could not be found in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioner presented Dr. Natividad A. Dayan, who testified that she conducted a psychological evaluation of petitioner and found him to be conscientious, hardworking, diligent, a perfectionist who wants all tasks and projects completed up to the final detail and who exerts his best in whatever he does.<br><br>On the other hand, Dr. Dayan declared that Sharon was suffering from Anti-Social Personality Disorder exhibited by her blatant display of infidelity; that she committed several indiscretions and had no capacity for remorse, even bringing with her the two children of Mustafa Ibrahim to live with petitioner.  Such immaturity and irresponsibility in handling the marriage like her repeated acts of infidelity and abandonment of her family are indications of Anti-Social Personality Disorder amounting to psychological incapacity to perform the essential obligations of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After trial, judgment was rendered, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the civil and church marriages between DAVID B. DEDEL and SHARON L. CORPUZ celebrated on September 28, 1966 and May 20, 1967 are hereby declared null and void on the ground of psychological incapacity on the part of the respondent to perform the essential obligations of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code.<br><br>Accordingly, the conjugal partnership of gains existing between the    parties is dissolved and in lieu thereof a regime of complete separation of property between the said spouses is established in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the Family Code, without prejudice to rights previously acquired by creditors.<br><br>Let a copy of this Decision be duly recorded in the proper civil and property registries in accordance with Article 52 of the Family Code.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent Republic of the Philippines, through the Solicitor General, appealed alleging that –<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE PETITION DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A VALID GROUND FOR DECLARATION OF NULLITY OF MARRIAGE.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DECLARING THAT THE CHURCH MARRIAGE BETWEEN PETITIONER IS NULL AND VOID.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RENDERING A DECISION WITHOUT A CERTIFICATION HAVING BEEN ISSUED BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL AS REQUIRED IN THE <i>MOLINA</i> CASE.<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals recalled and set aside the judgment of the trial court and ordered dismissal of the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated January 8, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the appellate court gravely abused its discretion and manifestly erred in its conclusion that the: (1) respondent was not suffering from psychological incapacity to perform her marital obligations; (2) psychological incapacity of respondent is not attended by gravity, juridical antecedence and permanence or incurability; and (3) totality of evidence submitted by the petitioner falls short to prove psychological incapacity suffered by respondent.<br><br>The main question for resolution is whether or not the totality of the evidence presented is enough to sustain a finding that respondent is psychologically incapacitated.  More specifically, does the aberrant sexual behavior of respondent adverted to by petitioner fall within the term “psychological incapacity?”<br><br>In <i>Santos v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> it was ruled:<br><blockquote>x x x “psychological incapacity” should refer to no less than a mental (not physical) incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage which, as so expressed in Article 68 of the Family Code, include their mutual obligations to live together, observe love, respect and fidelity and render help and support.  There is hardly any doubt that the intendment of the law has been to confine the meaning of “psychological incapacity” to the most serious cases of personality disorders clearly demonstrative of an utter insensitivity of inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage.  This psychological condition must exist at the time the marriage is celebrated.  The law does not evidently envision, upon the other hand, an inability of the spouse to have sexual relations with the other.  This conclusion is implicit under Article 54 of the Family Code which considers children conceived prior to the judicial declaration of nullity of the void marriage to be “legitimate.”<br><br>The other forms of psychoses, if existing at the inception of marriage, like the state of a party being of unsound mind or concealment of drug addiction, habitual alcoholism, homosexuality or lesbianism, merely renders the marriage contract <i>voidable </i>pursuant to Article 46, Family Code.  If drug addiction, habitual alcoholism, lesbianism or homosexuality should occur only during the marriage, they become mere grounds for legal separation under Article 55 of the Family Code.  These provisions, however, do not necessarily preclude the possibility of these various circumstances being themselves, depending on the degree and severity of the disorder, <i>indicia</i> of psychological incapacity.<br><br>Until further statutory and jurisprudential parameters are established, every circumstance that may have some bearing on the degree, extent and other conditions of that incapacity must, in every case, be    carefully examined and evaluated so that no precipitate and indiscriminate nullity is peremptorily decreed.  The well-considered opinion of psychiatrists, psychologists and persons with expertise in psychological disciplines might be helpful or even desirable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>The difficulty in resolving the problem lies in the fact that a personality disorder is a very complex and elusive phenomenon which defies easy analysis and definition.  In this case, respondent’s sexual infidelity can hardly qualify as being mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that she could not have known the obligations she was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given a valid assumption thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It appears that respondent’s promiscuity did not exist<i> prior</i> to or at the inception of the marriage.  What is, in fact, disclosed by the records is a blissful marital union at its celebration, later affirmed in church rites, and which produced four children.<br><br>Respondent’s sexual infidelity or perversion and abandonment do not by themselves constitute psychological incapacity within the contemplation of the Family Code.  Neither could her emotional immaturity and irresponsibility be equated with psychological incapacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  It must be shown that these acts are manifestations of a <i>disordered personality</i> which make respondent <i>completely</i> unable to discharge the essential obligations of the marital state, not merely due to her youth, immaturity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> or sexual promiscuity.<br><br>At best, the circumstances relied upon by petitioner are grounds for legal separation under Article 55<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Family Code.  However, we pointed out in <i>Marcos v. Marcos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that Article 36 is <i>not</i> to be equated with legal separation in which the grounds need not be rooted in psychological incapacity but on physical violence, moral pressure, civil interdiction, drug addiction, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity, abandonment and the like.  In short, the evidence presented by petitioner refers only to grounds for legal separation, not for declaring a marriage void.<br><br>We likewise agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court has no jurisdiction to dissolve the church marriage of petitioner and respondent.  The authority to do so is exclusively lodged with the Ecclesiastical Court of the Roman Catholic Church.<br><br>All told, we find no cogent reason to disturb the ruling of the appellate court.  We cannot deny the grief, frustration and even desperation of petitioner in his present situation.  Regrettably, there are circumstances, like in this case, where neither law nor society can provide the    specific answers to every individual problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While we sympathize with petitioner’s marital predicament, our first and foremost duty is to apply the law no matter how harsh it may be.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
