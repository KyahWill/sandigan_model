The prosecution presented Nestor Labayan[e], [Private Complainant] Teresita Dangalan-Mendoza, [Barangay] Tanod Julian Lascano, Alexander Mendones [and] Manuel Dangalan as its witnesses.&nbsp; The defense, on the other hand, presented accused Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr., Rosalio Bon and Virgilio Bon.<br><br>“The evidence for the prosecution [w]as synthesized by the trial court, as follows:<br><blockquote>‘Prosecution’s evidence was supplied by Julian Lascano, Oscar Narvaez, Alexander Mendones, Manuel Dangalan, Nestor Labayan[e] and Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] which shows that Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] owns a titled agricultural land under Title No. 6666 located in Basud, Sorsogon, Sorsogon, administered by Virgilio Bon.&nbsp; Receiving information that trees inside the land were being stolen, cut [and] sawed into lumber by her administrator and/or workers, she sent her brother Manuel Dangalan to investigate the report.&nbsp; On February 7, 1990, Manuel Dangalan sought the help of Barangay Captain Nestor Labayane, who in turn wrote a letter to one of the [b]arangay [t]anod[s], Julian Lascano, to assist and investigate Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza’s] complaint of Illegal Cutting of Trees.&nbsp; On February 12, 1990, together with Julian Lascano, Manuel Dangalan, Ricardo Valladolid, Natividad Legaspi and Virgilio Bon repaired to the land of Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza].&nbsp; During their investigation, the group discovered six (6) stumps of trees[:] four (4) Narra trees, one cuyao-yao tree and one am[u]gis tree.&nbsp; Pictures were taken of the stumps x x x.&nbsp; On the land, Virgilio Bon admitted ordering the cutting and sawing of the trees into lumber.&nbsp; Oscar Narvaez testified that sometime in January, 1990, he sawed the trees into six flitches upon instruction of Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr.; Alexander Mendones, CENRO Officer, upon complaint of Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] for Illegal Cutting of Trees repaired to the land on July 17, 1990, and found four stumps of trees.&nbsp; Scaling the four stumps, it was his estimate that the lumber produced was 11.97 cubic meters o[r] 4,315 board feet, with a value of P25,376.00 x x x.’<br></blockquote>“In their defense, all the three accused took the witness stand and denied the accusation. Their testimonies were summarized by the trial court, as follows:<br><blockquote>‘All the accused testified in their defense.&nbsp; Rosalio Bon, the son of Virgilio Bon denied the charge[.] [He said] that he was in Manila from December 1989 and returned to Sorsogon on March 21, 1990.&nbsp; He mentioned that the purpose of filing this case was to eject his father as tenant of the land.<br><br>‘Virgilio Bon testified that he is the tenant of the land of Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] [and was] instituted [as such] by Teresita’s father.&nbsp; He developed the land[,] planting coconuts, abaca and fruit trees.&nbsp; Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] wanted to eject him as tenant. He and the private complainant [have] an agrarian case.&nbsp; Since Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] refused to receive the landowner’s share of produce, he deposited the money in the Rural Bank of Sorsogon in the name of Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] x x x. He denied cutting and gathering the trees in the land and pointed to Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] as the one who ordered the trees [to be cut] and sawed by Oscar Narvaez.&nbsp; Teresita [Dangalan-Mendoza] upon being confronted about the cutting of trees, ignored his complaint.<br><br>‘Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr., son-in-law of Virgilio Bon, denied that he hired Oscar Narvaez to saw the lumber.&nbsp; Oscar Narvaez [indicted] him of the crime because the former had a grudge against him.&nbsp; In a drinking spree, he happened to box Oscar Narvaez[,] after [which he] heard [the latter threaten him with] revenge.’<br></blockquote>“On August 23, 1993, the trial court rendered its decision convicting [Petitioner] Virgilio Bon and Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr. for the crime charged. Co-accused Rosalio Bon was acquitted.&nbsp; Aggrieved by the said decision, [Petitioner] Virgilio Bon and Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr. interposed [an] appeal [to the CA].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>In their appeal to the CA, petitioner and Jeniebre questioned the prosecution witnesses’ credibility and the sufficiency of the evidence proving their guilt.<br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>The CA sustained the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of Prosecution Witnesses Julian Lascano and Manuel Dangalan. Both testified that petitioner had admitted to having ordered the cutting of trees on Teresita Dangalan-Mendoza’s land.<br><br>Furthermore, the appellate court held that despite the absence of direct evidence in this case, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to convict petitioner.&nbsp; It ruled that the requirements for the sufficiency of the latter type of evidence under Section 4 of Rule 133<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the Rules of Court were amply satisfied by the following established facts: 1) in the presence of Dangalan, Lascano and Natividad Legaspi, petitioner admitted that he had ordered the cutting of the trees; 2) on February 12, 1990, he and his son Rosalio went to Dangalan-Mendoza, demanding that she pay the value of the trees cut; and 3) on February 13, 1990, petitioner&nbsp; asked her to forgive him for cutting the trees.<br><br>The CA held, however, that the same circumstances did not support the conviction of Jeniebre.&nbsp; Aside from the testimony of Oscar Narvaez that Jeniebre hired him to cut the trees into flitches, no other evidence was presented to show the latter’s participation in the offense charged.&nbsp; Moreover, the appellate court held that the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule under Section 28 of Rule 130<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the Rules of Court would be violated by binding Jeniebre to petitioner’s admission, which did not constitute any of the exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to this provision. It thus acquitted him.<br><br>As to petitioner, the CA modified the penalty imposed, pursuant to Section 68 of the Revised Forestry Code as amended, Articles 309 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code, and Section 1 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]<br><br></sup><center><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioner submits the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><center>“I<br></center><br>Whether hearsay testimony[,] which is denied by the alleged author under oath in open court, is admissible in evidence against him.<br><center><br>“II<br></center><br>Whether hearsay testimony allegedly made to potential prosecution witnesses who are not police operatives or media representatives is admissible in evidence against the author because what a man says against himself[,] if voluntary, is believable for the reason that it is fair to presume that [it] correspond[s] with the truth and it is his fault if they do not (U.S. v. Ching Po, 23 Phil. 578, 583 (1912).<br><center><br>“III<br></center><br>Whether or not x x x the [testimonies of the] prosecution witnesses x x x that x x x petitioner Bon admitted his guilt to them should be given high credence by the courts of justice considering that x x x many people who are being quoted in media today x x x have been found to be x x x&nbsp; lying.&nbsp; In other words, how much probity should we give a lying witness?<br><center><br>“IV<br></center><br>Assuming arguendo that petitioner Bon ma[d]e the extra-judicial admission to the prosecution witnesses, [whether or not] x x x the same [is constitutionally] admissible in evidence against him?”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Simply put, the points challenged by petitioner are as follows: 1) the admissibility of his purported extrajudicial admission of the allegation, testified to by the prosecution witnesses, that he had ordered the cutting of the trees; and 2) the credibility and the sufficiency of the testimonies of those witnesses. <br><center><br><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>First Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Admissibility of the Extrajudicial Admission</i></u></b><br></div><br>At the outset, it must be emphasized that the present Petition is grounded on Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Under Section 1 thereof, “only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth” may be raised. A reading of the pleadings reveals that petitioner actually raised questions of fact --the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence against him.&nbsp; Nonetheless, this Court, in the exercise of its sound discretion and after taking into account the attendant circumstances, opts to take cognizance of and decide the factual issues raised in the Petition, in the interest of the proper administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the main, petitioner contends that Lascano’s and Dangalan’s separate testimonies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> regarding his alleged extrajudicial admission constitute hearsay evidence and are, therefore, inadmissible.&nbsp; He also argues that his supposed admission should not have been admitted, because it had been taken without the assistance of counsel at a time when he was already regarded as a suspect.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Section 36 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court states the rule on hearsay evidence as follows:<br><blockquote>“Sec. 36. <i>Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded</i>. - A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception, except as otherwise provided in these rules.”<br></blockquote>Under the above rule, any evidence -- whether oral or documentary -- is hearsay if its probative value is not based on the personal knowledge of the witness, but on that of some other person who is not on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Hence, information that is relayed to the former by the latter before it reaches the court is considered hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, Lascano and Dangalan testified that on February 12, 1990, they had heard petitioner admit to having ordered the cutting of the trees.&nbsp; Their testimonies cannot be considered as hearsay for three reasons.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, they were indisputably present and within hearing distance when he allegedly made the admission. Therefore, they testified to a matter of fact that had been derived from their own perception.<br><br><i>Second</i>, what was sought to be admitted as evidence was the fact that the utterance was actually made by petitioner, not necessarily that the matters stated therein were true.&nbsp; On this basis, a statement attributed to a person who is not on the witness stand is admissible; it is not covered by the hearsay rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Gotesco Investment Corporation v. Chatto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> ruled that evidence regarding the making of such statement is not secondary but primary, because the statement itself may constitute a fact in issue or be circumstantially relevant as to the existence of that fact.<br><br><i>Third</i>, even assuming that the testimonies were hearsay, petitioner is barred from questioning the admission of Dangalan’s testimony, because he failed to object to it at the time it was offered.&nbsp; It has been held that when parties fail to object to hearsay evidence, they are deemed to have waived their right to do so; thus, it may be admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The absence of an objection is clearly shown by the transcript of the stenographic notes, from which we quote:<blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"Atty.

This kind of evidence, however, is not the only matrix from which the trial court may draw its conclusions and findings of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Conviction may be based on circumstantial evidence, as long as the circumstances proven constitute an unbroken chain that leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>To sustain a conviction based on circumstantial evidence, it is necessary that the following elements concur:<br><ol><li>There is more than one circumstance.<br><br></li><li>The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven.<br><br></li><li>The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></li></ol>Did the circumstances in this case satisfy the above requirements? We rule in the affirmative.&nbsp; In its assessment of the evidence, the regional trial court (RTC) considered the following proven facts and circumstances:<br><blockquote>“x x x Accused Virgilio Bon[,] being the tenant is in actual possession and control over the land, fruit trees and big trees.&nbsp; Virgilio Bon has a better chance to cut and saw the lumber. He admitted before the [b]arangay [t]anod[,] Julian Lascano[,] with other witnesses present[,] that he ordered the cutting of the trees[, and the] saw[ing thereof] by his son-in-law, accused Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr. His admission was corroborated by Oscar Narvaez, the one hired by Alejandro Jeniebre, Jr., to saw the lumber. His extrajudicial confession is admissible evidence against him as it was voluntary and not under custodial investigation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court, on the other hand, found that the following circumstances sufficiently proved petitioner’s culpability:<br><blockquote>“x x x (1) [Petitioner] Virgilio Bon admitted in the presence of Manuel Dangalan, Julian Lascano and Natividad Legaspi that he caused the cutting of the questioned trees; (2) [o]n February 12, 1990, [Petitioner] Virgilio Bon and his son[,] x x x Rosalio Bon[,] went to private complainant[,] demanding [that] the latter x x x pay the value of the questioned trees which they had cut; (3) [o]n February 13, 1990, [Petitioner] Virgilio Bon went to private complainant to ask forgiveness for cutting the trees.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>A review of the records also shows that the fact of the alleged cutting, gathering and manufacture of lumber from the trees was proven by the prosecution through the following pieces of documentary evidence: photographs of tree stumps,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the investigation report of an officer of the Community Environment and Natural Resources (CENRO) that no permit was secured for the cutting of the trees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and the CENRO’s computation of the value<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the timber generated from the felled trees.&nbsp; This fact, together with the circumstantial evidence, indubitably points to no other conclusion than that petitioner was guilty as charged.<br><br><b><u><i>Correct Penalty</i></u></b><br><br>We now go to the penalty.&nbsp; We deem it necessary to discuss this matter because of the differing penalties imposed by the appellate and the trial courts.&nbsp; The RTC imposed an indeterminate sentence of seven (7) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum; to eleven (11) years, six (6) months and twenty-one (21) days of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum.&nbsp; The CA, however, increased the penalty to imprisonment ranging from ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum; to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months <i>of reclusion temporal</i> as maximum.<br><br>Article 68 of the Revised Forestry Law, as amended by Executive Order No. 277,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> provides that any violation thereof “shall be punished with the penalties imposed under Articles 309<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and 310<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of Revised Penal Code.” This amendment -- which eliminated the phrase “shall be guilty of qualified theft as defined and punished under Articles 309 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code” -- has already been interpreted by this Court.&nbsp; According to its interpretation, the quoted phrase means that the acts of cutting, gathering, collecting, removing or possessing forest products without authority constitute distinct offenses that are now independent of the crime of theft under Articles 309 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), but that the penalty to be imposed is that which is provided under these articles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Both the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> found that the value of the lumber was P12,000.&nbsp; Under Articles 309 and 310 of the RPC, the statutory penalty should be two degrees higher than <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium and maximum periods;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> or <i>prision mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its minimum period.&nbsp; The Indeterminate Sentence Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> however, reduces the sentence to an indeterminate penalty anywhere in the range of&nbsp; six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to 14 years and eight (8) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum.&nbsp; Clearly, the sentences imposed by the trial court and the CA are within the allowable range.&nbsp; In view, however, of the finding of the RTC that no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the offense, the penalty it imposed was more in accord with the liberal spirit of the law towards the accused.&nbsp; Hence, we adopt the trial court’s indeterminate sentence of seven (7) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum; to eleven (11) years, six (6) months and twenty-one (21) days of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b> with the <b><i>MODIFICATION</i></b> that petitioner is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of seven (7) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum;
