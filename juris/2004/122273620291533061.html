				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us on automatic review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 15 August 2001 of the Regional Trial Court of Lipa City, Branch 12 (“trial court”), in Criminal Case No. 0759-99. The trial court convicted appellant Geronimo Boromeo y Marco (“appellant”) of rape and sentenced him to suffer the death penalty.<br><br>On 22 October 1999, Second Assistant City Prosecutor Danilo S. Sandoval filed an information charging appellant with rape under Article 266-A, 1(d), and Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 19th day of October, 1999 at about 10:30 o’clock in the evening, at Sitio Paninsingin, Barangay Tambo, Lipa City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a common law spouse of the mother of herein victim, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Christine Liezel Mendoza y Tiqui[s], a ten (10) year old minor against her will and consent to her damage and prejudice in such amount as may be awarded to her under the provisions of the Civil Code.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned on 10 November 1999, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented two witnesses: the victim Christine Liezel Mendoza, and Dr. Aletha Silang, Medico-Legal Officer III of the Lipa City District Hospital.<br><br>Born in Lipa City on 23 January 1990, Christine Liezel Mendoza (“Christine”) is one of Luzviminda C. Tiquis’ (“Luzviminda”) eight children with Sevilla R. Mendoza (“Sevilla”). Luzviminda and Sevilla were lawfully married on 16 November 1980<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> but later separated. Sometime in 1997, Luzviminda started living-in with appellant, a sidewalk vendor. Of her eight children with Sevilla, only Christine, four-year old Maria Vena, and two-year old Deo lived with Luzviminda and appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Christine testified that on 19 October 1999, around 10:30 o’clock in the evening, she and appellant were in their house in Paninsingin, Tambo, Lipa City. Deo was also in the house sleeping. Luzviminda was then attending a relative’s wake.<br><br>Christine testified that appellant ordered her to go inside their room. She obeyed. Appellant then took off his clothes. Without removing Christine’s T-shirt and shorts, the only garments she was wearing, appellant placed himself on top of Christine. Christine stated that appellant forcibly inserted his organ into hers through the hole in her shorts. She felt pain. Christine further stated that appellant had “partially” penetrated her genitalia when Luzviminda suddenly arrived and caught appellant on top of her.<br><br>Luzviminda was furious on seeing what appellant was doing to Christine. Christine recalled Luzviminda warning appellant that she would have him jailed. Christine and    Luzviminda then left their house and went to the house of Virginia Tiquis (“Virginia”), Luzviminda’s mother. Christine stated that Luzviminda did not tell Virginia about the rape incident. However, when Virginia learned of the rape, Luzviminda decided to bring Christine to the Lipa City Police Station to file a complaint against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Christine executed a <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> narrating how appellant raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She confirmed the contents of her sworn statement during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Luzviminda also executed her sworn statement, as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">04.

Dr. Silang issued a medico-legal report with the following    findings:<br><blockquote>This is to certify that I have attended CHRISTINE LIEZEL MENDOZA, 10 years of age, female, child, Filipino, of Paninsingin, Tambo, Lipa City at about 7:55 a.m., October 21, 1999 with the following injuries sustained:<br><br>- No external signs of physical injury.<br><br>- Genitalia – hymen intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>For its part, the defense presented two witnesses: appellant himself and Luzviminda Tiquis.<br><br>Appellant denied the accusation against him. Appellant recounted that after selling his merchandise that afternoon of 19 October 1999, his friends invited him to a drinking spree. They started to drink at 6 o’clock in the evening. On reaching home at 8 o’clock that night, appellant immediately went to their bedroom and slept, as he was drunk. He woke up when Luzviminda arrived at 11 o’clock in the evening, without her children whom she left at a nearby store. Earlier that evening, Luzviminda and her children had left the house to attend a relative’s wake.<br><br>Luzviminda was furious and became shrill because she saw her <i>Kumareng</i> Elena sleeping beside appellant. Luzviminda had accommodated Elena in their house because of Elena’s marital problems. Realizing Luzviminda was jealous, appellant explained to her that he “happened to sleep beside Elena” because he was drunk when he came home. Appellant asserted that he and Elena were not doing anything wrong. Elena also tried to explain the matter to Luzviminda, but Luzviminda would not listen. As Luzviminda would not stop nagging him, appellant boxed and kicked her. When Luzviminda retaliated, appellant slapped her.<br><br>Appellant then left the house and spent the whole evening at the    bus stop in Mataas na Lupa, Lipa City. He was about to sell his goods at the bus stop the next day when a police officer arrived and arrested him. The police officer brought appellant to the Lipa City Police Station where the police investigated him for allegedly raping Christine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>To corroborate his testimony, appellant presented Luzviminda who testified that when she, Christine and Maria Vena left their house at 6 o’clock in the evening of 19 October 1999 to attend a relative’s wake, appellant was left alone resting in their living room. Appellant could not go with them to the wake because he was drunk. When she and her children returned home at 10:30 o’clock in the evening, Luzviminda was surprised to see appellant sleeping beside Elena in their bedroom. She was so angry that she kicked appellant. Appellant kicked and slapped her in retaliation. Appellant then left the house.<br><br>Luzviminda asserted that it was not true that appellant raped Christine. Luzviminda stated that she was just jealous and wanted to get back at appellant. Hence, she reported the rape incident to the police and filed a complaint against appellant. Luzviminda accompanied the police in their search for appellant. On 20 October 1999, around 8 o’clock in the morning, they found and arrested appellant at the bus stop in Mataas na Lupa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, the trial court found that appellant raped Christine. The trial court gave full credence to Christine’s testimony “which was positive and given in a straightforward, clear and convincing manner.” The trial court noted that “during the cross-examination, she was unwavering and her answers were consistent; she never changed her account of what transpired.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The dispositive part<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the trial court’s decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, GERONIMO BOROMEO, guilty    beyond reasonable doubt, as principal by direct participation of the crime of Rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A 1(d) and Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act Nos. 7659 and 8353, sentences him to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH, to indemnify [Christine] Liezel Mendoza in the amount of P75,000.00, to pay her moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the cost.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<br><blockquote>Appellant assigns the following errors:<br><ol type="I"><li> The trial court erred in finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br></li><li> Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that appellant is guilty of the crime charged, nonetheless, the trial court erred in imposing on him the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>On 13 February 2003, the Office of the Solicitor General filed its Appellee’s Brief praying that this Court affirm in toto the trial court’s decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On 14 March 2003, appellant filed his Reply Brief reiterating the same arguments he pleaded to seek an acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>We affirm the judgment of conviction.<br><br>In criminal cases, an appeal throws the whole case wide open for review. The reviewing tribunal can correct errors or even reverse the trial court’s decision on grounds other than those that the parties raise as errors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Appellant points to the results of the medical examination on Christine showing the absence of hymenal laceration on her genitals. Appellant claims that the medical report shows that Christine’s hymen remained intact. Appellant asserts that these findings are incompatible with Christine’s claim that appellant forced his organ into hers, much less, that appellant raped her in the evening of 19 October 1999. Appellant also submits that the medical findings show no visible signs of physical injury even though Christine was of tender age at the time of the alleged rape. Appellant argues that if it were true that he raped Christine, “it is unbelievable that no external physical injuries or unusual findings could be noted on her body.”<br><br>Appellant’s arguments do not persuade us.<br><br>In a rape case, what is most important is the credible testimony of the victim. A medical examination and a medical certificate are merely corroborative and are not indispensable to a prosecution for rape. The court may convict the accused based solely on the victim’s credible, natural, and convincing testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Proof of hymenal laceration is not an element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> An intact hymen does not negate a finding that the victim was raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> To sustain a conviction for rape, full penetration of the female genital organ is not necessary. It is enough that there is proof of entry of the male organ into the <i>labia</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> of the female organ. Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the vagina, even without laceration of the hymen, is enough to constitute rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and even the briefest of contact is deemed rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As long as the attempt to insert the penis results in contact with the lips of the vagina, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, the rape is consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In <b><i>People v. Tampos,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court held that rape is committed on the victim’s testimony that she felt pain.<br><br>In the present case, Christine testified that appellant was able “to partially insert his private organ into hers,” because of which she felt pain. Christine further testified that appellant failed to “fully insert his private organ into hers because Luzviminda arrived.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Christine’s hymen remained intact because there was no full penetration due to Luzviminda’s sudden arrival at the house.<br><br>Rape is committed when the accused has carnal knowledge of the victim by force, threat or intimidation, or when the victim is deprived of reason or is unconscious, or when the victim is under 12 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Based on the records, the prosecution proved that appellant had carnal knowledge of Christine.<br><br>If the victim’s testimony meets the test of credibility, that is    enough to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> We entertain no doubt that Christine told the truth. Her testimony was clear, candid and consistent. She positively identified appellant as her rapist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> On the witness stand, Christine testified thus:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q</td><td width="90%">On October 19, 1999, around 10:30 o’clock in the evening, where were you if you can still remember?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>I was in our house sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">While you were in your house on that date, October 19, 1999, around 10:30 o’clock in the evening, do you know the whereabouts of Geronimo Boromeo or your Kuya Ronnie?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He was also at home sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">Do you know whether he did anything unusual to you on October 19, 1999 around 10:30 o’clock in the evening?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>What was it?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He ordered me to go inside the room sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>After you were ordered to go inside the room, did you follow his instruction?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>After that, after you entered inside the room, what did your Kuya Ronnie do if he did anything?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Ginalaw po niya ako.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>What did you mean by ginalaw ka?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He placed himself on top of me sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><u><strong>What else did he do when your Kuya went on top of you?</strong></u></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><u><strong>He placed his private organ inside my private organ sir.</strong></u></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><strong><u>Was Geronimo Boromeo or your Kuya Ronnie able to insert his private organ fully to your private organ?</u></strong></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><strong><u>No sir, because my mother arrived.</u></strong></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify"><u><strong>When your Kuya Ronnie inserted his private organ into your private organ which he was not able to insert fully, what did you feel in your private organ?</strong></u></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><u><strong>It was painful sir.</strong></u></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td>x       x         x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>What was the attire of your Kuya Ronnie when he went on top of you, if he has any clothing at all?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>None sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><u><strong>How about you, when your Kuya Ronnie went on top of you, did you have any lower garments?</strong></u></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><u><strong>Yes sir.

Contrary to appellant’s contention, the absence of external signs of physical violence on Christine does not prove that he did not rape her. Proof of physical injury is not an essential element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Admittedly, appellant did not use force or violence in raping Christine. Christine merely obeyed when appellant ordered her to enter their bedroom. Christine did not offer any resistance when appellant raped her. This explains the absence of any external sign of injury on Christine’s body. Besides, where the victim is below 12 years old, the only subject of inquiry is whether “carnal knowledge” took place. Proof of force, threat or intimidation is unnecessary since none of these is an element of statutory rape. There is statutory rape where, as in this case, the offended party is below 12 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Here, the Information alleged, and the prosecution proved during trial, that Christine was below 12 years old when appellant raped her. Under Article 266-A(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, there is rape even in the absence of force, threat or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Appellant assails the inconsistencies in Christine’s statements on whether appellant totally undressed her or inserted his penis through a hole in her shorts. These inconsistencies cannot exculpate appellant. Whether appellant raped Christine after undressing her or inserted his penis through a hole in her shorts is immaterial. Rape could take place under either situation. Besides, it is natural for inconsistencies to creep into the testimony of a rape victim who is of tender age like Christine. Courts expect minor inconsistencies when a child-victim narrates the details of a harrowing experience like rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Inconsistencies in a rape victim’s testimony do not impair her credibility, especially if the inconsistencies refer to trivial matters that do not alter the essential fact of the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> A rape victim is not expected to mechanically keep in memory details of the rape incident and then when called to testify automatically give an accurate account of the traumatic experience she suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Appellant capitalizes on Luzviminda’s turning into a defense witness as convincing proof of his innocence. Appellant argues that no sane mother would testify against her own daughter if the latter were telling the truth. That Luzviminda turned her back on Christine and testified for appellant does not militate against Christine’s credibility. Appellant insists that the charge arose out of Luzviminda’s desire to exact revenge on him because Luzviminda caught appellant and Elena “sleeping side by side” that night.<br><br>Appellant argues that Luzviminda’s moral ascendancy over Christine made it easy for Luzviminda to manipulate her daughter to tell an “orchestrated story.” Appellant points out that when Luzviminda’s conscience bothered her, Luzviminda recanted and corroborated his testimony that he did not rape Christine.<br><br>Appellant’s assertions are futile. Luzviminda’s actuations after the rape incident convince this Court of the truthfulness of Christine’s testimony. Luzviminda brought Christine, a ten-year old girl, to the Lipa City Police Station to report the rape incident. Luzviminda filed the criminal complaint against appellant. Luzviminda led the police to the place where appellant was arrested at 8 o’clock in the morning of 20 October 1999. On 21 October 1999, Luzviminda executed a sworn statement before the police narrating her eyewitness account of the rape incident and pointing to appellant as the culprit. On that same day, Luzviminda brought Christine to the Lipa City District Hospital for medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>All these circumstances belie appellant’s claim that Christine merely concocted the rape incident so that Luzviminda could get back at appellant.

Still, Luzviminda pursued the criminal complaint against appellant. This belies appellant’s claim that Christine merely concocted the rape incident to satisfy Luzviminda’s desire for revenge against appellant. If Christine merely wanted to accommodate Luzviminda, Christine should have also changed her own story when Luzviminda changed hers. Christine, however, remained steadfast that appellant raped her even after her mother recanted.<br><br>Motives such as resentment, hatred, or revenge have never swayed this Court from giving full credence to the testimony of a minor rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Besides, the transcript of stenographic notes fails to show that Christine’s testimony was elicited by intimidation or undue influence. Far from being an “orchestrated story,” as appellant claims, Christine’s testimony clearly appears candid, spontaneous and clear.<br><br>It is lamentable that Luzviminda’s concern for appellant was more intense than her desire to right a grievous wrong done to her own child. In <b><i>People v. Dizon,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> this Court stated:<br><blockquote>Truly, some wives are overwhelmed by emotional attachments to their husbands to such an extent that the welfare of their own offsprings takes back seat. <i>Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point.</i> Knowingly or otherwise, they suppress the truth and act as medium for injustice to preponderate. Though heavens fall, they would stand by their man. Teresa exemplifies this breed of women.</blockquote>There being proof beyond reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crime as charged, we affirm his conviction.<br><br>Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code partly provide:<br><br>Article 266-A.
