				<BR><STRONG>CORONA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Time and again, this Court has emphasized that any delay in the rendition of judgments diminishes our people’s faith in the judiciary.&nbsp; If, for some valid reason, a judge cannot comply with the required deadline, he should seek an extension to avoid administrative sanctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>An on-the-spot judicial audit and physical inventory of cases, including cases submitted for decision, were conducted in Branches 57, 58 and 59 of the Regional Trial Court, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(A). JUDGE ROBERTO S. JAVELLANA</span><br></div><br>At the time of the audit, respondent Judge Roberto S. Javellana was handling two salas, Branch 57 (in an acting capacity) and Branch 59 (his original station) which was designated as a special court for heinous crimes.&nbsp; He was likewise the incumbent Executive Judge.<br><br>Based on the records as of February 28, 2000, Branch 57 had a caseload of 559 cases.&nbsp; This caseload consisted of 398 criminal and 155 civil and other cases.<br><br>Branch 59, as of audit date in February 2000, had a caseload of 86 cases consisting of 67 criminal and 19 civil cases.<br><br>Consequently, the audit team reported:<br><blockquote>It should be noted that aside from handling his regular court&nbsp; Branch 59, Judge Javellana is also handling Branch 57 in concurrent capacity.&nbsp; This situation is further aggravated by the fact that Judge Javellana is also the incumbent Executive Judge and the presiding judge of Branch 59 which is a special court for heinous crime, etc.&nbsp; No wonder, the audit shows how the over all performance of Judge Javellana was affected while handling Branch 57 which has the highest caseload so far compared to the two (2) other branches which are special courts.<br><br>Although admittedly, Judge Javellana has so many cases that are submitted for decision which are already beyond the reglementary period, the above-discussed circumstance are considered mitigating circumstance that should be given due consideration in favor of Judge Javellana.<br><br>In fact, during the conversation with Judge Javellana, he suggested the possibility of considering the return of Judge Beldia to his official station or perhaps another acting presiding judge be designated to handle Branch 57 if only to exclusively devote the time in handling all other cases not falling within the designated special courts.&nbsp; The uneven distribution of caseload in the three (3) RTC branches in San Carlos City is a situation that Judge Javellana had reluctantly accepted.&nbsp; The said situation becomes uncontrollable&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;because the two (2) designated special courts are limited to handling specific cases under the directive of the Honorable Court.<br></blockquote>Based on the report of the audit team, this Court issued a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated August 28, 2000, with the following directives:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECT</span>: (1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Acting Presiding Judge Roberto S.

(Italics Supplied) </blockquote> We agree with the OCA’s conclusion that respondent Judge Javellana should be meted an administrative penalty for being remiss in the performance of his duties.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we do not agree with the recommended penalty.<br><br>While respondent Judge Javellana decided practically all the cases submitted to him for decision, it was done only after an audit was conducted in his sala and a directive to immediately decide the cases was issued by this Court. Moreover, the dates of the decisions were way beyond the reglementary period.<br><br>A judge cannot choose his deadline for deciding cases pending before him. Without an extension granted by this Court, the failure to decide even a single case within the required period constitutes gross inefficiency that merits administrative sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically Canon 3, Rule 3.05 mandates judges to attend promptly to the business of the court and decide cases within the periods prescribed by law and the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Under the 1987 Constitution, lower court judges are also mandated to decide cases within 90 days from submission.<br><br>Judges must closely adhere to the Code of Judicial Conduct in order to preserve the integrity, competence and independence of the judiciary and make the administration of justice more efficient. Time and again, we have stressed the need to strictly observe this duty so as not to negate our efforts to minimize, if not totally eradicate, the twin problems of congestion and delay that have long plagued our courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Respondent Judge Javellana reneged on this duty.<br><br>Respondent Judge should have known that if his caseload, additional assignments or designations, health reasons or other factors prevented the timely disposition of his pending cases, all he had to do was to ask this Court for a reasonable extension of time to dispose of his cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The Court, cognizant of the heavy caseloads of some judges and mindful of the difficulties encountered by them in the disposition thereof, is almost always disposed to grant such requests on meritorious grounds.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by the OCA, respondent Javellana failed to file any motion for extension despite the availability of this remedy.<br><br>Furthermore, his designation as Executive Judge and his appointment to another branch, in addition to his regular station, was no excuse for his delay in promptly deciding the cases assigned to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As earlier stated, he could have asked for an extension of time within which to decide. For his failure to do so, respondent Judge has to suffer the consequences.<br><br>The failure of his clerk of court to call his attention to the cases submitted for decision, the inability of his officer-in-charge to properly manage the daily court activities and all the excuses he gave are not acceptable to us.&nbsp; The reasons proferred were not beyond his control. More importantly, respondent Judge should have known that it was incumbent upon him to devise an efficient recording and filing system in his sala.&nbsp; A judge cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or mismanagement of his court personnel since they are not responsible for his judicial functions. On the contrary, a judge should be the master of his own domain and take responsibility for the mistakes of his subordinates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>All told, we find respondent Judge Javellana guilty of unjustified delay in rendering decisions.<br><br>Under Section 9(1), Rule 140, as amended, of the Revised Rules of Court, undue delay in rendering a decision is classified as a less serious charge. And under Section 11(b) of the same Rule, the penalty for such offense is suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one nor more than three months, or a fine of more than P10,000 but not exceeding <s>P</s>20,000.<br><br>While we agree with the findings and recommendation of OCA that respondent Judge Javellana be sanctioned, we do not consider the recommended fine of <s>P</s>10,000 as commensurate to the gravity of the offense committed. As reported by OCA, respondent Judge Javellana failed to decide 38 cases, aside from 19 cases with pending motions for resolutions, both in Branches 57 and 59, within the mandatory 90 days period.<br><br>Nonetheless, the fact that respondent judge presides over two courts and is also an Executive Judge serves to mitigate his liability.&nbsp; Instead of suspension, a fine in the amount of <s>P</s>20,000 would be sufficient.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(B).
