				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For review before the Court is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 73, of Antipolo City, finding appellant Bobby Orense guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of statutory rape against his own daughter, Grace Anne R. Orense, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death.<br><br>The information, dated 31 March 1997, averred –<blockquote>“That on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of March 1997, in the Municipality of Antipolo, Province of Rizal, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Grace Anne Orense, who is his own daughter, a minor three (3) years of age, against her will and consent.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned, appellant Bobby Orense pled “not guilty” to the charge; whereupon, trial on the merits commenced.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The case for the prosecution.</span>&nbsp; –<br><br>The prosecution presented five witnesses, namely: complainant-victim Grace Anne R. Orense; her mother Noralyn A. Ramos; examining physician Tomas D. Suguitan; Dr. Olga M. Bausa, who compared the blood samples of the complainant with the bloodstains found on the “sando” shirt of appellant; and Dr. Norieta Calma-Balderama, a psychiatrist.<br><br>Grace Anne identified her father, appellant Bobby Orense, in open court.&nbsp; She testified that her father, whom she curtly called “<span style="font-style: italic;">bastos</span>,” did something bad to her and that she prayed that “her father be sent to jail.”&nbsp; She said that she had seen the penis of appellant which he had inserted into her vagina several times.&nbsp; When she bled, appellant wiped the blood off with his shirt and then licked her private parts.&nbsp; When asked about her age, she answered that she was four years old.<br><br>Noralyn Ramos Orense, mother of Grace Anne, confirmed being married to appellant Bobby Orense, their marriage twice solemnized, on 08 March 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and on 16 April 1988,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and that complainant Grace Anne was born on 08 October 1993 per her birth certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The family lived in Coconut Street, FEU Village, <span style="font-style: italic;">Brgy</span>. Mambungan, Antipolo, Rizal.&nbsp; Noralyn was not home in the afternoon of 02 March 1997.&nbsp; Returning home at six o’clock that evening, she noticed that Grace Anne was unusually quiet (<span style="font-style: italic;">matamlay</span>).&nbsp; Around noontime the following day, Grace Anne, who just had a bowel movement, complained of pains in her private parts while Noralyn was giving her a bath.&nbsp; It was then when she learned for the first time of the rape incident.&nbsp; For about a week, Noralyn had the same observation whenever she would give Grace Anne a bath.&nbsp; Grace Anne also complained of frequent stomach pains and difficulty in urinating.&nbsp; The matter prompted Noralyn to call the “hotline” of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bantay Bata</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> where she was told to have her child examined by a medico-legal officer.&nbsp; She and Grace Anne proceeded to the Sto. Niño de San Antonio Maternity and General Hospital.&nbsp; She was advised to have the child undergo urinalysis.&nbsp; Dr. D. S. Sta. Ana, a pathologist, with the assistance of medical technologist Editha A. Santos, conducted the urinalysis and found Grace Anne to be suffering from urinary tract infection.&nbsp; Dr. Tomas D. Suguitan, a medico-legal officer, examined Grace Anne and found her to be a non-virgin.<br><br>On 24 March 1997, Noralyn went to the Rizal CIG Provincial Office, Karangalan Village, in Cainta, Rizal, to execute a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> on the rape perpetrated by appellant.&nbsp; When apprehended, appellant told Noralyn that he would agree to leave the house and financially support them provided she would drop the charge against him.&nbsp; Noralyn declined.&nbsp; Appellant was detained at the Antipolo Municipal Jail.&nbsp; Since Grace Anne continued to have nightmares, Noralyn brought her daughter to the Child Protection Unit of the Philippine General Hospital for psychiatric treatment.<br><br>Dr. Sta. Ana and Editha A. Santos of the Sto. Niño De San Antonio Maternity and General Hospital in Marcos Highway, Barrio de la Paz, Pasig City, undertook urinalysis on Grace Anne.&nbsp; The report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated 25 March 1997, read:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“STO.

Bausa, Police Senior Inspector and Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Service in Camp Crame, Quezon City, compared the 2 ml. blood sample taken from Grace Anne with that of the bloodstains found on a “sando” shirt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> belonging to appellant.&nbsp; The biochemical examination on the shirt gave positive result for the presence of human blood belonging to blood type “B.”&nbsp; Medico-Legal Report No. S-233-97,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated 10 November 1997, showed that both specimens belong to blood type “B”:<blockquote>“SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>Specimen A — Living person of Grace Anne R.

Avenue, Manila, to secure an NBI clearance which he needed for his job application.&nbsp; He stayed there until two o’clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; He then proceeded to Camp Crame to renew his license as a security guard and left the place at four o’clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; At around six o’clock in the evening, appellant arrived home only to find his clothes in a trash can.&nbsp; According to appellant, his wife did it out of anger as he was away for so long.&nbsp; Appellant said that his wife treated him like a house helper and obliged him to do household chores, like washing clothes and doing the dishes, that prompted him to stay with his father at Blumentritt, Manila, for about a month prior to 02 March 1997.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The decision under review</span>.&nbsp; –<br><br>On 24 August 2001, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered a decision, finding Bobby Orense guilty of statutory rape; it concluded:<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Bobby Orense is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of statutory rape and is sentence[d] to suffer the penalty of death in accordance with Republic Act [No.] 7659.&nbsp; The accused is also ordered to pay the victim the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00 as indemnity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>In this appeal, appellant contends that the prosecution has failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>As so often said, this Court, is guided in its review of trial court decisions in rape cases by certain guidelines, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., (1) that an accusation for rape can be made with facility; (2) that the crime is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (3) that, in view of the nature of the offense of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and (4) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> More frequently than not, however, the thrust of the issues focuses on the credibility of the victim.&nbsp; In this respect, great reliance is made on the evaluation made by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses, particularly their demeanor, conduct, and attitude, during the direct and cross-examination by counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellant doubts the credibility of Grace Anne, being still a child, to testify.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Pruna</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court has observed:<blockquote>“As a general rule, when a witness takes the witness stand, the law, on ground of public policy, presumes that he is competent.&nbsp; The court cannot reject the witness in the absence of proof of his incompetency.&nbsp; The burden is, therefore, upon the party objecting to the competency of a witness to establish the ground of incompetency.&nbsp; (VII Vicente J. Francisco, Part I, 234 [1997 Ed.], <span style="font-style: italic;">citing</span> Wharton’s Criminal Evidence, Section 1152 [11<sup>th</sup> Ed.])<br><br>“Section 21 of Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence enumerates the persons who are disqualified to be witnesses.&nbsp; Among those disqualified are ‘[c]hildren whose mental maturity is such as to render them incapable of perceiving the facts respecting which they are examined and relating them truthfully.’<br><br>“No precise minimum age can be fixed at which children shall be excluded from testifying.&nbsp; The intelligence, not the age, of a young child is the test of the competency as a witness.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid</span>., p. 242, <span style="font-style: italic;">citing</span> 58 Am. Jur. 97.)&nbsp; It is settled that a child, regardless of age, can be a competent witness if he can perceive and, in perceiving, can make known his perception to others and that he is capable of relating truthfully the facts for which he is examined.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Librando</span>, 335 SCRA 232, 244 [2000].)<br><br>“In determining the competency of a child witness, the court must consider his capacity (a) at the time the fact to be testified to occurred such that he could receive correct impressions thereof; (b) to comprehend the obligation of an oath; and (c) to relate those facts truly to the court at the time he is offered as a witness.&nbsp; (2 Florenz D. Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium 608 [2001 Ed.].&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> also VII Francisco 243, <span style="font-style: italic;">citing</span> Wheeler v. U.S., 159 U.S. 523.)&nbsp; The examination should show that the child has some understanding of the punishment which may result from false swearing.&nbsp; The requisite appreciation of consequences is disclosed where the child states that he knows that it is wrong&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to tell a lie, and that he would be punished if he does so, or that he uses language which is equivalent to saying that he would be sent to hell for false swearing.&nbsp; (VII Francisco 243, <span style="font-style: italic;">citing</span> 3 Jones on <span style="font-style: italic;">Evidence</span> 1296-1298.)&nbsp; A child can be disqualified only if it can be shown that his mental maturity renders him incapable of perceiving facts respecting which he is being examined and of relating them truthfully.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Virtucio</span>, 326 SCRA 198, 205 [2000].)<br><br>“The question of competency of a child-witness rests primarily in the sound discretion of the trial court.&nbsp; This is so because the trial judge sees the proposed witness and observes his manner of testifying, his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, as well as his understanding of the obligation of an oath.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. De la Cruz</span>, G.R. No. 135022, 11 July 2002, 384 SCRA 375.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> also <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.
