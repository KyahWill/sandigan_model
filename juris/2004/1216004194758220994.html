The two men then struggled for possession of the gun.&nbsp; As Jaime almost succeeded in wresting possession of the gun from him, appellant Flores shouted to appellant Ventura to stab Jaime.&nbsp; Using the knife he was carrying, appellant Flores stabbed Jaime three times.&nbsp; Jaime thereupon released the gun, threw a nearby plastic stool at the jalousy glass window causing it to break and cried out for help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Aileen who had been awakened, began shouting for help as she saw her husband in mortal danger.&nbsp; Appellant Flores stabbed her, however, with his knife, and although Aileen tried to defend herself with an electric cord, appellant Flores continued stabbing her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Awakened by the commotion, Aireen descended the stairs and saw the knife wielding appellant Flores whom she recognized as a former employee of the butcher shop of the Bocataje spouses.&nbsp; Pleading with appellant Flores not to harm her, Aireen ran back upstairs into Rizza Mae’s room, and the two called to their neighbors for help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Appellants Ventura and Flores thereupon fled the Bocateja house,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> bringing nothing with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Soon members of the Central Investigation Unit (CIU) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) arrived in response to a flash report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> &nbsp;Some of the police officers took the spouses to the Western Visayas Regional Hospital,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> while other elements of the CIU team intercepted appellants Ventura and Flores who were being pursued by neighbors of the spouses at the corner of Araneta-Yulo.&nbsp; Recovered from appellant Ventura was a .38 caliber revolver with five (5) live bullets, and from appellant Flores a blood stained knife<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> measuring 14½ inches from tip to handle with a 10-inch blade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Shortly after their arrest, appellants were interviewed by reporters from Bombo Radio to whom they admitted responsibility for stabbing Jaime and Aileen.&nbsp; In response to questions from the reporters, appellant Ventura explained that he suspected his wife was carrying on an affair with Jaime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the ocular inspection of the Bocateja residence, the CIU team found the spouses’ room in disarray, with some cabinets opened and blood splattered all over the floor, the bed and the ceiling. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Aileen eventually died in the hospital on the same day of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Dr. Luis Gamboa, City Health Officer of Bacolod City who conducted the autopsy of her body, found that she suffered a hack wound on her face and four stab wounds on her body, three at the chest and one at the back of the right shoulder, all caused by a sharp bladed instrument, such as the knife recovered from appellant Flores. One of the stab wounds penetrated Aileen’s chest near the left nipple, the intercoastal space and the middle of her right lung causing internal hemorrhage and ultimately resulting in her death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Jaime who was hospitalized for a total of six days, was treated by Dr. Jose Jocson,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> &nbsp;who certified that he sustained the following non-lethal injuries: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">Multiple Stab Wounds<br>#1 Posterior Axillary Area Right<br>#2 Posterior Axillary Area Left with Minimal Hemothorax<br>Lacerated Wound Right Parietal Area<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></div></blockquote>From the evidence for the defense consisting of the testimonies of appellants Ventura and Flores and Primitiva Empirado, the following version is culled:<br><br>Four days after February 13, 2000 when appellant Ventura arrived in Negros Occidental from Manila where he had been working as a security guard,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> he noticed that his wife, Johanna, who had previously been employed as a house helper of the Bocateja spouses, was wearing a new ring.&nbsp; When he confronted her, she said that it came from Jaime who was courting her, and that it was because Jaime’s wife, Aileen, had discovered their illicit relationship that she had been dismissed from the Bocateja household.&nbsp; Incensed at the revelation, he slapped his wife whereupon she left the conjugal home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On February 22, 2000, Johanna returned to the conjugal home in Barangay Alegria, Municipality of Murcia, Negros Occidental to get her things.&nbsp; After a verbal confrontation with her husband, she left to find work in Kabankalan, Negros Occidental.&nbsp; This was the last time that Johanna and appellant Ventura saw each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>That same day, appellant Flores visited his uncle-appellant Ventura. The two spoke at length and appellant Flores, who had previously worked for a day at the meat shop of the Bocateja&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;spouses, confirmed that Johanna and Jaime were having an affair.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Since appellant Flores knew where the Bocateja spouses lived, appellant Ventura asked him to go with him to their residence so he could confront Jaime about his affair with Johanna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellants, armed with an unlicensed revolver and a knife, thus repaired to the Bocateja residence still on the same day, February 22, 2000, arriving there at around 11:00 p.m.&nbsp; They were not able to immediately enter the premises, however.&nbsp; After boring a hole through the kitchen door with the knife, appellants entered the Bocateja residence at 2:00 a.m. of the next day, February 23, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Once inside, appellants entered the room of the Bocateja spouses through the unlocked sliding door.&nbsp; Appellant Ventura woke Jaime up, confronted him and told him to stop his relationship with Johanna.&nbsp; Jaime fought back, and he and appellant Ventura grappled for possession of the latter’s gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Soon after, Aileen woke up, screamed for help, and began throwing things at appellant Flores whom she attempted to strangle with an electrical extension cord.&nbsp; Unable to breathe, appellant Ventura stabbed Aileen twice with his knife. And seeing that Jaime had wrested control of the gun from appellant Ventura, appellant Flores also stabbed Jaime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Since appellants had not intended to kill Aileen or stab Jaime, they fled in the course of which Jaime began shooting at them with a 9 mm pistol.&nbsp; Appellants were eventually intercepted by policemen who placed them under arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Interviewed by the media after his arrest, appellant Ventura stressed that he just wanted to confront Jaime about the latter’s relationship with appellant’s wife, Johanna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>By the appealed Decision of December 15, 2000, the trial court disposed as follows:<blockquote>FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused FELIX VENTURA y QUINDOY and ARANTE FLORES y VENTURA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as Principals by Direct Participation of the crime of <span style="font-weight: bold;">ATTEMPTED MURDER</span> as alleged in Criminal Information No. 00-20693 <span style="font-weight: bold;">with the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, dwelling, nighttime and the breaking of door</span> to gain entrance to the house and with no mitigating circumstance.&nbsp; Accordingly, they are sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Temporal in its maximum period.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, they shall serve a prison term of from Eight (8) years of Prision Mayor as Minimum to Eighteen (18) years of Reclusion Temporal as Maximum.<br><br>The Court also finds the two (2) above-named accused GUILTY as Principal[s] by Direct participation for the crime of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Murder</span> as alleged in Criminal Information No. 00-20692 <span style="font-weight: bold;">qualified by abuse of superior strength</span>.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The aggravating circumstances of dwelling, nighttime and by the breaking of a door are present in the commission of the crime</span>.&nbsp; There is no mitigating circumstance.&nbsp; The accused, therefore, are meted the Supreme penalty of DEATH.<br><br>By way of civil liability, the accused are solidarily ordered to pay the heirs of Aileen Bocoteja the sum of P50,000.00 as death indemnity.&nbsp; The accused are likewise held solidarily liable to pay Jaime Bocateja the sum of P100,000.00 as moral damages and the sum of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In their Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> appellants contend that the trial court erred (1) in convicting them despite the failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt; (2) in considering abuse of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance in Criminal Case No. 00-20892; (3) in considering evident premeditation as a qualifying circumstance in Criminal Case No. 00-20893; and (4) in considering the aggravating circumstances of breaking of door and nocturnity in both cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Appellants argue that, at most, they can only be convicted of attempted homicide for the stabbing of Jaime and homicide for the fatal stabbing of Aileen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>From a considered review of the records and applicable jurisprudence, the instant appeal fails.<br><br>The essence of evident premeditation is that the execution of the criminal act must be preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; For it to be appreciated, the following must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (1) the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">time</span> when the accused <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determined to commit</span> the crime; (2) an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">act</span> manifestly indicating that the accused <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clung to his determination</span>; and (3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sufficient lapse of time</span> between such determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the circumstances of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>By appellants’ argument, even if appellant Ventura became jealous when he learned of the illicit affair between his wife and Jaime, it is not, by itself, sufficient proof that he determined to kill the latter; that with Jaime’s testimony that appellant had announced a “hold-up,” they, at most, intended to rob, but not kill the spouses;&nbsp; that their only purpose was to confront Jaime regarding his supposed affair with appellant Ventura’s wife, Johanna; and that if they had truly intended to kill Jaime, then appellant Ventura would not have bothered to awaken him, but would just have shot him in his sleep.<br><br>These assertions run counter to the established facts and are debunked by appellants’ own admissions.<br><br>Appellants admittedly arrived at the Bocateja residence at 11:00 p.m. and surreptitiously entered therein at 2:00 a.m. &nbsp;At that time, the surrounding premises were decidedly dark, and all the members of the household were fast asleep. Armed with a gun and a knife, they proceeded directly to the bedroom of the spouses, where appellant Ventura woke up Jaime.&nbsp; These actuations are not of those seeking parley, but instead betray an unmistakable intention to kill, not merely confront, Jaime.<br><br>Indeed, when pressed during cross-examination to explain why he chose to “confront” Jaime under the foregoing circumstances, appellant Ventura became evasive and did not give a clear answer:<blockquote>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Witness, you said that your purpose in going to the house of Jaime was only <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">to confront him.&nbsp; My question is, <span style="font-weight: bold;">why is it that you went there at 11:00 o’clock in the evening and not in the morning so that you will have all the opportunity to confront him?</span><br></div>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Because at that time, I was not on my proper frame of mind.</span><br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, is it not a fact that as early as February 17, 2000, you were already told by <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">your wife that there was that relationship with Jaime Bocateja and your wife?<br></div>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you not immediately confront Mr, Bocateja after that day or <br></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">February 17?</span><br></div><br>WITNESS:<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">On that day, I don’t know Jaime Bocateja.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x</div><br>ATTY.

While appellants could not have been compelled to be witnesses against themselves,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> they waived this right by voluntarily taking the witness stand. &nbsp;Consequently, they were subject to cross-examination on matters covered by their direct examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Their admissions before the trial court constitute relevant and competent evidence which the trial court correctly appreciated against them. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Although he admitted stabbing Jaime, appellant Flores sought to justify his actions by claiming that he was impelled by the need to prevent Jaime from shooting his uncle, appellant Ventura.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The accused Arante Flores who delivered the stabbing blow is big and strong, standing about five feet and six (5’6”) inches tall.&nbsp; His weapon was a 14 inch dagger.&nbsp; Aileen Bocateja [stood] only about five (5’0”) feet tall.&nbsp; The disparity of their strength is enormous.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>To take advantage of superior strength means to purposely use excessive force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; The appreciation of this aggravating circumstance depends on the age, size and strength of the parties, and is considered whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a superiority of strength notoriously advantageous to the aggressor, which is selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Appellants "agree with the trial court that accused-appellant Arante Flores is taller, and probably stronger than the victim Aileen Bocateja because of their difference in sex as well as the fact that the accused appellant Flores was armed at that time x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Nevertheless, they argue that Aileen’s death was not attended by abuse of superior strength since: (1) though ultimately unsuccessful, she was able to put up a defense against appellant Flores; and (2) the prosecution failed to show that appellant Flores deliberately took advantage of the disparity in their size and sex in order to facilitate the commission of the crime.<br><br>Unlike in treachery, where the victim is not given the opportunity to defend himself or repel the aggression,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> taking advantage of superior strength does not mean that the victim was completely defenseless. Abuse of superiority is determined by the excess of the aggressor’s natural strength over that of the victim, considering the momentary position of both and the employment of means weakening the defense, <span style="font-style: italic;">although not annulling it</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the fact that Aileen attempted to fend off the attack on her and her husband by throwing nearby objects, such as an electric cord, at appellant Flores does not automatically negate the possibility that the latter was able to take advantage of his superior strength.<br><br>On the contrary, this Court in a very long line of cases has consistently held that an attack made by a man with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed and defenseless woman constitutes the circumstance of abuse of that superiority which his sex and the weapon used in the act afforded him, and from which the woman was unable to defend herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Molas</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> where the accused was convicted of murder for stabbing to death two women and an eight year old boy, this Court discoursed:<blockquote>While treachery was not appreciated as a qualifying circumstance against Molas, the killing of the three victims was raised to murder by the presence of the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">There was abuse of superior strength when Molas inflicted several mortal wounds upon Soledad.&nbsp; Molas, besides being younger and stronger, was armed with a weapon which he used in seriously wounding her.&nbsp; That circumstance was also present when he hacked eight-year old Abelaro and also Dulcesima who, besides being a woman of lesser strength was unarmed.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>And in the more recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.Loreto</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> this Court opined:<blockquote>The contention of accused-appellant is barren of merit.&nbsp; Article 14, paragraph 15 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a crime against persons is aggravated by the accused taking advantage of superior strength.&nbsp; There are no fixed and invariable rules regarding abuse of superior strength or employing means to weaken the defense of the victim.&nbsp; Superiority does not always mean numerical superiority.&nbsp; Abuse of superiority depends upon the relative strength of the aggressor <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-à-vis</span> the victim.&nbsp; There is abuse of superior strength even if there is only one malefactor and one victim.&nbsp; Abuse of superiority is determined by the excess of the aggressor’s natural strength over that of the victim, considering the position of both and the employment of means to weaken the defense, although not annulling it.&nbsp; The aggressor must have advantage of his natural strength to insure the commission of the crime.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">In this case, accused-appellant was armed with a knife and used the same in repeatedly stabbing Leah, a young wisp of a girl, no less than eighteen times after overtaking her in the sala of Dan’s house.&nbsp; Irrefragably, then, accused-appellant abused his superior strength in stabbing Leah.</span>&nbsp; In a case of early vintage [<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Guzman, supra</span>. at 1127], the Court held that:<blockquote>There is nothing to the argument that the accused&nbsp; was erroneously convicted of murder.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">An attack made by a man with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed and defenseless woman constitutes the circumstance of abuse of that superiority which his sex and the weapon used in the act afforded him, and from which the woman was unable to defend herself </span>(U.S. vs. Camiloy, 36 Phil. 757; U.S. vs. Consuelo, 13 Phil. 612; People vs. Quesada, 62 Phil. 446).&nbsp; The circumstance of abuse of superior strength was, therefore, correctly appreciated by the trial court, as qualifying the offense as murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote>By deliberately employing a deadly weapon against Aileen, appellant Flores clearly took advantage of the superiority which his strength, sex and weapon gave him over his unarmed victim.<br><br>As for appellant Flores’ claim of self-defense, it cannot be sustained.&nbsp; As in defense of a relative, one claiming self defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> both unlawful aggression on the part of the person killed or injured and reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression.&nbsp; As a third requisite, he must also prove lack of sufficient provocation on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; None of these requisites was shown to be present.&nbsp; As expounded by the trial court:<blockquote>Arante declared that Aileen panicked and screamed and was hitting him with an extension cord so he stabbed her.&nbsp; Arante was suggesting that had Ai[l]een remained cool, composed and friendly, she would not have died.<br><br>This perverted reasoning need not detain the Court.&nbsp; There was an on-going aggression being committed inside her house and within the confines of her room, hence, Aileen’s actuations were perfectly just and legitimate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote>As adverted to earlier, the trial court, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Dueno</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> did not consider evident premeditation as having aggravated the killing of Aileen since she was not the intended victim of appellants’ conspiracy.&nbsp; Upon further scrutiny, however, this Court finds that this aggravating circumstance should have been appreciated in connection with Aileen’s murder. Jurisprudence is to the effect that evident premeditation may be considered as present, even if a person other than the intended victim was killed, if it is shown that the conspirators were determined to kill not only the intended victim but also anyone who may help him put a violent resistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Here, it was established that upon seeing her husband being attacked by appellants, Aileen immediately called for help and hurled objects at appellant Flores.&nbsp; And it was because of this passionate defense of her husband that appellant Flores hacked at her face and stabbed her four times.&nbsp;&nbsp; These factual circumstances are analogous to those in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.

Responsibility of a conspirator is not confined to the accomplishment of a particular purpose of conspiracy but extends to collateral acts and offenses incident to and growing out of the purpose intended</span>. Conspirators are held to have intended the consequences of their acts and by purposely engaging in conspiracy which necessarily and directly produces a prohibited result, they are, in contemplation of law, chargeable with intending that result. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conspirators are necessarily liable for the acts of another conspirator unless such act differs radically and substantively from that which they intended to commit</span>.

(Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote>Indeed, since they deliberately planned to attack Jaime in the sanctity of his bedroom where his wife Aileen was also sleeping, appellants cannot now claim that the latter’s violent resistance was an unforeseen circumstance.

On this point, this Court’s discussion in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Legaspi</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> quoted in the Solicitor General’s Brief, is instructive:<blockquote>Nonetheless, it is to be noted that the appreciation by the trial court of the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nighttime, despite the non-allegation thereof in the Information, resulted in the imposition of the supreme penalty of death upon accused-appellant.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Gallego</span> (G.R. No. 130603, 338 SCRA 21, August 15, 2000), We had occasion to rule thus:<blockquote>“In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Albert</span> (251 SCRA 136, 1995), we admonished courts to proceed with more care where the possible punishment is in its severest form – death – because the execution of such a sentence is irrevocable.&nbsp; Any decision authorizing the State to take life must be as error-free as possible, hence it is the bounden duty of the Court to exercise extreme caution in reviewing the parties’ evidence.&nbsp; Safeguards designed to reduce to a minimum, if not eliminate the grain of human fault ought not to be ignored in a case involving the imposition of capital punishment for an erroneous conviction ‘will leave a lasting stain in our escutcheon of justice.’ <span style="font-weight: bold;">The accused must thence be afforded every opportunity to present his defense on an aggravating circumstance that would spell the difference between life and death</span> in order for the Court to properly ‘exercise extreme caution in reviewing the parties’ evidence.’ &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">This, the accused can do only if he is appraised of the aggravating circumstance raising the penalty imposable upon him to death</span>.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Such aggravating circumstance must be alleged in the information, otherwise the Court cannot appreciate it</span>.&nbsp; The death sentence being irrevocable, we cannot allow the decision to take away life to hinge on the inadvertence or keenness of the accused in predicting what aggravating circumstance will be appreciated against him.</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x</div><br>The principle above-enunciated is applicable to the case at bar.&nbsp; Consequently, we hold that due to their non-allegation in the Information for rape filed against accused-appellant, the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and dwelling cannot be considered in raising the penalty imposable upon accused-appellant from <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x</div><br>It is to be noted carefully that the rule on generic aggravating circumstances has now been formalized in the Revised Rules of Criminal procedure, which took effect on December 1, 2000.&nbsp; Section 8 of Rule 110 now provides that:<blockquote>Sec. 8.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Designation of the offense</span>. – <span style="font-weight: bold;">The complaint or information shall</span> state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.</blockquote>Likewise, Section 9 of the same Rule provides:<blockquote>Sec. 9.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Cause of the accusation</span>. – The acts or omission complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient <span style="font-weight: bold;">to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its</span> qualifying and <span style="font-weight: bold;">aggravating circumstances</span> and for the court to pronounce judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>Appellants and the Solicitor General also argue that nocturnity should not have been considered since Jaime himself testified that their bedroom was well-lit and there was light coming from the kitchen and the adjoining bedroom of their children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>In determining nocturnity, two tests are employed in the alternative: (1) the objective test, under which nighttime is aggravating because the darkness facilitated the commission of the offense; and (2) the subjective test, under which nighttime is aggravating because the darkness was purposely sought by the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>Applying these tests to the established factual circumstances,&nbsp; this Court concludes that nocturnity was correctly appreciated in connection with both crimes.<br><br>While the bedroom where the crimes occurred was well-lit, the evidence shows that, in furtherance of their murderous intent, appellants deliberately took advantage of nighttime, as well as the fact that the household members were asleep, in order to gain entry into the Bocateja residence. Indeed, their own testimony indicates that while they were already outside the Bocateja house at around 11:00 p.m., they purposely waited until 2:00 a.m. before breaking into the residence so as not to call the attention of the Bocatejas and/or their neighbors. It is thus clear that appellants deliberately took advantage of the darkness of the night, not to mention the fact that the Bocatejas were fast asleep, to conceal their actions and to facilitate and insure that their entry into the victims’ home would be undetected.<br><br>No mitigating circumstances are present to offset the foregoing aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; While the trial Court noted that appellants were apparently motivated by their belief that Johanna and Jaime were carrying on an illicit relationship, to wit:<blockquote>The accused presented evidence to prove that Jaime Bocateja and Johanna Ventura, wife of the accused Felix Ventura, were maintaining an illicit relationship.&nbsp; The evidence on this point is principally hearsay – the alleged admissions made by Johanna of the relationship.&nbsp; There is no doubt, however, that the accused Ventura believes that [his] wife and Jaime Bocateja are clandestine lovers.&nbsp; It is fairly reasonable, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that it is Ventura’s belief of this illicit relationship which prompted him to confront Jaime Bocateja,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></blockquote>it nevertheless ruled out passion or obfuscation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> or immediate vindication of a grave offense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> as mitigating circumstances.<br><br>While jealousy may give rise to passion or obfuscation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> for the appreciation of this mitigating circumstance it is necessary that the act which produced the obfuscation was not far removed from the commission of the crime by a considerable length of time, during which the perpetrator might recover his normal equanimity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; In the same vein, while “immediate” vindication should be construed as “proximate” vindication in accordance with the controlling Spanish text<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, still this mitigating circumstance cannot be considered where sufficient time elapsed for the accused to regain his composure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>In these cases, appellant Ventura’s suspicions were aroused as early as February 17, almost a week before the stabbing incidents on February 23, when he first confronted his wife about her ring.&nbsp; Moreover, as previously noted, ten hours had elapsed from the time appellants left Murcia, Negros Occidental, weapons in hand, to the time they entered the Bocateja residence in Bacolod City.&nbsp; Within that period appellant Ventura had opportunity to change his clothes at a relatives’ house in a neighboring barangay and both appellants were able to take their dinner at the Burgos Market in Bacolod City.&nbsp; They even waited three hours outside the Bocateja residence before carrying out their plan. &nbsp;Without question, sufficient time had passed for appellants’ emotions to cool and for them to recover their equanimity.<br><br>In fine, for stabbing Jaime, appellants are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted murder qualified by evident premeditation with the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nighttime.&nbsp; However, as pointed out by the Solicitor General, the trial court erred in imposing the sentence of Eight (8) Years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> as minimum to Eighteen (18) Years of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> as maximum.<br><br>Article 51 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a penalty two degrees lower than that prescribed for the consummated penalty shall be imposed upon the principals in an attempted felony.&nbsp; Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the penalty for murder is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death.&nbsp; The penalty two degrees lower is <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>&nbsp; Applying Section 1 of Act No. 4103,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> as amended, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and considering the presence of two aggravating circumstances, the proper imposable penalty falls within the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> in its maximum period (from Ten (10) Years and One (1) Day to Twelve (12) Years) as maximum and <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> (from Six (6) Months and One (1) Day to Six (6) Years) as minimum.&nbsp;

Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code provides that when the law prescribes two indivisible penalties, the greater penalty shall be imposed when, in the commission of the deed, one aggravating circumstance is present.&nbsp; Consequently, the trial court’s imposition of the supreme penalty of death must be sustained.<br><br>Three members of the Court maintain their adherence to the separate opinions expressed in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Echegaray</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> that Republic Act No. 7659, insofar as it prescribes the penalty of death, is unconstitutional; nevertheless they submit to the ruling of the majority that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty should accordingly be imposed.<br><br>As regards the civil liability of the appellants, the award of the trial court is hereby modified as follows:In Criminal Case No. 00-20692, the award of <s>P</s>50,000.00 to the heirs of Aileen as civil indemnity for her death is sustained, the commission of the crime by appellants having been duly proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>&nbsp; The award of moral damages to her heirs is likewise proper considering that the prosecution presented adequate proof that they suffered mental anguish and wounded feelings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> However, the amount of moral damages awarded by the trial court is hereby reduced from <s>P</s>100,000.00 to <s>P</s>50,000.00 in line with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>&nbsp; It should be borne in mind that the purpose for such award is to compensate the heirs of the victim for the injuries to their feelings and not to enrich them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>The award of exemplary damages should be increased from <s>P</s>20,000.00 to <s>P</s>25,000.00.&nbsp; Such award is proper in view of the presence of aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, considering that counsel for appellants admitted that the heirs of Aileen incurred funeral expenses of <s>P</s>100,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> and such admission has not been shown to have been made through palpable mistake, the same&nbsp; should be awarded as actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 00-20692, the trial court did not grant Jaime’s claim for <s>P</s>20,000.00 in actual damages for hospitalization expenses since he failed to present any receipts to substantiate the same.&nbsp; Nonetheless, in light of the fact that Jaime was actually hospitalized and operated upon, this Court deems it prudent to award <s>P</s>20,000.00 as temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, Jaime is also entitled to moral damages in accordance with Article 2219, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, which this Court hereby awards in the amount of <s>P</s>25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, exemplary damages of <s>P</s>25,000.00 are also in order considering that the crime was attended by two aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the judgment in Criminal Case No. &nbsp;00-20693 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.&nbsp; Appellants Felix Ventura and Arante Flores are found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of attempted murder qualified by evident premeditation with the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nighttime and are hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of Six (6) Years of <span style="font-style: italic;">Prision Correccional</span> as minimum to Twelve (12) Years of <span style="font-style: italic;">Prision Mayor</span> as maximum.<br><br>Appellants are solidarily ORDERED to pay the victim, Jaime Bocateja, the amounts of: (a) Twenty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>20,000.00) as temperate damages; (b) Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>25,000.00) as moral damages; and (c) Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>25,000.00) as exemplary damages.<br><br>The judgment in Criminal Case No. 00-20692 is likewise AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.
