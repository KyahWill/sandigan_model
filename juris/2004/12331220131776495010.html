Ortiz, RTC, Branch 89, Quezon City, effective immediately.&nbsp; In the same Administrative Order, Judge Eliodoro G. Ubiadas was deputized as acting presiding judge of RTC, Branch 74, Olongapo City (in place of respondent judge), in addition to his regular duties as presiding judge of Branch 72, same court, effective immediately.<br><br>Early in 1997, Judge Eliodoro Ubiadas suffered a stroke and was on sick leave for quite sometime.&nbsp; Consequently, during his ailment, all cases in Branch 72 and Branch 74 were at a stand still.<br><br>Taking the initiative of finding a solution to the inactivity of the two courts, specifically Branch 74 presided by respondent, complainant, in May 1997, wrote the Chief Justice and the Court Administrator about the delay in the hearing of cases in said Branch.&nbsp; She also filed with this Court a <span style="font-style: italic;">petition for mandamus</span> (G.R. No. 130329) against the Court Administrator to compel him to immediately recall respondent judge from RTC, Branch 89, to her Olongapo City sala (Branch 74).&nbsp; The petition, however, was dismissed.&nbsp; All these actions taken by complainant were known to respondent judge.<br><br>Meanwhile, a regular judge was appointed to preside over RTC, Branch 89, Quezon City.&nbsp; Consequently, on February 1, 1998, respondent judge reassumed her post in RTC, Branch 74, Olongapo City.<br><br>Respondent judge could not shake off the thought that complainant was instrumental in her recall, which deprived her of the convenience of working in Quezon City, her place of residence.&nbsp; She could not hide her displeasure towards complainant as she issued an Order dated February 10, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> inhibiting herself from presiding over a case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> wherein she (complainant) is the plaintiff, thus:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">It has come to the knowledge of the Presiding Judge (now respondent) that during her stint as judge-on-detail with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, and before she was directed by the Court Administrator to return to this station, plaintiff Atty.

Presiding Judge is no longer in a position to exercise judicial fairness, impartiality and justice in the resolution of their motions and cases,” especially that they already filed with the Ombudsman a complaint against her. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Movants thus prayed that respondent judge “immediately inhibit herself from further hearing and/or acting on the criminal cases,” and that the cases be re-raffled to another sala.<br><br>These allegations of complainant offended respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In her Order dated June 3, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 440-73, she did not only deny the <span style="font-style: italic;">Urgent Motion For Inhibition</span> but cited complainant in direct contempt of court for (1) “making misleading, baseless and unfounded statements” which were “offensive and malicious x x x, intended not only to threaten, intimidate and embarrass the judge, but also to interfere with the Court’s functions of administering justice and exercising its judicial discretion; and (2) “representing the accused who are already duly represented in Court, without authority x x x.” Accordingly, respondent judge penalized complainant with imprisonment of ten (10) days at the City Jail, Camp Maquinaya, Olongapo City and a fine of <s>P</s>2,000.00.&nbsp; The contempt Order also directed the Camp’s Commanding Officer to detain complainant immediately.<br><br>Unfazed, complainant filed on June 8, 1998 a <span style="font-style: italic;">Notice of Appearance</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in Criminal Cases Nos. 440-95,&nbsp; 58-94, 727-89 &amp; 276-97, again signed by the accused, stating that they requested complainant to represent them in their cases, in addition to their counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.<br><br>Believing that complainant’s appearance is improper, respondent judge, for the second time, issued an Order dated June 8, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 58-94, citing her in direct contempt of court and penalizing her with imprisonment for 10 days and a fine of <s>P</s>2,000.00, payable within 24 hours from notice.&nbsp; Respondent judge held:<br><blockquote>“Firstly, and earlier on, this Court has refused to recognize Atty. Fidela Vargas’ appearance as special counsel in this case.&nbsp; Her representation as ‘special counsel’ for the accused has no leg to stand on.&nbsp; Accused is duly represented by a Court-appointed counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> in all proceedings.&nbsp; The counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> has never been relieved and the Court has not named any other lawyer to act vice the designated counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The act of appearing as lawyer for a detained accused in a case where a counsel is already appointed by the Court without notice to and authority from the counsel on record and from the Court is, <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, a contemptuous act, and Atty. Vargas is guilty of contempt</span>.<br><br>“Secondly, officially from July 6, 1996 to January 31, 1998, this Judge was detailed with the Quezon City Regional Trial Court and during said period, it was Judge Eliodoro G. Ubiadas, Presiding Judge of RTC Branch 72, Olongapo City, who presided over this Court in an acting capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time this case was heard by this Judge prior to her assumption of her duties in the Quezon City Regional Trial Court was on July 31, 1996.&nbsp; But then, the case had to be reset to August 8, 1996 since the Public Prosecutor assigned to this Court failed to show up.&nbsp; Thereafter, it was Judge Eliodoro G. Ubiadas who presided over this Court, as earlier pointed out, in all those instances, accused Samuel Fortunato has always been duly represented by a court appointed counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.&nbsp; While trial did not take place in some dates, they were upon orders of Judge Ubiadas, the acting judge.<br><br>“The case is presently being tried and the prosecution evidence is still set on June 17, 1998, while that of the defense, on July 4, 1998 and July 15, 1998, respectively.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“There is, therefore, nothing in the record which would show, at any time, that this Judge has deliberately and intentionally disregarded accused’s right to a speedy trial or has been unfair and partial to the detriment of the accused.&nbsp; Such unfounded accusations simply cannot be disregarded or ignored, for it is an attack not only against the person sitting on this Court but also against the Court itself.&nbsp; It is an accusation against this Judge of a personal wrongdoing, and disrespect to the one who sits on the bench and before whom respondent lawyer appears and on the whole, a clear discourtesy to the Court.&nbsp; All the allegations of wrongdoing to this Judge, while camouflaged with the words ‘her honor,’ are but sarcasm and obvious disrespect and manifestations of contempt.<br><br>“To this court, respondent’s actuation of assailing this Judge and attributing to her unbecoming acts in the performance of her official duties, ascribing to this Judge faults, by deliberately falsifying and twisting the truth is a serious misconduct, designed to bring the authority of the Court, the administration of justice into disrepute, and ultimately to impede the administration of justice.&nbsp; Simply wanting this Court to dismiss this case when the Court is in the middle of receiving evidence, is obstructing the Court’s administration of justice.<br><br>“This Court would not believe that respondent’s allegations in the subject pleading is in good faith.&nbsp; Subject lawyer has, in more than one instance, demonstrated contemptuous conduct, which the Court previously ignored in the hope that she would realize what she was doing.&nbsp; This time, the dignity of the Court and this judge has to be upheld. &nbsp;The lawyer’s accusations have to be curtailed x x x to set an example and for the public good, but more importantly, to see to it that Courts and Judges are not irresponsibly maligned and ridiculed.”</span> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>To prevent the implementation of the contempt Order, complainant posted with the RTC, Branch 75, Olongapo City a cash bond of <s>P</s>2,000.00 which was approved.<br><br>On June 11, 1998, respondent judge issued an Order in Criminal Case No. 440-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> cancelling complainant’s cash bond on the grounds that: (a) only her court (Branch 74) can fix and accept the cash bond; (b) she has not received a copy of complainant’s <span style="font-style: italic;">petition for certiorari and prohibition</span> supposedly filed with the Court of Appeals questioning her contempt orders; and (c) what is required by the Rules of Court is a performance bond, not a cash bond.<br><br>On the same day, respondent judge issued another Order in Criminal Case No. 58-94<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> directing complainant to show cause, within 48 hours from notice, why she should not be cited for indirect contempt of court for posting her bond with a co-equal Branch.<br><br>Upon cancellation of her cash bond, complainant was arrested in her office in the morning of June 11, 1998 and was brought to respondent’s court for the purpose of detaining her in jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The raging lawyer-judge controversy became widely known in the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;locality.&nbsp; It was prominently published in the newspapers of general circulation.&nbsp; Thus, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tempo</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">People’s Journal</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila Bulletin</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila Standard</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> carried, respectively, these news items: “Lady judge jails lady lawyer;” “Lawyer cited for contempt;” “Judge justifies order;” “Lady judge defends action on lady lawyer;” and “Lawyer, 74, jailed for her impatience.”<br><br>Challenging the legality of her incarceration, complainant, on June 15, 1998, filed with the Court of Appeals a <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition For Habeas Corpus and/or Certiorari and Prohibition with Application for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction or Temporary Restraining Order</span>.&nbsp; Impleaded as respondents were respondent judge, the People of the Philippines and the Commanding Officer/Warden of the Olongapo City Jail, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 4800.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This case, still pending, was treated as a <span style="font-style: italic;">petition for certiorari and prohibition</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On June 16, 1998, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila Standard</span> had this news story on the controversy: “Judge calls jailed lawyer ‘malicious’.” A copy of this news item was posted at the door of respondent’s courtroom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This prompted complainant to file with the Office of the Chief Justice the instant affidavit-complaint for serious misconduct against respondent judge, docketed as OCA IPI No. 98-585-RTJ.&nbsp; The affidavit-complaint alleges that immediately after her arrest on June 11, 1998, complainant was brought to respondent’s sala between 9:00 and 10:00 o’clock in the morning for the purpose of detaining her in jail.&nbsp; When complainant was entering the courtroom, respondent, who was then conducting court session, suddenly pointed her finger at her and shouted, “Guards, guards, arrest that woman (referring to complainant), a lunatic, and confine her in an asylum!”&nbsp; Such utterance, done “in total disregard of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;her judicial function and decorum and abusing her judicial powers,” deeply humiliated complainant.&nbsp; According to her, respondent is liable for grave oral defamation.<br><br>The affidavit-complaint also alleges that the posting of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila Standard</span> news item, “Judge calls jailed lawyer ‘malicious’,” at the door of respondent’s courtroom, which constitutes libel, brought dishonor and great embarrassment to complainant as she was the “jailed lawyer” being referred to.<br><br>Then Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo directed respondent to comment on the affidavit-complaint.<br><br>In her comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> respondent denied complainant’s allegations.&nbsp; She countered that she did not write or supply the statements in the news item and that she does not know who posted it outside her courtroom.<br><br>Upon the Court Administrator’s recommendation, the affidavit-complaint was re-docketed as an administrative matter and was referred to Justice Hilarion L. Aquino of the Court of Appeals (now retired) for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>After trial, Justice Aquino submitted his Report, recommending that the complaint be dismissed for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Justice Aquino’s recommendation is well taken.<br><br>At the outset, let it be stressed that we are not concerned with the “hate relationship” between the parties arising from complainant’s motions to inhibit and respondent’s contempt orders as well as her disgust for the former’s “special appearances.”&nbsp; These matters have been the subject of complainant’s <span style="font-style: italic;">petition for certiorari and prohibition</span> filed with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; We will only delve on the instant administrative charge of serious misconduct (grave oral defamation and libel).<br><br>It is not disputed that on June 11, 1998, between 9:00 and 10:00 o’clock in the morning, respondent was hearing a case wherein the opposing lawyers were Atty. Hector Rodriguez from Manila and Atty. Oscar Karaan from Olongapo City.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complainant then appeared at the door of the courtroom.&nbsp; Upon seeing her, respondent stopped the proceedings and called her Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Roel Samonte.&nbsp; As to what happened next, the parties herein are in serious disagreement.<br><br>According to complainant, when respondent saw her standing by the door of the courtroom, she (respondent) immediately pointed her finger at her and shouted, “Guards, guards, arrest that woman, a lunatic, and confine her in an asylum.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This was allegedly witnessed by Nida Suarez, a court stenographer of another court.<br><br>Upon the other hand, respondent judge denied having uttered such statement.&nbsp; Her denial was confirmed by Attys. Hector Rodriguez and Oscar Karaan who were then present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Investigating Justice Aquino accorded credence to respondent’s version since it was corroborated by no less than the two (2) lawyers present at the time.&nbsp; Justice Aquino explained:<br><blockquote>“The clashing testimonies of Atty. Vargas and the respondent judge on this charge of grave oral defamation cannot be given much credence because in a general sense, they are self-serving in nature.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>“The relatively disinterested witnesses were court stenographer Nida Suarez and the two lawyers, Attorneys Hector Rodriguez and Oscar Karaan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stenographer Suarez (of another court) testified that the respondent judge uttered the words quoted above, but the two lawyers said they did not hear the judge saying so.&nbsp; Between the testimony of the stenographer and the two lawyers, the latter command greater respect not only because they emanated from officers of the court but also because they are lawyers in a better position to observe the respondent judge and hear her utterances.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two lawyers were inside the courtroom and, in fact, not more than three (3) meters away from the respondent judge, while the stenographer was outside the court and in the corridor of the Hall of Justice.<br><br>“Consequently, the undersigned finds no substantial evidence to support the charge of Oral Defamation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This conclusion dovetails with the finding of the Ombudsman that there was no probable cause on the same charge of Oral Defamation.” </blockquote> We observed that complainant did not even allege in her affidavit-complaint that respondent judge was the one who posted the newspaper clipping at the door of the courtroom.&nbsp; Obviously, that she was ridiculed and humiliated by the news item could not have been caused by respondent judge.&nbsp; It bears emphasis that complainant’s imputation that respondent posted such news item is based on pure and simple speculation.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no indication that respondent judge was the source of the statements published in the newspaper.&nbsp; If at all, the facts stated therein are entirely hearsay and have no evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>As accurately stated by Justice Aquino in his Report:<br><blockquote>“There is no evidence at all that respondent judge committed a misconduct for the posting of the newspaper clipping at the door of the courtroom.&nbsp; There is no evidence that she posted said clipping or that she ordered its posting.&nbsp; She was not the writer of the news item nor is there a showing that she supplied what was written thereon.&nbsp; Like the Ombudsman, the undersigned finds no evidence of respondent judge’s culpability on this charge.”<br></blockquote>In fine, we agree with Justice Aquino that complainant failed to substantiate her charges.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the instant administrative complaint is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, (Chairman), Corona,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio-Morales, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, now retired.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo at 367.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit “B,” Rollo at 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Civil Case No. 186-0-97, entitled “<span style="font-style: italic;">Fidela Y.
