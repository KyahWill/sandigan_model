In the same breath, petitioner pleaded for a liberal application of the rules of procedure given the “overriding importance of the factual and legal issues” raised in his petition.<br><br>By his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated July 27, 2000, respondent pointed out that, like the brown envelope addressed to the CA, that addressed to and received by his counsel at Iloilo City containing petitioner’s petition for review showed that it was also mailed only on April 12, 2000.  Additionally, respondent impugned the reliability of the certification of the postal registry clerk submitted by petitioner, it not having been made under oath.<br><br>By Resolution of August 16, 2000, the CA denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration of its May 31, 2000 Order, noting that the “counter-arguments or points advanced in the opposition are so cogent and compelling that they constitute forceful refutation of the reasons or arguments assigned in support of the motion.”<br><br>Hence, the petition for review at bar anchored on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote> <center> I. </center><br>THE DISMISSAL OF PETITIONER’S APPEAL BY THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS BASED ON TECHNICALITY THEREBY DENYING THE RIGHTS OF PETITIONER AS COMPLAINANT-PETITIONER TO PROSECUTE HIS CASE BEFORE SAID APPELLATE COURT SO THAT IT CAN BE DECIDED ON THE MERITS AND NOT ON ITS TECHNICALITY ASPECT.<br><br><center> II. </center><br>THE SUSPENSION OF THE RULES IN THE INSTANT CASE IS WARRANTED SO THAT PETITIONER’S APPEAL WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS COULD BE REINSTATED AND PROCEED IN DUE COURSE IN ORDER NOT TO DEPRIVE PETITIONER OF THE RIGHT TO USE AND ENJOY HIS REAL PROPERTY CURRENTLY BEING ENJOYED BY RESPONDENT DESPITE HIS COMMISSION OF ACTS WARRANTING THE TERMINATION OF HIS LEASEHOLD RELATIONSHIP WITH HEREIN PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner insists that, contrary to the finding of the CA, his petition for review before the appellate court was actually filed on March 30, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In any event, petitioner argues that even if his petition was indeed filed beyond the extension period granted by the CA, this Court should set aside its assailed resolution for when he filed his Motion for Extension with the appellate court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the decision of the DARAB, he had paid the appropriate docket fee.<br><br>Further, petitioner argues that although the two informations attached to his petition before the CA are not certified true copies, the same are not material to the resolution of the issue raised therein; that the attached assailed decision of the DARAB attached to his petition before the CA is a certified true copy, indicating that there was a sincere attempt on his part to comply with the appeal requirements; and that, at all events, the overriding importance of the issues raised in his petition before the CA warrants a liberal interpretation of the technical rules of procedure.<br><br>By the above-quoted grounds-bases of his petition at bar, petitioner virtually admits that his petition before the CA was indeed belatedly filed.<br><br>To the petition respondent, by his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of November 27, 2000, argues that petitioner raises questions of fact which this Court cannot entertain.<br><br>The two informations attached to petitioner’s petition before the CA need not, as correctly argued by petitioner, be certified true copies. Section 6 of Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure should not be construed as imposing the requirement that <b>all </b>supporting papers accompanying the petition for review be certified true copies. <i>Cadayona v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> explains:<br><blockquote> xxx A comparison of [Sec. 6 of Rule 43] this provision with the counterpart provision in Rule 42 (governing petitions for review from the RTC to the CA) would show that under the latter, only the judgments or final orders of the lower courts need be certified true copies or duplicate originals.  Also under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (governing Appeals by Certiorari to the Supreme Court), only the judgment or final order or resolution accompanying the petition must be a clearly legible duplicate original or a certified true copy thereof certified by the clerk of court of the court <i>a quo. </i> Even under Rule 65 governing certiorari and prohibition, petitions need be accompanied by certified true copies of the questioned judgment, it being sufficient that copies of all other relevant documents should accompany the petition.  Numerous resolutions issued by this Court emphasize that in appeals by certiorari under Rule 45 and original civil actions for certiorari under Rule 65 in relation to Rules 46 and 56, what is required to be a certified true copy is the copy of the questioned judgment, final order or resolution. No plausible reason suggests itself why a different treatment, <i>i.e.</i> a stricter requirement, should be given to petitions under Rule 43, which governs appeals from the Court of Tax Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.  None could have been intended by the framers of the Rules.  A contrary ruling would be too harsh and would not promote the underlying objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding.  It must be conceded that obtaining certified true copies necessary entails additional expenses that will make litigation more onerous to the litigants.  Moreover, certified true copies are not easily procurable and party litigants must wait for a period of time before the certified true copies are released. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court’s error in holding that the informations should be certified true copies to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure notwithstanding, the dismissal of the petition filed before it is in order.<br><br>Petitioner is raising a question of fact – the finding of the CA that the petition for review was filed beyond the prescribed period.<br><br>In an appeal via certiorari, only questions of law may be reviewed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  A question of law arises when there is doubt or difference as to what the law is on a certain state of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Whether the body of proofs presented by a party, weighed and analyzed in relation to contrary evidence submitted by an adverse party, may be said to be strong, clear and convincing, whether certain documents presented by one side should be accorded full faith and credit in the face of protests as to their spurious character by the other side, whether inconsistencies in the body of proofs of a party are of such gravity as to justify refusing to give said proofs weight – all these are issues of fact<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which may not be passed upon in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In accordance then with the established rule and practice, in view of the absence of any of the recognized exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that would warrant a review of the findings of facts of the appellate court, the issue raised by petitioner as regards the date of the filing of the petition for review will not be considered by this Court, the resolution thereon by the CA being final.<br><br>Since the perfection of an appeal within the statutory or reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, the failure of petitioner to so perfect his appeal rendered the questioned decision final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  This rule is founded upon the principle that the right to appeal is not part of due process of law but is a mere statutory privilege to be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Petitioner nevertheless harps on the judicial policy of allowing appeals, although filed late, when the interest of substantial justice so requires.<br><br>While every litigant must be given the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities, the failure to perfect an appeal is not a mere technicality as it raises a jurisdictional problem which deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction over the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Only under exceptionally meritorious circumstances may a departure from an otherwise stringent rule be allowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Bank of America, NT &amp; SA v. Gerochi, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> so instructs:<br><blockquote> True, in few highly exceptional instances, we have allowed the relaxing of the rules on the application of the reglementary periods of appeal.  We cite a few typical examples: In Ramos vs. Bagasao, 96 SCRA 395, we excused the delay of four days in the filing of a notice of appeal because the questioned decision of the trial court was served upon appellant Ramos at a time when <i>her counsel of record was already dead. </i> Her new counsel could only file the appeal four days after the prescribed reglementary period was over.  In Republic vs. Court of Appeals, 83 SCRA 453, we allowed the perfection of an appeal by the Republic despite the delay of six days to prevent a gross miscarriage of justice since the Republic stood to lose hundreds of hectares of land already <i>titled in its name</i> and had since then been devoted for educational purposes.  In Olacao v. National Labor Relations Commission, 177 SCRA 38, 41, we accepted a tardy appeal considering that the subject matter in issue had theretofore been <i>judicially settled, with finality, in another case.</i>  The dismissal of the appeal would have had the effect of the appellant being ordered twice to make the same reparation to the appellee.<br><br>The case at bench, given its own settings, cannot come close to those extraordinary circumstances that have indeed justified a deviation from an otherwise stringent rule.  Let it not be overlooked that the timeliness of an appeal is a <i>jurisdictional caveat</i> that not even this Court can trifle with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, there is no showing of a factual setting which warrants a liberal application of the rules on the period of appeal.  Having been extended an additional fifteen (15) day period within which to file his petition for review, it was incumbent upon petitioner to strictly comply with such deadline.  That he paid the appropriate docket fee upon filing his Motion for Extension of Time with the appellate court does not help his cause any.  The inevitable consequence of his grave inadvertence is to render the DARAB’s decision dismissing the case final and executory.<br><blockquote> We must stress that the bare invocation of “the interest of substantial justice” is not a magic wand that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules.  “Procedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party’s substantive rights.  Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant petition for review is <b>DENIED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Vitug, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez </i>and <i>Corona, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br> <hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> Rollo</i> at 45-46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 55-71.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><i> Id. </i>at 43-44.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Records at 6-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 1-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 36-39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 74-92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 74-75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 231-243.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 244.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 297-306.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 4-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 11-31.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i><u>Vid</u></i>e brown envelope which bears the stamp mark April 12, 2000 at the bottom left portion thereof, id. at between 11-A.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> SEC. 6. <i>Contents of the petition.-</i> The petition for review shall xxx (c) be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or a certified true copy of the award, judgment, final order or resolution appealed from, together with certified true copies of such material portions of the record referred to therein and other supporting papers; xxx<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 66.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 75-78.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><i> Rollo</i> at 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i> Id.</i> at 109-114.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 324 SCRA 619 (2000).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><i> Id.</i> at 625-626 (citations omitted).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Rule 45, Section 1, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>Palon v.
