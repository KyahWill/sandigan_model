That was intended to accommodate his many relatives and friends who trooped to his residence that Sunday at Block 5, Lot 28, Phase C-1 Francisco Homes, Barangay Mulawin, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan Province.&nbsp; As it was already summertime, and on account of the big attendance, the party had to be held in a vacant space within the fenced perimeter, with vehicular and pedestrian steel gates.&nbsp; In front thereof was a narrow concrete street.<br><br>“Inasmuch as Lapidante saw to it that drinks like gin and beer and appetizers were plenty, even before 10:00 A.M., inevitably, the revelers were already displaying excitement.&nbsp; Some were engaged in singing over a ‘karaoke,’ while one Sgt. Celso Suico of the Philippine Air Force and of the elite Presidential Security Group, who lived in another phase of the subdivision, demonstrated his exuberance by firing shots into the air with his Armalite rifle.&nbsp; Since the gunshots continued to ring out, and election gun ban was then in effect, the attention of Carmelo Catbagan, an investigator of the Criminal Investigation Service, Philippine National Police, whose residential unit was just one block away south of the Lapidantes, was called.<br><br>“When, by 5:00 p.m., Catbagan went there to verify from the group who among them had been firing the rifle, no one of those within the fenced area gave a positive answer.&nbsp; The embar[r]assed Catbagan left the place.&nbsp; Coincidentally, some minutes before that, Lapidante, driving his owner-type jeep, conducted home some of his guests.&nbsp; Accompanying him were Sgt. Suico and his companion Ernesto ‘Jun’ Lacaden.&nbsp; Even as they returned the Armalite to the PSG’s residence at Phase M, Suico substituted it with a government-issued Springfield .45 caliber pistol which he tucked to his waistband as they went back to rejoin the party.<br><br>“By about 5:30 p.m., while the celebrants were being entertained with a song by the eldest daughter of Lapidante, Catbagan with [Zosimo] (Jess) Fababier returned to Lapidante’s place on board a motorized tricycle.&nbsp; This time, after he alighted on the street in front, when Catbagan inquired about the gunshots of the Armalite, Sgt. Suico answered that ‘It’s nothing; it’s just a part of the celebration’.&nbsp; Suddenly, a piece of stone hurled from the direction of the celebrant’s house landed on a tree and thence to the body of Catbagan.&nbsp; Irritated and reacting thereto, the CIS agent directed Fababier to look for the one who threw the stone.<br><br>“At that moment, Sgt. Suico got out of the pedestrian steel gate and extended his hand towards Catbagan in the street as he introduced himself as being a PSG.&nbsp; Completely ignoring the gesture of the latter, Catbagan drew out his .9mm automatic pistol and with both hands holding the gun, fired successively at Suico, who when hit stretched out his hand, shouting&nbsp; ‘Huwag (Don’t) Pare.’&nbsp; Despite this Catbagan fired more shots at the victim who fell on the pavement, bloodied and dying from mortal wounds.<br><br>“As the shots were fired, Jun Lacaden who was taking a nap on the front seat of the owner-type jeep parked on the other side of the street, in front of the residential unit of Aida Villanueva, was abruptly awakened.&nbsp; Not fully aware of what happened, he disembarked therefrom without knowing what to do.&nbsp; Unexpectedly, two shots were also fired at him by Catbagan.&nbsp; One bullet found its mark in the body of Jun Lacaden who then fell down.<br><br>“Almost simultaneously, Catbagan directed his attention to Lapidante who was then inside their compound in the vicinity of their steel main gate.&nbsp; Upon the prompting of his wife Rosita for him to run and evade the assailant, the celebrant turned towards the main door of their house.&nbsp; But before he could reach the safety of their abode, two rapid shots were aimed by Catbagan at him, one of which hit him in the upper part of his body.<br><br>“After causing the mayhem, Catbagan then proceeded eastward to the main road.&nbsp; Thereupon, Charles Lacaden picked up the weapon of the PSG man and threw it to a vacant lot somewhere at the rear of the house and lot of Lapidante.&nbsp; As a consequence of the injuries they sustained, Sgt. Suico died on the spot; Lapidante later died in the hospital in Lagro, Quezon City; whereas Jun Lacaden had to be treated and confined at the East Avenue Medical Center, Quezon City.<br><br>“Police investigators went to the scene and there recovered some pieces of evidence.<br><br>The .45 caliber Springfield pistol of Suico was retrieved in a place at the back of the Lapidante residence.&nbsp; With a bullet vertically standing on the chamber, it had misfired due to some vital defects.&nbsp; There were six (6) live ammunitions of the .45 caliber pistol excluding the vertical one.&nbsp; No empty shell of .45 caliber pistol were recovered.&nbsp; There were nine (9) empty shells of the .9 mm pistol; and a deformed slug of the same weapon, aside from many shells from the Armalite rifle.<br><br>“Upon examination of Sgt. Suico’s body, Dr. Dominic Aguda of the National Bureau of Investigation found four (4) gunshot wounds, to wit:<br><blockquote>No. 1 - left upper chest;<br>No. 2 - left chest above left nipple;<br>No. 3 - left anterior portion of forearm;<br>No. 4 - right palm (inside)</blockquote>“Dr. Aguda concluded that the victim died from massive bleeding of the four injuries.&nbsp; The most fatal was wound No. 1 as it perforated the aorta and the right upper lung.&nbsp; Death therefrom was instantaneous.&nbsp; He opined that this wound was inflicted in a level from a higher plane, whereas the others may have been inflicted on some level with the victim.&nbsp; Suico died of massive bleeding.<br><br>“As regards the victim Lapidante, as shown by Dr. Aguda’s schematic sketch and the post-mortem autopsy report, the entry wound was at the left side of the back, exiting at the right anterior portion of the chest in a forward and upward trajection.&nbsp; The bullet hit the upper left tube of the left lung and then penetrated the upper lobe of the right lung.&nbsp; The victim also died from massive bleeding.<br><br>“From the shapes and measurement of the wound of entry, Dr. Aguda stated that the (weapon) firearm used in the shooting of the two victims were probably the same, they being approximately 1 x 1 cm.<br><br>“With respect to Jun Lacaden, Dr. Cristina Atienza of the East Avenue Medical Center found that he was hit at the right side of the back, the scapular and the bullet exited at the uppermost part of the left arm, near the armpit.&nbsp; She said that as the slug entered the thoracic cavity, they had to insert a tube to evacuate blood.&nbsp; Said victim was confined for more than one week, and it would have taken another 30 days for the victim to resume his usual activity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><b><center><u>Version of the Defense</u><br></center></b><br>Appellant argues that he was justified in shooting the victims, as he was merely defending himself and fulfilling his sworn duties.&nbsp; On the basis of these justifying circumstances, he insists on his acquittal.&nbsp; In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> he summarizes his version of the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>“The defense had a different version of the circumstances that led to the shooting incident on March 15, 1998.&nbsp; On said date, between 9:00 and 11:00 in the morning, <b><u>ERNESTO PURBOS</u></b> heard successive gunshots coming from the residence of Danilo Lapidante at San Francisco Homes, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.&nbsp; The gunshots numbered about ten (10) in the span of two (2) hours.&nbsp; Alarmed and scared, as there were children then playing in the vicinity, he went to the house of Carmelo Catbagan to report the gun firing incident.&nbsp; He pleaded Catbagan, known in their place as a policeman, to maintain the peace in the neighborhood.&nbsp; He was worried that the children might be hit accidentally by the revelry.&nbsp; Catbagan retorted not to mind the revelers, as they were just drinking.&nbsp; He then went home.<br><br>“At around 4:00 in the afternoon, he again heard successive gunshots coming from the house of the Lapidantes.&nbsp; The gunshots were louder and rapid in succession.&nbsp; Fearing for the safety of the children playing in the vicinity, he again proceeded to the house of Catbagan, pleading the latter to pacify or maintain order in the place.&nbsp; Catbagan replied that he would call the attention of the Barangay Captain and advised him to go home.<br><br>“<b><u>ZOSIMO PAVABIER</u></b> corroborated the testimony of witness Ernesto Purbos.&nbsp; On March 15, 1998, between the hours of 9:00 and past 11:00 in the morning, he heard several gunshots coming from the house of Danilo Lapidante.&nbsp; The reverberating gunshots were again heard at around 4:00 in the afternoon, prompting him to go out to the street to observe the commotion.&nbsp; In the street, he saw children playing as well as a group of his neighbors talking about the gunshots coming from the house of the Lapidantes.&nbsp; The neighbors were complaining that the children might be accidentally hit and that there was a gunban.&nbsp; On his way home, he met Carmelo Catbagan, who asked if he would accompany him to the barangay captain to report the incident.&nbsp; Catbagan was then limping and there was something bulging in his waist.&nbsp; They proceeded to the house of the barangay captain onboard a tricycle.&nbsp; Upon reaching the place, the wife of the barangay captain informed them that her husband left for the police precinct and instructed them to proceed to the house of the Lapidantes as the barangay captain might be already there.&nbsp; Catbagan then told him to proceed to the barangay hall to call upon the tanods, but the place was closed.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the house of Danilo Lapidante.<br><br>“At the residence of the Lapidantes, they found several persons engaged in a drinking session.&nbsp; Catbagan then introduced himself as a CIS and inquired who fired the firearm.&nbsp; The merrymakers ignored Catbagan and continued their merrymaking.&nbsp; Seconds later, somebody threw a fist sized stone at Catbagan, hitting the lat[t]er on the shoulder.&nbsp; The stone came from the side of the kitchen of the Lapidantes.&nbsp; Catbagan directed him to find out who threw the stone.&nbsp; After he had taken five steps, he saw Danilo Lapidante emerge from the side of the kitchen, rushing towards Catbagan.&nbsp; About the same moment, Jun Lacaden and Celso Suico were likewise proceeding towards the gate.&nbsp; Lacaden then went on the side of Catbagan, who was stepping backward, while Suico, uttering that he is a PSG, drew his .45 caliber pistol and cocked it.&nbsp; Instinctively, Catbagan drew his gun and fired at Suico, hitting the latter with three shots.&nbsp; Lacaden, who was attacking Catbagan from the side, was shot by the latter once.&nbsp; Seeing what happened to his companion, Danilo Lapidante hurriedly retreated towards his house, shouting repeatedly ‘akina iyong mahaba’.&nbsp; Catbagan made one shot upward, yelling at Lapidante, ‘pare, pare, huwag kang tatakbo’.&nbsp; As Lapidante continued proceeding towards his house, Catbagan fired at him once.&nbsp; Taken aback by the sudden turn of events, he retreated towards his house and just peeped over the window.&nbsp; He then saw Catbagan rushing towards his own house, gather his children and leave.&nbsp; At around 6:30 in the evening, he was picked-up by police authorities for investigation.<br><br>“<b><u>JONATHAN BELLOSILLO</u></b>, the Barangay captain of Barangay Mulawin, Francisco Homes San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, confirmed that a complaint/report was made by Carmelo Catbagan at his home office, anent a gunfiring incident, at around 4:30 in the afternoon of March 15, 1998.&nbsp; The Barangay Captain likewise testified on the several complaints he received against Danilo Lapidante, for conducting gambling and Jun Lacaden, for mauling incidents.<br><br>“The accused, <b><u>CARMELO CATBAGAN</u></b>, testifying on his behalf, averred that he is a regular agent of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), with a rank of Crime Investigator I.&nbsp; As a regular agent of the CIDG, he was issued two (2) official firearms, a 9MM Jericho pistol and a.38 caliber revolver.&nbsp; His principal duties were to protect the innocent against deception, [and] against violence, arrest felons, and in general, to respond to all calls for public assistance.<br><br>“On March 15, 1998, he was at his residence at Block 5, Lot 11, Phase 6-1, Francisco Homes, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, tending to his five (5) children.&nbsp; His wife was then in the province.&nbsp; At around 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning, he heard several burst[s] of gunfire coming from the direction of the rear portion of his house.&nbsp; A neighbor, Ernesto Purbos, then came to his house complaining about the gunshots.&nbsp; ‘Manong Erning’ wailed that the gunshots might accidentally hit the children playing in the street.&nbsp; Having told from where the gunshots came from, he pacified the complainant telling him that the revelers were just engaged in merrymaking and that they will just stop later on.&nbsp; Ernesto Purbos then went home.<br><br>“The peace in the vicinity was again disturbed at around 4:00 in the afternoon of the same day.&nbsp; Loud burst of rapid gunshots, to the tune of the song ‘Let’s Go’, were again heard coming from the same direction as that in the morning.&nbsp; From his experience, he knew that the firearm used was an armalite (M-16).&nbsp; Two of their neighbors came to him complaining about the gunshots.&nbsp; He advised them to go to the barangay captain and he will just follow after finishing his chores.&nbsp; He then heard a woman scream, complaining that the shots were being directed towards the firewall of the house neighboring that of the Lapidantes.&nbsp; Ernesto Purbos likewise returned, echoing his previous complaint about the gunshots.&nbsp; He assured Purbos that he would act on his complaint, but first he would go to the barangay captain to report the incident.&nbsp; He then got his service firearm and went out.&nbsp; On his way to the house of the barangay captain, he met Zosimo Pavabier, who likewise complained of the gunshots.&nbsp; He asked Pavabier to accompany him and the two of them proceeded to the house of the said official.&nbsp; When they reached their destination, however, the wife of the barangay official told them that her husband has gone to the Police on the Block Headquarter.&nbsp; Learning the purpose of their visit, the wife told them to just proceed to the vicinity in question as her husband might already be there.&nbsp; On their way, they went by the barangay hall to fetch some ‘tanods’, but the place was closed.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the house of the Lapidantes.<br><br>“Upon reaching the house of the Lapidantes, Catbagan and Pavabier noticed that the Barangay Captain was not yet there.&nbsp; They likewise noticed that there were several persons having a drinking spree inside the compound.&nbsp; Catbagan introduced himself as a CIS and inquired upon the group who fired the gunshots.&nbsp; The merrymakers, however, ignored him and laughed.&nbsp; As he was telling the group that:&nbsp; ‘Don’t you know there are many residents here and you might hit somebody’, a fist sized stone was thrown which hit his left shoulder.&nbsp; The stone came from the rear of the house of the Lapidantes.&nbsp; Alerted by the hostility of the crowd, he instructed Pavabier to look for the one who threw the stone at him.&nbsp; As Pavabier was about to comply with his instructions, Danilo Lapidante emerged from the side of his house and rushed to where he was standing, uttering: ‘ano ba ang problema pare?’&nbsp; About the same time, two more persons suddenly came out of the compound of the Lapidantes, rushing and encircling him.&nbsp; One of the aggressors, Ernesto Lacaden, was toting an ice-pick on one hand and positioned himself at his side.&nbsp; The other, whose identity he did not kn[o]w at that moment, went straight to him, drew a gun from his waist and cocked it, after which, aimed the pistol at him, uttering ‘Pare PSG ito’, in an arrogant voice.&nbsp; Threatened of his safety, he drew his own gun while stepping backward and fired at the aggressors.<br><br>“Simultaneously, Danilo Lapidante retreated towards his house, shouting: ‘Akina yung mahaba, yung mahaba’, while Jun Lacaden attacked him coming from the side, with the ice-pick.&nbsp; Catbagan side stepped and fired a shot at Lacaden before turning his attention at Lapidante.&nbsp; He fired a warning shot, uttering: ‘Tumigil ka, huwag kang kikilos’.&nbsp; Lapidante, however, did not heed Catbagan’s warning and continued rushing towards his house, as if to get something.&nbsp; Fearing that Lapidante might be able to get hold of the long gun, Catbagan fired a shot at him once.<br><br>“Concerned for his safety and that of his family, Catbagan brought his five children to the house of his sister in Malabon, Metro Manila.&nbsp; He then surrendered himself and his firearms to his superior officer at the CIDG Office.<br><br>“<b><u>ATTY. VIRGILIO PABLICO Y TABALBA</u></b>, Chief of the CIDG Legal Office and immediate superior of the accused, testified on the latter’s official duties and functions as well as his voluntary surrender on March 16, 1998[.]&nbsp; Accordingly, accused Carmelo Catbagan was appointed as a regular and non-organic member of the CIDG, with a rank of Criminal Investigator I.&nbsp; His official functions include the authority to conduct investigation of cases involving violations of the Revised Penal Code and other special laws, to effect arrest and to conduct search in accordance with existing rules, to take sworn statements and to appear as a witness in appropriate forum.&nbsp; As a regular agent, Catbagan was issued and authorized to carry a firearm.&nbsp; The issued firearm to Catbagan was a 9MM Jericho pistol, with Serial No. 000748.&nbsp; Catbagan, as a CIDG agent, was likewise deputized by the COMELEC and granted an exemption to carry firearm during election period.<br><br>“On March 15, 1998, at around 8:00 to 10:00 in the evening, he received a telephone call from Agent Catbagan, informing him that he was involved in a shooting incident, wherein he was able to shoot three (3) persons.&nbsp; Two (2) of the protagonists allegedly died and the other was wounded and taken to a hospital.&nbsp; Catbagan intimated that he wanted to be put under his custody as soon as a he made arrangements for his children’s security.&nbsp; On March 16, 1998, at around 1:00 in the afternoon, Catbagan presented himself to Police Superintendent Edgardo Acu×¡a together with his service firearm.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><b><center><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u><br></center></b><br>The RTC held that appellant did not know who had fired the gunshots at Lapidante’s party; thus, he could not claim that he had gone there to perform his duty to make an arrest. Consequently, it brushed aside his defense of fulfillment of duty, or lawful exercise of a right or office.&nbsp; It did not give credence, either, to his invocation of self-defense. <br><br>With respect to Celso Suico in Criminal Case No. 1082-M-98, the trial court ruled that there was unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, but that the means employed to repel such aggression was unreasonable. It “entertain[ed] serious doubts on the right of the [appellant] to continue firing at Suico after the latter was dispossessed of his gun due to the injuries received from the gunfire of the assailant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It credited appellant with incomplete self-defense, because he supposedly lost the right to kill or even wound the victim after the unlawful aggression had ceased.<br><br>The RTC refused to qualify the crime against Suico.&nbsp; Ruling that there had been no evident premeditation and treachery in the killing, it found appellant guilty only of the crime of homicide.<br><br>As regards the victim Danilo Lapidante in Criminal Case No. 1083-M-98, he was undisputedly unarmed, as he was inside his own premises —within his fenced front yard — at the time of the incident.&nbsp; Thus, the lower court found no act of aggression on his part.&nbsp; It held that “the belief on the part of [appellant] that the victim was about to retrieve a rifle from the doorside of the house, existed only in his imagination.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Consequently, “there was no moment for [appellant] to validly state that his own life [was] in imminent danger from Lapidante.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Aside from rejecting self-defense, the trial court also held that treachery had attended the killing, because the unarmed victim had unexpectedly been shot while his back was towards appellant.<br><br>Finally, in Criminal Case No. 1099-M-98, the court <i>a quo</i> found that Ernesto Lacaden had been shot in the back, apparently while “in the act of fleeing from the fury of gunfire from [appellant].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It did not accept the allegation that the victim had been carrying an ice pick at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it explained that even if he indeed had one at the time, he could not have done any real harm to appellant who was just too far from him. Absent any clear and convincing proof that Lacaden committed unlawful aggression, self-defense —whether complete or incomplete — could not be appreciated.<br><br>The RTC found the crime against Lacaden to be qualified by treachery, as he had not posed any imminent danger to appellant.&nbsp; It ruled that treachery was proven by the following circumstances: (1) the fact that the victim was running away from the scene of the crime; and (2) appellant’s use of his .9 mm automatic pistol, a lethal weapon used to wound the former’s vital organs.&nbsp; Since death did not ensue by reason of causes independent of the will of appellant, the court a quo found him guilty of frustrated murder.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>The Issues</u><br></center></b><br>Before us, appellant assigns to the trial court the following alleged errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote><center>“I<br></center><br>The court <u>a quo</u> gravely erred in finding accused-appellant Carmelo Catbagan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offenses charged in Criminal Case Nos. 1082-M-98, 1083-M-98 and 1099-M-98, respectively.<br><br><center>“II<br></center><br>The court <u>a quo</u> gravely erred in failing to rule that accused-appellant Carmelo Catbagan acted in the fulfillment of his sworn duties and/or acted in self-defense in the commission of the offenses charged.<br><center><br>“III<br></center><br>Granting arguendo that the accused-appellant’s guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt, the court <u>a quo</u> still committed a reversible error in not considering the attendance of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in the imposition of the appropriate penalties for the offenses proved during the trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>In sum, the issues to be resolved are as follows: 1) whether appellant was justified in shooting the victims as a direct result of his “fulfillment of a lawful duty” and “self-defense”; 2) whether he could be credited with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender; and 3) whether the characterization of the crimes and penalties imposed by the trial court was correct.<br><b><center><br><u>The Court’s Ruling</u><br></center></b><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br><b><center><u>First Issue:<br><i>Fulfillment of a Lawful Duty</i></u><br></center></b><br>In criminal cases, the prosecution has the burden of establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; But once the commission of the act charged is admitted, the burden of proof shifts to the accused, who must now prove the elements of the justifying circumstances cited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Appellant invokes his lawful performance of duty as one such circumstance, arguing that “his presence at the scene of the incident, prompted by the complaints in their neighborhood and his own personal knowledge relative to the wanton discharge of a firearm, the effectivity of the election gun ban, his coordination with the authorities of the barangay, and the inquiry he made to the revellers, were all in consonance with the legitimate performance of a sworn duty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Citing these specific facts, he argues that he was justified in shooting the victims.&nbsp; In effect, his contention is that, being a regular agent of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) of the Philippine National Police (PNP), he was justified in maintaining public order, as well as in protecting and securing life and property.<br><br>Although he is correct in arguing that he had the legal obligation to maintain peace and order, he was not justified in shooting the victims.&nbsp; Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) provides that a person who acts in the fulfillment of a duty or in the lawful exercise of a right or office does not incur any criminal liability.&nbsp; Two requisites must concur before this defense can prosper: 1) the accused must have acted in the performance of a duty or in the lawful exercise of a right or office; and 2) the injury caused or the offense committed should have been the necessary consequence of such lawful exercise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>These requisites are absent in this case.&nbsp; Appellant was not performing his duties at the time of the shooting, because the men he shot had not been indiscriminately firing guns in his presence, as he alleges.&nbsp; Further, as found by the RTC, “nothing was mentioned in [his] direct testimony that he was there to effect an arrest.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Said the trial court:<br><blockquote>“While he might have heard of gunfire, since there is no proof to the effect that Catbagan had personal knowledge that it was Suico who had been firing the Armalite, under no circumstances may it be said that the accused was justifiably there to perform the duty of making the arrest in accordance with existing laws and rules.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>At most, appellant was in the house of the Lapidantes to determine who had fired the gunshots that were heard by the neighborhood.&nbsp; But the fatal injuries that he inflicted on the victims were not a necessary consequence of the performance of his duty as a police officer.<br><br>Indeed, his “presence at the scene of the incident [was] all in the legitimate performance and fulfillment of a sworn duty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He was duty-bound to find out who had fired the gun that day and to maintain peace and order in the neighborhood.&nbsp; But his act of shooting of the victims cannot be justified.&nbsp; His <i>presence</i> at the scene of the incident should be distinguished from his act of <i>shooting</i> them. <br><br>Appellant cites <i>People v. Cabrera</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> to support his argument that he was performing his duty and was thus justified in shooting the victims.&nbsp; There is an important distinction between the present case and <i>Cabrera</i>.&nbsp; In the latter, the disturbance had been created by the victim <i>in the presence</i> of the accused, who therefore had the duty to immediately intervene and subdue the former, who was causing danger.&nbsp; In the present case, appellant had no personal knowledge of who had fired the gunshots.&nbsp; Thus, his duty at the time was simply to determine who was the subject of the complaints of the residents of the village.&nbsp; It was never shown, though, that the shooting was in furtherance of or was a necessary consequence of his performance of such duty.<br><br>To be sure, the right to kill an offender is not absolute, and may be used only as a last resort, and under circumstances indicating that the offender cannot otherwise be taken without bloodshed.&nbsp; The law does not clothe police officers with authority to arbitrarily judge the necessity to kill.&nbsp; It may be true that police officers sometimes find themselves in a dilemma when pressured by a situation where an immediate and decisive, but legal, action is needed.&nbsp; However, it must be stressed that the judgment and discretion of police officers in the performance of their duties must be exercised neither capriciously nor oppressively, but within reasonable limits.&nbsp; In the absence of a clear and legal provision to the contrary, they must act in conformity with the dictates of a sound discretion, and within the spirit and purpose of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><b><center><br><u>Second Issue:<br><i>Self-Defense</i></u><br></center></b><br>Appellant also invokes the principle of standing one’s ground when in the right.&nbsp; Allegedly, since he had the right to be where he was, “the law does not require him to step aside when his assailant is rapidly advancing upon him with a deadly weapon.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> We clarify.&nbsp; Article 11 of the RPC provides:<br><br><blockquote>“ART. 11.&nbsp; <i>Justifying circumstances</i>. — The following do not incur any criminal liability:<br><ol>1.&nbsp; Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur:<br></ol><blockquote><i>First</i>.

Ruled the lower court:<br><blockquote>“Under the given situation wherein the Sergeant cocking the pistol was one who was trained, and skilled in the handling of guns, plus the fact that he was drunk, the Court cannot blame accused Catbagan to believe and fear that Suico would attack him in that mock introduction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>The prosecution presented, in fact, conflicting accounts of how Suico had been shot.&nbsp; The shooting allegedly happened after he had offered a handshake to appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> according to Rosita Lapidante, the wife of another victim.&nbsp; On the other hand, Charlie Lacaden, the brother of still another victim, gave testimony that conflicted with hers.&nbsp; Suico was allegedly shot by appellant when the former turned his back to the latter.<br><br>On the other hand, appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and Defense Witness Zosimo Pavabier<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> positively and consistently testified that it was Suico who had first drawn and aimed his gun at appellant.&nbsp; This assertion was confirmed by the physical evidence that the victim’s gun had a live bullet sandwiched between its breechblock and chamber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This fact proves that the gun was cocked and fired, but that the bullet was jammed in the process.<br><br>The prosecution tried to explain this occurrence by inconsistent and incongruous statements.&nbsp; According to the testimony of Rosita, Charlie took the gun from Suico’s belly then aimed it at appellant, but the gun did not fire because it was defective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> According to the testimony of Charlie, on the other hand, he took the gun because he was afraid that appellant would come back, but that he later threw it towards the rear portion of the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, the RTC concluded:<br><blockquote>“As regards the proof that Suico’s gun misfired due to vital defects in its mechanism, the Court suspects that <i>the firearm was tampered with to create the scenario that the PSG man was without fault</i>.&nbsp; In fact, Mrs. Lapidante and Charles Lacaden’s testimonies regarding what was done to the gun after the incident are in conflict with each other.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; (Italics supplied) <br></blockquote>Unlawful aggression is an actual physical assault, or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury, upon a person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In case of threat, it must be offensive and strong, positively showing the wrongful intent to cause injury — as in this case.&nbsp; Thus, Suico’s act of aiming a cocked gun at appellant is sufficient unlawful aggression.<br><br>The second element of self-defense — reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it — requires the following: 1) a necessity of the course of action taken by the person making the defense and 2) a necessity of the means used.&nbsp; Both the course of action taken and the means used must be reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues that he was justified in wounding Suico, because the latter was armed with a deadlier weapon and was still persistently aggressive after being shot the first time.&nbsp; The former maintains that “[t]he fact that [he] struck one blow more than [what] was absolutely [necessary] to save his own life, or that he failed to hold his hand so as to avoid inflicting a fatal wound where a less severe stroke might have served the purpose, would not [negate] self-defense, because [he], in the heat of an encounter at close quarters, was not in a position to reflect coolly or to wait after each blow to determine the effects thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The means employed by the person invoking self-defense is reasonable if equivalent to the means of attack used by the original aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Whether or not the means of self-defense is reasonable depends upon the nature or quality of the weapon, the physical condition, the character, the size and other circumstances of the aggressor; as well as those of the person who invokes self-defense; and also the place and the occasion of the assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The RTC made a definitive finding on the unreasonableness of the means employed by appellant as follows:<br><blockquote>“However, what followed, as testified by witnesses was that Catbagan continued firing even while Suico was pleading ‘Huwag pare!’ with outstretched hand and open palm of his right hand.&nbsp; While the accused asserted that he had to fire his gun and hit Suico with more shots to totally disable him, the same cannot be believed by the Court, if we take stock of Dr. Aguda’s testimony that with the injured arm and that on the chest being inflicted with the first ‘double tap’ shots; the victim would have had much difficulty to retaliate.&nbsp; In fact, Catbagan himself stated on clarification questions that the .45 caliber gun of the victim fell already so that the threat of continued aggression was no longer present.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>“On this point, the Court entertains serious doubts on the right of the accused to continue firing at Suico after the latter was dispossessed of his gun due to the injuries received from the gunfire of the assailant.&nbsp; Additionally, we cannot accept as credible Catbagan’s statement that he had to fire again at Suico inasmuch as the latter had stooped acting to pick up his own pistol from the pavement.&nbsp; If ever the victim was positioned that way, it was more of the impact of the bullets that hit him.&nbsp; The logical explanation can be derived from the presence of the entry wound in the inside of Suico’s right palm.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote>These findings are well-supported by the evidence on record.&nbsp; Clearly, the nature and the number of gunshot wounds — debilitating, fatal and multiple — inflicted by appellant on the deceased shows that the means employed by the former was not reasonable and commensurate to the unlawful aggression of the latter.&nbsp; The unreasonableness becomes even more apparent from the fact, duly admitted by appellant himself, that Suico had obviously been inebriated at the time of the aggression.&nbsp; It would have thus been easier for the former to have subdued the victim without resorting to excessive means.<br><br>Finally, as to the element of lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person resorting to self-defense, appellant has sufficiently established that he went to the house of the Lapidantes to find out who had fired the gunshots earlier that day.&nbsp; There was therefore absolutely no provocation from him, either by unjust conduct or by incitement, that would justify Suico’s acts of cocking and aiming a gun at him. <br><br>Not having proven all the elements of self-defense, appellant cannot use it to justify sufficiently his fatal shooting of Suico.&nbsp; Having proven a majority of the elements, however, the former may still be credited with a mitigating circumstance in accordance with Article 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the RPC.<br><br><i><b><u>Circumstances Surrounding<br>the Shooting of Lapidante</u></b></i><br><br>With respect to Lapidante, he allegedly rushed towards his house to get hold of the “<i>mahaba</i>,” so appellant had no other recourse but to shoot him.&nbsp; The purpose of the victim in rushing towards his house was supposedly to recover the advantage he had previously enjoyed.&nbsp; Hence, it is argued that unlawful aggression was present.<br><br>We disagree with appellant’s averments.&nbsp; Unlawful aggression presupposes an actual, sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof.&nbsp; Such aggression refers to an attack that has actually broken out or materialized or is at the very least clearly imminent; it cannot consist merely of any oral threat or intimidating stance or posture. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In this case, the RTC was categorical in ruling that the perceived danger was more in the mind of appellant than in reality.&nbsp; The circumstances did not point to any actual or imminent peril to his life, limb or right.&nbsp; On the part of Lapidante, the act of running towards his house can hardly be characterized as unlawful aggression.&nbsp; It could not have imperiled appellant’s life.<br><br>In a previous case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> this Court ruled that “a threat even if made with a weapon or the belief that a person [is] about to be attacked, is not sufficient, but that it is necessary that the intent be ostensibly revealed by an act of aggression or by some external acts showing the commencement of actual and material unlawful aggression.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> We agree with the RTC’s ratiocination, which we quote:<br><blockquote>“With respect to the incident involving the victim Lapidante, it is not disputed that he was unarmed as he was inside his own premises within the fenced area in front of his house.&nbsp; What acts of aggression against Catbagan which he did are not apparent to us.&nbsp; To this Court, the belief on the part of Catbagan that the victim was about to retrieve a rifle from the doorside of the house, existed only in his imagination.<br><br>“Aside from its intrinsic ambiguity, the claims of the defense witnesses about the alleged utterance of Lapidante about ‘Ang mahaba!’ an[g] mahaba!’ do not sit well with this Court.&nbsp; Indeed, we are not convinced that he could have uttered that statement since the evidence points to the fact that he and his friends had just arrived from another phase of the subdivision upon having delivered thereat, the Armalite of Suico.&nbsp; On the contrary, Lapidante appeared to have been gripped by fear and was obviously trying to escape from harm.&nbsp; Indeed, there was no moment for Catbagan to validly state that his own life [was] in imminent danger from Lapidante.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote>Neither do we accept the contention that unlawful aggression by Lapidante was shown by his act of rushing towards his house for the purpose of taking a more advantageous position.&nbsp; Referred to here is the rule that if it is clear that the purpose of the aggressor in retreating — or, as in this case, Lapidante’s rushing towards his house — is to take a more advantageous position to ensure the success of the attack already begun, the unlawful aggression is considered still continuing; and the one resorting to self-defense has a right to pursue and disable the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Obviously, this rule does not apply to Lapidante, because 1) there was no clear purpose in his act of retreating to take a more advantageous position; and 2) since he never attacked appellant in the first place, the former could not have begun any unlawful aggression and, hence, would not have had any reason to take a more advantageous position.&nbsp; How could there have been a continuation of something that had never been started?&nbsp; If any aggression was begun in this case, it was by Suico, not by Lapidante.<br><br>Hence, no unlawful aggression by Lapidante was shown.&nbsp; Because the presence thereof is a statutory and doctrinal <i>conditio sine qua non</i> of the justifying circumstance of self-defense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> —complete or incomplete — we need not examine the presence of the other requisites.<br><br><b><i><u>Circumstances Surrounding<br>the Shooting of Lacaden</u></i></b><br><br>Appellant asserts that Lacaden attacked him with an ice pick from the side.&nbsp; Allegedly, this act clearly showed unlawful aggression on the latter’s part.&nbsp; All the pieces of evidence on record, however, point to the absence thereof.<br><br>Most crucial is the position of the gunshot wound.&nbsp; As testified to by the doctor who had treated the victim, its point of entry was on the right side of the back, just below the scapula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This incontestable fact belies the claim of appellant that he was attacked by Lacaden with an ice pick.&nbsp; Such attack would have required the latter to face him; and, logically, a gunshot entry wound would have been in the front — not in the back — portion of Lacaden’s body.&nbsp; The wound in the back of the victim clearly shows that he was shot while his back was turned to appellant.&nbsp; Hence, there was no unlawful aggression on the part of the former.<br><br>Neither was any ice pick presented in the proceedings before the RTC.&nbsp; Appellant maintains that his testimony, coupled with that of Pavabier, is sufficient to establish the existence of the weapon.&nbsp; But the prosecution witnesses, including the victim himself, testified otherwise —that there was no unlawful aggression during the incident, much less with the use of an ice pick.&nbsp; The RTC held thus:<br><blockquote>“In the case of Jun Lacaden, he was shot in the back which could only corroborate the evidence to the effect that he was also in the act of fleeing from the fury of gunfire from Catbagan.&nbsp; As to the allegation of the latter that Jun Lacaden had an icepick, that claim is rather nebulous.&nbsp; Firstly, as veteran criminal investigator, he should have taken, kept and presented that said instrument to augment his legal excuse.&nbsp; Secondly, if really there was one, it is rather surprising why he did not demand Jun Lacaden for its surrender initially as he passed thru the pedestrian steel door and subsequently while the latter had positioned himself near the owner-type jeep.<br><br>“More importantly, granting that Jun Lacaden had an icepick, and/or had any design to launch an attack against Catbagan, the former was just too far a distance away to do real harm to the accused.&nbsp; From 6-7 meters, as clarified from the accused himself, it is ridiculous for us to believe that Jun Lacaden could stab him. More so because the accused himself testified that the two arms of Jun Lacaden were raised upward which is not to mention that Catbagan had already demonstrated his proficiency and accuracy in the use of his .9 mm automatic pistol.&nbsp; Thus, there was, like that of Lapidante, no occasion to find as existing, the element of unlawful aggression.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote>Appellant has presented no sufficient reason to overturn these conclusive findings of the trial court.&nbsp; Aside from being completely in accord with logic and human experience, they are too solid to be debunked by him.<br><b><center><br><u>Third Issue:<br><i>Voluntary Surrender</i></u><br></center></b><br>Finally, appellant argues that even on the assumption that his guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt, he is still entitled to a mitigating circumstance.&nbsp; According to him, he voluntarily surrendered to the authorities after the occurrence of the incident, a fact not only uncontroverted but even admitted by the prosecution.<br><br>For voluntary surrender to mitigate criminal liability, the following elements must concur: 1) the offender has not been actually arrested; 2) the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority; and 3) the surrender was voluntary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is sufficient that that act be spontaneous and clearly indicative of the intent of the accused to surrender unconditionally, because there is either an acknowledgement of guilt or a desire to save the authorities the trouble and the expense that would necessarily be incurred in searching for and capturing the culprit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>It was established that on the night after the shooting incident, appellant called up his immediate supervisor, Atty.

The absence of such intent was, in fact, even more apparent in the testimony of appellant, who said therein that he did not even look at the victim anymore.&nbsp; The former’s attention was concentrated on the latter, who was shouting, “<i>Ang mahaba, ang mahaba!</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The intent to kill, an essential element of the offense of frustrated or attempted homicide, must be proved by clear and convincing evidence and with the same degree of certainty as that required of the other elements of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The inference that such intent existed should not be drawn in the absence of circumstances sufficient to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; If it was absent but wounds were inflicted, the crime is not frustrated murder, but only physical injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In this case, the expert opinion of the doctor who treated Lacaden was that it would take the latter thirty days to heal and recover from the lone gunshot wound and to resume his normal work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Thus, a finding of less serious physical injuries<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> is proper.<br><br>Although the charge in the instant case is frustrated murder, a finding of guilt for the lesser offense of less serious physical injuries may be made, considering that the essential ingredients of this lesser offense are necessarily included in or form part of those constituting the graver one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In the same manner, a conviction may be for slight or serious physical injuries in a prosecution for homicide or murder, inasmuch as the infliction of the former, when carried out to the utmost degree, could lead to the latter offense.&nbsp; Such conviction may be made, without intent to kill — an essential element of the crime of homicide or murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>To summarize, in Criminal Case No. 1082-M-98, appellant is found guilty of homicide, for which the penalty prescribed is <i>reclusion temporal.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Since he proved a majority of the elements of self-defense — unlawful aggression and lack of sufficient provocation — the penalty prescribed by law may be lowered by two degrees<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> to <i>prision correccional</i>.&nbsp; Considering further the presence of the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender without any aggravating circumstance, the penalty shall be imposed in its minimum period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The Indeterminate Sentence Law is applicable in this case.&nbsp; Hence appellant should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall be that which may properly be imposed under the Revised Penal Code; and the minimum of which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower than that prescribed by the Code — in this case, <i>arresto mayor</i>.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 1083-M-98, appellant is found guilty of homicide, for which the penalty prescribed by law is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Again, considering the presence of the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender without any aggravating circumstance, the penalty shall be imposed in its minimum period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The Indeterminate Sentence Law is also applicable to this case.&nbsp; Hence, appellant should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall be that which may properly be imposed under the Revised Penal Code; and the minimum of which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower than that prescribed by the Code&nbsp; — in this case, <i>prision mayor</i>.<br><br>Finally, as to Criminal Case No. 1099-M-98, appellant is found guilty of less serious physical injuries, for which the penalty prescribed by law is <i>arresto mayor</i>.&nbsp; Again, considering the presence of the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender without any aggravating circumstance, the penalty shall be imposed in its minimum period<br><br>Coming now to pecuniary liabilities, the heirs of the victims Suico and Lapidante in Criminal Case Nos. 1082-M-98 and 1083-M-98, respectively, are entitled to a fixed sum representing civil indemnity for death.&nbsp; Death indemnity is currently fixed at P50,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> This kind of civil indemnity is separate and distinct from other forms of indemnity for damages and is automatically awarded without need of further proof other than the fact of death and the responsibility of the accused therefor.<br><br>Proof of moral damages was presented through the testimony of Lapidante’s wife.&nbsp; The RTC’s award of such damages herein is excessive, however, considering that it is not meant to enrich an injured party. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Hence, in Criminal Case No. 1083-M-98, the amount thereof should be reduced to P50,000.&nbsp; In the other two cases, there being no proof of moral damages, the award therefor is deleted.&nbsp; Moral damages cannot be granted in the absence of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>It is also proper to award compensation to the heirs of the victims for loss of earning capacity, pursuant to Article 2206 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The documents presented, coupled with the testimonies of Elsie Suico and Rosita Lapidante, are sufficient bases for the award.<br><br>At the time of his death, Suico, forty-four (44) years old,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> was receiving a monthly take-home pay of P942.70,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> as proven and admitted.&nbsp; To compute his net earnings, we multiply this amount by 12 to get his annual income; then deduct the reasonable and necessary living expenses which, in the absence of contrary evidence, is pegged at 50 percent of the earnings.&nbsp; Applying the formula “Net earning capacity = [2/3 x (80 – age at time of death) x (gross annual income – reasonable and necessary living expenses)],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> we arrive at a loss of earning capacity of P135,748.80.<br><br>Applying the same formula to Lapidante who was thirty-five (35) years old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> at the time of his death, with a monthly take-home pay of P10,004.24<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> and an additional income of P1,000.00 for slaughtering pigs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> we arrive at a loss of earning capacity of P1,980,763.20.&nbsp;

thus, we should exclude it from the award of actual damages.<br><br>Finally, with respect to the civil indemnities for Lacaden, the award for actual damages — for hospitalization and medicines — should be P4,589.86, as only this amount was properly covered by receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The amount of P1,831, allegedly for hospital services, was included in a list presented by the victim, but was not properly supported by any receipt or record;
