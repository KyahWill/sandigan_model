The trial court found appellant Hairatul Jubail alias Shaira Jubail (“Hairatul”) guilty of violating Section 15, Article III, in relation to Section 21(b), Article IV, of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The trial court acquitted Hairatul’s co-accused, Ruaina Nuruddin alias Ruai Nuruddin (“Ruaina”), on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>The Information charging Hairatul and Ruaina of selling shabu states:<br><blockquote> That on or about November 12, 1998, in the City of Zamboanga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the  above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together, mutually aiding and assisting with one another, not being authorized by law to sell, deliver, transport, distribute or give away to another, did then and  there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver to Sr. Inspector Nickson Muksan y Babul, PNP, 2nd Zamboanga City Mobile Group, poseur-buyer, one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic pack containing white crystalline substance and positively tested for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride popularly known as “SHABU” weighing 298.2 grams, knowing same to be a regulated drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>When arraigned on 11 December 1998, Hairatul and Ruaina pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial then followed.<br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Trial</span> </center><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Prosecution’s Version</span> </center> <br>The prosecution presented five witnesses: (1) Chief Inspector Nickson Babul Muksan (“Chief Inspector Muksan”); (2) SPO2 Gualberto Serencio (“SPO2 Serencio”); (3) Police Inspector Mercedes Delfin Diestro (“Police Inspector Diestro”); (4) PO2 Geronimo Miñoza (“PO2 Miñoza”); and (5) PO1 Noel Falcasantos (“PO1 Falcasantos”).<br><br>Chief Inspector Muksan, a 1990 graduate of the Philippine Military Academy, was then the Group Director of the 2nd Mobile Group of the Philippine National Police (“PNP”) in Zamboanga City. Chief Inspector Muksan testified that a female civilian informant (“informant”) reported to him the activities of a certain drug pusher selling shabu in Zamboanga City. The informant, however, refused to reveal the name of the pusher.<br><br>Chief Inspector Muksan formed a team composed of PO2 Miñoza, PO1 Cuadra, PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez to conduct surveillance on the alleged pusher.  The team, with the help of the informant, conducted surveillance for more than a week.  The team reported to Chief Inspector Muksan that they were far from the place where the illegal drug activities allegedly occurred so they just relied on the report of the informant. After the surveillance, the informant revealed to Chief Inspector Muksan that the first name of the pusher was “Shaira” and that she had long hair and medium built body. The informant did not give the surname of the pusher.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Chief Inspector Muksan narrated that on 11 November 1998, he instructed the informant to arrange for the sale of 300 grams of shabu worth P276,000 with the pusher. The sale was to take place around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon, 12 November 1998, on Ruste Drive, San Roque. Chief Inspector Muksan prepared the marked money and newspaper cut outs in the size of peso bills. He placed genuine P500 and P100 bills on top of the stack of newspaper cutouts.  He then put them inside an open carton wrapped with newspaper. The carton appeared full of bundles of genuine money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 12 November 1998, before 5:00 o’clock in the morning, Chief Inspector Muksan briefed PO2 Miñoza, PO1 Cuadra, PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez on the plan for the buy-bust operation.  Chief Inspector Muksan would act as poseur-buyer while his operatives would assist him during the operation.  The group members, in civilian clothes, left their headquarters around 5:00 o’clock in the morning and proceeded to San Roque.  When they arrived in San Roque, Chief Inspector Muksan, PO2 Miñoza, PO1 Cuadra and the informant hid in an abandoned house about forty meters from the road.  PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez hid some fifty meters away where they could see Chief Inspector Muksan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon, the informant signaled to Chief Inspector Muksan that the pushers were coming. The informant and the pushers contacted each other by cellular phone. Chief Inspector Muksan went out of the house and followed the informant. PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Cuadra stayed inside the house. When Chief Inspector Muksan reached the road, he saw two motorized tricycles.  One tricycle had two women on board while the other tricycle had on board two women and a young boy 8 or 9 years old.<br><br>When Chief Inspector Muksan reached the road, he saw the informant talking to the four women and the boy.  The informant introduced Chief Inspector Muksan in the Tausog dialect as the person who would buy the shabu. The informant introduced two of the women as Shaira (“Hairatul”) and Ruai (“Ruaina”). According to Chief Inspector Muksan, he handed the buy-bust money to the informant who gave it to Hairatul.  Ruaina took the money from Hairatul and placed it inside her shoulder bag.  Hairatul then handed to Chief Inspector Muksan a red Jollibee plastic bag.  Chief Inspector Muksan opened the red Jollibee plastic bag and saw a transparent plastic pack containing white crystalline substance, which he presumed to be shabu.  Chief Inspector Muksan then turned his face and scratched his head as a sign to his men to come out and assist him in arresting the pushers. Chief Inspector Muksan arrested Hairatul and Ruaina by holding them in the arm while waiting for his operatives.  The two other women and the young boy ran away and boarded a tricycle.<br><br>PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Cuadra arrived and helped Chief Inspector Muksan in holding Hairatul and Ruaina. Chief Inspector Muksan took Hairatul’s black shoulder bag that contained her passport, while PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Cuadra held Ruaina and grabbed her brown shoulder bag that contained the buy-bust money and her bankbook.  When PO1 Valdez and PO1 Falcasantos arrived at the scene, Chief Inspector Muksan ordered them to arrest the two women and young boy who nevertheless escaped. Chief Inspector Muksan and his men then boarded a public utility vehicle and brought Hairatul and Ruaina to the office of the 2nd Mobile Group for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>SPO2 Serencio testified that he was the investigator of the case. On 12 November 1998, around 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon, Chief Inspector Muksan turned over Hairatul and Ruaina to SPO2 Serencio, along with the following items: the transparent plastic pack containing white crystalline substance, the marked money, the shoulder bags belonging to Hairatul and Ruaina, Hairatul’s passport and Ruaina’s bankbook.  SPO2 Serencio recorded Hairatul and Ruaina’s turnover to him in Complaint Assignment Sheet No. 166-98.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>SPO2 Serencio then prepared the request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for laboratory examination addressed to the PNP Crime Laboratory to determine whether the white crystalline substance was shabu.  SPO2 Serencio also prepared the (1) affidavit of Chief Inspector Muksan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (2) joint affidavit of PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (3) joint affidavit of PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Cuadra,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (4) Case Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and (5) Supplemental Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On cross-examination, SPO2 Serencio testified that Chief Inspector Muksan turned over to him the buy-bust money that was inside a black plastic bag.  The buy-bust money was not inside the brown shoulder bag of Ruaina when Chief Inspector Muksan turned over to SPO2 Serencio Ruaina’s shoulder bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Police Inspector and Forensic Chemist Diestro of the PNP Crime Laboratory testified that on 12 November 1998, around 5:30 in the afternoon, she received a request for laboratory examination to determine the presence of prohibited or regulated drugs on a sample that Chief Inspector Muksan submitted.  Police Inspector Diestro conducted the test on the white crystalline substance contained inside the transparent heat-sealed plastic bag Chief Inspector Muksan submitted. The substance weighed 298.2 grams and the tests showed that it contained Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or shabu.  Police Inspector Diestro then prepared Physical Science Report No. D-310-98<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> on her findings on the tests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>PO2 Miñoza testified that he was part of the team headed by Chief Inspector Muksan that conducted a buy-bust operation on 12 November 1998 on Ruste Drive in San Roque. The team arrived in San Roque around 5:00 o’clock in the morning because there was no definite time when the pushers would arrive. He and PO1 Cuadra posted themselves at a store near Ruste Drive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon, he saw Chief Inspector Muksan stepping back and putting his hands on his head, which was the signal for them to arrest the pushers. Before Chief Inspector Muksan gave the signal, PO2 Miñoza did not see what was happening between Chief Inspector Muksan and the pushers because he and PO1 Cuadra hid themselves. After the signal, PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Cuadra assisted Chief Inspector Muksan in arresting Hairatul and Ruaina.  PO2 Miñoza handcuffed Ruaina. The two other women escaped on board a tricycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>PO1 Falcasantos testified that on 12 November 1998, he was at the 2nd Mobile    Force Station in Zamboanga City. Before 5:00 o’clock in the morning, Chief Inspector Muksan informed them that they would proceed to San Roque and conduct a buy-bust operation that day. Chief Inspector Muksan was the group director while the members were PO2 Miñoza, PO1 Cuadra, PO1 Valdez and PO1 Falcasantos.  PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Cuadra would stay near Chief Inspector Muksan while PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez would act as back-up for the group.<br><br>After the briefing, PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez rode a passenger jeepney to San Roque.  When they arrived in San Roque, PO1 Falcansantos and PO1 Valdez stationed themselves at the back of a house. They were there from 5:00 o’clock in the morning until 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon. During that time, they did not communicate or see Chief Inspector Muksan and the other members of the group.<br><br>PO1 Falcasantos testified that around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon, he saw Chief Inspector Muksan, PO2 Miñoza, PO1 Cuadra and the suspected pushers standing by the road near an abandoned house. PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez then approached Chief Inspector Muksan who told them to arrest the two other women and a boy. However, PO1 Falcasantos and PO1 Valdez failed to arrest the two women and the boy who quickly boarded a tricycle. They rejoined their group and they proceeded to their station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Defense’s Version</span> </center> <br>The defense presented five witnesses: (1) appellant Hairatul; (2) Hairatul’s co-accused, Ruaina; (3) Hairatul’s father, Bakun Jubail; (4) Putli Mohammad; and (5) Merhana Hadil.<br><br>At the time she testified, Hairatul was 24 years old and a    resident of Kagay, Talipao, Sulu.  She graduated from the Notre Dame of Jolo College in 1992 with a degree in midwifery.  Hairatul took the midwifery licensure examination in 1993 but failed.  On 8 November 1998, she accompanied her father Bakun Jubail to Zamboanga City for a medical check-up. They stayed at her cousin’s house in Sta. Catalina in Zamboanga City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Hairatul testified that on 12 November 1998, around 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon, she shopped at Shop-O-Rama and Shopper’s Plaza in Zamboanga City with her father Bakun and her cousin Ruaina. While inside one of the department stores, Hairatul met a school friend from Jolo named Fatima, who was a former resident of Bus-bus, Jolo, Sulu.  Fatima, who was already residing in Zamboanga City, invited Hairatul and Ruaina to her mother’s house in San Roque.  Hairatul asked permission from her father Bakun to accept Fatima’s invitation.  Bakun agreed but told them not to stay long.<br><br>Hairatul, Ruaina and Fatima rode a passenger jeepney to San Roque. When they arrived at the house of Fatima’s mother in San Roque, Hairatul and Ruaina had drinks and snacks.  Hairatul and Ruaina met Fatima’s mother Rakag, and Fatima’s brother who was 8 or 9 years old.  Rakag’s house is small with just one room. The house is about 50 meters from the main road of San Roque.<br><br>Around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon, Hairatul and Ruaina asked permission to leave and Rakag told them that they would leave together since they were going to Campo Islam. While they were about ten meters away from the main road, a tall dark person, whom Hairatul later identified as Chief Inspector Muksan, held Fatima’s hand and grabbed the red Jollibee plastic bag Fatima carried. While Fatima was struggling, the two companions of Chief Inspector Muksan held Hairatul and Ruaina and took their shoulder bags. They identified themselves as police officers.  Hairatul and Ruaina cried as they struggled with the police officers, wondering why they were being arrested.  After the commotion, Hairatul learned that Rakag, Fatima and the young boy escaped. The police officers who arrested Hairatul and Ruaina then brought them to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>At the time she testified, Ruaina was 26 years old and a resident of Bus-bus, Jolo, Sulu. She graduated from the Sulu State College in 1996 with a degree in Education.  Ruaina took the licensure examination for elementary school teachers on 1 August 1998 at the Baliwasan Central School in Zamboanga City.  She went back to Zamboanga City on the first week of November 1998 to follow-up the result and learned that she flunked the examination. While in Zamboanga City, Ruaina stayed at her cousin Ahajan’s house in Sta. Catalina. Her cousin Hairatul and Hairatul’s father Bakun also stayed in that house while in Zamboanga City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Ruaina testified that on 12 November 1998, around 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon, she shopped with Hairatul and Bakun at the Shop-O-Rama and Shopper’s Plaza. Ruaina wanted to buy something before going home to Jolo that evening. While shopping, they met Fatima who used to be Ruaina’s neighbor in Bus-bus, Jolo but who was already residing in Zamboanga City. Fatima invited Hairatul and Ruaina to her house in San Roque. Fatima was insistent that Hairatul and Ruaina go with her. Ruaina and Hairatul accepted Fatima’s invitation and they rode a passenger utility jeepney to San Roque.<br><br>After alighting from the jeepney, Ruaina, Hairatul and  Fatima proceeded to Fatima’s house. Ruaina and Hairatul met Fatima’s mother, Rakag and Fatima’s younger brother. Rakag offered them some snacks and they talked about the situation in Jolo. Thirty minutes later, Ruaina and Hairatul asked permission to leave because they would return to Jolo that day and had to prepare their things. Rakag told Ruaina and Hairatul that they would go with them because they would visit some relatives in Campo Islam.<br><br>While they were on their way to the main road, a tall man whom Ruaina later identified as Chief Inspector Muksan rushed to Fatima and grabbed the red Jollibee plastic bag Fatima carried. There was a commotion and Ruaina became afraid. Four other men arrived, held Ruaina and Hairatul, and grabbed their shoulder bags. Ruaina and Hairatul cried and asked their captors what was happening.  Some of those who held Ruaina and Hairatul left them and ran after Fatima, Rakag and the young boy who all escaped.  The men brought Ruaina and Hairatul to the police station. Only then did Ruaina learn that their captors were police officers arresting them because the red Jollibee plastic bag seized from Fatima contained shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Bakun Jubail (“Bakun”) testified that his daughter accompanied him to Zamboanga City on 8 November 1998 for his medical treatment. They stayed at his nephew’s house in Sta. Catalina, Zamboanga City. On 9 November 1998, Dr. Ireneo P. Cases examined Bakun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  On 12 November 1998, around 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon, Bakun, Hairatul and Ruaina met Fatima while they were shopping. Hairatul told Bakun that Fatima was inviting them to Fatima’s house. Bakun preferred to go home and did not join Hairatul and Ruaina who went with Fatima. Bakun learned later that day that the police had arrested Hairatul and Ruaina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Putli Mohammad (“Putli”) testified that on 12 November 1998, around 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon, she boarded a passenger jeepney on her way to San Roque.  Hairatul, Ruaina and Fatima were also passengers on the jeepney. Putli knew Hairatul, Ruaina and Fatima because they all came from the same barangay. Putli, a resident of Barangay Kagay, Talipao, Sulu, was in Zamboanga City to accompany someone who was applying for a job abroad. Putli asked Hairatul and Ruaina where they were going and they replied that Fatima invited them to go to her house. After Fatima paid their fare, Putli, Fatima, Hairatul and Ruaina alighted on Ruste Drive. Putli proceeded to her nephew’s house in San Roque while the three women went the opposite direction towards Fatima’s house. About three hours later, Putli learned that the police arrested some people that afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Merhana Hadil (“Merhana”) testified that she is a resident of Kagay, Talipao, Sulu. On 7 November 1998, her aunt Putli accompanied her to Zamboanga City to apply for a job abroad. On 12 November 1998, around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon, while on her way to the market, Merhana saw Hairatul, Ruaina, Fatima, Dakag (sic) and a young boy about 20 meters in front of her. Fatima carried a red plastic bag while Hairatul and Ruaina carried shoulder bags. Suddenly a tall man approached Fatima and grabbed the red plastic bag Fatima carried. While the tall man was holding Fatima, four other men approached the four women and the boy. Fearing that a shooting might occur, Merhana hurriedly went home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Trial Court’s Ruling</span> </center> <br>On 15 October 1999, the trial court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused HAIRATUL JUBAIL y KILIH alias SHAIRA JUBAIL y AHARUL GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of Violation of Section 15, Article III in relation to Section 21 (b), Article IV of Republic Act No. 6425, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended, and SENTENCES said accused to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and its accessory penalties, to pay the fine of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND (<i>P500,000.00</i>), and to pay the costs.

The trial court relied on the presumption that there was regular performance of public duty by police officers since the accused did not adduce evidence of any improper or ill motive by the police officers to testify falsely against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The trial court found the allegations of Hairatul and Ruaina that the red Jollibee plastic bag containing the shabu was taken from Fatima as just a ploy to shift criminal responsibility to Fatima whose whereabouts is no longer known.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The trial court held that the testimony of Hairatul and Ruaina could not prevail over the testimony of Chief Inspector Muksan that Hairatul handed to him the red Jollibee plastic bag containing the shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, the trial court held that the passive act of Ruaina in receiving the buy-bust money, which was inside a carton, does not prove that she conspired with Hairatul. Thus, the trial court acquitted Ruaina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"> <u>The Issues</u> </center><br>In her Appellant’s Brief, Hairatul submits that:<br><ol type="a"><li>The trial court seriously erred in giving credence to the uncorroborated and inconsistent testimony of Senior Inspector Nickson Muksan.<br><br></li><li>The trial court seriously erred in concluding that there was a sale of shabu.<br><br></li><li>The failure to call to the witness stand the informant is fatal to the cause of the prosecution.<br><br></li><li>The trial court seriously erred in applying to the instant case the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.<br><br></li><li>The trial court seriously erred in not giving credence and weight to the testimonies of the accused and her witnesses.<br><br></li><li>The trial court seriously erred in not applying the ruling of the Supreme Court in the <i>Melosantos</i> and <i>Crisostomo</i> cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></li></ol><br><u style="font-weight: bold;"><center><u>The Court’s Ruling </u></center> </u><br>We find the appeal meritorious.

The reviewing tribunal can correct errors though unassigned in the appeal, or even reverse the trial court’s decision on grounds other than those the parties raised as errors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"> <i>Credibility of Chief Inspector Muksan as Lone Prosecution Eyewitness</i> </center><br>In convicting Hairatul, the trial court relied mainly on the testimony of Chief Inspector Muksan as sole eyewitness for the prosecution. The other members of the buy-bust operation did not witness the actual exchange of shabu and buy-bust money between Chief Inspector Muksan, who acted as poseur-buyer, and the pushers.  Prosecution witnesses PO2 Miñoza and PO1 Falcasantos repeatedly admitted that they did not witness what happened between Chief Inspector Muksan and the pushers before the actual arrest because they were hiding far from the scene of the crime.

Trial courts should always require precise and convincing testimony in cases involving buy-bust operations lest an innocent person suffer the severe penalties for drug offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>There are other discrepancies in the statements of Chief Inspector Muksan, which weaken the probative value of the prosecution’s evidence.<br><br>First, Chief Inspector Muksan failed to give a plausible explanation why his team had to be in San Roque at 5:00 o’clock in the morning on 12 November 1998 when the scheduled buy-bust operation was at 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon.  Chief Inspector Muksan requested the informant on 11 November 1998 to tell the pusher that they would buy shabu at 3:00 o’clock the following day in San Roque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> When asked during cross-examination why they had to be in San Roque as early as 5:00 o’clock in the morning, Chief Inspector Muksan gave the following explanation, which contradicted his earlier testimony:<br><br> <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">And the civilian informant was also there at 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes.<br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Why she be there at 5:00 o’clock when the transaction was at 3:00 o’clock?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">So that we could also know our position/so that we will know our position because that is the place where we agreed upon.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">So, from 5:00 o’clock in the morning to 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon the civilian informant was also there with you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">Why was she there when the supposed buy-bust transaction will take place at 3:00 o’clock?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"> <div align="justify">Waiting for the accused.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">Why she do that 5:00 o’clock, 6:00 o’clock, 7:00 o’clock, 8:00 o’clock . . . ten (10) hours why she be waiting for ten hours knowing that the accused is the supposed suspect will come at 3:00 o’clock, why she be there waiting?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td>A:</td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"> Because the accused in my own assessment the accused is not accurate in giving time it might be in the morning or anytime on the same day.</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="2">COURT:</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td>Proceed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

However, when the police officers arrested Hairatul and Ruaina and confiscated their shoulder bags, the police officers did not find any cellular phone in their possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This casts doubt on the identity of the pusher and militates against the claim of the prosecution that Hairatul was the pusher.<br><br><b><i>Non-Presentation of the Informant</i></b><br><br>In the face of Chief Inspector Muksan’s inconsistent testimony, the testimony of the informant is indispensable. More so in this case where the police engaged the informant’s services for the first time in a buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The prosecution did not present as witness the informant who apparently was the only eyewitness to the entire transaction. The testimony of a police informant in an illegal drug case is not essential to convict the accused since the testimony would be merely corroborative and cumulative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> However, where the informant is the only eyewitness to the illegal transaction, his testimony is essential and non-presentation of the informant is fatal to the prosecution’s cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As held in <i><b>People v. Zheng Bai Hui:</b></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><blockquote> Except when the appellant vehemently denies selling prohibited drugs and there are material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the arresting officers, or there are reasons to believe that the arresting officers had motives to testify falsely against the appellant, or that only the informant as the poseur-buyer who actually witnessed the entire transaction, the testimony of the informant may be dispensed with as it will be merely corroborative of the apprehending officers’ eyewitness testimonies. There is no need to present the informant in court where the sale was actually witnessed and adequately proved by prosecution witnesses.<br></blockquote>In this case, Hairatul denied selling the shabu and testified that the red Jollibee plastic bag which contained shabu was not hers but Fatima’s. Chief Inspector Muksan, the only eyewitness presented by the prosecution, did not witness the entire transaction.  Chief Inspector Muksan did not witness the most crucial moment when the pusher handed over the shabu to the buyer.  When Chief Inspector Muksan arrived at the scene, the red Jollibee plastic bag containing the shabu was already in the possession of the informant. Thus, the testimony of the informant is essential in this case to prove with certainty the identity of the seller of the shabu.<br><br>The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty cannot by itself overcome the presumption of innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> An accused in a criminal case is presumed innocent until proven otherwise and the prosecution has the burden of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The evidence of the prosecution must stand on its own weight and not rely on the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this case, the Court finds that the prosecution has failed to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence and to prove with moral certainty the guilt of Hairatul.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 15 October 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Zamboanga City, Branch 16, in Criminal Case No. 15557 is <b>REVERSED. </b>Appellant Hairatul Jubail is <b>ACQUITTED</b> on the ground of reasonable doubt.
