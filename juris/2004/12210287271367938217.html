Declaration of Real Property No. 01846, for the year 1994, is for the property covered by    TCT No. T-305595, and identifies the market value of the property to be P137,880.00.<br><br>Samaniego explained that the amount appearing on the declaration of real property stands for the value of a certain parcel of land per square meter if the land is residential, commercial or industrial, and per hectare if it is agricultural. The unit value is based on the schedule of market value prepared during the revision, which is approved by the Provincial Assessor and submitted to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for approval.

The contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage, in any of the following cases:<br><br>(1)     When the price of a sale with right to repurchase is unusually inadequate;<br><br>(2)     When the vendor remains in possession as lessee or otherwise;<br><br>(3)     When upon or after the expiration of the right to repurchase another instrument extending the period of redemption or granting a new period is executed;<br><br>(4)     When the purchaser retains for himself a part of the purchase price;<br><br>(5)     When the vendor binds himself to pay the taxes on the thing sold;<br><br>(6)     In any other case where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation.<br><br>In any of the foregoing cases, any money, fruits, or other benefit to be received by the vendee as rent or otherwise shall be considered as interest which shall be subject to the usury laws.<br></blockquote>It is well-settled that the presence of even one of the foregoing circumstances is sufficient to declare a contract as an equitable mortgage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></sup> in consonance with the rule that the law favors the least transmission of property rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></sup> For the presumption of an equitable mortgage to arise under Article 1602, two requisites must concur: (1) that the parties entered into a contract denominated as a sale; and (2) that their intention was to secure an existing debt by way of a mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></sup><br><br>After a careful review of the records of the case, we find no cogent reason to disturb the ruling of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Actori incumbit onus probandi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></sup> Upon the plaintiff in a civil case, the burden of proof never parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></sup> Plaintiff must therefore establish her case by a preponderance of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></sup> She has the burden of presenting evidence required to obtain a favorable judgment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></sup> and she, having the burden of proof, will be defeated if no evidence were given on either side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></sup><br><br>In this case, it was incumbent upon San Pedro to adduce sufficient evidence to support her claim of an equitable mortgage.  Petitioner relies on paragraphs 1, 2, 5 and 6 of Article 1602.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></sup> Upon an examination of the evidence, we find insufficient basis to conclude the existence of any of the grounds she relied upon.<br><br>Anent alleged inadequacy of the purchase price, petitioner presented two witnesses who testified as to the market values of real estate in the subject locale.  Neither of these witnesses, however, was able to conclusively demonstrate that the purchase price of the property was grossly inadequate.<br><br>The testimony of the purported broker, Adela Ortega, was not given any credence by the Court of Appeals.  We quote with approval the ruling of the Court of Appeals on this point:<br><blockquote>Plaintiff-appellee’s witness Adela Ortega failed to substantiate her allegation that the prevailing price of the subject property at the time of the sale (1985) was P60.00 per square meter.  Although Adela Ortega claimed that she was able to sell lots adjacent to the subject property at the said prevailing price, she failed to present proof of such claim despite her reservation to do so.  Moreover, Adela Ortega’s competency and credibility as an experienced real estate broker is also suspect or questionable.  She admitted that she was not aware or familiar with the factors or bases that affect the increase in the value of realty, or how does it influence the zonal valuation made by the local government, which should be very basic to a real estate broker.<br></blockquote>The second witness, BIR Revenue Supervisor Juanito Angeles, testified as to the market value of properties in the subject locale as of the effectivity of Department Order No. 83-94, on<u> September 25, 1994.</u>  However, it must be noted that Angeles did not testify as to the market value of the locale as of <u>May 23, 1985</u>, the date of the contract in question.  Neither did petitioner present any other evidence of the real estate market values as of that date.<br><br>Absent any evidence of the market value of the locale as of the date of the contract, it cannot be concluded that the price at which the property was sold, or about P8.70 per square meter, was grossly inadequate.  Mere inadequacy of price would not be sufficient.  The price must be <u>grossly</u> inadequate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> or purely shocking to the conscience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Since the property in question could have been worth as little as P20.00 per square meter in 1994, the price of P8.70 per square meter nine years earlier, in 1985, does not seem to be grossly inadequate. Indeed, respondents’ Declaration of Real Property No. 10786, for the year 1987, shows the market value of the property to be only P34,470.00 for that year.<br><br>As regards the alleged continuous possession of the property in question, San Pedro presented Federico Santos, who testified that he is a farmer by occupation, currently tilling a farmholding of less than two hectares located at San Juan, Balagtas, Bulacan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> owned by Erlinda San Pedro, to whom he has been paying lease rentals of 18 cavans a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The testimony of the witness was offered to prove that he was the agricultural leasehold tenant of the petitioner on the parcel of land which was described in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>However, while the witness may have established that he was, indeed, the agricultural tenant of the petitioner, the identity of the parcel of land which he tills and the parcel of land described in the complaint was not established.  The “<i>Kasunduan sa Buwisan</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> entered into between Federico J. Santos and Lourdes Manalo Vda. De San Pedro dated May 14, 1975 reiterates the tenancy relation between witness Santos and the San Pedro family.  The parcel of land described therein has an area of 1.5 hectares,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> while the property subject of the contract in question has an area of 17,235 square meters, or 1.72 hectares.  There is therefore no clear indicator that the parcel of land being tilled by Santos is, indeed, the parcel of land subject of the contract between San Pedro and Lee.  Although a landowner-tenant relation has been established between San Pedro and Santos, we cannot conclude therefrom that San Pedro was in possession of the property subject of the “<i>Kasulatan ng Ganap na Bilihan ng Lupa</i>” through her tenant Federico Santos.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the direct connection between the parcel of land tilled by Santos and the land in question needs no proof, in view of the purported admission by respondents in the course of the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Specifically, petitioner points to (1) an alleged admission made by respondents’ counsel during the cross-examination of witness Federico Santos on July 3, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and (2) a statement made in respondents’ Comment/Opposition to Plaintiff’s Formal Offer of Evidence, to the effect that petitioner’s exercise of rights of ownership over the parcel of land in question amounts to a usurpation of respondents’ rights as owner of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Petitioner relies on Rule 129, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides in part that “<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[a]</sup>n admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof”.<br><br>An examination of the records of the case, however, will readily disclose that no such admission was made either by respondents or by respondents’ counsel.  The question propounded by respondents’ counsel on July 3, 1995, is as follows:<br><br>Q    Mr. Witness, are you aware of the fact that since 1985 the land you have been cultivating has been transferred in the name of Sps. Ruben Lee and Lilian Sison?<br><br>A     No, ma’am.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Mr. Witness, are you aware of the fact that since 1985 the land you have been cultivating has been transferred in the name of Sps. Ruben Lee and Lilian Sison?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>No, ma’am.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>In the assessment of this Court, said question contains absolutely no admission that the parcel of land tilled by Santos is in fact the parcel of land subject of the contract in question.<br><br>We likewise find no admission made in respondents’ Comment/Opposition to Plaintiff’s Formal Offer of Evidence.  The alleged admission was made in the comment/objection to petitioner’s Exhibits F to F-14, the Receipts of Payments of Rentals by Federico Santos to Erlinda San Pedro, and reads:<br><blockquote>These receipts do not prove rights of ownership.  The same even show acts of USURPATION of the Rights of Ownership of the defendants by the plaintiff and her alleged tenant since Title to the property in question is now in the name of Defendant spouses as Evidenced by TCT No. T-305595.  (Ehx. B of the Plaintiff)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>On the contrary, what the foregoing portion of the Comment/Objection reveals is that:  <u>if</u> Santos was indeed tilling the parcel of land covered by TCT No. T-305595 as a tenant of San Pedro, San Pedro would be guilty of usurpation.<br><br>Rule 129, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that a judicial admission may be contradicted by showing that it was made through palpable mistake, or that no such admission was made.  Petitioner’s theory as regards the purported judicial admission is readily contradicted by a perusal of the records, which show that in fact no such admission was made by respondents.  We thus find no adequate proof for petitioner’s contention that she was exercising possessory rights over the parcel of land covered by TCT No. T-305595.<br><br>As a third ground for the establishment of the purported equitable mortgage, petitioner argues that paragraph 5 of Article 1602 is present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Again, petitioner presented no proof that she, as vendor of property, bound herself to pay taxes on the thing sold.<br><br>Finally, petitioner relies on Article 1602, paragraph 6, which applies to “any other case where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation.”<br><br>In contrast, respondents’ witnesses all testified as to the existence of a contract of sale between her and respondent Ruben Lee.  Pertinently, Philip dela Torre, who brokered the sale, and Atty. Venustiano Roxas, who prepared the contract in question, were both unequivocal as to the nature of the contract.  These two witnesses, whose impartiality was not impugned, both affirmed the sale of the subject property.<br><br>Respondents presented documentary evidence which shows that the contract was indeed a sale: (1) a receipt for P150,000.00 dated May 23, 1985, issued by Erlinda San Pedro, attesting full receipt of the amount in question;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (2) an authority to pay capital gains tax, executed by Erlinda San Pedro in favor of Ruben Lee;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and (3) an affidavit of non-tenancy executed by Erlinda San Pedro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>The “<u>Kasulatan ng Ganap na Bilihan ng Lupa</u>” unequivocally states the absolute sale of the property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-290387.  Being a notarized document, it carries the evidentiary weight conferred upon duly executed instruments provided by law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and is entitled to full faith and credit upon its face.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the decision of the Court of Appeals dated November 20, 2002, which dismissed the complaint filed by petitioner for lack of merit, is<b> AFFIRMED</b>.
