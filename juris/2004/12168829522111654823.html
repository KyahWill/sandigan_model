Ernan Libao.<br><br>On September 25, 1997, Barangay Captain Rodriguez appeared at the RAC Compound demanding the release of the lumber by presenting a letter-request addressed to the CENRO to salvage old cut timber, duly indorsed by Mayor Rodriguez.&nbsp; As the request did not bear the approval of the CENRO, it was denied.<br><br>On October 5, 1997, Pancol Barangay Captain Pedro Samaniego and the other herein petitioner, Igang Barangay Captain Andres Abonita, Jr., went to the RAC Compound upon orders of Mayor Rodriguez to haul the lumber to the Municipal Hall, but the officer-in-charge refused to release the same without the advice of EIIB authorities.&nbsp; On even date, acting upon the orders of Mayor Rodriguez, Barangay Captain Abonita returned to the RAC Compound accompanied by two fully armed policemen who then and there forcibly took possession, hauled, and transferred the lumber to the Municipal Hall of Taytay.<br><br>On November 7, 1996, Enrique A.

Sandiganbayan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They add that the repeated and ex-parte amendment of the information by the Ombudsman resulted to inordinate delay in bringing the case to trial, which is a ground for dismissal of the information under Section 13, in relation to Section 7 of R.A. 8493 (The Speedy Trial Act of 1998).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Petitioners likewise argue that the simultaneous filing by the Ombudsman of two informations against them, one before the Sandiganbayan (Criminal Case No. 25065), and the other before the Regional Trial Court in Puerto Princesa City (Criminal Case No. 14959), involving the same subject matter constitutes forum shopping which is expressly prohibited under the Supreme Court Revised Circular No. 28-91 directing the summary dismissal of multiple complaints or charges, and necessarily places both of them in “double danger of conviction and punishment for the same offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Petitioners additionally question the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, they arguing that they are not tasked with the enforcement and implementation of P.D. No. 705 (REVISED FORESTRY CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES) as neither of them are law enforcement officers or prosecutors but are mere executive officials of their respective local government units with entirely different official functions and, as such, the accusation against them is not in relation to their office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners thus conclude that the Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, as Section 4 of R.A. 8249 limits the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan to those offenses defined and penalized in Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII, Book II of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The petition fails.<br><br><i>Tatad v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> cited by petitioners has a different factual setting from the present case.&nbsp; The cases against Tatad remained dormant for almost three years, drawing this Court to dismiss them in light of the following observations: political motivation played a vital role in activating and propelling the prosecutorial process; there was a blatant departure from established procedures prescribed by law for the conduct of a preliminary investigation; and the long delay in resolving the preliminary investigation could not be justified on the basis of the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>From the records of the case at bar, it is gathered that the Provincial Prosecutor of Palawan took only three months, from November 7, 1996 to February 18, 1997, to come up with its resolution finding probable cause against petitioners.&nbsp; The Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon took eight months to review the case and come up with the joint review action on October 19, 1998.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Office of the Ombudsman acted on the case for around two months. Considering that the records were passed upon by three offices, the period of preliminary investigation, which did not exceed two years, cannot be deemed to have violated petitioners’ constitutionally guaranteed rights to procedural due process and to a speedy disposition of cases.<br><br>As <i>Ty-Dazo v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> instructs: <blockquote> The right to a speedy disposition of cases, like the right to a speedy trial, is deemed violated only when the proceedings [are] attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or when the unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured, or when without cause or unjustifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to elapse without the party having his case tried.&nbsp; In the determination of whether or not the right has been violated, the factors that maybe considered and balanced are: the length of the delay, the reasons for such delay, the assertion or failure to assert such right by the accused, and the prejudice caused by the delay.<br><br>A mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved, therefore, would not be sufficient.&nbsp; In the application of the constitutional guarantee of the right to speedy disposition of cases, particular regard must also be taken of the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </blockquote> Parenthetically, as reflected in the following observation of the Sandiganbayan, petitioners themselves contributed to the delay, thus: <blockquote> With respect to the alleged delay of the filing of the Information and for the delay in finally getting the case ready for arraignment, Prosecutor Evelyn T. Lucero has stated that, to a certain extent, the claim is valid although   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the delay is caused not unreasonably butbecause of the exercise of the right of the accused to determine whether or not they couldbe charged under the Information for which they have filed Motions to Quash</span>; thus, the delay cannot be considered unreasonable nor the grounds for setting aside the amended Information as it now stands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> The rule is well settled that the right to a speedy disposition of cases, like the right to a speedy trial, is deemed violated only when the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In further pressing for the dismissal of the case, petitioners cite Sections 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of R.A. 8493, averring that the unreasonable delay in bringing them to arraignment is a ground for the dismissal of the case, they having been arraigned only on January 17, 2000, after several and repeated amendments of the information.<br><br>The records show, however, that it was on account of petitioners’ continuous filing of motions that the arraignment was deferred.<br><br>Under Section 2 of Supreme Court Circular No. 38-98, Implementing Rules for R.A.8493, the pendency of petitioners’ motion to quash takes the case out from the time limit for arraignment (and pre-trial) provided under Section 2 of said law. <blockquote> <i>Sec. 2. Time Limit for Arraignment and Pre-trial.</i> -&nbsp; The arraignment, and the pre-trial if the accused pleads not guilty to the crime charged, shall be held within thirty (30) days from the date the court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the accused.&nbsp;  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The periodof the pendency of a motion to quash</span>, or for a bill of particulars, or other cause justifying suspension of arraignment <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall be excluded</span>. (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> On the claim of petitioners that the Sandiganbayan should be faulted for granting the repeated amendments of the information by the Ombudsman, suffice it to state that an information may be amended in form or in substance without leave of court at any time before an accused enters his plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In another attempt at having the case dismissed, petitioners aver that the Ombudsman committed forum shopping by filing the same information before the Sandiganbayan and the Regional Trial Court of Puerto Princesa, Palawan in violation of Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 (Additional Requisites for Petitions filed with the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals to Prevent Forum Shopping or Multiple Filing of Petitions and Complaints).<br><br>Assuming arguendo that indeed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same</span> information for violation of Section 1(b) of P.D. 1829 was also filed before the Regional Trial Court of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, then as the People by the Office of the Ombudsman through the Special Prosecutor contends in its Memorandum, “since the Information in Criminal Case No. 25065 was filed with the Sandiganbayan on December 8, 1988, while the information before the regional Trial Court was allegedly filed on February 24, 1999, then, if there is any case to be dismissed for forum shopping, that case should be the one before the Regional trial Court, as it was the second action filed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further assail the jurisdiction of Sandiganbayan over the offense for which they were indicted.<br><br>Lamentably, petitioners may well have been confused regarding the charge against them for instead of showing that the offense with which they were charged - violation of Section 1(b) of P.D. 1829 (obstruction of justice) - is not in relation to their office, they argued that they are not tasked with the enforcement and implementation of P.D. No. 705 – the offense subject of the investigation which petitioners allegedly obstructed or interfered with.<br><br>Petitioners are charged not for violation of P.D. 705 but of P.D. 1829, hence, petitioners’ argument that the act complained of was not done in relation to their office to take the case out of the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan does not lie.<br><br>At all events, Republic Act 8249, which amended Presidential Decree No. 1606, provides that <i><b>as long as one</b></i> (or more) of the accused is an official of the executive branch occupying position otherwise classified as Grade ‘27’ and higher of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Sandiganbayan exercises <b style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive original jurisdiction</b> over offenses or felonies committed by public officials whether simple or complexed with other crimes <b>committed by the public officials and employees in relation to their office.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>For purposes of vesting jurisdiction with the Sandiganbayan, the crux of the issue is whether petitioner Mayor Rodriguez, who holds a position of “Grade 27” under the Local Government Code of 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>, committed the offense charged in relation to her office.<br><br>In <i>Montilla v. Hilario</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>, this Court laid down the principle that for an offense to be committed in relation to the office, the relation between the crime and the office must be direct and not accidental, in that in the legal sense, the offense can not exist without the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>As an exception to <i>Montilla</i>, this Court, in <i>People v. Montejo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>     held that although public office is not an element of an offense charged, as long as the offense charged in the information is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intimatelyconnected with the office and is alleged to have been perpetrated while the accused was in theperformance, though improper or irregular, of his official functions, there being no personal motive tocommit the crime and had the accused would not have committed it had he not held the aforesaidoffice</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the accused is held to have been indicted for “an offense committed in relation” to his office.<br><br>Applying the exception laid down in <i>Montejo</i>, this Court in <i>Cunanan v. Arceo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> held that although public office is not an element of the crime of murder as it may be committed by any person, whether a public officer or a private citizen, the circumstances under which the therein petitioner, who was a member of the Philippine National Police, shot and killed the victim in the course of trying to restore local public order, bring the therein petitioner’s case squarely within the meaning of an “offense committed in relation to the [accused’s] public office.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In the present case, public office is not an essential element of the offense of obstruction of justice under Section 1(b) of P.D. 1829. The circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense alleged to have been committed by petitioner Rodriguez are such, however, that the offense may not have been committed had said petitioner not held the office of the mayor. As found during the preliminary investigation, petitioner Rodriguez, in the course of her duty as Mayor, who is tasked to exercise general and operational control and supervision over the local police forces<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>, used her influence, authority and office to call and command members of the municipal police of Taytay to haul and transfer the lumber which was still subject of an investigation for violation of P.D. 705.<br><br>The joint-counter affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> signed by petitioners during the preliminary investigation quoted the letter of petitioner Mayor Rodriguez to the municipal police officers, viz: <blockquote><blockquote> To:&nbsp; SPO1 Juanito G.

The averment in the information that petitioner Rodriguez, as municipal mayor, took advantage of her office and caused the hauling of the lumber to the municipal hall to obstruct the investigation of the case for violation of P.D. 705 effectively vested jurisdiction over the offense on the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; Thus, the amended information reads: <blockquote> <center>AMENDED INFORMATION<br></center><br>The undersigned Special Prosecution Officer II, Office of the Special Prosecutor, hereby accuses EVELYN VILLABERT RODRIGUEZ and ANDREWS BONITA JR. of Violation of Section 1(b), Presidential Decree No. 1829 committed as follows:<br><br>“That on or about October 5, 1996, at Sitio Igang, Barangay Poblacion, Municipality of Taytay, Province of Palawan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused EVELYN VILLABERT RODRIGUEZ and ANDREWS ABONITA JR., <i>both public officers, being the Municipal Mayor and Barangay Captain of Barangay Igang of the same municipality, respectively, committing the offense in relation to their office and taking advantage of the same</i>, confederating and conspiring with each other enter the compound of the Rural Agricultural Center (RAC) at Sitio Igang, Poblacion, Taytay, Palawan and while inside with force, intimidation and against the will of the one officially detailed thereat, 2LT.
