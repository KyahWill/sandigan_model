				<BR><BR><div align="justify">There is grave abuse of discretion (1) when an act is done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> or (2) when it is executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily out of malice, ill will or personal bias.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In the present case, the Commission on Elections approved the assailed Resolution and awarded the subject Contract not only in clear violation of law and jurisprudence, but also in reckless disregard of its own bidding rules and procedure. For the automation of the counting and canvassing of the ballots in the 2004 elections, Comelec awarded the Contract to “Mega Pacific Consortium” an entity that had not participated in the bidding. Despite this grant, the poll body signed the actual automation Contract with “Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc.,” a company that joined the bidding but had not met the eligibility requirements.<p></p><p>Comelec awarded this billion—peso undertaking with inexplicable haste, without adequately checking and observing mandatory financial, technical and legal requirements. It also accepted the proferred computer hardware and software even if, at the time of the award, they had undeniably failed to pass eight critical requirements designed to safeguard the integrity of elections, especially the following three items:&nbsp; </p><ul><li>They failed to achieve the accuracy rating criteria of 99.9995 percent set—up by the Comelec itself&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>They were not able to detect previously downloaded results at various canvassing or consolidation levels and to prevent these from being inputted again&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>They were unable to print the statutorily required audit trails of the count/canvass at different levels without any loss of data</li></ul><p>Because of the foregoing violations of law and the glaring grave abuse of discretion committed by Comelec, the Court has no choice but to exercise its solemn “constitutional duty”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to void the assailed Resolution and the subject Contract. The illegal, imprudent and hasty actions of the Commission have not only desecrated legal and jurisprudential norms, but have also cast serious doubts upon the poll body’s ability and capacity to conduct automated elections. Truly, the pith and soul of democracy — credible, orderly, and peaceful elections — has been put in jeopardy by the illegal and gravely abusive acts of Comelec.</p><p align="center"><em>The Case</em></p><p>Before us is a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking (1) to declare null and void Resolution No. 6074 of the Commission on Elections (Comelec), which awarded “Phase II of the Modernization Project of the Commission to Mega Pacific Consortium (MPC);” (2) to enjoin the implementation of any further contract that may have been entered into by Comelec “either with Mega Pacific Consortium and/or Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc. (MPEI);” and (3) to compel Comelec to conduct a re—bidding of the project.</p><p align="center"><em>The Facts</em></p><p>The following facts are not disputed. They were culled from official documents, the parties’ pleadings, as well as from admissions during the Oral Argument on October 7, 2003.</p><p>On June 7, 1995, Congress passed Republic Act 8046,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which authorized Comelec to conduct a nationwide demonstration of a computerized election system and allowed the poll body to pilot—test the system in the March 1996 elections in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).</p><p>On December 22, 1997, Congress enacted Republic Act 8436<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> authorizing Comelec to use an automated election system (AES) for the process of voting, counting votes and canvassing/consolidating the results of the national and local elections. It also mandated the poll body to acquire automated counting machines (ACMs), computer equipment, devices and materials; and to adopt new electoral forms and printing materials.</p><p>Initially intending to implement the automation during the May 11, 1998 presidential elections, Comelec — in its Resolution No. 2985 dated February 9, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> — eventually decided against full national implementation and limited the automation to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). However, due to the failure of the machines to read correctly some automated ballots in one town, the poll body later ordered their manual count for the entire Province of Sulu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>In the May 2001 elections, the counting and canvassing of votes for both national and local positions were also done manually, as no additional ACMs had been acquired for that electoral exercise allegedly because of time constraints.</p><p>On October 29, 2002, Comelec adopted in its Resolution 02—0170 a modernization program for the 2004 elections. It resolved to conduct biddings for the three (3) phases of its Automated Election System; namely, Phase I — Voter Registration and Validation System; Phase II — Automated Counting and Canvassing System; and Phase III — Electronic Transmission.</p><p>On January 24, 2003, President Gloria Macapagal—Arroyo issued Executive Order No. 172, which allocated the sum of P2.5 billion to fund the AES for the May 10, 2004 elections. Upon the request of Comelec, she authorized the release of an additional P500 million.</p><p>On January 28, 2003, the Commission issued an “Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid,” which we quote as follows:</p><p align="center">“INVITATION TO APPLY FOR ELIGIBILITY AND TO BID&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The Commission on Elections (COMELEC), pursuant to the mandate of Republic Act Nos. 8189 and 8436, invites interested offerors, vendors, suppliers or lessors to apply for eligibility and to bid for the procurement by purchase, lease, lease with option to purchase, or otherwise, supplies, equipment, materials and services needed for a comprehensive Automated Election System, consisting of three (3) phases: (a) registration/verification of voters, (b) automated counting and consolidation of votes, and (c) electronic transmission of election results, with an approved budget of TWO BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION (Php2,500,000,000) Pesos.&nbsp; </p><p>Only bids from the following entities shall be entertained:&nbsp; </p></blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Duly licensed Filipino citizens/proprietorships;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>Partnerships duly organized under the laws of the Philippines and of which at least sixty percent (60%) of the interest belongs to citizens of the Philippines;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br></li><li>Corporations duly organized under the laws of the Philippines, and of which at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding capital stock belongs to citizens of the Philippines;&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>Manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture,<em> i.e.</em>, a group of two (2) or more manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or liable for a particular contract, provided that Filipino ownership thereof shall be at least sixty percent (60%); and&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>Cooperatives duly registered with the Cooperatives Development Authority. <br></li></ol><blockquote><p>Bid documents for the three (3) phases may be obtained starting 10 February 2003, during office hours from the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat/Office of Commissioner Resurreccion Z.

For this purpose, interested offerors, vendors, suppliers or lessors have the option to participate in any or all of the three (3) phases of the comprehensive Automated Election System.&nbsp; </p><p>A Pre—Bid Conference is scheduled on 13 February 2003, at 9:00 a.m. at the Session Hall, Commission on Elections, Postigo Street, Intramuros, Manila.

Should such review uncover any misrepresentation made in the eligibility statements, or any changes in the situation of the bidder to materially downgrade the substance of such statements, the COMELEC shall disqualify the bidder upon due notice without any obligation whatsoever for any expenses or losses that may be incurred by it in the preparation of its bid.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p>On February 11, 2003, Comelec issued Resolution No. 5929 clarifying certain eligibility criteria for bidders and the schedule of activities for the project bidding, as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“1.)

Tancangco”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p></blockquote><p>On February 17, 2003, the poll body released the Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure the election automation machines. The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of Comelec convened a pre—bid conference on February 18, 2003 and gave prospective bidders until March 10, 2003 to submit their respective bids.</p><p>Among others, the RFP provided that bids from manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture may be entertained, provided that the Philippine ownership thereof shall be at least 60 percent. <em>Joint venture</em> is defined in the RFP as “a group of two or more manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or liable for a particular contract.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p>Basically, the public bidding was to be conducted under a <i>two—envelope/two stage system.</i> The bidder’s first envelope or the Eligibility Envelope should establish the bidder’s eligibility to bid and its qualifications to perform the acts if accepted. On the other hand, the second envelope would be the Bid Envelope itself. The RFP outlines the bidding procedures as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“25. <em>Determination of Eligibility of Prospective Bidders</em>&nbsp; </p><p>“25.1 The eligibility envelopes of prospective Bidders shall be opened first to determine their eligibility. In case any of the requirements specified in Clause 20 is missing from the first bid envelope, the BAC shall declare said prospective Bidder as ineligible to bid. Bid envelopes of ineligible Bidders shall be immediately returned unopened.&nbsp; </p><p>“25.2 The eligibility of prospective Bidders shall be determined using simple ‘pass/fail’ criteria and shall be determined as either eligible or ineligible. If the prospective Bidder is rated ‘passed’ for all the legal, technical and financial requirements, he shall be considered eligible. If the prospective Bidder is rated ‘failed’ in any of the requirements, he shall be considered ineligible.&nbsp; </p><p>“26. <em>Bid Examination/Evaluation</em>&nbsp; </p><p>“26.1 The BAC will examine the Bids to determine whether they are complete, whether any computational errors have been made, whether required securities have been furnished, whether the documents have been properly signed, and whether the Bids are generally in order.&nbsp; </p><p>“26.2 The BAC shall check the submitted documents of each Bidder against the required documents enumerated under Clause 20, to ascertain if they are all present in the Second bid envelope (Technical Envelope). In case one (1) or more of the required documents is missing, the BAC shall rate the Bid concerned as ‘failed’ and immediately return to the Bidder its Third bid envelope (Financial Envelope) unopened. Otherwise, the BAC shall rate the first bid envelope as ‘passed’.&nbsp; </p><p>“26.3 The BAC shall immediately open the Financial Envelopes of the Bidders whose Technical Envelopes were passed or rated on or above the passing score. Only Bids that are determined to contain all the bid requirements for both components shall be rated ‘passed’ and shall immediately be considered for evaluation and comparison.&nbsp; </p><p>“26.4 In the opening and examination of the Financial Envelope, the BAC shall announce and tabulate the Total Bid Price as calculated. Arithmetical errors will be rectified on the following basis: If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words will prevail. If there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price that is obtained by multiplying the unit price and the quantity, the unit price shall prevail and the total price shall be corrected accordingly. If there is a discrepancy between the Total Bid Price and the sum of the total prices, the sum of the total prices prevail and the Total Bid Price shall be corrected accordingly.&nbsp; </p><p>“26.5 Financial Proposals which do not clearly state the Total Bid Price shall be rejected. Also, Total Bid Price as calculated that exceeds the approved budget for the contract shall also be rejected.&nbsp; </p><p>27. <em>Comparison of Bids</em>&nbsp; </p><p>27.1 The bid price shall be deemed to embrace all costs, charges and fees associated with carrying out all the elements of the proposed Contract, including but not limited to, license fees, freight charges and taxes.&nbsp; </p><p>27.2 The BAC shall establish the calculated prices of all Bids rated ‘passed’ and rank the same in ascending order.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></blockquote><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td width="20%">x x x </td><td width="20%">&nbsp;</td><td width="20%"><div align="center">x x x </div></td><td width="20%">&nbsp;</td><td width="20%"><div align="right">x x x </div></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote>“29. <em>Postqualification</em>&nbsp; <p>“29.1 The BAC will determine to its satisfaction whether the Bidder selected as having submitted the lowest calculated bid is qualified to satisfactorily perform the Contract.&nbsp; </p><p>“29.2 The determination will take into account the Bidder’s financial, technical and production capabilities/resources. It will be based upon an examination of the documentary evidence of the Bidder’s qualification submitted by the Bidder as well as such other information as the BAC deems necessary and appropriate.&nbsp; </p><p>“29.3 A bid determined as not substantially responsive will be rejected by the BAC and may not subsequently be made responsive by the Bidder by correction of the non—conformity.&nbsp; </p><p>“29.4 The BAC may waive any informality or non—conformity or irregularity in a bid which does not constitute a material deviation, provided such waiver does not prejudice or affect the relative ranking of any Bidder.&nbsp; </p><p>“29.5 Should the BAC find that the Bidder complies with the legal, financial and technical requirements, it shall make an affirmative determination which shall be a prerequisite for award of the Contract to the Bidder. Otherwise, it will make a negative determination which will result in rejection of the Bidder’s bid, in which event the BAC will proceed to the next lowest calculated bid to make a similar determination of that Bidder’s capabilities to perform satisfactorily.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Out of the 57 bidders,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the BAC found MPC and the Total Information Management Corporation (TIMC) eligible. For technical evaluation, they were referred to the BAC’s Technical Working Group (TWG) and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).</p><p>In its Report on the Evaluation of the Technical Proposals on Phase II, DOST said that both MPC and TIMC had obtained a number of failed marks in the technical evaluation. Notwithstanding these failures, Comelec <em>en banc</em>, on April 15, 2003, promulgated Resolution No. 6074 awarding the project to MPC. The Commission publicized this Resolution and the award of the project to MPC on May 16, 2003. </p><p>On May 29, 2003, five individuals and entities (including the herein Petitioners Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines, represented by its president, Alfredo M. Torres; and Ma. Corazon Akol) wrote a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to Comelec Chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. They protested the award of the Contract to Respondent MPC “due to glaring irregularities in the manner in which the bidding process had been conducted.” Citing therein the noncompliance with eligibility as well as technical and procedural requirements (many of which have been discussed at length in the Petition), they sought a re—bidding. </p><p>In a letter—reply dated June 6, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Comelec chairman — speaking through Atty. Jaime Paz, his head executive assistant — rejected the protest and declared that the award “would stand up to the strictest scrutiny.”</p><p>Hence, the present Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p align="center"><em>The Issues</em></p><p>In their Memorandum, petitioners raise the following issues for our consideration:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“1. The COMELEC awarded and contracted with a non—eligible entity; x x x&nbsp; </p><p>“2. Private respondents failed to pass the Technical Test as required in the RFP. Notwithstanding, such failure was ignored. In effect, the COMELEC changed the rules after the bidding in effect changing the nature of the contract bidded upon.&nbsp; </p><p>“3. Petitioners have <em>locus standi</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>“4. Instant Petition is not premature. Direct resort to the Supreme Court is justified.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p></blockquote><p>In the main, the <em>substantive</em> issue is whether the Commission on Elections, the agency vested with the exclusive constitutional mandate to oversee elections, gravely abused its discretion when, in the exercise of its administrative functions, it awarded to MPC the contract for the second phase of the comprehensive Automated Election System.</p><p>Before discussing the validity of the award to MPC, however, we deem it proper to first pass upon the <em>procedural</em> issues: the legal standing of petitioners and the alleged prematurity of the Petition.</p><p align="center"><em>This Court’s Ruling</em></p><p>The Petition is meritorious.</p><p align="center"><em>First Procedural Issue:<br></em><em>Locus Standi of Petitioners</em></p><p>Respondents chorus that petitioners do not possess locus <em>standi</em>, inasmuch as they are not challenging the validity or constitutionality of RA 8436. Moreover, petitioners supposedly admitted during the Oral Argument that no law had been violated by the award of the Contract. Furthermore, they allegedly have no actual and material interest in the Contract and, hence, do not stand to be injured or prejudiced on account of the award.</p><p>On the other hand, petitioners — suing in their capacities as taxpayers, registered voters and concerned citizens — respond that the issues central to this case are “of transcendental importance and of national interest.” Allegedly, Comelec’s flawed bidding and questionable award of the Contract to an unqualified entity would impact directly on the success or the failure of the electoral process. Thus, any taint on the sanctity of the ballot as the expression of the will of the people would inevitably affect their faith in the democratic system of government. Petitioners further argue that the award of any contract for automation involves disbursement of public funds in gargantuan amounts; therefore, public interest requires that the laws governing the transaction must be followed strictly. </p><p>We agree with petitioners. Our nation’s political and economic future virtually hangs in the balance, pending the outcome of the 2004 elections. Hence, there can be no serious doubt that the subject matter of this case is “a matter of public concern and imbued with public interest”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> in other words, it is of “paramount public interest”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and “transcendental importance.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This fact alone would justify relaxing the rule on legal standing, following the liberal policy of this Court whenever a case involves “an issue of overarching significance to our society.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Petitioners’ legal standing should therefore be recognized and upheld.</p><p>Moreover, this Court has held that taxpayers are allowed to sue when there is a claim of “illegal disbursement of public funds,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or if public money is being “deflected to any improper purpose”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> or when petitioners seek to restrain respondent from “wasting public funds through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the instant case, individual petitioners, suing as taxpayers, assert a material interest in seeing to it that public funds are properly and lawfully used. In the Petition, they claim that the bidding was defective, the winning bidder not a qualified entity, and the award of the Contract contrary to law and regulation. Accordingly, they seek to restrain respondents from implementing the Contract and, <em>necessarily, from making any unwarranted expenditure of public funds pursuant thereto</em>. Thus, we hold that petitioners possess<i> locus standi</i>.</p><p align="center"><em>Second Procedural Issue:<br></em><em>Alleged Prematurity Due to Non—Exhaustion<br></em><em>of Administrative Remedies</em></p><p>Respondents claim that petitioners acted prematurely, since they had not first utilized the protest mechanism available to them under RA 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act, for the settlement of disputes pertaining to procurement contracts.</p><p>Section 55 of RA 9184 states that protests against decisions of the Bidding and Awards Committee in all stages of procurement may be lodged with the head of the procuring entity by filing a verified position paper and paying a protest fee. Section 57 of the same law mandates that in no case shall any such protest stay or delay the bidding process, but it must first be resolved before any award is made.</p><p>On the other hand, Section 58 provides that court action may be resorted to only after the protests contemplated by the statute shall have been completed. Cases filed in violation of this process are to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Regional trial courts shall have jurisdiction over final decisions of the head of the procuring entity, and court actions shall be instituted pursuant to Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.</p><p>Respondents assert that throughout the bidding process, petitioners never questioned the BAC Report finding MPC eligible to bid and recommending the award of the Contract to it (MPC). According to respondents, the Report should have been appealed to the Comelec <em>en banc</em>, pursuant to the aforementioned sections of RA 9184. In the absence of such appeal, the determination and recommendation of the BAC had become final.</p><p>The Court is not persuaded.</p><p>Respondent Comelec came out with its en banc Resolution No. 6074 dated April 15, 2003, awarding the project to Respondent MPC even before the BAC managed to issue its written report and recommendation on April 21, 2003. Thus, how could petitioners have appealed the BAC’s recommendation or report to the head of the procuring entity (the chairman of Comelec), when the Comelec <em>en banc</em> had already approved the award of the contract to MPC even before petitioners learned of the BAC recommendation? </p><p>It is claimed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> by Comelec that during its April 15, 2003 session, it received and approved the <em>verbal</em> report and recommendation of the BAC for the award of the Contract to MPC, and that the BAC subsequently re—affirmed its verbal report and recommendation by submitting it in writing on April 21, 2003. Respondents insist that the law does not require that the BAC Report be in writing before Comelec can act thereon; therefore, there is allegedly nothing irregular about the Report as well as the <em>en banc</em> Resolution.</p><p>However, it is obvious that petitioners could have appealed the BAC’s report and recommendation to the head of the procuring entity (the Comelec chair) only upon their <i>discovery</i> thereof, which at the very earliest would have been on April 21, 2003, when the BAC actually put its report in writing and finally released it. Even then, what would have been the use of protesting/appealing the report to the Comelec chair, when by that time the Commission en banc (<em>including the chairman himself</em>) had already approved the BAC Report and awarded the Contract to MPC? </p><p>And even assuming <em>arguendo</em> that petitioners had somehow gotten wind of the verbal BAC report on April 15, 2003 (immediately after the <em>en banc</em> session), at that point the Commission <i>en banc</i> had already given its approval to the BAC Report along with the award to MPC. <em>To put it bluntly, the Comelec en banc itself made it legally impossible for petitioners to avail themselves of the administrative remedy that the Commission is so impiously harping on</em>. There is no doubt that they had not been accorded the opportunity to avail themselves of the process provided under Section 55 of RA 9184, according to which a protest against a decision of the BAC may be filed <em>with the head of the procuring entity</em>. Nemo tenetur ad impossible,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> to borrow private respondents’ favorite Latin excuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p><em>Some Observations on the<br>BAC Report to the Comelec</em></p><p>We shall return to this issue of alleged prematurity shortly, but at this interstice, we would just want to put forward a few observations regarding the BAC Report and the Comelec <i>en banc’s </i>approval thereof.</p><p><em>First</em>, Comelec contends that there was nothing unusual about the fact that the Report submitted by the BAC came only after the former had already awarded the Contract, because the latter had been asked to render its report and recommendation orally during the Commission’s <em>en banc</em> session on April 15, 2003. Accordingly, Comelec supposedly acted upon such oral recommendation and approved the award to MPC on the same day, following which the recommendation was subsequently reduced into writing on April 21, 2003. While not entirely outside the realm of the possible, this interesting and unique spiel does not speak well of the process that Comelec supposedly went through in making a critical decision with respect to a multi—billion—peso contract.</p><p>We can imagine that anyone else standing in the shoes of the Honorable Commissioners would have been extremely conscious of the overarching need for utter transparency. They would have scrupulously avoided the slightest hint of impropriety, preferring to maintain an exacting regularity in the performance of their duties, instead of trying to break a speed record in the award of multi—billion—peso contracts. After all, between April 15 and April 21 were a mere six (6) days. Could Comelec not have waited out six more days for the written report of the BAC, instead of rushing pell—mell into the arms of MPC? Certainly, respondents never cared to explain the nature of the Commission’s dire need to act immediately without awaiting the formal, written BAC Report.</p><p>In short, the Court finds it difficult to reconcile the uncommon dispatch with which Comelec acted to approve the multi—billion—peso deal, with its claim of having been impelled by only the purest and most noble of motives. </p><p>At any rate, as will be discussed later on, several other factors combine to lend <em>negative</em> credence to Comelec’s tale.</p><p><em>Second</em>, without necessarily ascribing any premature malice or premeditation on the part of the Comelec officials involved, it should nevertheless be conceded that this cart—before—the—horse maneuver (awarding of the Contract ahead of the BAC’s written report) would definitely serve as a clever and effective way of averting and frustrating any impending protest under Section 55.</p><p>Having made the foregoing observations, we now go back to the question of exhausting administrative remedies. Respondents may not have realized it, but the letter addressed to Chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. dated May 29, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> serves to eliminate the prematurity issue as it was an actual written protest against the decision of the poll body to award the Contract.

Matters pertaining to the identity, existence and eligibility of MPC as a bidder&nbsp; </p><p>B. Failure of the automated counting machines (ACMs) to pass the DOST technical tests&nbsp; </p><p>C.

(MPEI), which was incorporated only on February 27, 2003, or 11 days prior to the bidding itself. Rather, the bidder was Mega Pacific Consortium (MPC), of which MPEI was but a part. As proof thereof, they point to the March 7, 2003 letter of intent to bid, signed by the president of MPEI allegedly for and on behalf of MPC. They also call attention to the official receipt issued to MPC, acknowledging payment for the bidding documents, as proof that it was the “consortium” that participated in the bidding process.</p><p>We do not agree. The March 7, 2003 letter, signed by only one signatory — “Willy U. Yu, President, Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc., (Lead Company/ Proponent) For: Mega Pacific Consortium” — and without any further proof, does not by itself prove the existence of the consortium. It does not show that MPEI or its president have been duly pre—authorized by the other members of the putative consortium to represent them, to bid on their collective behalf and, more important, to commit them jointly and severally to the bid undertakings. The letter is purely self—serving and uncorroborated.</p><p>Neither does an official receipt issued to MPC, acknowledging payment for the bidding documents, constitute proof that it was the purported consortium that participated in the bidding. Such receipts are issued by cashiers without any legally sufficient inquiry as to the real identity or existence of the supposed payor.</p><p>To assure itself properly of the due existence (as well as eligibility and qualification) of the putative consortium, Comelec’s BAC should have examined the bidding documents submitted on behalf of MPC. They would have easily discovered the following fatal flaws.</p><p><em>Two—Envelope,<br></em><em>Two—Stage System</em></p><p>As stated earlier in our factual presentation, the public bidding system designed by Comelec under its RFP (Request for Proposal for the Automation of the 2004 Election) mandated the use of a two—envelope, two—stage system. A bidder’s<em> first envelope</em> (Eligibility Envelope) was meant to establish its eligibility to bid and its qualifications and capacity to perform the contract if its bid was accepted, while the <em>second envelope</em> would be the Bid Envelope itself.</p><p>The Eligibility Envelope was to contain <em>legal documents</em> such as articles of incorporation, business registrations, licenses and permits, mayor’s permit, VAT certification, and so forth; <em>technical documents</em> containing documentary evidence to establish the track record of the bidder and its technical and production capabilities to perform the contract; and <em>financial documents</em>, including audited financial statements for the last three years, to establish the bidder’s financial capacity.</p><p>In the case of a consortium or joint venture desirous of participating in the bidding, it goes without saying that the Eligibility Envelope would necessarily have to include a copy of the joint venture agreement, the consortium agreement or memorandum of agreement — or a business plan or some other instrument of similar import — establishing the due existence, composition and scope of such aggrupation. <em>Otherwise, how would Comelec know who it was dealing with, and whether these parties are qualified and capable of delivering the products and services being offered for bidding?</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p>In the instant case, no such instrument was submitted to Comelec during the bidding process. This fact can be conclusively ascertained by scrutinizing the two—inch thick “Eligibility Requirements” file submitted by Comelec last October 9, 2003, in partial compliance with this Court’s instructions given during the Oral Argument. This file purports to replicate the eligibility documents originally submitted to Comelec by MPEI allegedly on behalf of MPC, in connection with the bidding conducted in March 2003. Included in the file are the incorporation papers and financial statements of the members of the supposed consortium and certain certificates, licenses and permits issued to them.</p><p>However, there is no sign whatsoever of any joint venture agreement, consortium agreement, memorandum of agreement, or business plan executed among the members of the purported consortium.</p><p>The only logical conclusion is that no such agreement was ever submitted to the Comelec for its consideration, <em>as part of the bidding process</em>.</p><p>It thus follows that, prior the award of the Contract, there was no documentary or other basis for Comelec to conclude that a consortium had actually been formed amongst MPEI, SK C&amp;C and WeSolv, along with Election.com and ePLDT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Neither was there anything to indicate the exact relationships between and among these firms; their diverse roles, undertakings and prestations, if any, relative to the prosecution of the project, the extent of their respective investments (if any) in the supposed consortium or in the project; and the precise nature and extent of their respective liabilities with respect to the contract being offered for bidding. And apart from the self—serving letter of March 7, 2003, there was not even any indication that MPEI was the lead company duly authorized to act on behalf of the others.</p><p>So, it necessarily follows that, during the bidding process, Comelec had no basis at all for determining that the alleged consortium really existed and was eligible and qualified; and that the arrangements among the members were satisfactory and sufficient to ensure delivery on the Contract and to protect the government’s interest.</p><p>Notwithstanding such deficiencies, Comelec still deemed the “consortium” eligible to participate in the bidding, proceeded to open its Second Envelope, and eventually awarded the bid to it, even though — per the Comelec’s own RFP — the BAC should have declared the MPC ineligible to bid and returned the Second (Bid) Envelope unopened. </p><p>Inasmuch as Comelec should not have considered MPEI <em>et al.</em> as comprising a consortium or joint venture, it should not have allowed them to avail themselves of the provision in Section 5.4 (b) (i) of the IRR for RA 6957 (the Build—Operate—Transfer Law), as amended by RA 7718. This provision states in part that a joint venture/consortium proponent shall be evaluated based on the individual or <em>collective experience of the member—firms</em> of the joint venture or consortium and of the contractor(s) that it has engaged for the project. Parenthetically, respondents have uniformly argued that the said IRR of RA 6957, as amended, have suppletory application to the instant case.</p><p>Hence, had the proponent MPEI been evaluated based solely on its own experience, financial and operational track record or lack thereof, it would surely not have qualified and would have been immediately considered ineligible to bid, as respondents readily admit.</p><p>At any rate, it is clear that <em>Comelec gravely abused its discretion </em>in arbitrarily failing to observe its own rules, policies and guidelines with respect to the bidding process, thereby negating a fair, honest and competitive bidding.</p><p><em>Commissioners Not<br>Aware of Consortium</em></p><p>In this regard, the Court is beguiled by the statements of Commissioner Florentino Tuason Jr., given in open court during the Oral Argument last October 7, 2003. The good commissioner affirmed that he was aware, <em>of his own personal knowledge</em>, that there had indeed been a written agreement among the “consortium” members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> although it was an internal matter among them,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and of the fact that it would be presented by counsel for private respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p>However, under questioning by Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide Jr. and Justice Jose C. Vitug, Commissioner Tuason in effect admitted that, while he was the commissioner—in—charge of Comelec’s Legal Department, <em>he had never seen, even up to that late date, the agreement he spoke of.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Under further questioning, he was likewise unable to provide any information regarding the amounts invested into the project by several members of the claimed consortium.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> A short while later, he admitted that <em>the Commission had not taken a look at the agreement</em> (if any).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p>He tried to justify his position by claiming that he was not a member of the BAC. Neither was he the commissioner—in—charge of the Phase II Modernization project (the automated election system); but that, in any case, the BAC and the Phase II Modernization Project Team did look into the aspect of the composition of the consortium.</p><p>It seems to the Court, though, that even if the BAC or the Phase II Team had taken charge of evaluating the eligibility, qualifications and credentials of the consortium—bidder, still, in all probability, the former would have referred the task to Commissioner Tuason, head of Comelec’s Legal Department. That task was the appreciation and evaluation of the legal effects and consequences of the terms, conditions, stipulations and covenants contained in any joint venture agreement, consortium agreement or a similar document — assuming of course that any of these was available at the time. The fact that Commissioner Tuason was barely aware of the situation bespeaks the complete absence of such document, or the utter failure or neglect of the Comelec to examine it — assuming it was available at all — at the time the award was made on April 15, 2003.</p><p>In any event, the Court notes for the record that Commissioner Tuason basically contradicted his statements in open court about there being one written agreement among all the consortium members, when he subsequently referred<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> to the four (4) Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) executed by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p>At this juncture, one might ask: What, then, if there are four MOAs instead of one or none at all? Isn’t it enough that there are these corporations coming together to carry out the automation project? Isn’t it true, as respondent aver, that nowhere in the RFP issued by Comelec is it required that the members of the joint venture execute a single written agreement to prove the existence of a joint venture. Indeed, the intention to be jointly and severally liable may be evidenced not only by a single joint venture agreement, but also by supplementary documents executed by the parties signifying such intention. What then is the big deal?</p><p>The problem is not that there are four agreements instead of only one. The problem is that <em>Comelec never bothered to check</em>. It never based its decision on documents or other proof that would concretely establish the existence of the claimed consortium or joint venture or agglomeration. It relied merely on the self—serving representation in an uncorroborated letter signed by only one individual, claiming that his company represented a “consortium” of several different corporations. It concluded forthwith that a consortium indeed existed, composed of such and such members, and thereafter declared that the entity was eligible to bid.</p><p>True, copies of financial statements and incorporation papers of the alleged “consortium” members were submitted. But these papers did not establish the existence of a consortium, as they could have been provided by the companies concerned for purposes other than to prove that they were part of a consortium or joint venture. For instance, the papers may have been intended to show that those companies were each qualified to be a sub—contractor (and nothing more) in a major project. Those documents did not by themselves support the assumption that a consortium or joint venture existed among the companies.</p><p>In brief, despite the<em> absence </em>of competent proof as to the existence and eligibility of the alleged consortium (MPC), its capacity to deliver on the Contract, and the members’ joint and several liability therefor, Comelec nevertheless <em>assumed</em> that such consortium existed and was eligible. It then went ahead and considered the bid of MPC, to which the Contract was eventually awarded, in gross violation of the former’s own bidding rules and procedures contained in its RFP. Therein lies Comelec’s grave abuse of discretion.</p><p><em>Sufficiency of the<br>Four Agreements</em></p><p>Instead of one multilateral agreement executed by, and effective and binding on, all the five “consortium members” — as earlier claimed by Commissioner Tuason in open court — it turns out that what was actually executed were four (4) <em>separate and distinct bilateral Agreements</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Obviously, Comelec was furnished copies of these Agreements only <em>after</em> the bidding process had been terminated, as these were not included in the Eligibility Documents. These Agreements are as follows:&nbsp; </p><ul><li>A Memorandum of Agreement between MPEI and SK C&amp;C&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>A Memorandum of Agreement between MPEI and WeSolv&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>A “Teaming Agreement” between MPEI and Election.com Ltd.&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>A “Teaming Agreement” between MPEI and ePLDT.</li></ul><p>In sum, each of the four different and separate bilateral Agreements is valid and binding only between MPEI and the other contracting party, leaving the other “consortium” members total strangers thereto. Under this setup, MPEI dealt <em>separately</em> with each of the “members,” and the latter (WeSolv, SK C&amp;C, Election.com, and ePLDT) in turn had nothing to do with one another, each dealing only with MPEI.</p><p>Respondents assert that these four Agreements were sufficient for the purpose of enabling the corporations to still qualify (even at that late stage) as a consortium or joint venture, since the first two Agreements had allegedly <em>set forth the joint and several undertakings among the parties, whereas the latter two clarified the parties’ respective roles with regard to the Project, with MPEI being the independent contractor and Election.com and ePLDT the subcontractors</em>.</p><p>Additionally, the use of the phrase “particular contract” in the Comelec’s Request for Proposal (RFP), in connection with the joint and several liabilities of companies in a joint venture, is taken by them to mean that all the members of the joint venture need not be solidarily liable for the entire project or joint venture, because it is sufficient that the lead company and the member in charge of a particular contract or aspect of the joint venture agree to be solidarily liable.</p><p>At this point, it must be stressed most vigorously that the submission of the four bilateral Agreements to Comelec <em>after the end of the bidding process</em> did nothing to eliminate the grave abuse of discretion it had <em>already </em>committed on April 15, 2003.</p><p><em>Deficiencies Have<br>Not Been “Cured”</em></p><p>In any event, it is also claimed that the automation Contract awarded by Comelec incorporates all documents executed by the “consortium” members, even if these documents are not referred to therein. The basis of this assertion appears to be the passages from Section 1.4 of the Contract, which is reproduced as follows:</p><p>“All Contract Documents shall form part of the Contract even if they or any one of them is not referred to or mentioned in the Contract as forming a part thereof. Each of the Contract Documents shall be mutually complementary and explanatory of each other such that what is noted in one although not shown in the other shall be considered contained in all, and what is required by any one shall be as binding as if required by all, unless one item is a correction of the other.</p><p>“The intent of the Contract Documents is the proper, satisfactory and timely execution and completion of the Project, in accordance with the Contract Documents. Consequently, all items necessary for the proper and timely execution and completion of the Project shall be deemed included in the Contract.”</p><p>Thus, it is argued that whatever perceived deficiencies there were in the supplementary contracts — those entered into by MPEI and the other members of the “consortium” as regards their joint and several undertakings — have been cured. Better still, such deficiencies have supposedly been prevented from arising as a result of the above—quoted provisions, from which it can be immediately established that each of the members of MPC assumes the same joint and several liability as the other members.</p><p>The foregoing argument is unpersuasive. <em>First</em>, the contract being referred to, entitled “The Automated Counting and Canvassing Project Contract,” is between Comelec and MPEI, not the alleged consortium, MPC. To repeat, it is MPEI — not MPC — that is a party to the Contract. <em>Nowhere in that Contract is there any mention of a consortium or joint venture, of members thereof, much less of joint and several liability</em>. Supposedly executed sometime in May 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Contract bears a notarization date of June 30, 2003, and contains the signature of Willy U. Yu signing as president of MPEI (not for and on behalf of MPC), along with that of the Comelec chair. It provides in Section 3.2 that MPEI (not MPC) is to supply the Equipment and perform the Services under the Contract, in accordance with the appendices thereof; nothing whatsoever is said about any consortium or joint venture or partnership.</p><p><em>Second</em>, the portions of Section 1.4 of the Contract reproduced above do <em>not</em> have the effect of curing (much less preventing) deficiencies in the bilateral agreements entered into by MPEI with the other members of the “consortium,” with respect to their joint and several liabilities. The term “Contract Documents,” as used in the quoted passages of Section 1.4, has a well—defined meaning and actually refers only to the following documents:&nbsp; </p><ul><li>The Contract itself along with its appendices&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>The Request for Proposal (also known as “Terms of Reference”) issued by the Comelec, including the Tender Inquiries and Bid Bulletins&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br></li><li>The Tender Proposal submitted by MPEI</li></ul><p>In other words, the term “Contract Documents” cannot be understood as referring to or including the MOAs and the Teaming Agreements entered into by MPEI with SK C&amp;C, WeSolv, Election.com and ePLDT. This much is very clear and admits of no debate. The attempt to use the provisions of Section 1.4 to shore up the MOAs and the Teaming Agreements is simply unwarranted.</p><p><em>Third</em> and last, we fail to see how respondents can arrive at the conclusion that, from the above—quoted provisions, it can be immediately established that each of the members of MPC assumes the same joint and several liability as the other members. Earlier, respondents claimed exactly the opposite — that the two MOAs (between MPEI and SK C&amp;C, and between MPEI and WeSolv) had <em>set forth the joint and several undertakings among the parties; whereas the two Teaming Agreements clarified the parties’ respective roles with regard to the Project, with MPEI being the independent contractor and Election.com and ePLDT the subcontractors.</em></p><p>Obviously, given the differences in their relationships, their respective liabilities cannot be the same. Precisely, the very clear terms and stipulations contained in the MOAs and the Teaming Agreements — entered into by MPEI with SK C&amp;C, WeSolv, Election.com and ePLDT — negate the idea that these “members” are on a par with one another and are, as such, assuming the same joint and several liability. </p><p>Moreover, respondents have earlier seized upon the use of the term “particular contract” in the Comelec’s Request for Proposal (RFP), in order to argue that all the members of the joint venture did not <em>need to be solidarily liable for the entire project</em> or joint venture. It was sufficient that the lead company and the member in charge of a particular contract or aspect of the joint venture would agree to be solidarily liable. The glaring lack of consistency leaves us at a loss. Are respondents trying to establish the same joint and solidary liability among all the “members” or not? </p><p><em>Enforcement of<br></em><em>Liabilities Problematic</em></p><p>Next, it is also maintained that the automation Contract between Comelec and the MPEI <em>confirms the solidary undertaking of the lead company and the consortium member concerned</em> for each particular Contract, inasmuch as the position of MPEI and anyone else performing the services contemplated under the Contract is described therein as <em>that of an independent contractor</em>.</p><p>The Court does not see, however, how this conclusion was arrived at. In the first place, the contractual provision being relied upon by respondents is Article 14, “Independent Contractors,” which states: “<em>Nothing contained herein shall be construed as establishing or creating between the COMELEC and MEGA the relationship of employee and employer or principal and agent, it being understood that the position of MEGA and of anyone performing the Services contemplated under this Contract, is that of an independent contractor</em>.”</p><p>Obviously, the intent behind the provision was simply to avoid the creation of an employer—employee or a principal—agent relationship and the complications that it would produce. Hence, the Article states that the role or position of MPEI, or anyone else performing on its behalf, is that of an independent contractor. It is obvious to the Court that respondents are <em>stretching matters too far</em> when they claim that, because of this provision, the Contract in effect confirms the <em>solidary undertaking</em> of the lead company and the consortium member concerned for the particular phase of the project. This assertion is an absolute <em>non sequitur</em>.</p><p><em>Enforcement of Liabilities<br>Under the Civil Code Not Possible</em></p><p>In any event, it is claimed that Comelec may still enforce the liability of the “consortium” members under the Civil Code provisions on partnership, reasoning that MPEI <em>et al. represented themselves as partners and members of MPC for purposes of bidding for the Project. They are, therefore, liable to the Comelec to the extent that the latter relied upon such representation. Their liability as partners is solidary with respect to everything chargeable to the partnership under certain conditions. </em></p><p>The Court has two points to make with respect to this argument. <i>First</i>, it must be recalled that SK C&amp;C, WeSolv, Election.com and ePLDT never represented themselves as partners and members of MPC, whether for purposes of bidding or for something else. It was MPEI <em>alone</em> that represented them to be members of a “consortium” it supposedly headed. Thus, its acts may not necessarily be held against the other “members.” </p><p><em>Second</em>, this argument of the OSG in its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> might possibly apply<em> in the absence of a joint venture agreement or some other writing</em> that discloses the relationship of the “members” with one another. But precisely, this case does not deal with a situation in which there is nothing in writing to serve as reference, leaving Comelec to rely on mere representations and therefore justifying a falling back on the rules on partnership. For, again, the terms and stipulations of the MOAs entered into by MPEI with SK C&amp;C and WeSolv, as well as the Teaming Agreements of MPEI with Election.com and ePLDT (copies of which have been furnished the Comelec) are very clear with respect to the extent and the limitations of the firms’ respective liabilities.</p><p>In the case of WeSolv and SK C&amp;C, their MOAs state that their liabilities, while joint and several with MPEI, are<em> limited only to the particular areas of work wherein their services are engaged or their products utilized</em>. As for Election.com and ePLDT, their separate “Teaming Agreements” specifically ascribe to them the role of subcontractor <i>vis—à—vis</i> MPEI as contractor and, based on the terms of their particular agreements, <em>neither Election.com nor ePLDT is, with MPEI, jointly and severally liable to Comelec</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It follows then that in the instant case, there is no justification for anyone, much less Comelec, to resort to the rules on partnership and partners’ liabilities.</p><p><em>Eligibility of a Consortium<br></em><em>Based on the Collective<br></em><em>Qualifications of Its Members</em></p><p>Respondents declare that, for purposes of assessing the eligibility of the bidder, the members of MPC should be evaluated on a collective basis. Therefore, they contend, the failure of MPEI to submit financial statements (on account of its recent incorporation) should not by itself disqualify MPC, since the other members of the “consortium” could meet the criteria set out in the RFP.</p><p>Thus, according to respondents, the collective nature of the undertaking of the members of MPC, their contribution of assets and sharing of risks, and the community of their interest in the performance of the Contract lead to these reasonable conclusions: (1) that their <em>collective qualifications</em> should be the basis for evaluating their eligibility; (2) that the sheer enormity of the project renders it improbable to expect any single entity to be able to comply with all the eligibility requirements and undertake the project by itself; and (3) that, as argued by the OSG, the RFP allows bids from manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors that have formed themselves into a joint venture, in recognition of the virtual impossibility of a single entity’s ability to respond to the Invitation to Bid. </p><p>Additionally, argues the Comelec, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 6957 (the Build—Operate—Transfer Law) as amended by RA 7718 would be applicable, as proponents of BOT projects usually form joint ventures or consortiums. Under the IRR, a joint venture/consortium proponent shall be evaluated based on the individual or the collective experience of the member—firms of the joint venture/consortium and of the contractors the proponent has engaged for the project.</p><p>Unfortunately, this argument seems to assume that the “collective” nature of the undertaking of the members of MPC, their contribution of assets and sharing of risks, and the “community” of their interest in the performance of the Contract entitle MPC to be treated as a joint venture or consortium; and to be evaluated accordingly on the basis of the members’ collective qualifications when, in fact, the evidence before the Court suggest otherwise.</p><p>This Court in<em> Kilosbayan v. Guingona</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> defined <em>joint venture</em> as “an association of persons or companies jointly undertaking some commercial enterprise; generally, all contribute assets and share risks. It requires a community of interest in the performance of the subject matter, a right to direct and govern the policy in connection therewith, and [a] duty, which may be altered by agreement to share both in profit and losses.”</p><p>Going back to the instant case, it should be recalled that the automation Contract with Comelec was not executed by the “consortium” MPC — or by MPEI for and on behalf of MPC — but by MPEI, <em>period</em>. The said Contract contains <em>no mention whatsoever </em>of any consortium or members thereof. This fact alone seems to contradict all the suppositions about a joint undertaking that would normally apply to a joint venture or consortium: that it is a commercial enterprise involving a community of interest, a sharing of risks, profits and losses, and so on.</p><p>Now let us consider the four bilateral Agreements, starting with the Memorandum of Agreement between MPEI and WeSolv Open Computing, Inc., dated March 5, 2003. The body of the MOA consists of just seven (7) short paragraphs that would easily fit in one page. It reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“1. The parties agree to cooperate in successfully implementing the Project in the substance and form as may be most beneficial to both parties and other subcontractors involved in the Project.&nbsp; </p><p>“2. Mega Pacific shall be responsible for any contract negotiations and signing with the COMELEC and, subject to the latter’s approval, agrees to give WeSolv an opportunity to be present at meetings with the COMELEC concerning WeSolv’s portion of the Project.&nbsp; </p><p>“3. <em>WeSolv shall be jointly and severally liable with Mega Pacific only for the particular products and/or services supplied by the former for the Project.</em>&nbsp; </p><p>“4. <em>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses relative to this agreement unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties.</em>&nbsp; </p><p>“5. The parties undertake to do all acts and such other things incidental to, necessary or desirable or the attainment of the objectives and purposes of this Agreement.</p>“6. In the event that the parties fail to agree on the terms and conditions of the supply of the products and services including but not limited to the scope of the products and services to be supplied and payment terms, WeSolv shall cease to be bound by its obligations stated in the aforementioned paragraphs.&nbsp; <p>“7. Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be settled amicably by the parties whenever possible. Should the parties be unable to do so, the parties hereby agree to settle their dispute through arbitration in accordance with the existing laws of the Republic of the Philippines.” (Underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Even shorter is the Memorandum of Agreement between MPEI and SK C&amp;C Co. Ltd., dated March 9, 2003, the body of which consists of only six (6) paragraphs, which we quote:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“1. All parties agree to cooperate in achieving the Consortium’s objective of successfully implementing the Project in the substance and form as may be most beneficial to the Consortium members and in accordance w/ the demand of the RFP.&nbsp; </p><p>“2. Mega Pacific shall have full powers and authority to represent the Consortium with the Comelec, and to enter and sign, for and in behalf of its members any and all agreement/s which maybe required in the implementation of the Project.&nbsp; </p><p>“3. <em>Each of the individual members of the Consortium shall be jointly and severally liable with the Lead Firm for the particular products and/or services supplied by such individual member for the project, in accordance with their respective undertaking or sphere of responsibility.</em>&nbsp; </p><p>“4. <i>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses relative to this agreement unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties.&nbsp; </i></p><p>“5. The parties undertake to do all acts and such other things incidental to, necessary or desirable for the attainment of the objectives and purposes of this Agreement.&nbsp; </p><p>“6. Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be settled amicably by the parties whenever possible. Should the parties be unable to do so, the parties hereby agree to settle their dispute through arbitration in accordance with the existing laws of the Republic of the Philippines.” (Underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>It will be noted that the two Agreements quoted above are very similar in wording. Neither of them contains any specifics or details as to the exact nature and scope of the parties’ respective undertakings, performances and deliverables under the Agreement with respect to the automation project. Likewise, the two Agreements are quite bereft of pesos—and—centavos data as to the amount of investments each party contributes, its respective share in the revenues and/or profit from the Contract with Comelec, and so forth — all of which are normal for agreements of this nature. Yet, according to public and private respondents, the participation of MPEI, WeSolv and SK C&amp;C comprises fully 90 percent of the entire undertaking with respect to the election automation project, which is worth about P1.3 billion. </p><p>As for Election.com and ePLDT, the separate “Teaming Agreements” they entered into with MPEI for the remaining 10 percent of the entire project undertaking are ironically much longer and more detailed than the MOAs discussed earlier. Although specifically ascribing to them the role of <em>subcontractor vis—à—vis</em> MPEI as contractor, these Agreements are, however, completely devoid of any pricing data or payment terms. Even the appended Schedules supposedly containing prices of goods and services are shorn of any price data. Again, as mentioned earlier, based on the terms of their particular Agreements, neither Election.com nor ePLDT — with MPEI — is jointly and severally liable to Comelec.</p><p>It is difficult to imagine how these bare Agreements — especially the first two — could be implemented in practice; and how a dispute between the parties or a claim by Comelec against them, for instance, could be resolved without lengthy and debilitating litigations. Absent any clear—cut statement as to the exact nature and scope of the parties’ respective undertakings, commitments, deliverables and covenants, one party or another can easily dodge its obligation and deny or contest its liability under the Agreement; or claim that it is the other party that should have delivered but failed to.</p><p>Likewise, in the absence of definite indicators as to the amount of investments to be contributed by each party, disbursements for expenses, the parties’ respective shares in the profits and the like, it seems to the Court that this situation could readily give rise to all kinds of misunderstandings and disagreements over money matters.</p><p>Under such a scenario, it will be extremely difficult for Comelec to enforce the supposed joint and several liabilities of the members of the “consortium.” The Court is not even mentioning the possibility of a situation arising from a failure of WeSolv and MPEI to agree on the scope, the terms and the conditions for the supply of the products and services under the Agreement. In that situation, by virtue of paragraph 6 of its MOA, WeSolv would perforce cease to be bound by its obligations — including its joint and solidary liability with MPEI under the MOA — and could forthwith disengage from the project. Effectively, WeSolv could at any time unilaterally exit from its MOA with MPEI by simply failing to agree. Where would that outcome leave MPEI and Comelec?</p><p>To the Court, this strange and beguiling arrangement of MPEI with the other companies does not qualify them to be treated as a consortium or joint venture, at least of the type that government agencies like the Comelec should be dealing with. With more reason is it unable to agree to the proposal to evaluate the members of MPC on a collective basis.</p><p>In any event, the MPC members claim to be a joint venture/consortium; and respondents have consistently been arguing that the IRR for RA 6957, as amended, should be applied to the instant case in order to allow a collective evaluation of consortium members. Surprisingly, considering these facts, respondents have not deemed it necessary for MPC members to comply with Section 5.4 (a) (iii) of the IRR for RA 6957 as amended.</p><p>According to the aforementioned provision, if the project proponent is a joint venture or consortium, <em>the members or participants thereof are required to submit a sworn statement that, if awarded the contract, they shall bind themselves to be jointly, severally and solidarily liable for the project proponent’s obligations thereunder. This provision was supposed to mirror Section 5 of RA 6957, as amended, which states: “In all cases, a consortium that participates in a bid must present proof that the members of the consortium have bound themselves jointly and severally to assume responsibility for any project. The withdrawal of any member of the consortium prior to the implementation of the project could be a ground for the cancellation of the contract</em>.” </p><p>The Court has certainly not seen any joint and several undertaking by the MPC members that even approximates the tenor of that which is described above. We fail to see why respondents should invoke the IRR if it is for their benefit, but refuse to comply with it otherwise.</p><p align="center"><em>B.</em></p><p align="center"><em>DOST Technical Tests Flunked by the<br></em><em>Automated Counting Machines</em></p><p>Let us now move to the second subtopic, which deals with the substantive issue: the ACM’s failure to pass the tests of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).</p><p>After respondent “consortium” and the other bidder, TIM, had submitted their respective bids on March 10, 2003, the Comelec’s BAC — through its Technical Working Group (TWG) and the DOST — evaluated their technical proposals. Requirements that were highly technical in nature and that required the use of certain equipment in the evaluation process were referred to the DOST for testing.

and the DOST had conducted their separate tests and submitted their respective reports that the BAC, on the basis of these reports formulated its comments/recommendations on the bids of the consortium and TIM.</p><p>The BAC, in its Report dated April 21, 2003, recommended that the Phase II project involving the acquisition of automated counting machines be awarded to MPEI. It said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“After incisive analysis of the technical reports of the DOST and the Technical Working Group for Phase II — Automated Counting Machine, the BAC considers adaptability to advances in modern technology to ensure an effective and efficient method, as well as the security and integrity of the system.&nbsp; </p><p>“The results of the evaluation conducted by the TWG and that of the DOST (14 April 2003 report), would show the apparent advantage of Mega—Pacific over the other competitor, TIM.&nbsp; </p><p>“The BAC further noted that both Mega—Pacific and TIM obtained some ‘failed marks’ in the technical evaluation. In general, the ‘failed marks’ of Total Information Management as enumerated above affect the counting machine itself which are material in nature, constituting non—compliance to the RFP. On the other hand, the ‘failed marks’ of Mega—Pacific are mere formalities on certain documentary requirements which the BAC may waive as clearly indicated in the Invitation to Bid.&nbsp; </p><p>“In the DOST test, TIM obtained 12 failed marks and mostly attributed to the counting machine itself as stated earlier. These are requirements of the RFP and therefore the BAC cannot disregard the same.&nbsp; </p><p>“Mega—Pacific failed in 8 items however these are mostly on the software which can be corrected by reprogramming the software and therefore can be readily corrected.&nbsp; </p><p>“The BAC verbally inquired from DOST on the status of the retest of the counting machines of the TIM and was informed that the report will be forthcoming after the holy week. The BAC was informed that the retest is on a different parameters they’re being two different machines being tested. One purposely to test if previously read ballots will be read again and the other for the other features such as two sided ballots.&nbsp; </p><p>“The said machine and the software therefore may not be considered the same machine and program as submitted in the Technical proposal and therefore may be considered an enhancement of the original proposal.&nbsp; </p><p>“Advance information relayed to the BAC as of 1:40 PM of 15 April 2003 by Executive Director Ronaldo T. Viloria of DOST is that the result of the test in the two counting machines of TIM contains substantial errors that may lead to the failure of these machines based on the specific items of the RFP that DOST has to certify.</p></blockquote><p><em>OPENING OF FINANCIAL BIDS</em>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“The BAC on 15 April 2003, after notifying the concerned bidders opened the financial bids in their presence and the results were as follows:</p></blockquote><p>Mega—Pacific:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Option 1 — Outright purchase: Bid Price of Php1,248,949,088.00&nbsp; </p><p>Option 2 — Lease option:</p><blockquote><p>70% Down payment of cost of hardware or Php642,755,757.07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p> Remainder payable over 50 months or a total of Php642,755,757.07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p> Discount rate of 15% p.a. or 1.2532% per month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Total Number of Automated Counting Machine — 1,769 ACMs (Nationwide)</p></blockquote><p>TIM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> Total Bid Price — Php1,297,860,560.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p> Total Number of Automated Counting Machine — 2,272 ACMs (Mindanao and NCR only)&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>“Premises considered, it appears that the bid of Mega Pacific is the lowest calculated responsive bid, and therefore, the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) recommends that the Phase II project re Automated Counting Machine be awarded to Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p>The BAC, however, also stated on page 4 of its Report: “<em>Based on the 14 April 2003 report (Table 6) of the DOST, it appears that both Mega—Pacific and TIM (Total Information Management Corporation) failed to meet some of the requirements. Below is a comparative presentation of the requirements wherein Mega—Pacific or TIM or both of them failed</em>: . . ..” What followed was a list of “key requirements,” referring to technical requirements, and an indication of which of the two bidders had failed to meet them. </blockquote><p><em>Failure to Meet the<br>Required Accuracy Rating</em></p><p>The first of the key requirements was that the counting machines were to have an <i>accuracy rating of at least 99.9995 percent</i>. The BAC Report indicates that both Mega Pacific and TIM failed to meet this standard.</p><p>The key requirement of accuracy rating happens to be part and parcel of the Comelec’s Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP, on page 26, even states that the ballot counting machines and ballot counting software “<em>must have an accuracy rating of 99.9995% (not merely 99.995%) or better as certified by a reliable independent testing agency</em>.”</p><p>When questioned on this matter during the Oral Argument, Commissioner Borra tried to wash his hands by claiming that the required accuracy rating of 99.9995 percent had been set by a private sector group in tandem with Comelec. He added that the Commission had merely adopted the accuracy rating as part of the group’s recommended bid requirements, which it had not bothered to amend even after being advised by DOST that such standard was unachievable. This excuse, however, does not in any way lessen Comelec’s responsibility to adhere to its own published bidding rules, as well as to see to it that the consortium indeed meets the accuracy standard. <em>Whichever accuracy rating is the right standard — whether 99.995 or 99.9995 percent — the fact remains that the machines of the so—called “consortium” failed to even reach the lesser of the two</em>. On this basis alone, it ought to have been disqualified and its bid rejected outright.</p><p>At this point, the Court stresses that the essence of public bidding is violated by the practice of requiring very high standards or unrealistic specifications that cannot be met — like the 99.9995 percent accuracy rating in this case — only to water them down <em>after</em> the bid has been award. Such scheme, which discourages the entry of prospective <em>bona fide</em> bidders, is in fact a sure indication of fraud in the bidding, designed to eliminate fair competition. Certainly, if no bidder meets the mandatory requirements, standards or specifications, then no award should be made and a failed bidding declared.</p><p><em>Failure of Software to Detect<br>Previously Downloaded Data</em></p><p>Furthermore, on page 6 of the BAC Report, it appears that the “consortium” as well as TIM failed to meet another key requirement — for the counting machine’s software program to be <em>able to detect previously downloaded precinct results and to prevent these from being entered again into the counting machine.</em> This same deficiency on the part of both bidders reappears on page 7 of the BAC Report, as a result of the recurrence of their failure to meet the said key requirement.</p><p>That the ability to detect previously downloaded data at different canvassing or consolidation levels is deemed of utmost importance can be seen from the fact that it is repeated three times in the RFP. On page 30 thereof, we find the requirement that the <em>city/municipal</em> canvassing system software must be able to detect previously downloaded precinct results and prevent these from being “inputted” again into the system. Again, on page 32 of the RFP, we read that the <em>provincial/district</em> canvassing system software must be able to detect previously downloaded city/municipal results and prevent these from being “inputted” again into the system. And once more, on page 35 of the RFP, we find the requirement that the <em>national</em> canvassing system software must be able to detect previously downloaded provincial/district results and prevent these from being “inputted” again into the system.</p><p>Once again, though, Comelec chose to ignore this crucial deficiency, which should have been a cause for the gravest concern. Come May 2004, unscrupulous persons may take advantage of and exploit such deficiency by repeatedly downloading and feeding into the computers results favorable to a particular candidate or candidates. <em>We are thus confronted with the grim prospect of election fraud on a massive scale by means of just a few key strokes. The marvels and woes of the electronic age!</em></p><p><em>Inability to Print<br>the Audit Trail</em></p><p>But that grim prospect is not all. The BAC Report, on pages 6 and 7, indicate that the ACMs of both bidders were <em>unable to print the audit trail</em> without any loss of data. In the case of MPC, the audit trail system was “not yet incorporated” into its ACMs.</p><p>This particular deficiency is significant, not only to this bidding but to the cause of free and credible elections. The purpose of requiring audit trails is to enable Comelec to trace and verify the identities of the ACM operators responsible for data entry and downloading, as well as the times when the various data were downloaded into the canvassing system, in order to forestall fraud and to identify the perpetrators.</p><p>Thus, the RFP on page 27 states that the <em>ballot counting machines and ballot counting software</em> must print an audit trail of all machine operations for documentation and verification purposes. Furthermore, the audit trail must be stored on the internal storage device and be available on demand for future printing and verifying. On pages 30—31, the RFP also requires that the <em>city/municipal</em> canvassing system <em>software</em> be able to print an audit trail of the canvassing operations, including therein such data as the date and time the canvassing program was started, the log—in of the authorized users (the identity of the machine operators), the date and time the canvass data were downloaded into the canvassing system, and so on and so forth. On page 33 of the RFP, we find the same audit trail requirement with respect to the<em> provincial/district </em>canvassing system <em>software</em>; and again on pages 35—36 thereof, the same audit trail requirement with respect to the <em>national</em> canvassing system <em>software</em>.</p><p>That this requirement for printing audit trails is not to be lightly brushed aside by the BAC or Comelec itself as a mere formality or technicality can be readily gleaned from the provisions of Section 7 of RA 8436, which authorizes the Commission to use an automated system for elections.</p><p>The said provision which respondents have quoted several times, provides that ACMs are to possess certain features divided into two classes: those that the statute itself considers <em>mandatory</em> and other features or capabilities that the law deems optional. Among those considered mandatory are “provisions for audit trails”! Section 7 reads as follows: “<em>The System</em> <strong>shall</strong> <em>contain the following features: (a) use of appropriate ballots; (b) stand—alone machine which can count votes and an automated system which can consolidate the results immediately; (c)</em> <strong>with provisions for audit trails;</strong> <em>(d) minimum human intervention; and (e) adequate safeguard/security measures.”</em> (Italics and emphases supplied.)</p><p>In brief, respondents cannot deny that the provision requiring audit trails is indeed mandatory, considering the wording of Section 7 of RA 8436. Neither can Respondent Comelec deny that it has relied on the BAC Report, which indicates that the machines or the software was deficient in that respect. And yet, the Commission simply disregarded this shortcoming and awarded the Contract to private respondent, thereby violating the very law it was supposed to implement.</p><p align="center"><em>C.</em></p><p align="center"><em>Inadequacy of Post Facto<br>&nbsp; Remedial Measures</em></p><p>Respondents argue that the deficiencies relating to the detection of previously downloaded data, as well as provisions for audit trails, are mere shortcomings or minor deficiencies in software or programming, which can be rectified. Perhaps Comelec simply relied upon the BAC Report, which states on page 8 thereof that “<em>Mega Pacific failed in 8 items[;] however these are mostly on the software which can be corrected by re—programming . . . and therefore can be readily corrected.</em>”</p><p>The undersigned ponente’s questions, some of which were addressed to Commissioner Borra during the Oral Argument, remain unanswered to this day. First of all, who made the determination that the eight “fail” marks of Mega Pacific were on account of the software — was it DOST or TWG? How can we be sure these failures were not the results of machine defects? How was it determined that the software could actually be re—programmed and thereby rectified? Did a qualified technical expert read and analyze the<em> source code</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> for the programs and conclude that these could be saved and remedied? (Such determination cannot be done by any other means save by the examination and analysis of the source code.) </p><p>Who was this qualified technical expert? When did he carry out the study? Did he prepare a written report on his findings? Or did the Comelec just make a wild guess? It does not follow that all defects in software programs can be rectified, and the programs saved. In the information technology sector, it is common knowledge that there are many badly written programs, with significant programming errors written into them; hence it does not make economic sense to try to correct the programs; instead, programmers simply abandon them and just start from scratch. There’s no telling if any of these programs is unrectifiable, unless a qualified programmer reads the source code. </p><p>And if indeed a qualified expert reviewed the source code, did he also determine how much work would be needed to rectify the programs? And how much time and money would be spent for that effort? Who would carry out the work? After the rectification process, who would ascertain and how would it be ascertained that the programs have indeed been properly rectified, and that they would work properly thereafter? And of course, the most important question to ask: could the rectification be done in time for the elections in 2004?</p><p>Clearly, none of the respondents bothered to think the matter through. Comelec simply took the word of the BAC as gospel truth, without even bothering to inquire from DOST whether it was true that the deficiencies noted could possibly be remedied by re—programming the software. Apparently, Comelec did not care about the software, but focused only on purchasing the machines.</p><p>What really adds to the Court’s dismay is the admission made by Commissioner Borra during the Oral Argument that the software currently being used by Comelec was merely the “demo” version, inasmuch as the final version that would actually be used in the elections was still being developed and had not yet been finalized.</p><p>It is not clear when the final version of the software would be ready for testing and deployment. It seems to the Court that Comelec is just keeping its fingers crossed and hoping the final product would work. Is there a “Plan B” in case it does not? Who knows? But all these software programs are part and parcel of the bidding and the Contract awarded to the Consortium. <em>Why is it that the machines are already being brought in and paid for, when there is as yet no way of knowing if the final version of the software would be able to run them properly, as well as canvass and consolidate the results in the manner required</em>?</p><p>The counting machines, as well as the canvassing system, will never work properly <em>without the correct software programs</em>. There is an old adage that is still valid to this day: “Garbage in, garbage out.” No matter how powerful, advanced and sophisticated the computers and the servers are, if the software being utilized is defective or has been compromised, the results will be no better than garbage. And to think that what is at stake here is the 2004 national elections — the very basis of our democratic life.</p><p><em>Correction of Defects?</em></p><p>To their Memorandum, public respondents proudly appended 19 Certifications issued by DOST declaring that some 285 counting machines had been tested and had passed the acceptance testing conducted by the Department on October 8—18, 2003. Among those tested were some machines that had failed previous tests, but had undergone adjustments and thus passed re—testing.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Certifications from DOST fail to divulge in what manner and by what standards or criteria the condition, performance and/or readiness of the machines were re—evaluated and re—appraised and thereafter given the passing mark. Apart from that fact, the remedial efforts of respondents were, not surprisingly, apparently focused again on the machines — the hardware. Nothing was said or done about the <em>software </em>— the deficiencies as to detection and prevention of downloading and entering previously downloaded data, as well as the capability to print an audit trail. <em>No matter how many times the machines were tested and re—tested, if nothing was done about the programming defects and deficiencies, the same danger of massive electoral fraud remains</em>. As anyone who has a modicum of knowledge of computers would say, “That’s elementary!”</p><p>And only last December 5, 2003, an Inq7.net news report quoted the Comelec chair as saying that the new automated poll system would be used nationwide in May 2004, <em>even as the software for the system remained unfinished</em>. It also reported that a certain Titus Manuel of the Philippine Computer Society, which was helping Comelec test the hardware and software, <em>said that the software for the counting still had to be submitted on December 15, while the software for the canvassing was due in early January</em>. </p><p>Even as Comelec continues making payments for the ACMs, we keep asking ourselves: who is going to ensure that the software would be tested and would work properly?</p><p>At any rate, the re—testing of the machines and/or the 100 percent testing of all machines (testing of every single unit) would not serve to eradicate the grave abuse of discretion already committed by Comelec when it awarded the Contract on April 15, 2003, despite the obvious and admitted flaws in the bidding process, the failure of the “winning bidder” to qualify, and the inability of the ACMs and the intended software to meet the bid requirements and rules.</p><p>Comelesuasive<em>c’s Latest<br></em><em>“Assurances” Are<br></em><em>Unper</em></p><p>Even the latest pleadings filed by Comelec do not serve to allay our apprehensions. They merely affirm and compound the serious violations of law and gravely abusive acts it has committed. Let us examine them.</p><p>The Resolution issued by this Court on December 9, 2003 required respondents to inform it as to the number of ACMs delivered and paid for, as well as the total payment made to date for the purchase thereof. They were likewise instructed to submit a certification from the DOST attesting to the number of ACMs tested, the number found to be defective; and “<em>whether the reprogrammed software has been tested and found to have complied with the requirements under Republic Act No. 8436</em>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p>In its “Partial Compliance and Manifestation” dated December 29, 2003, Comelec informed the Court that 1,991 ACMs had already been delivered to the Commission as of that date. It further certified that it had already paid the supplier the sum of P849,167,697.41, which corresponded to 1,973 ACM units that had passed the acceptance testing procedures conducted by the MIRDC—DOST<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></sup> and which had therefore been accepted by the poll body.</p><p>In the same submission, <em>for the very first time</em>, Comelec also disclosed to the Court the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“The Automated Counting and Canvassing Project involves not only the manufacturing of the ACM hardware but also the development of three (3) types of software, which are intended for use in the following:&nbsp; </p></blockquote><ol><li>Evaluation of Technical Bids&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>Testing and Acceptance Procedures&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>Election Day Use.”</li></ol><p><em>Purchase of the First Type of<br>Software Without Evaluation</em></p><p>In other words, the first type of software was to be developed solely for the purpose of enabling the evaluation of the bidder’s technical bid. Comelec explained thus: “<em>In addition to the presentation of the ACM hardware, the bidders were required to develop a ‘base’ software program that will enable the ACM to function properly. Since the software program utilized during the evaluation of bids is not the actual software program to be employed on election day, there being two (2) other types of software program that will still have to be developed and thoroughly tested prior to actual election day use, defects in the ‘base’ software that can be readily corrected by reprogramming are considered minor in nature, and may therefore be waived</em>.”</p><p>In short, Comelec claims that it evaluated the bids and made the decision to award the Contract to the “winning” bidder partly on the basis of the operation of the ACMs running a “base” software. That software was therefore nothing but a sample or “demo” software, which would not be the actual one that would be used on election day. Keeping in mind that the Contract involves the acquisition of not just the ACMs or the hardware, but also the software that would run them, it is now even clearer that the Contract was awarded without Comelec having seen, much less evaluated, the <em>final</em> product — the software that would finally be utilized come election day. (Not even the “near—final” product, for that matter).</p><p>What then was the point of conducting the bidding, when the software that was the subject of the Contract was <em>still to be created </em>and could conceivably undergo innumerable changes before being considered as being in final form? And that is not all!</p><p><em>No Explanation for Lapses<br>&nbsp; in the Second Type of Software</em></p><p>The second phase, allegedly involving the second type of software, is simply denominated “Testing and Acceptance Procedures.” As best as we can construe, Comelec is claiming that this second type of software is also <em>to be developed </em>and delivered by the supplier in connection with the “testing and acceptance” phase of the acquisition process. The previous pleadings, though — including the DOST reports submitted to this Court — have not heretofore mentioned any statement, allegation or representation to the effect that a particular set of software was to be developed and/or delivered by the supplier in connection with the testing and acceptance of delivered ACMs. </p><p>What the records do show is that the imported ACMs were subjected to the testing and acceptance process conducted by the DOST. Since the initial batch delivered included a high percentage of machines that had failed the tests, Comelec asked the DOST to conduct a 100 percent testing; that is, to test every single one of the ACMs delivered. Among the machines tested on October 8 to 18, 2003, were some units that had failed previous tests but had subsequently been re—tested and had passed. To repeat, however, until now, there has never been any mention of a second set or type of software pertaining to the testing and acceptance process.</p><p>In any event, apart from making that misplaced and uncorroborated claim, Comelec in the same submission also professes (in response to the concerns expressed by this Court) that <em>the reprogrammed software has been tested and found to have complied with the requirements of RA 8436. It reasoned thus: “Since the software program is an inherent element in the automated counting system, the certification issued by the MIRDC—DOST that one thousand nine hundred seventy—three (1,973) units passed the acceptance test procedures is an official recognition by the MIRDC—DOST that the software component of the automated election system, which has been reprogrammed to comply with the provisions of Republic Act No. 8436 as prescribed in the Ad Hoc Technical Evaluation Committee’s ACM Testing and Acceptance Manual, has passed the MIRDC—DOST tests</em>.”</p><p>The facts do not support this sweeping statement of Comelec. A scrutiny of the MIRDC—DOST letter dated December 15, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which it relied upon, does not justify its grand conclusion. For clarity’s sake, we quote in full the letter—certification, as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“15 December 2003 <br></p><p>“HON. RESURRECCION Z.

VILORIA, CESO III<br>Executive Director cum<br>Chairman, DOST—Technical Evaluation Committee”&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Even a cursory glance at the foregoing letter shows that it is completely bereft of anything that would remotely support Comelec’s contention that the “software component of the automated election system x x x has been reprogrammed to comply with” RA 8436, and “has passed the MIRDC—DOST tests.” There is no mention at all of any software reprogramming. If the MIRDC—DOST had indeed undertaken the supposed reprogramming and the process turned out to be successful, that agency would have proudly trumpeted its singular achievement.</p><p>How Comelec came to believe that such reprogramming had been undertaken is unclear. In any event, the Commission is not forthright and candid with the factual details. If reprogramming has been done, who performed it and when? What exactly did the process involve? How can we be assured that it was properly performed? Since the facts attendant to the alleged reprogramming are still shrouded in mystery, the Court cannot give any weight to Comelec’s bare allegations.</p><p>The fact that a total of 1,973 of the machines has ultimately passed the MIRDC—DOST tests does not by itself serve as an endorsement of the soundness of the software program, much less as a proof that it has been reprogrammed. In the first place, nothing on record shows that the tests and re—tests conducted on the machines were intended to address the serious deficiencies noted earlier. As a matter of fact, the MIRDC—DOST letter does not even indicate what kinds of tests or re—tests were conducted, their exact nature and scope, and the specific objectives thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The absence of relevant supporting documents, combined with the utter vagueness of the letter, certainly fails to inspire belief or to justify the expansive confidence displayed by Comelec.<em> In any event, it goes without saying that remedial measures such as the alleged reprogramming cannot in any way mitigate the grave abuse of discretion already committed as early as April 15, 2003</em>.</p><p><em>Rationale of Public Bidding Negated<br>by the Third Type of Software</em></p><p>Respondent Comelec tries to assuage this Court’s anxiety in these words: “<em>The reprogrammed software that has already passed the requirements of Republic Act No. 8436 during the MIRDC—DOST testing and acceptance procedures will require further customization since the following additional elements, among other things, will have to be considered before the final software can be used on election day</em>: 1. Final Certified List of Candidates x x x 2. Project of Precincts x x x 3. Official Ballot Design and Security Features x x x 4. Encryption, digital certificates and digital signatures . . . <em>The certified list of candidates for national elective positions will be finalized on or before 23 January 2004 while the final list of projects of precincts will be prepared also on the same date. Once all the above elements are incorporated in the software program, the Test Certification Group created by the Ad Hoc Technical Evaluation Committee will conduct meticulous testing of the final software before the same can be used on election day. In addition to the testing to be conducted by said Test Certification Group, the Comelec will conduct mock elections in selected areas nationwide not only for purposes of public information but also to further test the final election day program. Public respondent Comelec, therefore, requests that it be given up to 16 February 2004 to comply with this requirement</em>.”</p><p>The foregoing passage shows the imprudent approach adopted by Comelec in the bidding and acquisition process. The Commission says that before the software can be utilized on election day, it will require “customization” through addition of data — like the list of candidates, project of precincts, and so on. And inasmuch as such data will become available only in January 2004 anyway, there is therefore no perceived need on Comelec’s part to rush the supplier into producing the final (or near—final) version of the software before that time. In any case, Comelec argues that the software needed for the electoral exercise can be continuously developed, tested, adjusted and perfected, practically all the way up to election day, at the same time that the Commission is undertaking all the other distinct and diverse activities pertinent to the elections.</p><p>Given such a frame of mind, it is no wonder that Comelec paid little attention to the counting and canvassing software during the entire bidding process, which took place in February—March 2003. Granted that the software was defective, could not detect and prevent the re—use of previously downloaded data or produce the audit trail — aside from its other shortcomings — nevertheless, all those deficiencies could still be corrected down the road. At any rate, the software used for bidding purposes would not be the same one that will be used on election day, so why pay any attention to its defects? Or to the Comelec’s own bidding rules for that matter? </p><p>Clearly, such jumbled ratiocinations completely negate the rationale underlying the bidding process mandated by law.</p><p>At the very outset, the Court has explained that Comelec flagrantly violated the public policy on public biddings (1) by allowing MPC/MPEI to participate in the bidding even though it was not qualified to do so; and (2) by eventually awarding the Contract to MPC/MPEI. Now, with the latest explanation given by Comelec, it is clear that the Commission further desecrated the law on public bidding by permitting the winning bidder to change and alter the subject of the Contract (the software), in effect allowing a substantive amendment without public bidding.</p><p>This stance is contrary to settled jurisprudence requiring the strict application of pertinent rules, regulations and guidelines for public bidding for the purpose of <em>placing each bidder, actual or potential, on the same footing</em>. The essence of public bidding is, after all, an opportunity for fair competition, and a fair basis for the precise comparison of bids. In common parlance, public bidding aims to “level the playing field.” That means each bidder must bid under the same conditions; and be subject to the same guidelines, requirements and limitations, so that the best offer or lowest bid may be determined, <em>all other things being equal</em>.</p><p>Thus, it is contrary to the very concept of public bidding to permit a variance between the conditions under which bids are invited and those under which proposals are submitted and approved; or, as in this case, the conditions under which the bid is won and those under which the awarded Contract will be complied with. The substantive amendment of the contract bidded out, without any public bidding —<em> after</em> the bidding process had been concluded — is violative of the public policy on public biddings, as well as the spirit and intent of RA 8436. <em>The whole point in going through the public bidding exercise was completely lost. The very rationale of public bidding was totally subverted by the Commission</em>.</p><p>From another perspective, the Comelec approach also fails to make sense. Granted that, before election day, the software would still have to be customized to each precinct, municipality, city, district, and so on, there still was nothing at all to prevent Comelec from requiring prospective suppliers/bidders to produce, <em>at the very start of the bidding process</em>, the “next—to—final” versions of the software (the best software the suppliers had) — pre—tested and ready to be customized to the final list of candidates and project of precincts, among others, and ready to be deployed thereafter. The satisfaction of such requirement would probably have provided far better bases for evaluation and selection, as between suppliers, than the so—called demo software.</p><p>Respondents contend that the bidding suppliers’ counting machines were previously used in at least one political exercise with no less than 20 million voters. If so, it stands to reason that the software used in that past electoral exercise would probably still be available and, in all likelihood, could have been adopted for use in this instance. Paying for machines and software of that category (already tried and proven in actual elections and ready to be adopted for use) would definitely make more sense than paying the same hundreds of millions of pesos for demo software and empty promises of usable programs in the future.</p><p>But there is still another gut—level reason why the approach taken by Comelec is reprehensible. It rides on the perilous assumption that nothing would go wrong; and that, come election day, the Commission and the supplier would have developed, adjusted and “re—programmed” the software to the point where the automated system could function as envisioned. But what if such optimistic projection does not materialize? What if, despite all their herculean efforts, the software now being hurriedly developed and tested for the automated system performs dismally and inaccurately or, worse, is hacked and/or manipulated?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> What then will we do with all the machines and defective software <em>already paid for</em> in the amount of P849 million of our tax money? Even more important, <em>what will happen to our country in case of failure of the automation?</em></p><p>The Court cannot grant the plea of Comelec that it be given until February 16, 2004 to be able to submit a “certification relative to the additional elements of the software that will be customized,” because for us to do so would unnecessarily delay the resolution of this case and would just give the poll body an unwarranted excuse to postpone the 2004 elections. On the other hand, because such certification will not cure the gravely abusive actions complained of by petitioners, it will be utterly useless.</p><p>Is this Court being overly pessimistic and perhaps even engaging in speculation? Hardly. Rather, the Court holds that Comelec should not have gambled on the unrealistic optimism that the supplier’s software development efforts would turn out well. The Commission should have adopted a much more prudent and judicious approach to ensure the delivery of tried and tested software, and readied alternative courses of action in case of failure. Considering that the nation’s future is at stake here, it should have done no less.</p><p align="center"><em>Epilogue</em></p><p>Once again, the Court finds itself at the crossroads of our nation’s history. At stake in this controversy is not just the business of a computer supplier, or a questionable proclamation by Comelec of one or more public officials. Neither is it about whether this country should switch from the manual to the automated system of counting and canvassing votes. At its core is the ability and capacity of the Commission on Elections to perform properly, legally and prudently its legal mandate to implement the transition from manual to automated elections.</p><p>Unfortunately, Comelec has failed to measure up to this historic task. As stated at the start of this Decision, Comelec has not merely gravely abused its discretion in awarding the Contract for the automation of the counting and canvassing of the ballots. It has also put at grave risk the holding of credible and peaceful elections by shoddily accepting electronic hardware and software that admittedly failed to pass legally mandated technical requirements. Inadequate as they are, the remedies it proffers <i>post facto</i> do not cure the grave abuse of discretion it already committed (1) on April 15, 2003, when it illegally made the award; and (2) “sometime” in May 2003 when it executed the Contract for the purchase of defective machines and non—existent software from a non—eligible bidder.</p><p>For these reasons, the Court finds it totally unacceptable and unconscionable to place its imprimatur on this void and illegal transaction that seriously endangers the breakdown of our electoral system. For this Court to cop—out and to close its eyes to these illegal transactions, while convenient, would be to abandon its constitutional duty of safeguarding public interest.</p><p>As a necessary consequence of such nullity and illegality, the purchase of the machines and all appurtenances thereto including the still—to—be—produced (or in Comelec’s words, to be “reprogrammed”) software, as well as all the payments made therefor, have no basis whatsoever in law. The public funds expended pursuant to the void Resolution and Contract must therefore be recovered from the payees and/or from the persons who made possible the illegal disbursements, without prejudice to possible criminal prosecutions against them.</p><p>Furthermore, Comelec and its officials concerned must bear full responsibility for the failed bidding and award, and held accountable for the electoral mess wrought by their grave abuse of discretion in the performance of their functions. The State, of course, is not bound by the mistakes and illegalities of its agents and servants.</p><p>True, our country needs to transcend our slow, manual and archaic electoral process. But before it can do so, it must first have a diligent and competent electoral agency that can properly and prudently implement a well—conceived automated election system.</p><p>At bottom, before the country can hope to have a speedy and fraud—free automated election, it must first be able to procure the proper computerized hardware and software legally, based on a transparent and valid system of public bidding. As in any democratic system, the ultimate <i>goal </i>of automating elections must be achieved by a legal, valid and above—board process of acquiring the necessary tools and skills therefor. Though the Philippines needs an automated electoral process, it cannot accept just any system shoved into its bosom through improper and illegal methods. As the saying goes, the end never justifies the means. Penumbral contracting will not produce enlightened results.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition is <em>GRANTED</em>.

For our purposes, it is well worth noting that Sec. 5.4 of the IRR for RA 6957 as amended, speaks of prequalification requirements for project proponents, and in sub—section (b)(i), it provides that, <em>for purposes of evaluating a joint venture or consortium</em>, it shall submit as part of its prequalification statement a business plan which shall among others identify its members and its contractor(s), and the description of the respective roles said members and contractors shall play or undertake in the project.

This showed an initial finding that on its face the allegations in the petition were insufficient to justify or warrant the grant of a temporary restraining order. In the meantime then the parties were not barred from performing their respective obligations under the contract. As of today, the COMELEC has already paid a large portion of its contracted obligation and the private respondent has delivered the contracted equipment for automation. It is to be reasonably presumed that during the same period the COMELEC focused its attention, time and resources toward the full and successful implementation of the comprehensive Automated Election System for the May 2004 elections. Setting aside the contract in question at this late hour may have unsettling, disturbing and even destabilizing effect. For one, it will leave the COMELEC insufficient time to prepare for a non-automated electoral process, <em>i.e.</em>, the manual process, which would necessarily include the acquisition of the security paper and the purchase of a “dandy roll” to watermark the ballot paper, printing of other election forms, as well as the bidding and acquisition of the ballot boxes. For another, the law on Automated Election System (R.A. 8436) and Executive Order No. 172 (24 January 2003) which allocated the sum of P2.5 Billion, and Executive Order No. 175 (10 February 2003) which allocated the additional sum of P500 Million for the implementation in the May 2004 elections of the Automated Election System would be put to naught as there is absolutely no more time to conduct a re-bidding.</p><p>Finally, there is no suggestion that graft and corruption attended the bidding process, or that the contract price is excessive or unreasonable. All that the petitioners claim is that “the bidding and the award process was fatally flawed. The public respondents acted without or excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it [sic] awarded the project.” It may be precipitate for this Court to declare void the contract in question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><p align="center"><strong>SEPARATE OPINION</strong></p><p><strong>VITUG,</strong> <em>J.</em>:</p><p>While the Supreme Court exercises original jurisdiction over petitions for <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition (along with petitions for prohibition, <em>mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus</em> and injunction), that jurisdiction, however, is not exclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> A direct recourse to the Supreme Court, for the issuance of these writs, in disregard of the rule on hierarchy, should be appropriate only when, besides the attendance of clearly exceptional and compelling reasons clearly set out in the petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> there are no contentious factual assertions of the parties that need to be threshed out before any objective and definitive conclusion can be reached.</p><p>What appears to be a significant issue in the instant petition is the legality of respondent COMELEC’s award of the contract relative to the procurement of automated counting machines to respondent Mega Pacific under alleged questionable circumstances.

The preservation of an honest, upright system of electing our nation’s public officers bears urgent public interest considerations.

The fact that WeSolve, SK C &amp; C, Election.Com and ePLDT bound themselves to MPEI <em>does not mean that a joint venture was executed</em>. These individual entities are merely the sub-contractors of MPEI, and their liability for any breach is <em>only </em>to MPEI.</p><p>Under the RFP, a “joint venture” has been given a very strict definition. To be eligible to submit a bid, the following criteria must be met:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors <em>forming themselves into a joint venture, that intend to be jointly and severally liable for a particular contract, provided Filipino ownership thereof shall be 60%</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (underscoring supplied)</p></blockquote><p>There are therefore three qualifications for eligibility under the RFP. <em>First</em>, the manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors must expressly form themselves into a joint venture. <em>Second</em>, this joint venture must demonstrate an intent that the individual members be jointly and severally liable for a particular contract. <i>Finally</i>, the Filipino ownership of the joint venture must be 60%.</p><p>Whereas the RFP does not require the members of the joint venture to execute a single document to constitute the joint venture, there must be sufficient evidence that such a joint venture was indeed formed, whether this evidence is a single document, or a multiplicity of documents. It is plain that the “joint venture” must be formed as a <em>single entity,</em> responsible for the entirety of the contract, even if separate agreements among the individual members of the joint venture would lay out the specific tenor of their obligations to each other; otherwise, it would be impossible to evaluate the nationality of this joint venture, which nationality is the third requirement for eligibility.</p><p>Conspicuously absent from the records of this case are documents that demonstrate that the individual members of the so-called “Consortium” actually formed or constituted themselves into a joint venture. Jurisprudence discussing a joint venture lays out the rule that such an entity “presupposes generally a parity of standing between the joint co-ventures or partners, in which each party has an equal proprietary interest in the capital or property contributed, and where each party exercises equal rights in the conduct of the business.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p>In <em>Aurbach, et. al. v. Sanitary Wares Manufacturing Corporation, et. al.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we expressed the view that a joint venture may be likened to a partnership, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The legal concept of a joint venture is of common law origin. It has no precise legal definition, but it has been generally understood to mean an organization formed for some temporary purpose. It is hardly distinguishable from the partnership, since their elements are similar—community of interest in the business, sharing of profits and losses, and a mutual right of control. The main distinction cited by most opinions in common law jurisdiction is that the partnership contemplates a general business with some degree of continuity, while the joint venture is formed for the execution of a single transaction, and is thus of a temporary nature. This observation is not entirely accurate in this jurisdiction, since under the Civil Code, a partnership may be particular or universal, and a particular partnership may have for its object a specific undertaking. It would seem therefore that under Philippine law, a joint venture is a form of partnership and should thus be governed by the law of partnerships. The Supreme Court has however recognized a distinction between these two business forms, and has held that although a corporation cannot enter into a partnership contract, it may however engage in a joint venture with others. (citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p>In other words, the legal concept of a “joint venture”, since akin to a partnership, involves a common agreement — in which all individuals and entities party to the joint venture bind themselves, jointly, to perform a common undertaking or undertakings. The definition of a “joint venture” under the RFP is in line with this legal definition.</p><p>There is nothing in the records that would indicate that any such entity was created by the individual members of the so-called “Consortium”. In the absence of any evidence, we must conclude that no such agreement exists. </p><p>Since we are unable to conclude that the “joint venture” has any legal existence, it is impossible to evaluate whether or not the third criterion — setting out the nationality requirement for an eligible joint venture — has been met by the so-called “Consortium”. The so-called “Consortium”, therefore, has failed to meet the first and third criteria.</p><p>There is also a gross failure on the part of the private respondents to meet the second criterion. There is a marked absence of intent that the individual members of the so-called “Consortium” be jointly and severally liable for the contract. </p><p>The records contain particular individual agreements that MPEI entered into with other entities. A perusal of the individual agreements that MPEI entered into with the other entities readily demonstrates that <em>it was always the intent of MPEI to have direct and primary liability for any breach of the Contact with COMELEC</em>.</p><blockquote>Part of the records are so-called “Teaming Agreements” which MPEI entered into with Election.Com Ltd.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and ePLDT Inc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> both dated March 3, 2003. An examination of the language of these “Teaming Agreements” would once more demonstrate that it was <em>MPEI, and MPEI alone, which intended to bid for the Contract with the COMELEC, and intended to be bound thereby</em>. First, both these “Teaming Agreements” contain stipulations designating MPEI as the “Contractor” and the other party as merely the “Subcontractor”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Each of these “Teaming Agreements” acknowledges that the agreements were entered into in the expectation that COMELEC would award the Contract to the <em>Contractor</em>, MPEI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Absent from either of these “Teaming Agreements” is any reference to the possibility that COMELEC would contract with the so-called “Consortium”.</blockquote><p>Moreover, both of these agreements state that the obligation of the Subcontractor was the delivery of equipment or provision of services to the Contractor, MPEI,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and indeed expressly limit the Subcontractor’s role in the entire project to be merely that of a provider of the equipment and services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Liability for failure to perform these obligations is expressly limited. The Subcontractors would be liable only <em>to</em> <i>MPEI</i>, and not to the COMELEC.</p><p>Also part of the records is the “Memorandum of Agreement” entered into between MPEI and WeSolv Open Computing, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The very first preambulatory clause thereof reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>WHEREAS, pursuant to an open competitive bidding to be conducted by the Commission on Elections (“COMELEC”) of the Philippine Government, <em>Mega Pacific</em> intends to submit a bid for <em>Phase II: Automated Counting and Canvassing System</em> (the “Project”) of the Modernization Program of the Philippine Electoral System;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (underscoring supplied)</p></blockquote><p>“Mega Pacific”, the entity referred to, is defined as “Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and <em>not the so-called “Consortium”</em>. In other words, MPEI and WeSolv understood that <em>MPEI</em> would be bidding for the Contract, and MPEI alone would be contracting with COMELEC.</p><p>The expression of “joint and several liability” of “WeSolv” does not transform the agreement into a joint venture. There is a clear limit to the extent of this liability. As plainly stated in the Memorandum of Agreement:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>WeSolv shall be jointly and severally liable with Mega Pacific only for the particular products and/or services supplied by the former for the Project</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The very first reference to any so-called “Consortium” is in the “Memorandum of Agreement” dated March 9, 2003, between MPEI and SK C &amp; C, “a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Republic of Korea”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The initial preambulatory clause reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>WHEREAS, pursuant to an open competitive bidding to be conducted by the Commission on Elections (“COMELEC”) of the Philippine Government, the Mega Pacific Consortium shall bid for <em>Phase II: Automated Counting and Canvassing System</em> (the “Project”) of the Modernization Program of the Philippine Electoral System; . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p></blockquote><p>That Memorandum of Agreement also contains the following clause:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Each of the individual members of the Consortium shall be jointly and severally liable with the Lead Firm for the particular products and/or services supplied by such individual member for the project, in accordance with their respective undertaking or sphere of responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Three things are significant about this Memorandum of Agreement. </p><p><em>First</em>, whereas there is reference to a “Consortium”, the specific composition of the “Consortium” is not specified. Thus, the records are bereft of any evidence that would demonstrate which entities, if any, would be parties to this “Consortium”. It is therefore impossible to make a factual determination as regards whether the “Consortium” would meet the strict requirements for a qualified bidder outlined in the RFP.</p><p><em>Second</em>, the Memorandum of Agreement specifically limits the liability of each member of this “Consortium” only<em> in accordance with their respective undertaking or sphere of responsibility</em>. Thus, the “joint and several” liability of each member of the Consortium would again be only within a very limited application, <em>i.e.</em>, only to the extent of its individual undertaking.</p><p><em>Third</em>, and most significant, the Memorandum of Agreement is only between <em>MPEI and SK C &amp; C</em>. There is no evidence of any similar Memorandum of Agreement, referring to a Consortium, entered into between MPEI and any other entity. The joint and several liability referred to in the quoted paragraph, therefore, would pertain <em>only to MPEI and SK C &amp; C, since these are the only two parties to this particular contract</em>, and not to any other member of the Consortium, if any. In the absence of evidence, it is impossible to conclude that there are other members of the Consortium, and equally impossible to determine the extent of their liability, if any.</p><p>In sum, therefore, there is a conspicuous dearth of evidence to demonstrate that there was, indeed, a Consortium; if there was a Consortium, the specific composition thereof; and, if there was a Consortium, the liability of its individual members, for breach of the contract to COMELEC.</p><p>All this demonstrates that, even if the other contracting party were the so-called “Consortium”, this “Consortium” would be ineligible to enter into the contract with the COMELEC.</p><p>However, it is plain that the COMELEC entered into a contract <em>not</em> with this “Consortium”, but rather with MPEI — an entity which, it is acknowledged, would <em>per se </em>be ineligible to bid. A plain reading of the contract denominates the parties to be:</p><p>COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, the government institution charged with the enforcement and administration of laws relative to the conduct of elections, with principal office address at Postigo Street, Intramuros, Manila, Philippines, represented in this act by its Chairman, Hon.

Consequently, all items necessary for the proper and timely execution and completion of the Project shall be deemed included in the Contract.</p></blockquote><p>Again, <em>conspicuously absent</em> from this contractual definition of a “Contract Document” is <em>any mention</em> of any subsidiary agreement between a purported “Consortium” and the COMELEC. Indeed, a plain reading of the definition of the “Contract Document” would indicate that, insofar as the parties to the contract were concerned, the <em>bid itself </em>was submitted by MPEI and not the “Consortium”.</p><p>Moreover, the definition of “Contract Document” could easily have integrated the subsidiary agreements, incorporating them by reference, in the same way that the “Request for Proposal” and “Tender Proposal” were incorporated by reference. </p><p>These contracts were not even appended as annexes to the main contract. The appendices to the main contract are: “Products and Services to be Acquired from, and Provided by, Mega Pacific Solutions, Inc., and Technical Specifications”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> “Ballot Counting System”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> “Canvassing of Votes System/Software”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> “Project Management Approach”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> “Implementation and Roll-Out Plan”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> “Timelines”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> “List of Goods”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> “List of Documentation”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> “Training Summary”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> “List of Services”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> “Schedule of Communication/Information Dissemination Materials”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and “Global Price Summary”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p>Moreover, an examination of the various obligations in the contract readily demonstrates that <em>all those obligations pertain only to either COMELEC or MPEI</em>. None of the other entities under the so-called “Consortium” has any obligations to COMELEC under the Contract. It is apparent that only COMELEC and MPEI are bound thereunder. The argument that the “Consortium”, as an entity, bound itself to perform particular obligations under the contract is easily debunked by an examination of the contract itself.</p><p>Various other documents also support the fact that only MPEI, not any so-called “Consortium”, contracted with COMELEC. For instance, there is the Secretary’s Certificate, dated March 5, 2003, executed by Enrique T. Tansipek, the Corporate Secretary of MPEI, which attests to the corporate authority given by the M<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> There are various “Affidavits of Undertaking” dated March 7, 2003, executed by Willy U. Yu, President of MPEI, which attest that (1) <em>MPEI</em> (not any so-called “Consortium”) will be participating in the bid for the contract; and (2) the other entities, such as WeSolv, Oracle, and Election.com Ltd., are referred to merely as the “foreign suppliers”,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and <em>not as joint venture partners, or as individual members of a so-called “Consortium”</em>.</p><p align="center"><em>III.</em></p><p align="center"><em>On the Failure of Private Respondents to Meet the<br></em><em>Requirements for Eligible Bids.</em></p><p>Finally, even if we were to concede that the COMELEC contracted with an eligible entity, it appears that the counting machines and ballot-counting software submitted by the so-called “Consortium” simply failed to meet the accuracy rating required by the RFP.</p><p>In the RFP, the COMELEC required that both the counting machines and ballot-counting software should have an accuracy rating of 99.9995 or better.</p><p>After the bids were submitted, the accuracy criteria were suddenly changed to 99.995 percent.</p><p>Only very recently, in the <em>Piatco</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> case, we held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>An essential element of a publicly bidded contract is that all bidders must be on equal footing. Not simply in terms of application of the procedural rules and regulations imposed by the relevant government agency, but more importantly, on the contract bidded upon. Each bidder must be able to bid on the same thing. The rationale is obvious. If the winning bidder is allowed to later include or modify certain provisions in the contract awarded such that the contract is altered in any material respect, then the essence of fair competition in the public bidding is destroyed. A public bidding would indeed be a farce if after the contract is awarded, the winning bidder may modify the contract and include provisions which are favorable to it that were not previously made available to the other bidders.</p></blockquote><p>It is inherent in public biddings that there shall be a fair competition among the bidders. The specifications in such biddings provide the common ground or basis for the bidders. The specifications should, accordingly, operate equally or indiscriminately upon all bidders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p>To change the eligibility requirements mid-stream, and <i>after</i> bids had already been submitted, completely subverts the integrity of the bidding process and warrants the nullification of the award of the contract, whether the other contracting party was MPEI or the so-called “Consortium”. </p><p>In sum, the serious defects in the bidding process indicate a grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondent COMELEC, which seemed to display a marked bias in favor of awarding the contract to the private respondent MPEI or the so-called “Consortium”. Whereas automated counting might greatly speed up our election process, we should take great pains to make certain that the machines used are not flawed. To my mind, the subversion of the bidding process already makes the automation of the 2004 elections inherently suspect, which will have a potential negative effect on the integrity of the results. At this stage in our nation’s history, we should all strive toward restoring the public’s faith in the stability of our government institutions, and the use of suspect machines in counting votes cannot but subvert that faith.</p><p><em>IN VIEW WHEREOF, I CONCUR </em>with the majority opinion and vote to GRANT the petition, specifically, to: (1) declare NULL and VOID Resolution No. 6074 of the COMELEC awarding the contract for the second phase of the automated counting and canvassing system of the Modernization Program of the Philippine Electoral System to either Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc. or the Mega Pacific Consortium; (2) PROHIBIT the COMELEC from implementing any contract entered into with either Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc. or the Mega Pacific Consortium for the second phase of the automated counting and canvassing system of the Modernization Program of the Philippine Electoral System; and (3) COMPEL the COMELEC to conduct a re-bidding of the second phase of the automated counting and canvassing system of the Modernization Program of the Philippine Electoral System.<br><br><br></p><p></p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

All of democracy is founded on the idea that the loser of an election understands that he lost fair and square and that the election represents the will of the electorate.

It publicized this Resolution on May 16, 2003.</p><p>Unsatisfied with the COMELEC’s bidding process, five individuals and entities (including petitioner Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines) wrote a letter dated May 29, 2003 to COMELEC Chairman Benjamin Abalos, Sr. protesting the award of the contract to MP CONSORTIUM. They cited MP CONSORTIUM’s non-compliance with eligibility as well as technical requirements.</p><p>On June 6,2003, COMELEC Chairman Abalos rejected the protest and declared that the award “would stand up to strictest scrutiny.”</p><p>Undaunted, Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines (ITFP), Ma Corazon M. Akol, Miguel Uy, Eduardo H. Lopez, Augusto C. Lagman, Rex C. Drilon, Miguel Hilado, Ley Salcedo and Manuel Alcuaz, Jr., petitioners herein, filed the present petition for prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> seeking (1) to declare null and void COMELEC’s Resolution No. 6074; (2) to enjoin the implementation of the contract that may have been entered into by COMELEC either with MP CONSORTIUM or MPEI; and (3) to compel COMELEC to conduct a re-bidding of the Project.</p><p>After carefully reviewing the records of this case, I find the exhaustive<em> ponencia</em> of Mr. Justice Artemio V. Panganiban worthy of my fullest concurrence.</p><p><em>First</em>, I must deal with the procedural roadblocks.</p><p>Petitioners come to us <em>via </em>a petition for prohibition and <em>mandamus</em>, thus, it is argued that the recourse taken is improper. It is a well established rule, particularly in public biddings, that courts cannot compel an agency to do a particular act or to enjoin such act within its prerogative or discretion. This is not an iron-clad rule. One noted exception is when in the exercise of its authority it gravely abuses or exceeds its jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <em>Judicial review may be justified on the grounds of grave abuse of discretion, arbitrary rejection of bids, and lack of freedom of competition among bidders</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the case at bar, petitioners alleged in their petition that public respondents “acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> when they awarded the Project to MPEI. Thus, the following pronouncement of this Court in <em>JG Summit Holdings, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> deserves reiteration:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Be that as it may, the Court of Appeals erred when it dismissed the petition on the sole ground of the impropriety of the special civil action of mandamus.<em> It must be stressed that the petition was also one for certiorari, seeking to nullify the award of the sale to private respondent of the PHILSECO shares. Verily, the petition alleges that ‘respondents COP and APT have committed such a grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack or excess of their jurisdiction in insisting on awarding the bid to Philyards, for the various reasons stated herein, particularly since the right of first refusal and the right to top the bid are unconstitutional, contrary to law and public policy.’ Petitioner's failure to include certiorari in its caption should not negate the fact that the petition charged public respondent with grave abuse of discretion in awarding the sale to private respondent</em>. Well-settled is the rule that it is not the caption of the pleading but the allegations therein that determine the nature of the action and the Court shall grant relief warranted by the allegations and the proof even if no such relief is prayed for.</p></blockquote><p>Neither can I subscribe to respondents’ view that petitioners have no legal standing to file the present case and that the petition should be dismissed for their failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p><p>Section 7 of R.A. No. 8436 provides that the COMELEC, in the procurement of an automated election system, shall create an “Advisory Council to be composed of technical experts from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the <em>Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines (ITFP),</em> the University of the Philippines (UP) and two (2) representatives form the private sector recommended by the Philippine Computer Society (PCS).”</p><p>Obviously, petitioner ITFP is a member of the Advisory Council mandated to aid the COMELEC in the procurement of the ACM. As such, it has “actual and material interest” to ensure that in the procurement of the ACM, the bidding procedures are followed and the technical requirements are complied with. The same interest redounds to petitioners who are members of the ITFP and who, in addition, are suing as “taxpayers, registered voters and concerned citizens of the Philippines.” In <em>Del Mar vs. Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we ruled that taxpayers are allowed to sue (1) where there is a claim of illegal disbursement of public funds, (2) or that public money is being deflected to any improper purpose, (3) or where petitioners seek to restrain respondent from wasting public funds through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law. Considering that the assailed award involves the disbursement of billions of pesos from the public treasury, I must say that petitioners possess the required<em> locus standi</em>.</p><p>Anent petitioners’ failure to exhaust administrative remedies, suffice it to say that their letter dated May 29, 2003 to COMELEC Chairman Abalos objecting to the process which led to the award of the contract to MPEI satisfies the above procedural condition. Certainly, petitioners could not be expected to follow the protest mechanisms outlined in Section 55,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rule XVII of Republic Act No. 9184<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> considering that the assailed award was made known to the public only on May 16, 2003 or more than one (1) month from the time Resolution No. 6074 was promulgated. Respondents would argue that under the subsequent provision, Section 58<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the same Rule, the court which has jurisdiction over final decisions of the head of the procuring entity is the Regional Trial Court. This is not really a legal obstacle. In <em>Commission on Elections vs. Quijano-Padilla</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we ruled that: “[T]he doctrine of hierarchy of courts is not an iron-clad dictum. On several instances where this Court was confronted with cases of national interest and of serious implications, it never hesitated to set aside the rule and proceed with the judicial determination of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The case at bar is of similar import.<em> It is in the interest of the State that questions relating to government contracts be settled without delay. This is more so when the alleged contract involves the disbursement of public funds and the modernization of our country’s election process</em>.”</p><p>The substantive issues in this case may be reduced into two queries: <i>first</i>, Did the Comelec abuse its discretion when it allowed MPEI to actively participate in the bidding despite its failure to meet the mandatory eligibility requirement?; and second, Did the COMELEC abuse its discretion when it awarded the contract to MPEI?</p><p>At this juncture, it bears stressing that MPEI was incorporated only on <em>February 27, 2003</em> as evidenced by its Certificate of Incorporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This goes to show that from the time the COMELEC issued its Invitation to Bid (<em>January 28, 2003</em>) and Request for Proposal (<em>February 17, 2003</em>) up to the time it convened the Pre-bid Conference (February 18, 2003), MPEI was literally a non-existent entity. It came into being only on February 27, 2003 or eleven (11) days prior to the submission of its bid,<em> i.e. March 10, 2003</em>. This poses a legal obstacle to its eligibility as a bidder. The Request for Proposal requires the bidder to submit financial documents that will establish to the BAC’s satisfaction its financial capability which include:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“(1) <em>audited financial statements of the Bidder’s firm for the last three (3) calendar years, stamped “RECEIVED” by the appropriate government agency, to show its capacity to finance the manufacture and supply of Goods called for and a statement or record of volumes of sales</em>;&nbsp; </p><p>(2) Balance Sheet;&nbsp; </p><p>(3) Income Statement; and&nbsp; </p><p>(4) Statement of Cash Flow.”</p></blockquote><p>As correctly pointed out by petitioners, how could MPEI comply with the above requirement of audited financial statements for the last <em>three (3) calendar years</em> if it came into existence only eleven (11) days prior to the bidding?</p><p>To do away with such complication, MPEI asserts that it was MP CONSORTIUM who submitted the bid on March 10, 2003. It pretends compliance with the requirements by invoking the financial capabilities and long time existence of the alleged members of the MP CONSORTIUM, namely, Election.Com, We Solv, SK CeC, ePLDT and Oracle. It wants this Court to believe that it is MP CONSORTIUM who was actually dealing with the COMELEC and that its (MPEI) participation is merely that of a “lead company and proponent” of the joint venture. This is hardly convincing. For one, the contract for the supply and delivery of ACM was between COMELEC and MPEI, not MP CONSORTIUM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <em>As a matter of fact, there cannot be found in the contract any reference to the MP CONSORTIUM or any member thereof for that matter</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> For another, the agreements among the alleged members of MP CONSORTIUM do not show the existence of a joint-venture agreement. Worse, MPEI cannot produce the agreement as to the “joint and several liability” of the alleged members of the MP CONSORTIUM as required by this Court in its Resolution dated October 7, 2003.</p><p>What is apparent from the four (4) agreements I gathered is the existence of either a “contractor-subcontractor” or “buyer-supplier” relationship between MPEI on the one hand and the alleged members of the MP CONSORTIUM. There was no assumption of a “joint and several liability” over the entire Project of the COMELEC nor an intention to enter directly into a contract with COMELEC.</p><p>In the “<em>Memorandum of Agreement</em>” between MPEI and WeSolv, the latter only agreed to be one of its suppliers. Contrary to MPEI’s asseveration that it was MP CONSORTIUM which bid for the project, the Memorandum clearly states that MPEI “will undertake negotiations with the COMELEC for the purpose of finalizing the contract for the said Project in the event that it [MPEI] is declared as the winning bidder and the Project is awarded in its [MPEI] favor.” As if to emphasize the absence of “joint and several liability” to the entire Project, the Memorandum expressly provides that WeSolv shall be jointly and severally liable with MPEI “<em>only for the particular products and/or services supplied by the former for the Project” and that “in the event that they failed to agree on the terms and conditions of the supply of the products and services including but not limited to the scope of the products and services to be supplied and payment terms, WeSolv shall cease to be bound by its obligations.” The same provisions are to be found in the “Memorandum of Agreement</em>” between MPEI and SK C &amp; C.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p>The “<em>Teaming Agreement</em>” between MPEI and Election.Com<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> also negates MPEI’s assertion that it was MP CONSORTIUM that bid for the Project. Here, MPEI is singled out as the one who intended to submit a proposal to the COMELEC. Under the “Teaming Agreement,” MPEI “has identified the subcontractor [Election.Com] as one of its suppliers.” It was stipulated therein that “<em>the parties shall each be individually liable for any penalties or liabilities incurred by them in connection with the Project, if it can be shown that the said penalties or liabilities are a direct result of errors in data or, non-performance of products and/or services supplied.” The same limitation on liability is present in the “Teaming Agreement</em>” between MPEI and ePLDT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>A joint venture is an association of persons or companies jointly undertaking some commercial enterprise with all of them generally contributing assets and sharing risks. It requires a community of interest in the performance of the subject matter, a right to direct and govern the policy in connection therewith, and duty, which may be altered by agreement to share both in profit and losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the Philippines, the prevailing school of thought is that a joint venture is a species of partnerships.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Since joint venture is a species or a special type of partnership, it is said to have the following characteristics of partnership:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“(a) <em>It would have a juridical personality separate and distinct from that of each of the joint-venturers;</em>&nbsp; </p><p>(b) <em>Each of the co-venturers would be liable with their private property to the creditors of the joint venture beyond their contributions to the joint venture;</em>&nbsp; </p><p>(c) Even if a co-venturer transfers his interest to another, the transferee does not become a co-venturer to the others in the joint venture unless all the other co-venturers consent. This is in consonance with the <em>delectus personarum</em> principle applicable to partnerships;&nbsp; </p><p>(d) Generally, the co-venturers acting on behalf of the joint venture are agents thereof as to bind the joint venture; and&nbsp; </p><p>(e) Death, retirement, insolvency, civil interdiction or dissolution of a co-venturer dissolves the joint venture.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The agreements cited above do not show that each of the alleged members of the MP CONSORTIUM recognizes the latter as an entity with a separate and distinct juridical personality. What is more, its member limits its liability only to the extent of their participation.</p><p>Surely, it is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC to award a billion worth of contract to an entity whose existence and eligibility is highly questionable. It risks the accomplishment of a great undertaking such as the automation of our country’s election system. From a brief survey of the four (4) agreements, I am convinced that the COMELEC, and ultimately the people, stand on the losing end should the Project fail because of the obvious difficulty in determining where the culpability lies.</p><p>It bears reiterating for the consumption of our public officers that in the exercise of their contracting prerogative, they should be the first judges of the legality, propriety and wisdom of the contract they entered into. They must exercise a high degree of caution so that the Government may not be the victim of ill-advised or improvident action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Prudence should be their primordial virtue. Thus, even though they have broad discretion to determine the qualifications of the bidders, it may not act arbitrarily and they must conform to statutory requirements governing the awarding of public contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <em>Reason must govern the acts of such officials, and courts will not hesitate to interfere when it is clearly made to appear that they have acted arbitrarily, dishonestly or beyond the reasonable limits of the discretion conferred upon them</em>.</p><p>Another arbitrary act of the COMELEC is its awarding of the contract to MPEI despite the fact that it failed in some of the technical requirements.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“Below is a comparative presentation of the requirements wherein Mega-Pacific or TIM or both of them failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></blockquote><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="40%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="50%"><div align="center">KEY REQUIREMENTS</div></td><td colspan="3"><div align="center">BIDDER/S THAT FAILED</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td width="17%"><div align="center"></div></td><td width="16%"><div align="center"></div></td><td width="17%"><div align="center"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Does the machine have an</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>accuracy rating of at least</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>99.995 percent?

This is highly irregular. The above requirements where MPEI failed cannot be considered as insubstantial. They have a bearing on the required features of the automated election system under Section 7 of R.A. No. 8436, such as (1) use of appropriate ballots, (2) stand-alone machine which can count votes and an automated system which can consolidate the results immediately, (c) with provisions for audit trails, (d) minimum human intervention, and (e) adequate safeguard/security measures.</p><p>COMELEC’s stance that it can waive certain requirements is misplaced in the present case because what it waives are those which concerns the integrity and accuracy of the ACM and thus, affect the substance and the validity of the bids. Statutory or regulatory mandatory requirements with respect to bidding on public contracts cannot be waived. Presidential Decree No. 1594,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> for one, expressly states that the Government, in the evaluation of bid received, "reserves the right to waive the consideration of minor deviations in the bids received which do not affect the substance and validity of the bids." Thus, while a reservation in the advertisement of the right to reject any bid generally vests in the authorities a wide discretion as to who is the best and most advantageous bidder, however, it may not be used as a shield to a fraudulent award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <em>Should this be the case, judicial interference would be justified</em>.</p><p>One final note. There is a long history of election irregularities that suggest that vote fraud using voting machines has been occurring. As a matter of fact, many voting security experts agree that voting machines represent a pandora’s box for the election process. If the computer science community remains mute and allow unreliable voting systems to be procured, then it abdicates what may be its only opportunity to ensure the democratic process in elections. Government officials need help in understanding the serious risks inherent in computer-related elections system. Like petitioners, everyone must do his share.</p><p>WHEREFORE, I vote to GRANT the Petition.

Apparently, the Court has opted to trudge the trail it blazed recently in the <em>Amari</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and <em>PIATCO</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> cases. <i>Amari </i>voided the Manila Bay reclamation project on constitutional grounds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and <em>PIATCO</em> struck down the NAIA Terminal III contract for violations of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and some other laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to boot.</p><p><em>But in this case, no constitutional provision or letter of a statute was alleged to have been violated. The Court nullified the contract for an automated election system (“AES”) simply on the ground that in making the award the COMELEC has allegedly violated its bidding rules and an unfounded apprehension that the counting machines would not work on election day. On the other hand, not one of the losing bidders has joined the petition, as neither they nor the petitioners questioned the fairness of the price tag for the machines.</em></p><p>The year 2004 could have well been marked in the annals of the Philippines by the maiden use of the automated election. But the country was deprived of the golden chance to join the growing roster of states with modern election systems which include developing countries such as Kenya, Mali, Zambia, Romania, Albania, Mexico and Argentina because of the <em>Decision</em> of the Court.</p><p>In the process, the Court has disregarded the fundamental postulates by which this case should have been decided. They are the following:</p><p><em>First</em>. The instant original petition is one for prohibition and mandamus under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Prohibition is an extraordinary writ directed against any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings when said proceedings are without or in excess of the respondent’s jurisdiction or are attended with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <em>Mandamus</em>, on the other hand, is an extraordinary writ commanding a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, immediately or at some other specified time, to do the act required to be done, when the respondent unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or when the respondent excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p><em>Second</em>. In deciding the instant case, the Court shall consider only the undisputed or admitted facts and resolve only the specific questions raised by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The Court is not a repository of remedies or a “super-legal-aid bureau.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> We cannot grant relief for every perceived violation of the law or worse, on the basis of prophetic wisdom. Paraphrasing an old decision, Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote: “Judicial power, however large, has an orbit more or less strictly defined by well-recognized presuppositions regarding the kind of business that properly belongs to courts. Their business is adjudication, not speculation. They are concerned with actual, living controversies, and not abstract disputation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p><em>Third</em>. The Court does not, as indeed it cannot, guarantee the success of the automation or the integrity of the coming elections. It is not the Court’s function to <em>actively</em> ensure that the automation is successfully implemented or that the elections are made free of fraud, violence, terrorism and other threats to the sanctity of the ballot. This duty lies primarily with the COMELEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p><em>Fourth</em>. The Court has constantly underscored the importance of giving the COMELEC considerable latitude in adopting means and methods that will insure the accomplishment of the objective for which it was created — to promote free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections. Thus, in the past we have prudently declined to interfere with the COMELEC’s exercise of its administrative functions absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As luminously stated in <em>Sumulong v. COMELEC</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> “[I]n the matter of the administration of the laws relative to the conduct of elections, as well as in the appointment of election inspectors, we must not by any excessive zeal take away from the Commission on Elections the initiative which by constitutional and legal mandates properly belongs to it. Due regard to the independent character of the Commission, as ordained in the Constitution, requires that the power of this court to review the acts of that body should, as a general proposition, be used sparingly, but firmly in appropriate cases.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>For the reasons I shall discuss hereunder, I find myself unable to subscribe to the <em>ponencia</em> and join the ranks of my colleagues in the majority.</p><p>Let me first mention that at the opening part of the <em>Decision</em>, the Court opined that there is grave abuse of discretion when the assailed act is contrary to “jurisprudence.” Yet, the 99-page Decision failed to mention a single Court decision which the respondents have defied.</p><p><em>Petitioners failed to exhaust<br>administrative remedies</em></p><p>I agree with the respondents that the petitioners failed to exhaust, or better still avail of, the administrative remedies outlined in R.A. 9184, as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“SEC. 55. <em>Protests on Decisions of the BAC</em>. — Decisions of the BAC in all stages of procurement may be protested to the head of the procuring entity and shall be in writing. Decisions of the BAC may be protested by filing a verified position paper and paying a non-refundable protest fee. The amount of the protest fee and the periods during which the protests may be filed and resolved shall be specified in the IRR.&nbsp; </p><p>SEC. 56. <em>Resolution of Protests</em>. — The protests shall be resolved strictly on the basis of the records of the BAC. Up to a certain amount to be specified in the IRR, the decisions of the Head of the Procuring Entity shall be final.&nbsp; </p><p>SEC. 57. <em>Non-interruption of the Bidding Process</em>. — In no case shall any protest taken from any decision treated in this Article stay or delay the bidding process. Protests must first be resolved before any award is made.&nbsp; </p><p>SEC. 58. <em>Resort to Regular Courts; Certiorari</em>. — Court action may be resorted to only after the protests contemplated in this Article shall be have been completed. Cases that are filed in violation of the process specified in this Article shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The regional trial court shall have jurisdiction over final decisions of the head of the procuring entity. Court actions shall be governed by Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; </p><p>This provision is without prejudice to any law conferring on the Supreme Court the sole jurisdiction to issue temporary restraining orders and injunctions relating to Infrastructure Projects of Government.” [Emphasis supplied]</p></blockquote><p>As correctly pointed out by the respondents, at no time during the entire bidding process did the petitioners question the determination of the COMELEC Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) finding Mega Pacific Consortium (<em>MPC</em>) eligible to bid. Under R.A. 9184, decisions of the BAC should be appealed to the COMELEC <em>en banc</em>. Consequently, the determination of the BAC that <em>MPC</em> was eligible to bid, adopted subsequently by the COMELEC, became final.</p><p>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies requires that when an administrative remedy is provided by law, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts will act. No recourse can be had until all such remedies have been exhausted and special civil actions against administrative officers should not be entertained if superior administrative officers could grant relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In <em>Hon. Carale v. Hon. Abarintos</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court enunciated the reasons for the doctrine, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Observance of the mandate regarding exhaustion of administrative remedies is a sound practice and policy. <em>It ensures an orderly procedure which favors a preliminary sifting process, particularly with respect to matters peculiarly within the competence of the administrative agency, avoidance of interference with functions of the administrative agency by withholding judicial action until the administrative process had run its course, and prevention of attempts to swamp the courts by a resort to them in the first instance. The underlying principle of the rule rests on the presumption that the administrative agency, if afforded a complete chance to pass upon the matter, will decide the same correctly. There are both legal and practical reasons for this principle. The administrative process is intended to provide less expensive and more speedy solutions to disputes. Where the enabling statute indicates a procedure for administrative review, and provides a system of administrative appeal, or reconsideration, the courts, for reasons of law, comity and convenience, will not entertain the case unless the available administrative remedies have been resorted to and the appropriate authorities have been given an opportunity to act and correct the errors committed in the administrative forum</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>Accordingly, the party with an administrative remedy must not merely initiate the prescribed administrative procedure to obtain relief, but also pursue it to its appropriate conclusion before seeking judicial intervention in order to give the administrative agency an opportunity to decide the matter by itself correctly and prevent unnecessary and premature resort to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, under the Rules of Court, judicial review of administrative decisions may be availed of only through special civil actions. Such proceedings cannot lie if there is an appeal, or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p>In <em>Paat vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court enumerated the instances when the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies may be disregarded:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>…(1) when there is a violation of due process, (2) when the issue involved is purely a legal question, (3) when the administrative action is patently illegal amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, (4) when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned, (5) when there is irreparable injury, (6) when the respondent is a department secretary whose acts as an <em>alter ego</em> of the President bear the implied and assumed approval of the latter, (7) when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable, (8) when it would amount to a nullification of a claim, (9) when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings, (10) when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, and (11) when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The petitioners’ allegations do not bring their case within the jurisprudentially recognized exceptions to the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies. It is noteworthy that the protest mechanism outlined in R.A. 9184, in allowing protests of decisions of the BAC “in all stages of procurement,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> reinforces and even institutionalizes the exhaustion doctrine insofar as public bidding is concerned. Hence, had petitioners intended to pursue the available administrative remedies, they could have easily asked for a reconsideration the moment the BAC determined <em>MPC</em> eligible to bid, failing which, they could have filed a protest with the COMELEC <em>en banc </em>itself.</p><p>Petitioners did neither. Instead they sat in waiting until the final hour and now insist that the Court disregard the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies on the puerile reason that there was no opportunity for the protest mechanism instituted in R.A. 9184 to apply because the BAC rendered its report and recommendation in open session on April 15, 2003, the same day and on the same occasion that the COMELEC issued the assailed <em>Resolution No. 6074</em> awarding the Contract to <i>MPC</i>.</p><p>The majority opinion posits that it would have been futile for petitioners to protest/appeal the BAC report to the COMELEC chair since by the time they could have made the move the COMELEC had already approved the report. Not necessarily so. The petitioners could have, or better still, should have appealed directly to the COMELEC <em>en banc</em>. After all, matters of this nature have to be decided by the COMELEC as a collegial body. To state that the poll body would not act on the appeal is to uncharitably state that it would disregard its duty to respond as required by the Code of Ethical Conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, the Court’s statement that the COMELEC <em>en banc </em>made it impossible for petitioners to make use of the administrative remedy is simply baseless.</p><p>Be it noted that the petitioners wasted nearly five (5) months from the time the BAC Report was released on April 21, 2003 before they filed the instant <em>Petition</em> on August 6, 2003. The significant time gap precludes the availability of the exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. Specifically, the petitioners cannot successfully claim that to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable, or that the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, or that judicial intervention has become urgent because of the circumstances.</p><p>Considering the circumstances, it is my view that the premature invocation of this Court’s judicial power is fatal to the petitioners’ cause of action.</p><p><em>MPC, the consortium,<br>participated in the bidding</em></p><p>According to the Court, the first major concern which bears on the issue of grave abuse of discretion relates to the identity and existence of the <i>MPC </i>as a bidder. Petitioners claim that the real bidder was Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc. (MPEI). On the other hand, the respondents insist that the bidder was <em>MPC </em>of which <em>MPEI </em>was the lead member.</p><p>On record are the following documents:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>Letter of <i>MPEI’s</i> President, Willy Yu, dated March 7, 2003, which states</li></ol>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">March 7, 2003</div></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote>BIDS AND AWARDS COMMITTEE<br><p align="justify">Commission On Election<br>Intramuros, Manila&nbsp; </p><p>Sir:&nbsp; </p><p>In response to your Invitation to Bid for the COMELEC Modernization Project corresponding to the various phases which are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p></blockquote><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Phase I :</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Voters Registration – Voters Validation System</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Phase II : </td><td><div align="justify">Vote Counting and Canvassing – Automated</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">Counting/Canvassing</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Phase III :</td><td><div align="justify">Transmission &amp; Dissemination of Results –</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">Electronic Transmission/Consolidation &amp;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">Dissemination of Result</div></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote>The following companies listed below have agreed to form a consortium to bid for the said project;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </blockquote><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td>Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>Election.Com Ltd</td></tr><tr><td>EPLDT</td></tr><tr><td>SK C &amp; C</td></tr><tr><td>We Solv Open Computing, Inc.

The directive is contained in the Court’s Resolution of even date quoted below:</p><p>In open court, Atty.

Alfredo Lazaro, Jr. So, it was he who had to submit the documents and he did so on October 10, 2003. The COMELEC was not required to submit any document. But since the DOST status report which is among the documents mentioned in the <em>Resolution</em> was not in the custody of <i>MPEI</i>, the COMELEC elected to submit it along with the “Eligibility Requirements” folder.</p><p>Obviously to prop up the hypothesis that the COMELEC was unaware of the consortium agreements during the bidding process, the majority picked on Commissioner Florentino Tuason, Jr. and portions of his answers to the questions asked of him during the oral arguments. Although he was evidently not the Commissioner assigned to speak on behalf of the COMELEC but Commissioner Resureccion Borra, Commissioner Tuason deferred to the Court and responded to the questions as best as he could.

So do the answers of Atty. Lazaro, counsel for MPEI, who was queried quite extensively on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p>The consortium agreements were not submitted to the Court obviously because the <em>Petition</em> did not raise any question about the joint and several undertaking of the members of the consortium. It was only during the oral arguments that the Court saw the need to secure copies of the documents. Thus, the Court issued the <em>Resolution </em>of October 7, 2003.</p><p>All told, <em>MPEI </em>as lead member of MPC submitted as part of the bid documents not only the letter dated March 7, 2003 but the following agreements, to wit:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(a) <em>Memorandum of Agreement </em>between <em>MPEI</em> and <em>WeSolv</em> dated March 5, 2003 and notarized on March 7, 2003;&nbsp; </p><p>(b) <em>Memorandum of Agreement</em> between <em>MPEI </em>and <em>SK C&amp;C</em> dated March 9, 2003 and notarized on March 9, 2003;&nbsp; </p><p>(c) <em>Teaming Agreement</em> between <em>MPEI </em>and<em> Election.Com </em>dated March 3, 2003 and notarized on March 9, 2003; and&nbsp; </p><p>(d) <em>Agreement</em> between <em>MPEI</em> and <em>ePLDT</em> dated March 3, 2003 and notarized on March 9, 2003. </p></blockquote><p>before the deadline for submission of bids. Any contrary conclusion is baseless in fact and founded on pure conjecture.</p><p><em>The consortium<br>&nbsp; agreements are sufficient</em></p><p>The majority opinion, nonetheless, insinuates that it is not sufficient that a joint venture be formed, but that the members of the joint venture all bind themselves jointly and severally liable for the performance of the Contract. It asserts that there was no joint venture agreement, much less a joint and several undertaking, among the members of the alleged consortium. Thus, the BAC should not have found <em>MPC</em> eligible to bid.</p><p>I cannot subscribe to this position. The RFP specifically defines a joint venture as a group of two (2) or more manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors<em> that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or liable for the contract.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Nowhere in the RFP is it required that the members of the joint venture execute a single written agreement to prove the existence of a joint venture. Indeed, the intention to be jointly and severally liable may be evidenced not only by a single joint venture agreement but by supplementary documents executed by the parties signifying such intention.</p><p>As the respondents pointed out, separate agreements were entered into by and between <em>MPEI </em>on the one hand and <em>We Solv, SK C&amp;C, Election.Com, </em>and <em>ePLDT</em> on the other. The <em>Memorandum of Agreement</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> between <em>MPEI </em>and <em>We Solv</em> and <em>MPEI</em> and SK C&amp;C set forth the joint and several undertakings among the parties. On the other hand, the Teaming Agreements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> between <em>MPEI</em> and <em>Election.Com </em>and <em>MPEI </em>and <em>ePLDT</em> clarified their respective roles with regard to the Project, with MPEI being the “independent contractor” and Election.Com and <em>ePLDT</em> the “subcontractors”.</p><p>The <em>ponencia</em> mistakenly attributes to the respondents the argument that the phrase “particular contract” in the RFP should be taken to mean that all the members of the joint venture need not be solidarily liable for the entire project, it being sufficient that the lead company and the member in charge of a “particular contract” or aspect of the joint venture agree to be solidarily liable. Nowhere in any of the respondents’ pleadings was this argument ever raised. If it was, inestimable gain goes to the respondents because this contention is ultimately logical and coherent.</p><p>The RFP itself lays down the organizational structure of the joint venture and the liability dynamics of the members thereof. It reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“d. Manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture,<em> i.e.</em>, a group of two (2) or more manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or reliable for a <em>particular contract</em>, provided that Filipino ownership thereof shall be at least sixty percent (60%).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]</p></blockquote><p>So, the RFP adverts to “particular contract.” It does not speak of “entire Project” or “joint venture,” from which the phrase “particular contract” should be distinguished. The clear signification is that all the members of the joint venture need not be solidarily liable for the entire Project or joint venture; it is sufficient that the lead company and the member in charge of a particular contract or aspect of the joint venture agree to be solidarily liable.</p><p>In any case, the Contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> incorporates all documents executed by the consortium members even if the same are not referred to therein. It provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“1.4 Contract Documents&nbsp; </p><p>The following documents referred to collectively as the Contract Documents, are hereby incorporated and made integral parts of the Contract:&nbsp; </p><p>(1) this Contract together with its Appendices;&nbsp; </p><p>(2) the Request for Proposal (also known as ‘Terms of Reference’) issued by the Comelec including the Tender Inquiries and Bid Bulletins;&nbsp; </p><p>(3) Tender Proposal submitted by Mega.&nbsp; </p><p>All Contract Documents shall form part of the Contract even if they or any one of them is (<em>sic</em>) not referred to or mentioned in the Contract as forming a part thereof. <em>Each of the Contract Documents shall be mutually complementary and explanatory of each other such that what is noted in one although not shown in the other shall be considered contained in all,</em> and what is required by any one shall be as binding as if required by all, unless one item is a correction of the other.&nbsp; </p><p>The intent of the Contract Documents is the proper, satisfactory and timely execution and completion of the Project, in accordance with the Contract Documents. Consequently, all items necessary for the proper and timely execution and completion of the Project shall be deemed included in the Contract.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]</p></blockquote><p>Clearly, whatever perceived deficiencies there are in the supplementary contracts entered into by <em>MPEI</em> and the other members of the consortium as regards their joint and several undertaking were cured, or better still prevented from arising, by the above-quoted provisions from which it can be immediately established that each of the members of <em>MPC</em> is solidarily liable with the lead company,<em> MPEI</em>, albeit only for the particular contract or aspect of the joint venture of which it is in charge.</p><p>Moreover, the Contract provides several options which the COMELEC may take in case of MPC’s breach or non-performance of the material terms thereof. It provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“12.5. In the event of termination of this Contract pursuant to Article 12.2 hereof, COMELEC may exercise any or all of the following remedies:&nbsp; </p><p>12.5.1 Procure the facilities from another supplier, charging the amount over an (sic) above the contract price stipulated in this Contract, if any, to the account of MEGA;&nbsp; </p><p>12.5.2 Impose penalty for late delivery at the rate of 1/10 of 1% (0.001) for everyday of delay of the total value of the undelivered item(s);&nbsp; </p><p>12.5.3 Terminate this Contract;&nbsp; </p><p>12.5.4 Execute on MEGA’s Performance Security.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Significantly, <em>MPEI</em> posted a performance bond which amounts to 20% of the bid offer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> against which the COMELEC may execute in case of breach.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>COMELEC is protected<br>under the contract and the<br>Civil Code</p></blockquote><p>But the Court dismisses the respondents’ use of the Contract as basis for the enforcement of the claims of COMELEC against the consortium on the premise that the Contract is between the COMELEC and <em>MPEI</em>, not <em>MPC</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> That is so because MPEI, as lead member of the consortium, is empowered by <em>WeSolv</em> and <em>SK C&amp;C</em>, which along with MPEI itself, represent 90% of the total consortium interest, to represent them. This is clear from the stipulations in their MOAs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <em>Thus, as the Contract was executed by MPEI as the authorized representative of the key members of the MPC, it is the same as if MPC itself was the named party thereto.</em></p><p>From the foregoing, it is clear that the absence of a single formal joint venture agreement among all the members of the joint venture does not preclude the COMELEC from enforcing their liability in case of breach. In any event, the COMELEC may still enforce the liability of the consortium members under the general provisions of the Civil Code on partnership as correctly pointed out by the OSG in its <em>Memorandum</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“Respondent COMELEC is not and will not be precluded from asserting the solidary liability of all consortium members who represented themselves to be such. In the absence of a joint venture agreement, and in cadence with [the] rule on partnership that a partner is considered as the agent of his co-partners and of the partnership in respect of all partnership transactions (Article 1803, Civil Code), private respondent’s members acted as agents of each other and are as such solidarily bound by their own and the other members’ undertaking. Further, the rule is that when a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to another representing him to anyone, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one or more persons not actual partners, he is liable to any such persons to whom such representation has been made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if [he] has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public manner he is liable to such person, whether the representation has or has not been made or communicated to such person so giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent partner making the representation or consenting to its being made. When a partnership liability results, he is liable as though he was an actual member of the partnership. (Article 1825, Civil Code)”</p></blockquote><p>It should be recalled that <em>MPEI, SK C&amp;C, We Solv, Election.Com </em>and<em> ePLDT</em> represented themselves and/or allowed themselves to be represented as partners and members of MPC for purposes of bidding for the Project. They are, therefore, liable to the COMELEC to the extent that the latter relied upon such representation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Their liability as partners is solidary with respect to everything chargeable to the partnership under certain conditions. The Civil Code provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“Art. 1822. Where, by any wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the authority of his co-partners, loss or injury is caused to any person, not being a partner in the partnership, or any penalty is incurred, the partnership is liable therefore to the same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to act.&nbsp; </p><p>Art. 1823. The partnership is bound to make good the loss:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(1) where one partner acting within the scope of his apparent authority receives money or property of a third person and misapplies it; and&nbsp; </p><p>(2) Where the partnership in the course of its business receives money or property of a third person and the money or property so received is misapplied by any partner while it is in the custody of the partnership.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Art. 1824. <em>All partners are liable solidarily with the partnership for everything chargeable to the partnership under Articles 1822 and 1823.” </em>[Emphasis supplied]</p></blockquote><p><em>Thus, the solidary liability of the members of the consortium is inescapable, whether by the language of their own contracts inter se or the provisions of the Civil Code.</em></p><p><em>The consortium is eligible</em></p><p>The<em> ponencia</em> further echoes the petitioners’ objection to the BAC’s conclusion, finding <em>MPC</em> eligible to bid notwithstanding the absence of some financial documents of its member corporations, particularly MPEI which was incorporated only on February 27, 2003.</p><p>Under the RFP, the bidder shall furnish, as part of its bid, an eligibility envelope, consisting of legal, technical and financial documents, which should establish the bidder’s eligibility to bid and its qualifications to perform the Contract if its bid is accepted.

The company’s current assets should be more than its current liabilities. Its long term assets should be more than its long term liabilities. The BAC may disqualify companies that are having financial difficulty and thus, making its long term prospects dim. This will eventually affect their ability to deliver and meet the requirements for the election automated machines.”</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, the Bid Envelope shall contain the technical specifications and the bid price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p>According to the documents it submitted to substantiate eligibility, <em>MPEI</em> was incorporated only on February 27, 2003. Thus, it was not able to submit the required financial documents, <em>i.e., Audited Financial Statements for the last three (3) years, Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flow</em>.</p><p>However, the failure of MPEI to submit its financial documents due to its newly-acquired corporate personality should not by itself disqualify MPC. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the RFP in requiring the submission of the financial documents of the bidder is to determine the financial soundness of the latter and its capacity to perform the Contract if its bid is accepted. This purpose may well be attained by examining the financial documents submitted by the other members of the joint venture. In this regard, the respondents emphasized that <em>SK C&amp;C, ePLDT</em> and <em>We Solv</em> submitted the required financial documents. Moreover, <em>MPEI</em> has a paid in capital of P300,000,000.00, an amount which is substantially over and above the 10% equity based on the total project cost required by the RFP. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, I cannot subscribe to the majority’s myopic interpretation of the RFP that each of the members of MPC must comply with all the requirements thereunder.</p><p>In <em>Kilosbayan v. Guingona</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> we defined a joint venture as “an association of persons or companies jointly undertaking some commercial enterprise; generally all contribute assets and share risks.

Practical wisdom dictates this to be so because the sheer enormity of the Project renders it improbable to expect any single entity to be able to comply with all the eligibility requirements and undertake the Project by itself. As emphasized by the OSG, the RFP precisely allowed bids from manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture in recognition of the virtual impossibility that a single entity would be able to respond to the Invitation to Bid.</p><p>Further, as pointed out by the COMELEC, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (“IRR”) of R.A.

No. 7718,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> is instructive since proponents of Build-Operate-Transfer projects usually form joint ventures or consortiums. Under said IRR, “[A] joint venture/consortium proponent shall be evaluated based on the individual or collective experience of the member-firms of the joint venture/consortium and of the contractor(s) that it has engaged for the project.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p>On another point, the RFP provides that the documentary evidence of the bidder’s qualifications to perform the contract if its bid is accepted shall establish to the satisfaction of the BAC that in case a bidder offering to supply goods under the contract did not manufacture or otherwise produce the goods itself, the bidder must show that it is an established dealer of the goods for at least five (5) years and shall produce documentary evidence to show that he has been duly authorized by the goods’ manufacturer or producer to supply the goods to the Philippines. [<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p>The RFP also requires that the documents submitted shall show that the bidders have the financial, technical and production capability necessary to perform the contract. For this purpose, the primary technology proponent, <em>i.e.</em>, the manufacturer of the counting machine itself, and the creator of the consolidation software, should have a minimum of five (5) years corporate existence in good standing, whereas the members of the consortium providing ancillary services,<em> i.e.</em>, project management and human resources training, should show documentary evidence that their services have been contracted for at least one (1) political exercise with at least 20,000,000 voters and their companies have been issued an ISO certification. Finally, the ACMs should have been used in at least one (1) political exercise with no less than 20,000,000 voters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p>The <em>Comment</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the OSG and <em>Memorandum</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> submitted by MPC detailed the qualifications and track record of the members of<em> MPC, viz: SK C&amp;C</em>, the primary technology proponent and manufacturer of the ACMs, is a corporation in good standing in South Korea since 1991. The ACMs have been used in two (2) Korean national elections with more than 20,000,000 voters. <em>Election.Com</em>, which shall be responsible for system integration, is a corporation in good standing in Delaware, U.S.A. since 1991 and has experience with more than 400 elections in the U.S.A. and Europe. <em>We Solv</em>, which is responsible for the rollout, training and maintenance functions of <em>MPC</em>, is a Philippine corporation in good standing since 1994. Oracle, which shall provide complete information solutions, is a Philippine corporation in good standing since 1996. <em>ePLDT</em>, the provider of computer security and encryption, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. Finally, <em>MPEI</em>, which shall install and maintain the ACMs, provide system integration services and project leadership, is a Philippine corporation incorporated on February 27, 2003. Clearly, all these show that<em> MPC</em> has the financial, technical and production capability necessary to perform the Contract.</p><p>Noticeably, the petitioners failed to contest the qualifications of the members of the consortium in any of their pleadings. The <em>Decision</em>, uncharacteristically silent on this matter except for its general objection to the inability of <em>MPEI </em>to submit some of the financial documents required by the RFP, seemingly concedes that the members of the consortium are eligible and qualified to perform the Contract.</p><p>In my opinion, these paper requirements should yield to the reality that, collectively, the members of the consortium have furnished the COMELEC with sufficient information to enable it to judiciously gauge <em>MPC’s </em>eligibility and qualifications. The strict and inflexible adherence to the bidding requirements by each and every component of the consortium advanced by the petitioners would negate the salutary purpose of R.A. 8436 and frustrate the long-anticipated modernization of the electoral system.</p><p><em>Counting machines supplied<br></em><em>by MPC meet the features<br></em><em>prescribed by law</em></p><p>Unfortunately, the<em> ponencia’s</em> nitpicking did not stop there.

The machine must be certified by the DOST that it will operate properly and accurately under various working conditions. For this purpose, the COMELEC identified key requirements for evaluation, namely: vote counting accuracy, consolidation/canvassing accuracy, ballot counting speed, security features for both the hardware and software, and system reliability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p>In its Report, the BAC noted the results of the evaluation conducted by its Technical Working Group (TWG) and by the DOST as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“The BAC further noted that both Mega-Pacific and TIM obtained some ‘failed marks’ in the technical evaluation. In general, the ‘failed marks’ of Total Information Management as enumerated above affect the counting machine itself that are material in nature, constituting non-compliance to (<em>sic</em>) the RFP. On the other hand, the ‘failed marks’ of Mega-Pacific are mere formalities on certain documentary requirements, which the BAC may waive, as clearly indicated in the Invitation to Bid.&nbsp; </p><p><em>In the DOST test, TIM obtained 12 failed marks mostly attributed to the counting machine itself as stated earlier.

As stated in the BAC Report, the failed marks of <em>MPC</em> were mere formalities in certain documentary requirements. Further, these failed marks were attributable to the software which can be readily corrected by reprogramming. The failed marks, therefore, were not material in nature and were, at worst, mere optional features of the System.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The RFP clearly authorizes the BAC to waive any informality, non-conformity or irregularity in a bid which does not constitute a material deviation, provided that such waiver does not prejudice or affect the relative ranking of any bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p>As regards the issue relating to the accuracy rating of 99.9995% mandated for the counting machine by the RFP, right off I observe that the petitioners made pronounced changes in their position at every turn. In the <em>Petition</em>, they simply alleged that the COMELEC had erred when it “failed to declare a failed bidding and to conduct a re-bidding of the project despite the failure of the bidders to pass the technical tests,” including the test on the accuracy rating of the machine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> At the oral arguments, however, they claimed that the COMELEC had “waived the accuracy requirement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Finally, in their<em> Memorandum</em> they accused the poll body of having “changed the accuracy criteria from 99.9995 percent to only 99.995 percent.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p>However, there is no competent evidence on record that the COMELEC had waived or changed the prescribed accuracy rating. In fact, in the Contract between COMELEC and MPEI, the same accuracy rating of 99.9995 percent was required. Also in the letter dated October 24, 2003 of DOST, it clarified its Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> stating that upon further verification, it found that “except for 1 ACM (with an accuracy rating of 99.998%), all of the 456 machines (including the retested 9 units) that were tested by the DOST (as of October 20, 2003) have an accuracy rating of 100% provided that the ballots are shaded correctly and fed into the ACMs following the right orientation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Notably, the DOST Report itself states that the machines are 100% accurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This official evaluation has mooted the petitioners’ challenge and rendered the pursuit thereof an inconsequential exercise.</p><p>Harping on the requirement for audit trail, the <em>ponencia</em> proceeds to conclude that the ACMs are deficient because of their alleged inability to print the audit trail.</p><p>It should be emphasized that Table 6 of the DOST Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> shows that the tested ACM of <i>MPC</i> generates audit trails which reflect the exact date and time of the start and end of counting of ballots per precinct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The ACM was also able to generate hard and soft copies of the audit trail of the counting machine, with hard copies generated regularly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Moreover, R.A. 8436 itself merely requires that the AES shall have “provisions for audit trail,” which the ACM, as tested, has complied with.</p><p>Anent the inability of the machine to detect previously downloaded data and prevent these from being inputted again into the system, suffice it to state that this is neither a mandatory nor an optional feature of the AES under R.A. 8436. In any case, it is deemed satisfied with DOST’s final favorable evaluation.</p><p>In compliance with the <em>Resolution </em>dated December 9, 2003, the COMELEC filed its <em>Partial Compliance and Manifestation </em>dated December 24, 2003 informing the Court that 1,991 units of ACMs have already been delivered to the Commission. Of these, a total of P849,167,697.41, corresponding to 1,973 ACMs which have passed DOST testing, has been paid to MPC.</p><p>The misgivings regarding the alleged deficiencies in the software are largely explained by the Commission in their <em>Partial Compliance and Manifestation</em>. According to the Commission, the Project involved the development of three (3) types of software for use during the evaluation of technical bids, testing and acceptance procedures and on election day.</p><p>For purposes of the evaluation of technical bids, the bidders were asked to develop a “base” software program that will enable the ACMs to function properly. The base software is not the actual software to be used on election day. Hence, the software defects were considered minor in nature, and accordingly, waived.</p><p>On the other hand, for purposes of the technical and acceptance procedures, a Testing and Acceptance Manual (Manual) was prepared by the<em> Ad Hoc </em>Technical Evaluation Committee, which ensured compliance of the Manual with the Terms of Reference approved by the COMELEC and the provisions of R.A. 8436. The software used for the ACMs was reprogrammed to comply with the Manual. Upon testing, the DOST certified that 1,973 units passed the technical and acceptance procedures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p>Anent the software to be used on election day, additional elements such as the final certified list of candidates, project of precincts, official ballot design and security features, and encryption, digital certificates and digital signatures have to be integrated into the software. Understandably, because of the timeline followed with regard to these additional elements, the software has not yet been finalized. The <em>ponencia</em>, however, chooses to view these circumstances with insularity. It even holds suspect the certifications issued by the DOST declaring that the ACMs had passed the acceptance tests conducted by the Department.</p><p>It is not amiss to state at this juncture that these declarations should be accorded full faith and credit there being no justification for a contrary stance. Reckoned from the standpoint of the established legal presumptions of validity of official acts and regularity in the performance of official duty, I find it unjustified to speculate, as the <em>ponencia</em> does, on the good or bad motives that impelled the COMELEC to award the Contract to <em>MPC</em>.</p><p><em>Epilogue</em></p><p>In view of the foregoing, the majority’s position that the COMELEC should have conducted a re-bidding of the Project is plainly injudicious. The procedure is warranted only if no bid is received or qualified as the lowest calculated and responsive bid. It is not amiss to mention again that there were more than 50 bidders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> for the Project, out of which <em>MPC</em> was qualified as the lowest calculated and responsive bid. A re-bidding of the Project would not serve any further purpose because the bidding had actually drawn the participation of as many bidders as realistically possible and that considering the enormity of the Project, a new bidding would not reasonably attract new bidders. There is therefore no basis to conclude that there was a failure of bidding, and the contract should be re-advertised and re-bid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Remarkably besides, none of the losing bidders questioned the process undertaken by the BAC. The logical conclusion is that the losing bidders have conceded <em>MPC’s </em>eligibility and qualifications and deferred to the decision of the COMELEC to award the Contract to <em>MPC</em>.</p><p>It is also to the COMELEC’s credit that its award of the Contract to <em>MPC </em>has resulted in substantial savings for the government. The paramount objective of public bidding is to ensure that the government obtains the lowest and best price in the market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> This objective was undoubtedly attained by the award of the Contract to <em>MPC</em>. As emphasized in the respondents’ pleadings and in newspaper advertisements,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> <em>MPC’s</em> bid covering nationwide automation was P49,000,000.00 lower than that submitted by TIMC, with its coverage restricted to Mindanao and the National Capital Region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></p><p>As stated at the outset, the Court has unfailingly stressed the importance of giving the COMELEC considerable latitude in adopting means and methods that will insure the accomplishment of the objective for which it was created—to promote free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections — and perforce prudently declined to interfere with COMELEC’s exercise of its administrative functions absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion. I see no justification for the departure from this principle in the instant case.</p><p>Let it be noted that R.A. No. 8436 was precisely intended as an initial step towards the modernization of the Philippine electoral system which seeks to ensure free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections. The COMELEC must be given enough latitude to bring into fruition this laudable purpose.</p><p>All the challenges, whether factual or legal, to the acts of COMELEC, to my mind, have been adequately explained and clarified.</p><p>The most crucial point raised against the respondents is the alleged non-submission of the consortium agreements before the bidding deadline. The <em>ponencia </em>adverted to it no les than five times. But the assertion which is one of fact is debunked by the consortium agreements themselves which were notarized not later than March 9, 2003, or before the bidding deadline. To ignore the public character of the documents is to unfairly ascribe bad faith to COMELEC. </p><p>As for the fact that <em>MPEI </em>was made the party to the Contract with COMELEC, this was so simply because <em>MPEI</em> was authorized to sign in behalf of the other consortium members. </p><p>Seemingly, the ultimate resolution of this case has narrowed down to the question of which prognostication of the technical performance of the counting machines on election day is accurate: That of the COMELEC’s or this Court’s? But that would lead the Court to tread on unfamiliar waters. More fundamentally, the question was not raised in the<em> Petition</em>.</p><p>In closing, I refer to the definition of “grave abuse of discretion” which the Court made in <em>Tañada v. Angara</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> cited at the opening of the <em>Decision</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>By grave abuse of discretion is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law. Failure on the part of the petitioner to show grave abuse of discretion will result in the dismissal of the petition.&nbsp; </p><p>In rendering this Decision, this Court never forgets that the Senate, whose act is under review, is one of two sovereign houses of Congress and is thus entitled to great respect in its actions. It is itself a constitutional body independent and coordinate, and thus its actions are presumed regular and done in good faith. Unless convincing proof and persuasive arguments are presented to overthrow such presumptions, this Court will resolve every doubt in its favor. Using the foregoing well-accepted definition of grave abuse of discretion and the presumption of regularity in the Senate’s processes, this Court cannot find any cogent reason to impute grave abuse of discretion to the Senate’s exercise of its power of concurrence in the WTO Agreement granted it by Sec. 21 of Article VII of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Like the Senate to which the Court graciously deferred in the cited ruling, I respectfully submit, the COMELEC deserves the same degree of deferential treatment given its status as a constitutional body. But quite lamentably, the <em>Decision </em>would bring disrepute to and even cause havoc on the COMELEC as an institution. It will never be the same.</p><p>I therefore vote to dismiss the instant Petition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
