				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 45, petitioners Mighty Corporation and La Campana Fabrica de Tabaco, Inc.

CV No. 65175 affirming the November 26, 1998 decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> as modified by the June 24, 1999 order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 57 (Makati RTC) in Civil Case No. 93-850, which held petitioners liable for, and permanently enjoined them from, committing trademark infringement and unfair competition, and which ordered them to pay damages to respondents E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery (Gallo Winery) and The Andresons Group, Inc. (Andresons);&nbsp; (b) the July 11, 2002 CA resolution denying their motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and (c) the aforesaid Makati RTC decision itself.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.<br>The Factual Background</span></div><br>Respondent Gallo Winery is a foreign corporation not doing business in the Philippines but organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, United States of America (U.S.), where all its wineries are located. Gallo Winery produces different kinds of wines and brandy products and sells them in many countries under different registered trademarks, including the GALLO and ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO wine trademarks.<br><br>Respondent domestic corporation, Andresons, has been Gallo Winery’s exclusive wine importer and distributor in the Philippines since 1991, selling these products in its own name and for its own account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Gallo Winery’s GALLO wine trademark was registered in the principal register of the Philippine Patent Office (now Intellectual Property Office) on November 16, 1971 under Certificate of Registration No. 17021 which was renewed on November 16, 1991 for another 20 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Gallo Winery also applied for registration of its ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO wine trademark on October 11, 1990 under Application Serial No. 901011-00073599-PN but the records do not disclose if it was ever approved by the Director of Patents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, petitioners Mighty Corporation and La Campana and their sister company, Tobacco Industries of the Philippines (Tobacco Industries), are engaged in the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products for which they have been using the GALLO cigarette trademark since 1973. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) approved Tobacco Industries’ use of GALLO 100’s cigarette mark on September 14, 1973 and GALLO filter cigarette mark on March 26, 1976, both for the manufacture and sale of its cigarette products. In 1976, Tobacco Industries filed its manufacturer’s sworn statement as basis for BIR’s collection of specific tax on GALLO cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On February 5, 1974, Tobacco Industries applied for, but eventually did not pursue, the registration of the GALLO cigarette trademark in the principal register of the then Philippine Patent Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In May 1984, Tobacco Industries assigned the GALLO cigarette trademark to La Campana which, on July 16, 1985, applied for trademark&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;registration in the Philippine Patent Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On July 17, 1985, the National Library issued Certificate of Copyright Registration No. 5834 for La Campana’s lifetime copyright claim over GALLO cigarette labels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, La Campana authorized Mighty Corporation to manufacture and sell cigarettes bearing the GALLO trademark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> BIR approved Mighty Corporation’s use of GALLO 100’s cigarette brand, under licensing agreement with Tobacco Industries, on May 18, 1988, and GALLO SPECIAL MENTHOL 100’s cigarette brand on April 3, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Petitioners claim that GALLO cigarettes have been sold in the Philippines since 1973, initially by Tobacco Industries, then by La Campana and finally by Mighty Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, although the GALLO wine trademark was registered in the Philippines in 1971, respondents claim that they first introduced and sold the GALLO and ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO wines in the Philippines <span style="font-style: italic;">circa</span> 1974 within the then U.S. military facilities only.&nbsp; By 1979, they had expanded their Philippine market through authorized distributors and independent outlets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Respondents claim that they first learned about the existence of GALLO cigarettes in the latter part of 1992 when an Andresons employee saw such cigarettes on display with GALLO wines in a Davao supermarket wine cellar section.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Forthwith, respondents sent a demand letter to petitioners asking them to stop using the GALLO trademark, to no avail.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">II.<br>The Legal Dispute</span></div><br>On March 12, 1993, respondents sued petitioners in the Makati RTC for trademark and tradename infringement and unfair competition, with a prayer for damages and preliminary injunction.Respondents charged petitioners with violating Article 6<sup>bis</sup> of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and RA 166 (Trademark Law),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> specifically, Sections 22 and 23 (for trademark infringement),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 29 and 30<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (for unfair competition and false designation of origin) and 37 (for tradename infringement).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> They claimed that petitioners adopted the GALLO trademark to ride on Gallo Winery’s GALLO and ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO trademarks’ established reputation and popularity, thus causing confusion, deception and mistake on the part of the purchasing public who had always associated GALLO and ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO trademarks with Gallo Winery’s wines.&nbsp; Respondents prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> restraining order, plus <s>P</s>2 million as actual and compensatory damages, at least <s>P</s>500,000 as exemplary and moral damages, and at least <s>P</s>500,000 as attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In their answer, petitioners alleged, among other affirmative defenses, that: petitioner’s GALLO cigarettes and Gallo Winery’s wines were totally unrelated products; Gallo Winery’s GALLO trademark registration certificate covered wines only, not cigarettes; GALLO cigarettes and GALLO wines were sold through different channels of trade; GALLO cigarettes, sold at <s>P</s>4.60 for GALLO filters and <s>P</s>3 for GALLO menthols, were low-cost items compared to Gallo Winery’s high-priced luxury wines which cost between <s>P</s>98 to <s>P</s>242.50; the target market of Gallo Winery’s wines was the middle or high-income bracket with at least <s>P</s>10,000 monthly income while GALLO cigarette buyers were farmers, fishermen, laborers and other low-income workers; the dominant feature of the GALLO cigarette mark was the rooster device with the manufacturer’s name clearly indicated as MIGHTY CORPORATION while, in the case of&nbsp; Gallo Winery’s wines, it was the full names of the founders-owners ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO or just their surname GALLO; by their inaction and conduct, respondents were guilty of laches and estoppel; and petitioners acted with honesty, justice and good faith in the exercise of their right to manufacture and sell GALLO cigarettes.<br><br>In an order dated April 21, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Makati RTC denied, for lack of merit, respondent’s prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> holding that respondent’s GALLO trademark registration certificate covered wines only, that respondents’ wines and petitioners’ cigarettes were not related goods and respondents failed to prove material damage or great irreparable injury as required by Section 5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On August 19, 1993, the Makati RTC denied, for lack of merit, respondents’ motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The court reiterated that respondents’ wines and petitioners’ cigarettes were not related goods since the likelihood of deception and confusion on the part of the consuming public was very remote.&nbsp; The trial court emphasized that it could not rely on foreign rulings cited by respondents “because the[se] cases were decided by foreign courts on the basis of unknown facts peculiar to each case or upon factual surroundings which may exist only within their jurisdiction.&nbsp; Moreover, there [was] no showing that [these cases had] been tested or found applicable in our jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On February 20, 1995, the CA likewise dismissed respondents’ petition for review on certiorari, docketed as CA-G.R. No. 32626, thereby affirming the Makati RTC’s denial of the application for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction against petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, however, the Makati RTC, on November 26, 1998, held petitioners liable for, and permanently enjoined them from, committing trademark infringement and unfair competition with respect to the GALLO trademark:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) and against the defendant (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>), to wit:<ol type="A"><li>permanently restraining and enjoining defendants, their distributors, trade outlets, and all persons acting for them or under their instructions, from (i) using E &amp; J’s registered trademark GALLO or any other reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of said trademark, either singly or in conjunction with other words, designs or emblems and other acts of similar nature, and (ii) committing other acts of unfair competition against plaintiffs by manufacturing and selling their cigarettes in the domestic or export markets under the GALLO trademark.</li><br><li>ordering defendants to pay plaintiffs –</li><br><ol type="I"><li>actual and compensatory damages for the injury and prejudice and impairment of plaintiffs’ business and goodwill as a result of the acts and conduct pleaded as basis for this suit, in an amount equal to 10% of FOURTEEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (PHP14,235,000.00) from the filing of the complaint until fully paid;</li><br><li>exemplary damages in the amount of PHP100,000.00;</li><br><li>attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation in the amount of PHP1,130,068.91;</li><br><li>the cost of suit.</li></ol></ol>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>On June 24, 1999, the Makati RTC granted respondent’s motion for partial reconsideration and increased the award of actual and compensatory damages to 10% of <s>P</s>199,290,000 or <s>P</s>19,929,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed the Makati RTC decision and subsequently denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III.<br>The Issues</span></div><br>Petitioners now seek relief from this Court contending that the CA did not follow prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it held that:&nbsp; [a] RA 8293 (Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines [IP Code]) was applicable in this case; [b] GALLO cigarettes and GALLO wines were identical, similar or related goods for the reason alone that they were purportedly forms of vice; [c] both goods passed through the same channels of trade and [d] petitioners were liable for trademark infringement, unfair competition and damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, assert that this petition which invokes Rule 45 does not involve pure questions of law, and hence, must be dismissed outright.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.<br>Discussion</span></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES<br>IN THIS CASE OBLIGE THE COURT TO REVIEW<br>THE CA’S FACTUAL FINDINGS<br><br></span>As a general rule, a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 45 must raise only “questions of law”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (that is, the doubt pertains to the application and interpretation of law to a certain set of facts) and not “questions of fact” (where the doubt concerns the truth or falsehood of alleged facts),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> otherwise, the petition will be denied.&nbsp; We are not a trier of facts and the Court of Appeals’ factual findings are generally conclusive upon us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>This case involves questions of fact which are directly related and intertwined with questions of law.&nbsp; The resolution of the factual issues concerning the goods’ similarity, identity, relation, channels of trade, and acts of trademark infringement and unfair competition is greatly dependent on the interpretation of applicable laws.&nbsp; The controversy here is not simply the identity or similarity of both parties’ trademarks but whether or not infringement or unfair competition was committed, a conclusion based on statutory interpretation.&nbsp; Furthermore, one or more of the following exceptional circumstances oblige us to review the evidence on record:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><blockquote><ol><li>the conclusion is grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, and conjectures;</li><br><li>the inference of the Court of Appeals from its findings of fact is manifestly mistaken, absurd and impossible;</li><br><li>there is grave abuse of discretion;</li><br><li>the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;</li><br><li>the appellate court, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case, and the same are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee;</li><br><li>the findings are without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;</li><br><li>the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and</li><br><li>the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted [by the evidence] on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In this light, after thoroughly examining the evidence on record, weighing, analyzing and balancing all factors to determine whether trademark infringement and/or unfair competition has been committed, we conclude that both the Court of Appeals and the trial court veered away from the law and well-settled jurisprudence.<br><br>Thus, we give due course to the petition.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE TRADEMARK LAW AND THE PARIS<br>CONVENTION ARE THE APPLICABLE LAWS,<br>NOT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CODE<br><br></span>We note that respondents sued petitioners on March 12, 1993 for trademark infringement and unfair competition committed during the effectivity of the Paris Convention and the Trademark Law.<br><br>Yet, in the Makati RTC decision of November 26, 1998, petitioners were held liable not only under the aforesaid governing laws but also under the IP Code which took effect only on January 1, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> or about five years after the filing of the complaint:<blockquote>Defendants’ unauthorized use of the GALLO trademark constitutes trademark infringement pursuant to Section 22 of Republic Act No. 166, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Section 155 of the IP Code</span>, Article 6<sup>bis</sup> of the Paris Convention, and Article 16 (1) of the TRIPS Agreement as it causes confusion, deception and mistake on the part of the purchasing public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The CA apparently did not notice the error and affirmed the Makati RTC decision:<blockquote>In the light of its finding that appellants’ use of the GALLO trademark on its cigarettes is likely to create confusion with the GALLO trademark on wines previously registered and used in the Philippines by appellee E &amp; J Gallo Winery, the <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">trial court thus did not err in holding that appellants’ acts</span> not only <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">violated</span> the provisions of the our trademark laws (R.A. No. 166 and <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">R.A. Nos. (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) 8293)</span> but also Article 6<sup>bis</sup> of the Paris Convention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>We therefore hold that the courts <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> erred in retroactively applying the IP Code in this case.<br><br>It is a fundamental principle that the validity and obligatory force of a law proceed from the fact that it has first been promulgated.&nbsp; A law that is not yet effective cannot be considered as conclusively known by the populace.&nbsp; To make a law binding even before it takes effect may lead to the arbitrary exercise of the legislative power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non praeteritis</span>.&nbsp; A new state of the law ought to affect the future, not the past. Any doubt must generally be resolved against the retroactive operation of laws, whether these are original enactments, amendments or repeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> There are only a few instances when laws may be given retroactive effect,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> none of which is present in this case.<br><br>The IP Code, repealing the Trademark Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> was approved on June 6, 1997.&nbsp; Section 241 thereof expressly decreed that it was to take effect only on January 1, 1998, without any provision for retroactive application.&nbsp; Thus, the Makati RTC and the CA should have limited the consideration of the present case within the parameters of the Trademark Law and the Paris Convention, the laws in force at the time of the filing of the complaint.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN<br>TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT<br>AND UNFAIR COMPETITION<br><br></span>Although the laws on trademark infringement and unfair competition have a common conception at their root, that is, a person shall not be permitted to misrepresent his goods or his business as the goods or business of another, the law on unfair competition is broader and more inclusive than the law on trademark infringement.&nbsp; The latter is more limited but it recognizes a more exclusive right derived from the trademark adoption and registration by the person whose goods or business is first associated with it.&nbsp; The law on trademarks is thus a specialized subject distinct from the law on unfair competition, although the two subjects are entwined with each other and are dealt with together in the Trademark Law (now, both are covered by the IP Code).&nbsp; Hence, even if one fails to establish his exclusive property right to a trademark, he may still obtain relief on the ground of his competitor’s unfairness or fraud.&nbsp; Conduct constitutes unfair competition if the effect is to pass off on the public the goods of one man as the goods of another.&nbsp; It is not necessary that any particular means should be used to this end.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Del Monte Corporation vs. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> we distinguished trademark infringement from unfair competition:<blockquote><ol><li>Infringement of trademark is the unauthorized use of a trademark, whereas unfair competition is the passing off of one's goods as those of another.</li><br><li>In infringement of trademark fraudulent intent is unnecessary, whereas in unfair competition fraudulent intent is essential.</li><br><li>In infringement of trademark the prior registration of the trademark is a prerequisite to the action, whereas in unfair competition registration is not necessary.</li></ol></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pertinent Provisions on Trademark<br>Infringement under the Paris<br>Convention and the Trademark Law<br><br></span>Article 6<sup>bis</sup> of the Paris Convention,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> an international agreement binding on the Philippines and the United States (Gallo Winery’s country of domicile and origin) prohibits “the [registration] or use of a trademark which constitutes a reproduction, imitation or translation, liable to create confusion, of a mark considered by the competent authority of the country of registration or use to be <span style="font-style: italic;">well-known</span> in that country as being already the mark of a person entitled to the benefits of the [Paris] Convention and used for identical or <span style="font-style: italic;">similar</span> goods.&nbsp; [This rule also applies] when the essential part of the mark constitutes a reproduction of any such well-known mark or an imitation <span style="font-style: italic;">liable to create confusion</span> therewith.” There is no time limit for seeking the prohibition of the use of marks used in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Thus, under Article 6<sup>bis</sup> of the Paris Convention, the following are the elements of trademark infringement:<blockquote><ol type="A"><li>registration or use by another person of a trademark which is a reproduction, imitation or translation <span style="font-style: italic;">liable to create confusion</span>,</li><br><li>of a mark considered by the competent authority of the country of registration or use<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> to be <span style="font-style: italic;">well-known</span> in that country and is already the mark of a person entitled to the benefits of the Paris Convention, and</li><br><li>such trademark is <span style="font-style: italic;">used for identical or similar goods</span>.</li></ol></blockquote>On the other hand, Section 22 of the Trademark Law holds a person liable for infringement when, among others, he “uses without the consent of the registrant, any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of any registered mark or tradename in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of any goods, business or services or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers or others as to the source or origin of such goods or services, or identity of such business; or reproduce, counterfeit, copy or colorably imitate any such mark or tradename and apply such reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements intended to be used upon or in connection with such goods, business or services.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Trademark registration and actual use are material to the complaining party’s cause of action.<br><br>Corollary to this, Section 20 of the Trademark Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> considers the trademark registration certificate as <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence of the validity of the registration, the registrant’s ownership and exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;right to use the trademark in connection with the goods, business or services as classified by the Director of Patents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and as specified in the certificate, subject to the conditions and limitations stated therein.&nbsp; Sections 2 and 2-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the Trademark Law emphasize the importance of the trademark’s actual use in commerce in the Philippines prior to its registration.&nbsp; In the adjudication of trademark rights between contending parties, equitable principles of laches, estoppel, and acquiescence may be considered and applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Under Sections 2, 2-A, 9-A, 20 and 22 of the Trademark Law therefore, the following constitute the elements of trademark infringement:<blockquote><ol type="A"><li>a trademark actually used in commerce in the Philippines and registered in the principal register of the Philippine Patent Office</li><br><li>is used by another person in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of any goods, business or services or in connection with which such use is <span style="font-style: italic;">likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers</span> or others as to the <span style="font-style: italic;">source or origin</span> of such goods or services, <span style="font-style: italic;">or identity</span> of such business;

Withal, the fact that international law has been made part of the law of the land does not by any means imply the primacy of international law over national law in the municipal sphere.

We cannot give credence to private respondent's claim that its “LEE” mark first reached the Philippines in the 1960's through local sales by the Post Exchanges of the U.S. Military Bases in the Philippines (Rollo, p. 177) based as it was solely on the self-serving statements of Mr. Edward Poste, General Manager of Lee (Phils.), Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the H.D. Lee, Co., Inc., U.S.A., herein private respondent. (Original Records, p. 52)&nbsp; Similarly, we give little weight to the numerous vouchers representing various advertising expenses in the Philippines for “LEE” products. It is well to note that these expenses were incurred only in 1981 and 1982 by LEE (Phils.), Inc. after it entered into a licensing agreement with private respondent on 11 May 1981.</span> (Exhibit E)<br><br>On the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">petitioner has sufficiently shown that it has been in the business of selling jeans and other garments adopting its “STYLISTIC MR.

It requires actual commercial use of the mark prior to its registration.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no dispute that respondent corporation was the first registrant, yet it failed to fully substantiate its claim that it used in trade or business in the Philippines the subject mark; it did not present proof to invest it with exclusive, continuous adoption of the trademark which should consist among others, of considerable sales since its first use.&nbsp; The invoices submitted by respondent which were dated way back in 1957 show that the zippers sent to the Philippines were to be used as “samples” and “of no commercial value.”</span> The evidence for respondent must be clear, definite and free from inconsistencies.&nbsp; “Samples” are not for sale and therefore, the fact of exporting them to the Philippines cannot be considered to be equivalent to the “use” contemplated by law.&nbsp; Respondent did not expect income from such “samples.” There were no receipts to establish sale, and no proof were presented to show that they were subsequently sold in the Philippines.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx xxx xxx</div></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">For lack of adequate proof of actual use of its trademark in the Philippines prior to petitioner's use of its own mark and for failure to establish confusing similarity between said trademarks, private respondent's action for infringement must necessarily fail.</span>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>In view of the foregoing jurisprudence and respondents’ judicial admission that the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual commercial use</span> of the GALLO wine trademark was <span style="font-style: italic;">subsequent</span> to its registration in 1971 and to Tobacco Industries’ commercial use of the GALLO cigarette trademark in 1973, we rule that, on this account, respondents never enjoyed the exclusive right to use the GALLO wine trademark to the prejudice of Tobacco Industries and its successors-in-interest, herein petitioners, either under the Trademark Law or the Paris Convention.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Respondents’ GALLO trademark<br>registration is limited to<br>wines only<br><br></span>We also note that the GALLO trademark registration certificates in the Philippines and in other countries expressly state that they cover <span style="font-style: italic;">wines only</span>, without any evidence or indication that registrant Gallo Winery expanded or intended to expand its business to cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Thus, by strict application of Section 20 of the Trademark Law, Gallo Winery’s exclusive right to use the GALLO trademark should be limited to wines, the only product indicated in its registration certificates.&nbsp; This strict statutory limitation on the exclusive right to use trademarks was amply clarified in our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Faberge, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><blockquote>Having thus reviewed the laws applicable to the case before Us, it is not difficult to discern from the foregoing statutory enactments that private respondent may be permitted to register the trademark “BRUTE” for briefs produced by it notwithstanding petitioner's vehement protestations of unfair dealings in marketing its own set of items which are limited to: after-shave lotion, shaving cream, deodorant, talcum powder and toilet soap.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inasmuch as petitioner has not ventured in the production of briefs, an item which is not listed in its certificate of registration, petitioner cannot and should not be allowed to feign that private respondent had invaded petitioner's exclusive domain</span>.&nbsp; To be sure, it is significant that petitioner failed to annex in its Brief the so-called “eloquent proof that petitioner indeed intended to expand its mark ‘BRUT’ to other goods” (Page 27, Brief for the Petitioner; page 202, Rollo).&nbsp; Even then, a mere application by petitioner in this aspect does not suffice and may not vest an exclusive right in its favor that can ordinarily be protected by the Trademark Law.&nbsp; In short, <span style="font-weight: bold;">paraphrasing Section 20 of the Trademark Law as applied to the documentary evidence adduced by petitioner, the certificate of registration issued by the Director of Patents can confer upon petitioner the exclusive right to use its own symbol only to those goods specified in the certificate,</span> subject to any conditions and limitations stated therein.&nbsp; This basic point is perhaps the unwritten <span style="font-weight: bold;">rationale of Justice Escolin in</span> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Philippine Refining Co., Inc. vs. Ng Sam</span> (115 SCRA 472 [1982]), when he stressed the principle enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">American Foundries vs. Robertson</span> (269 U.S. 372, 381, 70 L ed 317, 46 Sct. 160) <span style="font-weight: bold;">that one who has adopted and used a trademark on his goods does not prevent the adoption and use of the same trademark by others for products which are of a different description</span>.&nbsp; Verily, this Court had the occasion to observe in the 1966 case of <span style="font-style: italic;">George W. Luft Co., Inc. vs. Ngo Guan</span> (18 SCRA 944 [1966]) that no serious objection was posed by the petitioner therein since the applicant utilized the emblem “Tango” for no other product than hair pomade in which petitioner does not deal.<br><br>This brings Us back to the incidental issue raised by petitioner which private respondent sought to belie as regards petitioner's alleged expansion of its business. It may be recalled that petitioner claimed that it has a pending application for registration of the emblem “BRUT 33” for briefs (page 25, Brief for the Petitioner; page 202, Rollo) to impress upon Us the Solomonic wisdom imparted by Justice JBL Reyes in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Sta. Ana vs. Maliwat</span> (24 SCRA 1018 [1968]), <span style="font-weight: bold;">to the effect that dissimilarity of goods will not preclude relief if the junior user's goods are not remote from any other product which the first user would be likely to make or sell</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">vide</span>, at page 1025). Commenting on the former provision of the Trademark Law now embodied substantially under Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 166, as amended, the erudite jurist opined that the law in point “does not require that the articles of manufacture of the previous user and late user of the mark should possess the same descriptive properties or should fall into the same categories as to bar the latter from registering his mark in the principal register.” (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span> at page 1026).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet, it is equally true that as aforesaid, the protective mantle of the Trademark Law extends only to the goods used by the first user as specified in the certificate of registration following the clear message conveyed by Section 20.<br><br>How do We now reconcile the apparent conflict between Section 4(d) which was relied upon by Justice JBL Reyes in the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sta. Ana</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">case and Section 20? It would seem that Section 4(d) does not require that the goods manufactured by the second user be related to the goods produced by the senior user while Section 20 limits the exclusive right of the senior user only to those goods specified in the certificate of registration</span>. But the rule has been laid down that the clause which comes later shall be given paramount significance over an anterior <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso</span> upon the presumption that it expresses the latest and dominant purpose. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Graham Paper Co. vs. National Newspapers Asso</span>.

In many of them, the labels are embellished with sketches of buildings and trees, vineyards or a bunch of grapes while in a few, one or two small roosters facing right or facing each other (atop the EJG crest, surrounded by leaves or ribbons), with additional designs in green, red and yellow colors, appear as minor features thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Directly below or above these sketches is the entire printed name of the founder-owners, “ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO” or just their surname “GALLO,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> which appears in <span style="font-style: italic;">different</span> fonts, sizes, styles and labels, unlike petitioners’ <span style="font-style: italic;">uniform</span> casque-font bold-lettered GALLO mark.<br><br>Moreover, on the labels of Gallo Winery’s wines are printed the words “VINTED AND BOTTLED BY ERNEST &amp; JULIO GALLO, MODESTO, CALIFORNIA.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The many different features like color schemes, art works and other markings of both products drown out the similarity between them – the use of the word “GALLO” — a family surname for the Gallo Winery’s wines and a Spanish word for rooster for petitioners’ cigarettes.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WINES AND CIGARETTES ARE NOT<br>IDENTICAL, SIMILAR, COMPETING OR<br>RELATED GOODS<br><br></span>Confusion of goods is evident where the litigants are actually in competition; but confusion of business may arise between non-competing interests as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Thus, apart from the strict application of Section 20 of the Trademark Law and Article 6bis of the Paris Convention which proscribe trademark infringement not only of goods specified in the certificate of registration but also of identical or similar goods, we have also uniformly recognized and applied the modern concept of “related goods.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Simply stated, when goods are so related that the public may be, or is actually, deceived and misled that they come from the same maker or manufacturer, trademark infringement occurs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Non-competing goods may be those which, though they are not in actual competition, are so related to each other that it can reasonably be assumed that they originate from one manufacturer, in which case, confusion of business can arise out of the use of similar marks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> They may also be those which, being entirely unrelated, cannot be assumed to have a common source; hence, there is no confusion of business, even though similar marks are used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Thus, there is no trademark infringement if the public does not expect the plaintiff to make or sell the same class of goods as those made or sold by the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>In resolving whether goods are related,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> several factors come into play:<blockquote><ol type="A"><li>the business (and its location) to which the goods belong</li><br><li>the class of product to which the goods belong</li><br><li>the product's quality, quantity, or size, including the nature of the package, wrapper or container <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></li><br><li>the nature and cost of the articles<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></li><br><li>the descriptive properties, physical attributes or essential characteristics with reference to their form, composition, texture or quality</li><br><li>the purpose of the goods<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></li><br><li>whether the article is bought for immediate consumption,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> that is, day-to-day household items<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></li><br><li>the fields of manufacture<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup></li><br><li>the conditions under which the article is usually purchased<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> and</li><br><li>the channels of trade through which the goods flow,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> how they are distributed, marketed, displayed and sold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The wisdom of this approach is its recognition that each trademark infringement case presents its own unique set of facts.&nbsp; No single factor is preeminent, nor can the presence or absence of one determine, without analysis of the others, the outcome of an infringement suit. Rather, the court is required to sift the evidence relevant to each of the criteria.&nbsp; This requires that the entire panoply of elements constituting the relevant factual landscape be comprehensively examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> It is a weighing and balancing process.&nbsp; With reference to this ultimate question, and from a balancing of the determinations reached on all of the factors, a conclusion is reached whether the parties have a right to the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>A very important circumstance though is whether there exists a likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers will be misled, or simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> The “purchaser” is not the “completely unwary consumer” but is the “ordinarily intelligent buyer” considering the type of product involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> He is “accustomed to buy, and therefore to some extent familiar with, the goods in question.&nbsp; The test of fraudulent simulation is to be found in the likelihood of the deception of some persons in some measure acquainted with an established design and desirous of purchasing the commodity with which that design has been associated.&nbsp; The test is not found in the deception, or the possibility of deception, of the person who knows nothing about the design which has been counterfeited, and who must be indifferent between that and the other.&nbsp; The simulation, in order to be objectionable, must be such as appears likely to mislead the ordinary intelligent buyer who has a need to supply and is familiar with the article that he seeks to purchase.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Hence, in the adjudication of trademark infringement, we give due regard to the goods’ usual purchaser’s character, attitude, habits, age, training and education. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>Applying these legal precepts to the present case, petitioner’s use of the GALLO cigarette trademark is not likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive the “ordinarily intelligent buyer” of either wines or cigarettes or both as to the identity of the goods, their source and origin, or identity of the business of petitioners and respondents.<br><br>Obviously, wines and cigarettes are not identical or competing products.

Indeed, it would be a grave abuse of discretion to treat wines and cigarettes as similar or related products likely to cause confusion just because they are pleasure-giving, relaxing or potentially harmful. Such reasoning makes no sense.<br><br>Second, it is common knowledge that supermarkets sell an infinite variety of wholly unrelated products and the goods here involved, wines and cigarettes, have nothing whatsoever in common with respect to their essential characteristics, quality, quantity, size, including the nature of their packages, wrappers or containers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the U.S. patent office and courts have consistently held that the mere fact that goods are sold in one store under the same roof does not automatically mean that buyers are likely to be confused as to the goods’ respective sources, connections or sponsorships.&nbsp; The fact that different products are available in the same store is an insufficient standard, in and of itself, to warrant a finding of likelihood of confusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>In this regard, we adopted the Director of Patents’ finding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Refining Co., Inc. vs. Ng Sam and the Director of Patents</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><blockquote>In his decision, the Director of Patents enumerated the factors that set respondent’s products apart from the goods of petitioner.

They pertain to unrelated fields of manufacture, might be distributed and marketed under dissimilar conditions, and are displayed separately even though they frequently may be sold through the same retail food establishments</span>. Opposer’s products are ordinary day-to-day household items whereas ham is not necessarily so. Thus, the goods of the parties are not of a character which purchasers would likely attribute to a common origin.</blockquote>The observations and conclusion of the Director of Patents are correct. The particular goods of the parties are so unrelated that consumers, would not, in any probability mistake one as the source of origin of the product of the other. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>The same is true in the present case. Wines and cigarettes are non-competing and are totally unrelated products not likely to cause confusion <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-à-vis</span> the goods or the business of the petitioners and respondents.<br><br>Wines are bottled and consumed by drinking while cigarettes are packed in cartons or packages and smoked.&nbsp; There is a whale of a difference between their descriptive properties, physical attributes or essential characteristics like form, composition, texture and quality.<br><br>GALLO cigarettes are inexpensive items while GALLO wines are not. GALLO wines are patronized by middle-to-high-income earners while GALLO cigarettes appeal only to simple folks like farmers, fishermen, laborers and other low-income workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Indeed, the big price difference of these two products is an important factor in proving that they are in fact unrelated and that they travel in different channels of trade.&nbsp; There is a distinct price segmentation based on vastly different social classes of purchasers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>GALLO cigarettes and GALLO wines are not sold through the same channels of trade.&nbsp; GALLO cigarettes are Philippine-made and petitioners neither claim nor pass off their goods as imported or emanating from Gallo Winery.
