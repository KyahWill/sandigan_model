				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated December 17, 1997 of the Regional Trial Court of Tacloban City, Branch 16, in Criminal Case No. Bn-92-7-2924, finding appellant Ricky Quimzon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> guilty of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>In an Information dated July 28, 1992, appellant and three other persons, namely Salvacion Lacsarom, Canoto Cabero<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Edgardo Detona<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> were charged with the crime of murder allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 7<sup>th</sup> day of March, 1992, in the Municipality of Burauen, Province of Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and helping one another with treachery and abuse of superior strength, with intent to kill, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault, strike, stab and wound one Marlo Casiong with short bolos locally known as ‘pisao’ which accused provided themselves for the purpose, thereby hitting and inflicting upon the said Marlo Casiong with fatal wounds on the different parts of his body which caused his death shortly thereafter.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant “surrendered” to the police authorities on August 18, 1994<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> while his other co-accused remain at-large. When arraigned on September 28, 1994, appellant, with the assistance of counsel, entered a plea of not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution established the following facts:<br><br>On the night of March 7, 1992, victim Marlo Casiong, his sister Emolyn Casiong, and one Rommel Redoña were at the social hall of Burauen, Leyte attending a benefit dance. Around 11:30 of the same evening, while dancing with one Salvacion Lacsarom, Marlo accidentally bumped his cousin, herein appellant Ricky Quimzon. Emolyn and Rommel, who were then dancing with each other and were about one meter away from Marlo and Salvacion, witnessed the incident. Thereafter, while the dance continued, Salvacion held Marlo’s hand and invited him to go outside the dance hall as she had something important to tell him. Thereupon, Marlo asked Emolyn to stay put because he was coming back. Feeling apprehensions about it, Emolyn and Rommel followed Salvacion and Marlo as they went out of the dance hall. Emolyn noticed that Canoto Cabero, Edgardo Detona and appellant Ricky also went out of the hall in a hurried manner thereby overtaking them (Emolyn and Rommel). Outside the social hall, Emolyn heard Salvacion say “ito na” then saw her push Marlo towards the group of Canoto, Edgardo and Ricky. Canoto then grabbed Marlo by the wrist and repeatedly stabbed him with a short bolo locally known as <i>pisao</i>. Edgardo followed suit by stabbing Marlo twice at the back. Despite being wounded, Marlo was able to get away from Canoto and Edgardo and walked fast towards the nearby health center. Marlo was about to reach the gate of the health center when Ricky, who was behind Marlo, held the latter’s hands. Marlo tried to free himself from the clutches of Ricky but in the course of his struggle he fell down. Thereupon, Ricky rode on the back of Marlo and repeatedly stabbed him on his back. Emolyn and Rommel shouted for help prompting an unidentified person to throw stones and utter, “that is enough”. Thereafter, Canoto, Edgardo and Ricky fled. With the help of some persons, Emolyn brought Marlo to the Burauen General Hospital but Marlo died before reaching the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In denying criminal liability, appellant interposed the defense of alibi. He claims that he does not know Salvacion Lacsarom, Canoto Cabero and Edgardo Detona. He denies that he stabbed Marlo Casiong. Appellant testified, as follows: He could not have been at the scene of the crime when the incident happened as he was in Barangay Patag attending another benefit dance. He arrived at Barangay Patag around 7 o’clock in the evening of March 7, 1992 and stayed there until 7 o’clock of the following morning. Barangay Patag is 18 kilometers away from the poblacion of Burauen where Marlo was killed and can only be reached by riding a horse or a carabao or by hiking for five hours. He only came to know of the death of Marlo when he went to the poblacion of Burauen. He was included as one of the accused because he refused to testify in favor of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Alfredo Rellesiva, then Barangay Chairman of Barangay Patag, Burauen, Leyte; and Mauro Lobriquinto, then second Barangay Councilor of Barangay Candag-on, corroborated appellant’s alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After trial, the court a quo rendered the assailed decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the evidence of the prosecution    having proven the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the Court hereby renders the conviction of the accused Ricky Quimzon of the crime of Murder punished under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The crime currently is punishable by RA 7659 classifying Murder as heinous crime to which the death penalty is to be imposed.<br><br>However, the crime was committed on March 7, 1992 and the effectivity of RA 7659 is January 1994. This act therefore cannot apply in the case at bench.<br><br>Two qualifying circumstances are alleged in the Information; namely, treachery and abuse of superior strength. However, the latter circumstance is absorbed by the former.<br><br>There is no other aggravating nor mitigating circumstance. The penalty therefore to be applied is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> being the medium of the penalty from minimum which is the maximum of reclusion temporal to death.<br><br>The accused is therefore sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of Reclusion Perpetua.<br><br>On the civil aspect, the defense admitted the expenses incurred for the wake and burial of the victim and neither did he controvert the moral damages suffered by the mother of the victim. The accused is ordered to pay the sum of P53,000.00 as actual expenses for the wake and burial, and P75,000.00 as moral damages payable to the mother of the victim Erlinda Casiong.<br><br>The Philippine National Police and the NBI are urged to exert efforts to bring the at large co-accused to justice for their complicity in the crime. Furnish them a copy. Meanwhile, until they are placed under the custody of the law, archived the case.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present petition with the following Assignment of Errors.<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>IT IS SUBMITTED BY THE APPELLANT THAT THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF BURAUEN, LEYTE ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER WITHOUT A CORPUS DELICTI.<br><center><br>II<br></center><br>IT IS SUBMITTED BY THE APPELLANT THAT THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF BURAUEN, LEYTE ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF EMOLYN CASIONG THE LONE PROSECUTION EYE WITNESS, LEADING TO THE CONVICTION OF APPELLANT ON THE CRIME CHARGED IN THE ABOVE ENTITLED CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>In support of his first assigned error, appellant contends that the testimony of prosecution witness Dr. Adelaida Asperin on the report of the autopsy conducted on the body of the victim Marlo Casiong was designed to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i>. Appellant, however, claims that Dr. Asperin is incompetent to testify, as she was not the one who personally examined the body. Instead, it was a certain Dr. Amparo Villanueva who conducted the autopsy on the body of Marlo Casiong. Appellant asserts that the trial court should have regarded the testimony of Dr. Asperin as inadmissible for being hearsay; and, in the absence of such testimony, the prosecution would not have been able to prove the corpus    delicti.<br><br>A review of the oral and documentary evidence presented before the trial court reveals that it was indeed Dr. Amparo Villanueva, not Dr. Adelaida Asperin, who conducted the autopsy taken on the body of Marlo Casiong. As the attending physician, Dr. Villanueva was the one who signed the autopsy report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In fact, Dr. Asperin herself admitted in her testimony that she never saw the victim, Marlo Casiong, and that it was Dr. Villanueva who conducted the autopsy and was the one who prepared the autopsy report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> However, Dr. Villanueva died before the prosecution was able to present her as witness.<br><br>Nonetheless, even if Dr. Asperin is an incompetent witness as to the autopsy report and her testimony could not have probative value for being hearsay, we still find that the prosecution was able to sufficiently establish by competent evidence the <i>corpus delicti</i> in the instant case.<br><br><i>Corpus delicti</i> is defined as the body, foundation or substance upon which a crime has been committed, e.g. the corpse of a murdered man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It refers to the fact that a crime has been actually committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Corpus delicti</i> does not refer to the autopsy report evidencing the nature of the wounds sustained by the victim nor the testimony of the physician who conducted the autopsy or medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It is made up of two elements: (a) that a certain result has been proved, for example, a man has died and (b) that some person is criminally responsible for the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Proof of <i>corpus delicti</i> is indispensable in prosecutions for felonies and offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While the autopsy report of a medico legal expert in cases of murder or homicide is preferably accepted to show the extent of the injuries suffered by the victim, it is not the only competent evidence to prove the injuries and the fact of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It may be proved by the testimonies of credible witnesses. Even a single witness’ uncorroborated testimony, if credible, may suffice to prove it and warrant a conviction therefor. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing jurisprudence, it is clear that the testimony of Dr. Asperin is not indispensable in proving the <i>corpus delicti</i>. Even without her testimony, the prosecution was still be able to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> by establishing the fact that the victim died and that such death occurred after he was stabbed by appellant and his co-accused. These facts were established by the testimony of prosecution witness Emolyn Casiong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The question that remains, therefore, is whether the trial court erred in giving credence to Emolyn’s testimony over and above the testimonies of the defense witnesses.<br><br>In his second assigned error, appellant questions Emolyn’s credibility as a witness by pointing out that Emolyn did not execute an affidavit regarding the events that she allegedly witnessed on March 7, 1992; that she did not present herself as a witness during the preliminary investigation conducted by the Municipal Trial Court of Burauen, and that she only appeared as a witness when the case was already being tried before the trial court. Appellant posits that Emolyn’s delay, which consisted in her failure to execute an affidavit and her belated appearance as a witness, puts the trustworthiness of her testimony in serious doubt.<br><br>We are not persuaded by appellant’s arguments.<br><br>When the credibility of witnesses is in issue, appellatte courts generally defer to the findings of the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It is doctrinally settled that the assessment of the credibility of a witness is a function that is best discharged by the trial judge whose conclusion thereon is accorded much weight and respect that will not be disturbed on appeal unless a material or substantial fact has been overlooked or misappreciated which if properly taken into account could alter the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>After going over the records of the case, we find no compelling reason to disturb the findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of Emolyn. Contrary to appellant’s assertion, we find that she took no delay in relating the killing of her brother to the police authorities. Emolyn testified that shortly after the killing of her brother, she submitted herself for investigation before the police authorities of Burauen, Leyte. However, the chief of police informed her that she could not execute an affidavit because she is a sister of the victim, but if the court would need her, then she can execute an affidavit. Unschooled on the rules on evidence, it is but natural for Emolyn to have readily accepted the explanation of the chief of police. In her direct examination, she testified, thus:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td width="15%"><div

Appellant further attacks the veracity of Emolyn’s testimony by calling our attention to some purported inconsistencies and improbabilities in her account of the events that took place prior to and during the stabbing of Marlo. Appellant contends: It could not have been possible for Emolyn to overhear the conversation that took place between Salvacion and Marlo while they were dancing because the music was loud, the beat was fast and furious, and Emolyn was engrossed in her dancing. It was impossible for Emolyn to hear Edgardo Detona, Canoto Cabero and appellant ask permission from their respective dancing partners before going out of the dance hall because Emolyn went out of the dance hall ahead of them. Emolyn failed to accurately recall the sequence of events that led to the stabbing of Marlo. She could not have witnessed Marlo’s stabbing as she admitted that it was dark where the incident took place. We are not convinced by appellant’s contentions. First, it is not improbable for Emolyn to overhear the conversation between Salvacion and Marlo while they were dancing because she (Emolyn) testified that she was just one meter away from Salvacion and Marlo at that time. The fact that they were dancing, that the music is loud and that there is another couple between them and her does not discount the possibility that she could have heard them talking. Given the above circumstances, it is expected of Salvacion and Marlo to have raised their voices in order to hear each other, which then enabled Emolyn to hear their conversation. Second, while Emolyn admitted that she and Rommel started to go out of the dance hall ahead of Edgardo, Canoto and appellant, she sufficiently explained that she was able to hear the three men talk to their respective partners because she was still near them when they asked permission from their partners.

The judge <i>a quo</i> was in a better position to pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses, having personally heard them when they testified and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Appellant interposes the defense of alibi. However, alibi, like denial, is an inherently weak defense as it is easy to concoct and difficult to prove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> While appellant’s testimony is corroborated by defense witness Rellesiva and Lobriquito, the trial court correctly gave more probative weight to the lone testimony of prosecution witness Emolyn who positively identified appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.<br><br>Appellant’s defense of alibi fails in the face of Emolyn’s positive identification of him as one of her brother’s killers. Positive identification destroys the defense of alibi and renders it impotent, especially where such identification is credible and categorical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The defense of denial is unavailing when placed astride the undisputed fact that there is positive identification of the felon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>We affirm the trial court’s finding that there was treachery in the killing of Marlo. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on an unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any real chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring its commission with no risk to the aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In the present case, Marlo accepted Salvacion’s invitation for them to go outside the dance hall on the impression that the latter has something important to tell him. He has no inkling of any impending danger on his life as he even told his sister, Emolyn, to wait for him because he will be coming back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Outside the dance hall, as soon as Salvacion pushed Marlo towards them, Canoto and Edgardo immediately attacked him without warning, inflicting wounds on the front and back portions of his body with the use of bolos. Although this initial assault on Marlo was frontal it may still be considered treacherous because the attack was sudden and unprovoked. There is no evidence showing that the attack was preceded by any exchange of words or any untoward incident between the assailants and Marlo, sufficient to warn Marlo of the impending attack on him. The mode of execution was in such a manner that Marlo was left with no opportunity to repel the attack or avoid it. Moreover, he was unarmed while all three assailants were carrying deadly weapons. The treachery continued when appellant held the hands of Marlo as the latter was running away from the initial stabbings of Canoto and Edgardo, rode on Marlo’s back when the latter fell down and repeatedly stabbed Marlo who had already been rendered weak by the multiple stab wounds inflicted by Edgardo and Canoto. Appellant attacked Marlo from behind and repeatedly stabbed Marlo when he was already in a defenseless position.<br><br>In any criminal prosecution, the only requisite is that the prosecution proves the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof that, excluding the possibility of error, produces absolute certainty. Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Hence, we uphold the trial court’s judgment declaring appellant guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt. The attendant circumstance of treachery qualified the killing to murder as defined under paragraph 1, Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Since treachery attended the killing, abuse of superior strength alleged in the Information is absorbed by said circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Aside from abuse of superior strength, no other aggravating circumstance was alleged and proved by the prosecution.<br><br>In a criminal case, an appeal throws open the entire case wide open for review, and the appellate court can correct errors, though unassigned, that may be found in the appealed judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>It appears in the Commitment Order, dated August 14, 1994, issued by the Municipal Trial Judge of the Municipal Trial Court of Burauen, Leyte, that appellant “voluntarily surrendered to SPO1 Josefino Agustin of PNP Burauen, Leyte on August 18, 1994”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> An examination of the records reveals that it can not be considered as a mitigating circumstance. For the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to be appreciated, the accused must satisfactorily comply with three requisites: (1) he has not been actually arrested; (2) he surrendered himself to a person in authority or the latter’s agent; and (3) the surrender is voluntary. There must be a showing of spontaneity and an intent to surrender unconditionally to the authorities, either because the accused acknowledges his guilt or he wishes to spare them the trouble and expense concomitant to his capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The “surrender” of appellant was far from being spontaneous and unconditional. The warrant of arrest is dated June 17, 1992 and all the accused, including appellant, remained at-large, which prompted the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Palo, Leyte to archive the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It took appellant two years before he finally “surrendered” to the police. In between said period, appellant, through counsel, filed a Motion to Fix Bail Bond<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> without surrendering his person to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Records do not reveal that the motion had been acted upon by the trial court. This act of appellant may be considered as a condition set by him before he surrenders to proper authorities, thus preventing his subsequent act of surrendering from being considered as a mitigating circumstance.<br><br>Moreover, we noted in the Motion to Fix Bail Bond, filed on July 9, 1992, that counsel for appellant alleged that appellant “is barely 15 years of age”. When appellant was called to the witness stand on August 2, 1996, or four years thereafter, appellant asserted that he was 21 years old. The stabbing incident took place on March 7, 1992, thus placing appellant to be 17 years old, a minor, when he committed the crime. The records do not show that the prosecution refuted appellant’s minority; and absent any evidence to the contrary, the trial court should have applied in favor of appellant the benefits under Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><br>Art. 68. <i>Penalty to be imposed upon a person under eighteen years of age</i>. –<br><br> . . .<br><ol start="2"><br><li>Upon a person over fifteen and under eighteen years of age the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall be imposed, but always in the proper period. (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the perpetrator of the crime of Murder shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Applying the express provision of the aforequoted Article 68 and pursuant to Article 61, paragraph 2, of the same Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>Art. 61. <i>Rules of graduating penalties</i>. - . . .<br><ol type="1"><li> When the penalty prescribed for the felony is single and indivisible, the penalty next lower in degree shall be that immediately following that indivisible penalty in the respective graduated scale prescribed in Article 71 of this Code.<div style="text-align: center;"><br>. . .<br></div></li></ol></blockquote>the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> or 12 years and 1 day to 20 years.<br><br>Considering the actual penalty to be imposed upon appellant, as prescribed by law, is not <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or death, appellant is entitled to the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Thus, from the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, one degree lower is <i>prision mayor</i> or 6 years and 1 day to 12 years from which will be drawn the MINIMUM period of the indeterminate sentence; while pursuant to paragraph 2, Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code, in the absence of any modifying circumstance, the penalty prescribed by law should be imposed in its medium period, or anywhere between 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months, as the MAXIMUM period of the indeterminate sentence.<br><br>We now come to the civil liability of appellant.<br><br>As to actual damages, we find that the evidence presented by the prosecution do not adequately provide a concrete basis for the amount of P53,000.00 awarded by the trial court to the victim’s mother, Erlinda Casiong. She testified that her family incurred expenses amounting to P50,206.00, during the wake and burial of her son. As proof, she presented seven official receipts amounting to P4,490.00 only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Other evidence consisting of small pieces of paper which were properly identified by Erlinda as having been signed by the persons from whom she bought the merchandise that were used or consumed during Marlo’s wake and burial, amounting to P4,020.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> may be considered competent evidence and admitted under Section 22, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, the prosecution was able to prove only a total of P8,510.00.  The other receipts presented were not properly identified and therefore inadmissible under the Rules of Court.<br><br>Nonetheless, in our recent rulings, we have held that in cases where the heirs of the victim failed to prove their claim for actual damages, but have shown that they have suffered pecuniary loss by reason of the death of the victim, an award of P25,000.00 by way of temperate damages is justified in lieu of an award of actual or compensatory damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In <i>People vs. Villanueva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we held that in cases where actual damages was proven by receipts during the trial but said damages amounted to less than P25,000.00, as in the present case, the award of temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 is justified in lieu of said actual damages. The rationale for such an award of temperate damages is that it would be anomalous and unfair for the heirs of the victim, who by presenting receipts, tried and succeeded in proving actual damages but in an amount less than P25,000.00, to be placed in a worse situation than those who might not have presented any receipts at all but would be entitled to P25,000.00 for temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Erlinda Casiong testified that her son was single when he died;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that she felt sad when her son was killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> We find her testimony sufficient to sustain the trial court’s award of moral damages but we reduce the amount of P75,000.00 to P50,000.00 in line with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Erlinda Casiong further testified that her son was working as a helper in a passenger bus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The indemnification for loss of earning capacity partakes of the nature of actual damages which must be duly proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In the absence of competent evidence to prove how much the victim was earning, the heirs of the victim are not entitled thereto.<br><br>The trial court did not award civil indemnity. In consonance with prevailing jurisprudence, we award the amount of P50,000.00 to the heirs of Marlo Casiong as civil indemnity for his death. The amount is awarded without need of proof other than appellant’s commission of the crime which resulted in the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tacloban City (Branch 15) is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. Appellant Ricky Quimzon is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and after applying The Indeterminate Sentence Law, and there being no modifying circumstance, he is sentenced to suffer imprisonment, from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as MINIMUM up to fourteen (14) years and ten (10) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as MAXIMUM. He is ordered to pay Erlinda Casiong, the mother of the deceased Marlo Casiong, the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for the victim’s death; P25,000.00 as temperate damages; and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Quisumbing, Callejo, Sr.</i>, and <i>Tinga, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Leocadio H.
