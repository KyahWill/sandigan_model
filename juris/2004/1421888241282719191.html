				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the 2001 local elections in Butig, Lanao del Sur, two Municipal Boards of Canvassers (“MBC”), with varying members participating, proclaimed different sets of municipal candidates as winners. The Commission on Elections nullified the conflicting proclamations of the two boards and ordered the constitution of a new MBC.<p></p><p>The COMELEC action is before this Court through two consolidated petitions. The first petition, docketed as G.R. No. 157007, is a <em>Petition for Certiorari with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Rasmia Romato Salic (“Salic”), a candidate for municipal mayor of Butig. The second petition, docketed as G.R. No. 157019, is likewise a <em>Petition for Certiorari</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed by Pauli Dimnatang Ditual A.B.M. (“Ditual”), a candidate for municipal vice-mayor of the same town. Both petitions seek to set aside the <em>Resolution</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the COMELEC Second Division (“Second Division”)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 5 July 2002, which annulled the proclamations of Salic and Ditual, as well as the <em>Resolution</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the COMELEC <em>en banc</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> affirming the Second Division’s Resolution.</p><p>The mayorship of Butig was contested by, among others, Salic and private respondent Dimnatang L. Pansar (“Pansar”), while the candidates for vice-mayor included Ditual and private respondent Monabantog Kiram (“Kiram”). Pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 4307,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the counting and canvassing of votes cast in Butig were, like those in other municipalities of the province, transferred to the Provincial Capitol Complex in Marawi City.</p><p>As mandated by law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the canvass of municipal election returns was conducted by the MBC of Butig. However, the proper composition of the board is a matter of controversy. The parties do not contest the designation of Musa Macabayao (“Macabayao”) and Mesug Palawan (“Palawan”) as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the board, respectively. The dispute refers to who really was the lawful Third Member of the board. The petitioners claim that Catambac Mimbantas (“Mimbantas”) legally served as the Third Member, while private respondents insist that it was Ismael Magarang<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (“Magarang”) instead.</p><p>On 10 June 2001, Salic was proclaimed by the MBC as the duly-elected mayor of Butig, in a <em>Certificate of Canvass and Proclamation</em> (“COC”) signed by Chairman Macabayao and Mimbantas as Third Member. The Macabayao-Mimbantas canvassing board also proclaimed Ditual as vice-mayor, and a set of duly-elected councilors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The COC signed by Macabayao and Mimbantas was submitted to the Election Records and Statistics Division (“ERSD”) of the COMELEC on 13 June 2001 by Macabayao, in his purported capacity as Acting Election Officer of Butig.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This COC was based on the returns from only thirty-six (36) out of the forty (40) precincts in Butig. The Macabayao-Mimbantas board, on Salic’s motion, excluded the returns from the other four (4) precincts. The precincts and the grounds for the disallowance of the returns therefrom, according to the rulings of the Macabayao-Mimbantas MBC, are as follows:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p><em>Precinct No. 1A/2A</em> — Election return is false and obviously manufactured, the return being accomplished by a biased Board of Election Inspectors as shown by the evidence and as it appears on said return, whose pages 1 and 2 for Local Positions have the serial number of 68090057, pages 3 and 4 have Serial Number 68090035, and page 5 with Serial Number 68090036.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>&nbsp; <p><em>Precinct No. 7A/8A</em> — Election return is false and obviously manufactured, the return being accomplished by a biased Board of Election Inspectors as shown by the evidence and as it appears on said return, whose page 1 for Local Positions have the serial number of 68090033, pages 2 and 3 have Serial Number 68090036, and page 4 with Serial Number 68090014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p>&nbsp; <p><em>Precinct No. 9A/10A</em> — Election return is false and obviously manufactured, the return being accomplished by a biased Board of Election Inspectors as shown by the evidence and as it appears on said return, whose page 1 for Local Positions have the serial number of 68090026, pages 2 and 3 and 4 have Serial Number 68090032.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>&nbsp; <p><em>Precinct No. 11A/12A</em> — Election return is false, and “obviously manufactured return being accomplished by a biased Board of Election Inspectors on the basis of ballots which are not legible being all soaked in and marred by ink, and as show (sic) also by the evidence on records and as it appears on the said returns.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p></blockquote><p>According to Pansar, however, the Macabayao-Mimbantas board acted without authority. He claims that at the start of the municipal canvass on 7 June 2001, all three - Macabayao, Palawan and Magarang — sat and performed their duties as members of the board .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> On 10 June 2001, after canvassing all the forty (40) election returns, Macabayao declared a recess and announced the reconvening of the board on the following day. As he left, Macabayao took with him all the election paraphernalia needed to proclaim the winners. But he did not show up on the following day when the board met to reconvene. Upon the instruction of Datusalangit Macalaba, PES in-charge, Palawan and Magarang continued the canvass proceedings.</p><p> On 17 June 2001, the Palawan-Magarang board issued a second COC proclaiming Pansar as the elected mayor and a set of municipal councilors as winners different from those proclaimed by the Mambuyao-Mimbantas board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Inexplicably, the Palawan-Macarang board did not proclaim the winner for the position of vice-mayor. The Palawan-Macarang COC was based on the canvass of the returns from all forty (40) precincts, including the four (4) returns excluded by the Mambuyao-Mimbantas board. The Palawan-Macarang COC was transmitted to the COMELEC on the same day it was issued, with the transmittal letter signed by both Palawan and Magarang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p>On 25 June 2001, Salic filed with the COMELEC a <em>Petition</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> docketed as SPC No. 01-337, praying that the Palawan-Magarang COC be stricken from the records for being void <em>ab initio</em>. Salic alleged, among others, that Mimbantas and not Magarang was the legitimate Third Member and that the signature of Palawan in the 17 June 2001 COC was forged.</p><p>To ascertain the true facts, the COMELEC <em>en banc</em>, issued Resolution No. 01-1029 on 12 July 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> constituting an <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> “to evaluate/study and to submit comment/recommendation” relative to the election. Thereafter, the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee issued a subpoena directing “all parties concerned” to submit their respective position papers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The Committee also received several pertinent documents and memoranda which were submitted to the COMELEC Law Department and the COMELEC ERSD pursuant to the <em>Resolution</em>. It conducted a hearing which only Magarang and Mimbantas attended together with their respective counsels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On 1 October 2001, the Committee submitted its findings to the COMELEC, and the matter was referred to the Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>In the meantime, vice-mayoral candidate Kiram filed a <em>Petition</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> with the COMELEC, docketed as SPC No. 01-273, against Ditual, the MBC and the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI), but it was dismissed by the Second Division in an <em>Order</em> dated 20 September 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The Second Division noted that what Kiram had filed was a pre-proclamation controversy and it was mooted by the proclamation of Ditual as vice-mayor. Undaunted, Kiram filed instead on 15 February 2002 a<em> Motion for Leave to Intervene and/or to Admit Petition in Intervention</em> (with attached <em>Petition in Intervention</em>) in SPC No. 01-337.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He sought the reconvening of the MBC to tabulate the results from all precincts, including the returns from the four (4) controverted precincts, and thereafter proclaim the winning candidate for vice-mayor.</p><p>On 5 July 2002, the Second Division promulgated the assailed <em>Resolution</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>, which declared as a “<em>sham</em>” the Macabayao-Mimbantas COC, thus nullifying the proclamations of Salic, Ditual and the eight (8) councilors who were proclaimed therein. At the same time, the Second Division ordered the exclusion of the returns from three (3) clustered precincts, namely Precincts No. 1A/2A, 7A/8A, and 9A/10A in the canvass of the election results for the positions of mayor and vice-mayor, thereby nullifying and declaring illegal the Palawan-Magarang board’s proclamation of Pansar as mayor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The Second Division gave credence to the findings of the <em>Ad Hoc </em>Committee which declared, among others, that it was Magarang, not Mimbantas, who was the duly-designated Third Member of the MBC. Accordingly, only the Palawan-Magarang board had the authority to act as the authorized MBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p>The Second Division reversed the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee’s recommendation and voided the Palawan-Magarang board’s proclamation of Pansar as mayor. It cited as an uncontested fact that the election returns from Precincts No. 1A/2A, 7A/8A, and 9A/10A had varying serial numbers on the pages of the set of returns for each precinct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Following Section 212 of the Omnibus Election Code, the Second Division ruled that the duly authorized MBC should have automatically excluded the returns from the precincts in the absence of a COMELEC order to the country. The COMELEC did not issue any such countervailing order since there was no explanation for the variance of the serial numbers on the pages of the returns supplied by the municipal treasurer who was Palawan himself. The MBC thus did not have any discretion but to exclude from canvass the returns with varying serial numbers.</p><p>Accordingly, the Second Division ordered that a new MBC composed of three COMELEC lawyers be constituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It directed the new MBC to complete the Butig canvass by resorting to and canvassing the ballot box copies of the returns from Precincts No. 1A/2A, 7A/8A, and 9A/10A, satisfying itself of the integrity of the ballot boxes prior to opening them. Should the ballot box copies of the returns that emerged be likewise irregular for having varying serial numbers or they are otherwise missing, the Second Division further directed the new MBC to conduct a recount of the votes cast for mayor and vice-mayor in the controverted precincts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p>Salic filed a <em>Motion for Reconsideration</em> of the Second Division’s <em>Resolution</em> but the COMELEC <em>en banc</em> denied it per its <em>Resolution</em> of 6 February 2003, adopting in toto the dispositive portion of the Second Division’s <em>Resolution</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Undaunted, Salic filed the present petition with this Court.</p><p>On the other hand, Ditual also felt aggrieved by the Second Division <em>Resolution </em>notwithstanding her claim that she was not a party to S.P. No. 01-273. But according to the records, she filed with the COMELEC the following: (a) on 5 July 2002, a <em>Motion with Leave of Court to Admit Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated July 5 2002</em>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (b) on 23 July 2002, a <em>Motion with Leave of Court to Admit Answer on the Petition for Intervention Filed by Monabantog D. Kiram</em>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and (c) on 1 October 2002, a <em>Motion to Exclude Vice Mayor Pauli Ditual from the Effects of the July 5, 2002 Resolution</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Only in the last mentioned motion did she argue that jurisdiction was not acquired over her person, stressing she was not summoned to answer the petition-in-intervention filed by Kiram.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the COMELEC <em>en banc affirmed in toto</em> the Second Division <em>Resolution</em> on 6 February 2003, merely noting therein the various pleadings filed by Ditual. Hence, she filed her own <em>Petition for Certiorari</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> with this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 157019. On 10 June 2003, the Court resolved to consolidate the separate petitions filed by Salic and Ditual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Both Salic and Ditual also prayed in their respective petitions for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the COMELEC from enforcing its assailed resolutions. The Court has chosen not to issue a TRO.</p><p>All the respondents in the consolidated cases, except for Palawan, filed their respective comments on the petitions. The last pleading was filed on 14 August 2003. Given the issues, the disposal of the petitions entailed a close examination of the records, more particularly the originals or certified photocopies of relevant documents such as the contested election returns and the certificates of canvass. However, the records were not promptly transmitted to the Court, and the delay prompted the Court to issue a <em>Resolution</em> dated 13 January 2004, directing the COMELEC to transmit the complete records of SPC No. 01-337 within ten (10) days from receipt. The voluminous records, consisting of sixteen (16) folders which in turn contain the total of two thousand four hundred sixty-seven (2,467) pages, were finally transmitted to the Court on 26 January 2004. The transmitted records include mere photocopies of the questioned election returns. The transmittal of the records was calendared in the Court’s agenda of 10 February 2004.</p><p>The issue presented by Salic’s petition is whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in annulling Salic’s proclamation as mayor, in ordering the recount of ballots in the three (3) excluded precincts, and in failing to exclude the returns from Precincts No. 11A/12A. On the other hand, Ditual’s petition asserts that the COMELEC had no jurisdiction to annul her proclamation as vice-mayor, as she had never been served summons by the poll body.</p><p>We shall first resolve Salic’s petition. To determine who were the legitimate members of the MBC, we refer to Republic Act No. 6646.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Section 20 thereof delineates the qualifications of the members of the municipal board of canvassers, to wit:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>Sec. 20. <strong>Board of Canvassers</strong>. — There shall be a board of canvassers for each province, city and municipality as follows:</p>&nbsp; <p>(c) Municipal Board of Canvassers. — The municipal board of canvassers shall be composed of the election registrar or a representative of the Commission, as chairman, the municipal treasurer, as vice-chairman, and the most senior district school supervisor <strong><em>or in his absence a principal of the school district or the elementary school,</em></strong> as members. (emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>It is undisputed that the most senior district school supervisor, DECS District Head Babaino P. Macadato, had inhibited himself from serving on the MBC by reason of his relationship to some local candidates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, the question arose as to whom Macadato had designated in his stead, Mimbantas or Magarang? The law explicitly prescribes the minimum qualifications of who may sit as the substitute Third Member of the MBC in the absence of the most senior school district supervisor. The substitute must be a principal of the school district or the elementary school. The assailed <em>Resolution</em> made a factual finding that Mimbantas was not a principal, but an ordinary elementary public school teacher.</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>As admitted by Mimbantas herself in her testimony before the <em>Ad Hoc </em>Committee, she is not a principal of the school district or the elementary school but an Elementary Public School Teacher I. Thus, her designation by the District In-Charge to the Butig MBC, though unrebutted, is null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Salic does not refute the finding and there is no compelling reason for the Court to overturn it. Clearly then, Mimbantas was not qualified to sit on the MBC, even assuming she was designated by the DECS District-In-Charge. The personality of the designating authority is not even relevant in the case of Mimbantas, as she does not possess the minimum qualifications as defined by law. If the law prescribes qualifications for appointment to a public office, the appointee must possess such statutory qualifications to make the appointment valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p>Consequently, the Macabayao-Mimbintas COC proclaiming Salic as mayor is void. The only valid signature thereon is that of Chairman Macabayao’s, but he alone cannot bind or speak for the entire MBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p>On the other hand, the COMELEC found that Magarang was the Acting Principal of Nanagun National High School, a position which made him qualified under the law to sit in the MBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Further, as found by the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee, a memorandum from Macadato dated 9 May 2001 explicitly directed Magarang to sit in the MBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Again, Salic does not dispute Magarang’s appointment. She claims though that Magarang had signed an <em>Indorsement</em> dated 7 May 2001 wherein he disqualified himself from sitting in the MBC since his cousins were candidates for the municipal council.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Magarang denied ever having signed such indorsement, claiming his signature therein was forged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Neither the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee nor the COMELEC commented on this particular allegation. But suffice it to note that they separately concluded that Magarang was qualified to sit in the MBC, as he indeed in fact performed the duties of a member of the MBC. Thus, there is dearth of factual basis to support the petitioners’ submission that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that Magarang was the lawful MBC Third Member.</p><p>The Court likewise cannot ignore the submission of the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee imputing serious irregularities on the part of the Macabayao-Mimbantas board. The Committee made the following observations on the Statement of Votes (SOV), thus:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>The attention of the Honorable Commission <em>En Banc</em> is respectfully invited to the Statement of Votes (SOV) signed and submitted by E.O. Musa Macabayao and Catambac Mimbantas particularly to the alleged winning candidates for Sangguniang Bayan members, namely: Palala Saman B., Coasain Senaida M., Hasim Gubar, Anawal Mustapha, and Datu Kunung Namraida and which were included in the Certificate of Canvass and Proclamation of Rasmia Romato Salic as they all contained erasures indicative of tampering to make it appear that they won in the election but candidates Canacan Cali Casimun Caseron and Panolong Taha D., who garnered votes of 670 and 613, respectively, and whose votes are higher than candidates Hashim Gubar, Anawal Mustapha and Datu Kunug Namraida, whose votes are 583, 544 and 535 respectively, were not included in the Certificate of Canvass and Proclamation of the Winning Candidates in the COC of Rasmia Romato Salic. It is crystal clear as the water that E.O. Musa Macabayao and Catambac Mimbantas tampered the Statement of Votes (SOV) which should be disregarded by the Honorable Commission and should be treated as a mere scrap of paper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The Court examined the SOV adverted to and the observations of the Committee are indeed borne out by the document, at it contains several superimpositions and erasures that taint the veracity of the document.</p><p>The COMELEC, however, nullified the proclamation of Pansar as mayor on the ground that the Palawan-Magarang COC failed to exclude the election returns from Precincts No. 1A/2A, 7A/8A, and 9A/10A. The individual pages of the set of returns for each of the precincts contain varying serial numbers. For that reason, the COMELEC ruled that they should have not been canvassed as mandated by Section 212 of the Election Code. Accordingly, the poll body ordered the constitution of a new MBC, composed of COMELEC lawyers, as well as the use of the ballot box copies of the returns in the canvass by the new board.</p><p>Salic agrees with the COMELEC on the exclusion of the returns from Precincts No. 1A/2A, 7A/8A and 9A/10A on the ground that they bear varying serial numbers in contravention of Section 212 of the Omnibus Election Code. However, she does not agree that recount of the ballots is the proper remedy, insinuating that not just the returns but the ballots themselves are tainted because members of the BEI participated in the perpetration of the electoral irregularities in the precincts. She further claims that the returns from Precincts No. 11A/12A should also be excluded because of the irregularities committed by the BEI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Pansar, for his part, maintains that the returns should not be excluded but submits at the same time that a recount is the most definitive mode of ascertaining the true results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p>Based on the SOV signed by the Palawan-Magarang board, it is apparent that the exclusion of the returns from the four (4) contested precincts would greatly benefit Salic. The vote tallies reveal that Salic received a disproportionately low number of votes in the precincts, compared to Pansar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> But this fact alone does not conclusively establish the commission of irregularities, much more provide legal basis for excluding the returns from the precincts. Indeed, there could be a plausible explanation for her receiving relatively fewer votes in the precincts. Hence, there must be a legal justification for excluding the returns from the precincts.</p><p>Such legal justification exists for the exclusion of the returns from Precincts No. 1A/2A, 7A/8A and 9A/10A. Section 212 of the Omnibus Election Code is clear and specific on how the returns such as those from the three (3) precincts should be treated. The penultimate paragraph of the Section is pointedly instructive, viz:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>Any election return with a separately printed serial number or which bears a different serial number from that assigned to the particular polling place concerned shall not be canvassed. This is to be determined by the board of canvassers prior to its canvassing on the basis of the certification of the provincial, city or municipal treasurer as to the serial number of the election return assigned to the said voting precinct, unless the Commission shall order in writing for its canvassing, stating the reason for the variance in serial numbers.</p></blockquote><p>The COMELEC states the reason for the rule in the assailed <em>Order</em>:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>Where the law outrightly (<em>sic</em>) and explicitly DIRECTS the board of canvassers to EXCLUDE election returns when the serial number appearing in the election return is different from that assigned to the precinct concerned, and necessarily, when there is a variance in the serial numbers of the pages of one set of election returns, the presumption of regularity in the due execution and preparation of the election return is entirely demolished, such that the reverse is the evidentiary norm, <em>i.e</em>., said election returns are presumed MANUFACTURED and therefore treated as falsified documents unless proven otherwise through an explanation of the legal custodian and distributor of the election returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The exclusion of the election returns from the three (3) precincts is warranted and, more importantly, uncontroverted. None of the parties has posed any objection to the move. Salic, however, maintains that the return from Precincts No. 11A/12A should be excluded as well, alleging that the BEI members of the precinct participated in illegal substitute voting in the precinct. Surprisingly, the Solicitor General, as counsel for the COMELEC, agrees with Salic also on the exclusion of the return from Precincts No. 11A/12A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court, however, is unable to agree that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the inclusion of the return from Precincts No. 11A/12A in the canvass.</p><p>The evidence presented by Salic for the exclusion of the return from Precincts No. 11A/12A consists of a “certification” purportedly signed by Election Officer Taha Casidar, and a handwritten “certification” allegedly executed by the members of the Board of Election Inspectors for Precincts No. 11A/12A. The COMELEC, and before it, the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee chose not to consider the “certifications,” and the Court cannot fault them for having done so. On their faces, the “certifications” appear as unauthenticated. Assuming that they are genuine writings issued by public officers, the rule is that public documents do not constitute <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the facts therein stated, unless they are evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record or by his deputy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> There is no such proof of official record; thus, the “certifications” must be considered private and not public documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> No evidentiary value can be accorded private documents in the absence of collateral proof of due execution and genuineness thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Not being a trier of facts, the Court has to accord great respect to the factual findings of the COMELEC, including its appreciation of evidence before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p>The only basis for excluding the four (4) questioned election returns is the discrepancy in the serial numbers on the pages thereof and not, as Salic claims, the alleged participation of the BEI members in the commission of election frauds. The claim is unproven and thus bereft of merit. The very case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Salic cites in her petition provides the unequivocal standard that there must be “unrebutted clear and convincing evidence before the COMELEC that not only did the inspectors not comply with the duty required of them by law but that serious defects shown by the voting records amounting to falsification thereof could not have happened without the active participation of the inspectors themselves.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> There is no such “unrebutted clear and convincing evidence” in this case.</p><p>The COMELEC directed the utilization of the ballot box copies of the election returns from the contested precincts for the purpose of completing the canvass and, as an alternative, the recount of the votes cast in the precincts in the event the pages of the returns are likewise found to be have varying serial numbers. This is the procedure laid down in Section 235 of the Omnibus Election Code in situations where the election returns appear to be tampered with or falsified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> As the COMELEC First Division noted, Section 212 of the Omnibus Election Code does not explicitly provide for a remedy where the pages of the election returns contain varying serial numbers which is the situation governed by the Section. But the silence of the Section does not signify any legislative intent to disenfranchise the voters of the precincts in question. The procedure laid down in Section 235 may also apply to the returns whose pages bear dissimilar numbers since such returns also appear to be unauthentic, such as those with varying serial numbers.</p><p>In all, Salic’s petition must fail as it is unable to demonstrate any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC.</p><p>On the other hand, Ditual’s position assumes a different thrust. She argues that the COMELEC’s nullification of her proclamation as vice-mayor violated her rights to due process and equal protection, stressing that she was not a party to COMELEC SPC No. 01-337, wherein the Second Division issued the assailed resolution annulling the canvassing board’s proclamation of her as the winning vice-mayoral candidate. The mere filing by opposing candidate Kiram of a motion to intervene in SPC No. 01-337, Ditual points out, did not<em> ipso facto</em> compel her to file a responsive pleading before the COMELEC. Under the COMELEC Rules of Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the allowance of a motion for intervention always depends upon the discretion of the COMELEC whose task is to evaluate first whether intervention is proper. Certainly, it is only after the COMELEC grants the motion to intervene that it may acquire jurisdiction over the party-intervenor. The fact that Ditual was served a copy of the <em>Petition for Intervention</em> by Kiram’s counsel is inconsequential considering that the COMELEC has not acted upon, much more granted, the motion to intervene.</p><p>However, jurisdiction over the person may be waived either expressly or impliedly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In filing a <em>Motion With Leave of Court</em> (<em>sic</em>) <em>To Admit Answer on the Petition for Intervention filed by Monabantog D. Kiram</em>, on 23 July 2002, Ditual placed herself under the COMELEC’s jurisdiction. That is the logical consequence of her plea before the poll body to admit her Answer to Kiram’s <em>Petition for Intervention</em>. It is of no moment that, as Ditual claims, she caused the filing of that pleading “in sheer panic,” or through another lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The filing of the motion evinces Ditual’s clear intention to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the COMELEC. Now, she is estopped from claiming otherwise.</p><p>There is another compelling reason for the affirmance of the COMELEC’s annulment of Ditual’s proclamation. Ditual draws her supposed right to public office from her proclamation by the Macabayao-Mimbantas board. But as, we declared earlier, it was illegally constituted and as such its acts and declarations are null and void. As Ditual’s claim to the vice-mayoralty has emanated from an illegal source, evidently it cannot be sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p><p>One final note. For no apparent reason, the Palawan-Magarang board refused to proclaim a winning vice-mayoral candidate. Worse, the parties and even the COMELEC seem to ignore that fact, as if the issue would fade away by pretending the anomaly had not existed. While the Macabayao-Mimbantas board canvassed the returns for vice-mayor and proclaimed a winning candidate, its acts however are void. On the other hand, a perusal of the SOV prepared by the Palawan-Magarang board reveals that it crossed out all the entries of votes cast for all the vice-mayoral candidates. Even curiouser is the fact that the Palawan-Magarang board tabulated the votes cast for Ditual in only half of the forty (40) precincts, not bothering to write down the number of votes cast for Ditual in the other twenty (20) precincts. Apart from <em>per se </em>smacking of irregularity, the acts reveal a deliberate intent on the Palawan-Magarang board’s part to frustrate the will of the Butig electorate. The proclamation of all the winning candidates in the municipal elections is a ministerial duty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of the canvassing board.</p><p>As the body mandated by the Constitution to enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of elections is the bounden duty of the COMELEC to ensure that the will of the electorate prevails. However, as of now there is no basis for the proclamation of the winning candidate for vice-mayor. The COMELEC decided to limit the canvass of the election returns from the four (4) contested precincts. In order to determine the winning vice-mayoral candidate, however, it is necessary and proper for the new Butig MBC to recanvass the returns for vice-mayor in all the forty (40) precincts of the municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the consolidated Petitions are <em>DISMISSED</em>.
