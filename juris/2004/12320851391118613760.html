Puno, the Court Administrator recommended the dismissal of the administrative complaint against respondent sheriff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Complainant alleged that respondent sheriff committed the following irregularities amounting to Gross Misconduct: <br><ol><li>Respondent sheriff levied defendants’ real property ahead of their personal properties;<br></li><br><li>Respondent sheriff made an excessive levy;<br></li><br><li>Respondent sheriff levied defendants’ personal properties without serving a Notice of Levy or issuing a receipt therefor;<br></li><br><li>Respondent sheriff delivered the levied personal properties to the judgment creditor without conducting an auction sale; and<br></li><br><li>Respondent sold the levied personal properties in an auction sale almost four years after being levied. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></li></ol>Complainant contends that respondent sheriff levied his real property ahead of his personal properties as shown by the Notice of Levy on his real property dated May 19, 1997, and Notice of Levy and Additional Notice of Levy on his personal properties both dated July 1, 1997, in violation of the Alias Writ of Execution and Section 9(b) of Rule 39<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>In answer thereto, respondent admitted that he first levied real property under TCT No. T-46478 but since the same was heavily mortgaged for P5,000,000.00, the judgment creditor, Triangle Ace Corporation, desisted from proceeding with the levy.&nbsp; It was because of this that he levied the personal properties consisting of the payloader, dump truck and G.I. sheets.&nbsp; He maintains that his action was in accordance with Section 9(b) of the New Rules of Civil Procedure which states that “the officer shall levy upon the properties of the judgment obligor of every kind and nature whatsoever which may be disposed for value and not otherwise exempt from execution.”&nbsp; He added that although the aforesaid section provides that “the officer shall first levy on the personal properties, if any, then on the real properties if the personal properties are insufficient to answer the judgment,” this section has been nullified by the succeeding paragraph which says “(w)hen there is more property of the judgment obligor that is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and lawful fees, he must sell only so much of the personal or real property as is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and lawful fees.”<br><br>At the outset, it must be determined whether or not the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which took effect on July 1, 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> applies to the case at bar.&nbsp; From the record of the case, it is apparent that respondent sheriff, after Judge Eliodoro G. Ubiadas rendered his decision in Civil Case No. 182-0-96 on November 19, 1996, issued a Notice of Garnishment dated February 27, 1997 and a Notice of Levy on real property dated May 19, 1997.&nbsp; Thereafter, on July 1, 1997, he issued a Notice of Levy and an Additional Notice of Levy on personal properties.<br><br>The Rules of Court shall govern all cases brought after they take effect, and also all further proceedings in cases then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure shall apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Inasmuch as respondent sheriff started levying the properties of complainant before the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, and considering further that the provision he is invoking was inexistent then, it is only proper to apply the rules prevailing when he began levying complainant’s properties.&nbsp; To do otherwise would create unfairness and cause inequity in the application of the rules.<br><br>Since the case stemmed from the final judgment of the lower court in a collection case, the pertinent rules are the provisions of the Rules of Court regarding writs of execution and execution of money judgments.<br><br>Section 8 of Rule 39 deals with the issuance, form and contents of a writ of execution.&nbsp; Said section reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 8.&nbsp; Issuance, form and contents of a writ of execution --- The writ of execution must issue in the name of the Republic of the Philippines from the court in which the judgment or order is entered; must intelligently refer to such judgment or order, stating the court, province, and municipality where it is of record, and the amount actually due thereon if it be for money; and must require the sheriff or other proper officer to whom it is directed substantially as follows:<br><br>(a) If the execution be against the property of the judgment debtor, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to satisfy the judgment</span>, with interest, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">out of the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of his real property;</span> x x x.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied) </blockquote> Section 15 of Rule 39 provides the manner by which the execution of a money judgment must be enforced:<br><blockquote>Sec. 15.&nbsp; Execution of money judgments. --- The officer must enforce an execution of a money judgment by levying on all the property, real and personal of every name and nature whatsoever, and which may be disposed for value, of the judgment debtor not exempt from execution, or on a sufficient amount of such property, if there be sufficient, and selling the same, and paying to the judgment creditor, or his attorney, so much of the proceeds as will satisfy the judgment.&nbsp; Any excess in the proceeds over the judgment and accruing costs must be delivered to the judgment debtor, unless otherwise directed by the judgment or order of the court.&nbsp; When there is more property of the judgment debtor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing costs, within the view of the officer, he must levy only on such part of the property as is amply sufficient to satisfy the judgment and costs.<br><br>Real property, stocks, shares, debts, credits, and other personal property, or any interest in either real or personal property, may be levied on in like manner and with like effect as under a writ of attachment. </blockquote> It is clear in Section 8(a) of Rule 39 that satisfaction of the judgment must be carried out first through the personal property of the judgment debtor, and then through his real property.&nbsp; This directive is evident from the Writ of Execution and Alias Writ of Execution issued by the Regional Trial Court which reads:<br><blockquote>NOW THEREFORE, you are hereby commanded to order the defendants to pay the plaintiff jointly and solidarily the amount of P956,285.00 with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from April 27, 1995, plus the amount of ten (10%) percent of the amount as attorney’s fees plus costs of the suit and in default of such payment, you cause to be made said sum out of the goods and chattels of the defendants aside from your lawful fees.<br><br>BUT, if sufficient personal properties cannot be found, then you are commanded that of the lands and buildings of the defendants, you cause to be made the said sum in the manner required for by the Rules of Court and make return of this writ within sixty (60) days together with your proceedings indorsed thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </blockquote> Going over the record of the case, it appears that after the decision of the lower court became final and a writ of execution was issued, the first thing respondent sheriff did was to serve a Notice of Garnishment to the Manager of PAG-IBIG (Take-Out Office) advising the latter not to deliver, transfer or dispose of money credits, shares, interests, and deposits in his control and possession belonging to Subic Realty Corporation, Florentino Caja and Erickson Y. Caja.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Subsequently, an alias writ of execution was issued and pursuant thereto, he levied the real property of complainant on May 19, 1997 and then the latter’s personal properties on July 1, 1997.<br><br>Clearly, what respondent sheriff levied first was personal property <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> garnishment.&nbsp; Garnishment is considered as a specie of attachment for reaching credits belonging to the judgment debtor and owing to him from a stranger to the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It involves money, stocks, credits, and other incorporeal property which belong to the party but is in the possession or under the control of a third person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Since the properties involved in garnishment are personal properties, garnishment is thus a levy on personal property.<br><br>We, however, find that respondent sheriff still violated the rule that satisfaction of the judgment must be carried out first through the personal property of the judgment debtor, and then through his real property.&nbsp; After levying the real property of complainant, respondent sheriff then levied complainant’s personal properties which is a direct violation of Section 8, Rule 39 and of the writ and alias writ of execution issued by the court.<br><br>Respondent sheriff’s contention that he levied the personal properties of complainant after the judgment creditor “desisted from proceeding with the levy” on the real property when it was discovered that the real property he previously levied was already mortgaged for P5,000,000.00, cannot give him any relief.<br><br>First, there was negligence on his part when he immediately levied the real property of complainant without checking if the latter has other personal properties that could satisfy the judgment.&nbsp; He could have easily asked the Land Transportation Office if complainant had vehicles registered in his name.&nbsp; If he had done so, respondent sheriff could have known that complainant had vehicles which he could levy first before levying any real property.&nbsp; He should have exhausted all means before going after the real property.&nbsp; This, he did not do.&nbsp; It was only after levying complainant’s real property and after discovering that said property was encumbered did he look for other personal property.<br><br>Second, the claim that the judgment creditor desisted from proceeding with the levy on the real property is no excuse.&nbsp; The levy on complainant’s real property was already effected and annotated as shown by Entry No. 122714 in TCT No. T-46478.&nbsp; It was the sale of the real property in an execution sale which the judgment creditor did not insist on because the same was already mortgaged for P10,000,000.00 in favor of Town Savings and Loan Bank of Bulacan per Entry No. 121262.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Complainant further accuses respondent of making an excessive levy.&nbsp; The decision, he said, calls only for the payment of P956,285.00 with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from April 27, 1995 plus ten (10%) percent of the amount as attorney’s fees plus costs of the suit, but respondent levied properties totaling almost five million pesos which is an amount over and above the judgment debt to be satisfied.&nbsp; He alleged that the personal properties respondent levied have an amount of more than three million pesos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and the real property had an assessed value of P1,786,870.00 and is mortgaged for ten million pesos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> He added that respondent sheriff was offered other real properties which are smaller in value and not encumbered but he insisted on levying the real property which has a conservative assessed value of double the amount to be satisfied.<br><br>Respondent sheriff countered that, anyway, the levy on the real property was not continued because the property was “heavily indebted at five million pesos.” As to the levy on the personal properties, he alleged that same cannot be excessive because their acquisition cost is not the price in an auction sale, the latter being much lower than the former.<br><br>As stated in the second paragraph of the aforecited section, the manner by which a levy on execution is to be effected is the same as that under a writ of attachment.&nbsp; Section 7 of Rule 57 illustrates how a property is attached:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7.&nbsp; Attachment of real and personal property; recording thereof. --- Properties shall be attached by the officer executing the order in the following manner:<br><br>a) Real property, or growing crops thereon, standing upon the records of the registrar of deeds of the province in the name of the party against whom attachment is issued, or not appearing at all upon such records, by filing with the registrar of deeds a copy of the order, together with a description of the property attached, and a notice that it is attached, and by leaving a copy of such order, description, and notice with the occupant of the property, if any there be.&nbsp; Where the property has been brought under the operation of the Land Registration Act, the notice shall contain a reference to the number of the certificate of title and the volume and page in the registration book where the certificate is registered.&nbsp; The registrar must index attachments filed under this paragraph in the names both of the applicant and the adverse party.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x x x. </blockquote> We find respondent sheriff’s contention that “the levy on complainant’s real property was not continued” because it was previously mortgaged to be untenable.&nbsp; The levy thereon was completed as shown by the annotation (Entry No. 122714) of the Notice of Levy on Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-46478.&nbsp; In fact, complainant, together with the other defendants in Civil Case No. 182-0-96, filed a Motion to Lift Levy on Execution dated January 18, 2000 asking that the levy on the real property be lifted because the levy on the personal properties was sufficient to satisfy the judgment debt.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the motion was denied by the lower court.&nbsp; It is clear that the levy on the real property is still subsisting.&nbsp; There was a valid levy on the real property.&nbsp; Thus, it is improper for respondent sheriff to rely, as a defense, on his claim that the levy on the real property was not continued.&nbsp; It was the sale of the levied real property in an execution sale which did not push through.<br><br>Levy is different from an execution sale.&nbsp; Levy has been defined as the act or acts by which an officer sets apart or appropriates a part or the whole of a judgment debtor’s property for the purpose of satisfying the command of the writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> On the other hand, an execution sale is a sale by a sheriff or other ministerial officer under the authority of a writ of execution which he has levied on property of the debtor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In the case before us, there was a levy on real property but the levied property was not sold in an execution sale because said property, if sold, will not satisfy the judgment debt because of an existing encumbrance thereon.<br><br>There being a levy on the complainant’s real property, the amount thereof must be considered in determining if there was an overlevy.&nbsp; As gathered from the Tax Declaration of the real property involved, including its improvements, its assessed value amounted to P1,786,870.00.&nbsp; It must be remembered, however, that said property is mortgaged for P10,000,000.00 in favor of Town Savings and Loan Bank of Bulacan.&nbsp; The fact that the property is mortgaged for ten million pesos only means that its value is more than said amount.&nbsp; This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that the value of a property is usually bigger than the amount for which it can be mortgaged.&nbsp; No person, in the ordinary course of business, would give a loan which is bigger than the value of the property that is used to secure such debt.&nbsp; Certainly, the issue of what is bigger -- the amount of the loan or the amount of the security for its payment -- is within public knowledge and capable of unquestionable demonstration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The amount of the real property levied upon is definitely more than ten million pesos since the property was mortgaged for ten million.&nbsp; This amount alone is more or less ten times greater than the judgment debt.&nbsp; As it is, there is already a clear case of overlevy.&nbsp; Although the levied realty was not auctioned at an execution sale, its value should still be taken into account in computing the total amount levied by respondent sheriff.<br><br>Respondent sheriff’s act of levying complainant’s real property despite its being mortgaged is tantamount to negligence.&nbsp; As an officer of the court, he knew fully well that the property cannot be used to satisfy the judgment debt since the mortgagee is the preferred creditor in relation to said property.<br><br>Anent the levy on the complainant’s personal properties, he avers that respondent made an overlevy since the value of the payloader and the dumptruck amounted to three million pesos which is over and above the judgment debt.<br><br>In the determination of the value of the two vehicles, it is the duty of complainant to show their true value as substantiated by competent proof.&nbsp; In the case before us, complainant failed to present the best proof to accurately show their value.&nbsp; He should have adduced in evidence the deeds of sale of said vehicles, but instead, he merely presented the invoices and delivery receipts. These pieces of evidence are not sufficient to prove the value of these properties as claimed by complainant considering that when the same, together with the G.I. sheets, were sold in public auction, the bid amounted only to P705,500.00 which is way below the judgment debt.<br><br>The rule is well-settled that a sheriff is guilty of misconduct where he failed to limit the goods to be levied to the amount called for in the writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> A deputy sheriff who made a levy far and in excess of the value of the judgment commits a misconduct in office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In the case before us, respondent sheriff clearly made an excessive levy when he levied complainant’s real property which was valued at more than ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00).<br><br>Complainant accuses respondent sheriff of surreptitiously taking the personal properties on July 1, 1997 without serving any Notice of Levy or issuing any receipt for the same.<br><br>Respondent sheriff maintains that the Notice of Levy was not given to complainant or to anybody at the place where the personal properties were taken because nobody would receive it.&nbsp; He added that complainant knew where they were taken.&nbsp; Moreover, he said, despite meeting complainant several times, the latter neither complained to him about the levy nor filed any complaint in court.<br><br>As regards the notice of levy for the payloader and dump truck, respondent testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

As sheriff, it was his duty to give the notice of levy or receipt to the person to whom the personal properties were taken.&nbsp; If no one would like to receive the same, it was his duty to leave copies of the notice at the place where he levied the personal property.&nbsp; Thereafter, he should have reported the proceedings by filing a report or return to the court.&nbsp; In the case at bar, even assuming that no one was willing to accept the notice of levy, the record is bereft of any evidence showing that respondent sheriff reported his failure to leave a copy of the notice of levy.&nbsp; Sheriffs are officers of the court who serve and execute writs addressed to them by the court, and who prepare and submit returns of their proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> On this score, respondent was again remiss in his duty as a sheriff.<br><br>Complainant claims that respondent sheriff delivered the heavy equipment and G.I. sheets to the judgment creditor without conducting an auction sale which is in contravention of the Alias Writ of Execution and a violation of Section 9(b), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Respondent sheriff argues that he never delivered said personal properties to the judgment creditor but merely kept the same in a secured place owned by the latter.&nbsp; He brought them there because the Sheriff’s Office and the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City had no warehouse or place to keep levied personal properties.&nbsp; In support thereto, he presented John Aquino, Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, who testified that they have no designated warehouse or building where sheriffs can keep levied personal properties.&nbsp;
