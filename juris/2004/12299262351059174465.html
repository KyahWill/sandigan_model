The Spouses Sacramento mortgaged the property with the Social Security System (SSS) as security for their housing loan and, likewise, surrendered the owner’s and duplicate copies of the certificate of title.&nbsp; On September 2, 1980, the spouses executed a Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage in favor of Maria Linda Clemeno and her husband Angel C.

The petitioner also declared in the said letter that even if the respondent wanted to buy the property, the same was unenforceable as there was no document executed by them to evince the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In their Answer to the complaint, the petitioners alleged that they entered into a verbal lease-purchase agreement over the house and lot with the respondent under the following terms and conditions: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(a)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The purchase price will be <s>P</s>270,000.00 to be paid in full not later than June 1, 1988;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The rental is <s>P</s>1,500.00 a month, for the whole period from June 1987 to June 1, 1988;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)</td> <td><div align="justify">If the whole purchase price is not paid on the agreed date, the total amount equivalent to one-year rental shall be deducted from the amount already paid by the plaintiff, who shall peacefully vacate the premises and surrender possession of the house and lot to the defendants.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(d) </td> <td><div align="justify">The purchase price of <s>P</s>270,000.00 shall be payable: <s>P</s>90,000.00 upon taking possession of the property, <s>P</s>90,000.00 payable within six (6) months thereafter, and <s>P</s>90,000.00 not later than June 1, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The petitioners further alleged that despite the respondent’s failure to comply with the conditions of their agreement, the latter was still granted an extension of until September 1989 to pay the purchase price of the property, but managed to pay only <s>P</s>113,049.96, including the monthly amortizations of their loan account with the SSS and realty tax payments.&nbsp; The petitioners further alleged that the respondent even failed to pay any rental for the property from June 1987 to June 1, 1988.&nbsp; They posited that the contract between the parties was unenforceable under Article 1403(2) of the New Civil Code, and prayed that judgment be rendered in their favor as prayed for by them in their complaint in Civil Case No. 93-17268, thus:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that after due hearing, a decision in favor of plaintiff be rendered, ordering Defendant – <br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">And all other persons claiming under him to vacate the premises located at 86 Madaling Araw St., Teresa Heights Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(b)</td> <td><div align="justify">To pay plaintiff a balance of <s>P</s>64,349.14 for the use and occupancy of the premises until May 31, 1993, and at the rate of <s>P</s>3,628.80 a month from June 1, 1993 until the premises shall have been finally vacated;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(c)</td> <td><div align="justify">To pay <s>P</s>50,000.00 plus <s>P</s>2,000.00 per appearance as and for attorney’s fees;

He made a typewritten letter to the respondent, stating that the latter had been given more than enough time to exercise the option to buy the property but failed to do so; hence, the offer was deemed cancelled. The petitioner left the letter with the respondent’s daughter, Michelle Lobregat.<br><br>The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the petitioners, as follows:<blockquote>Accordingly, therefore, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of Angel Clemeno, [Jr.] as against Romeo Lobregat and orders the latter and other persons claiming under him to:<ol><li>Vacate the premises located at No. 86 Madaling Araw Street, Teresa Heights Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City;<br></li><li>Pay Angel Clemeno, Jr. the amount of <s>P</s>64,349.14 for the use and occupancy of the premises until May 31, 1993 and at the rate of <s>P</s>3,628.80 a month from June 1, 1993 until the premises have been finally vacated;<br></li><li>Pay the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00 as attorney’s fees and other legal expenses, and<br></li><li>To pay the costs of suit.</li></ol>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>The trial court ruled that since both the sale and lease agreements were not reduced to writing, both contracts were unenforceable under Article 1403(2) of the New Civil Code, and had decided the case based on justice and equity.<br><br>The respondent appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals and raised the following assignment of errors:<blockquote><ol><li>THE LOWER COURT, AFTER THE COMPLETE, MERITORIOUS AND WRITTEN PIECES OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT LOBREGAT, FAILED/REFUSED TO CONSIDER THE SAME.&nbsp; INSTEAD, DECIDED ONLY THE CASE OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACCION PUBLICIANA</span> FILED BY DEFENDANT-APPELLEE A.

They further assert that even if, indeed, the parties had entered into a contract of sale, the same is unenforceable under paragraph 2, Article 1403 of the New Civil Code, which provides that such contract must be in writing; and Article 1358 of the New Civil Code which requires that such contract must appear in a public document.<br><br>On the other hand, the appellate court held that the petitioners and the respondent entered into a <span style="font-style: italic;">verbal</span> contract of sale and not a contract to sell over the subject property, thus:<blockquote>In the case at bench, Clemeno had agreed to sell his house and lot to Lobregat for a total consideration of <s>P</s>270,000.00 payable in installments within a period of two (2) years.&nbsp; The receipt, Exhibit “A”, is self-explanatory:&nbsp; it speaks of the receipt by Clemeno of the sum of <s>P</s>25,000.00 from Lobregat as advance payment of the subject house and lot, the total purchase price of which is <s>P</s>270,000.00.&nbsp; Significantly, upon his receipt of the advance payment, Clemeno delivered the possession of the premises to Lobregat who is now the present possessor thereof.&nbsp; Subsequent payments were made by Lobregat on the purchase price, all of which were duly receipted for by Clemeno.&nbsp; The receipts Exhibits “A-1”, “A-2” and “A-3”, for example, speak uniformly of “additional part payment” for the house and lot subject of this case.&nbsp; Moreover, as suggested by Clemeno himself, Lobregat had been religiously remitting the monthly payments on Clemeno’s loan obligation with the SSS.&nbsp; Note, for instance, Exhibit “A-4” – one of the many receipts of payment to SSS – where it is indicated that the real estate loan is in the name of Angel C. Clemeno, Jr., as borrower, but bears the name of Romeo Lobregat, as payor, on behalf of Clemeno.&nbsp; It is as clear as sunlight that the parties had entered into a contract of sale and not merely a contract to sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>The petition has no merit.<br><br>We find and so hold that the contract between the parties was a perfected verbal contract of sale, not a contract to sell over the subject property, with the petitioner as vendor and the respondent as vendee.&nbsp; Sale is a consensual contract and is perfected by mere consent, which is manifested by a meeting of the minds as to the offer and acceptance thereof on three elements: subject matter, price and terms of payment of the price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The petitioners sold their property to the respondent for <s>P</s>270,000.00, payable on installments, and upon the payment of the purchase price thereof, the petitioners were bound to execute a deed of sale in favor of the respondent and deliver to him the certificate of title over the property in his name.&nbsp; The parties later agreed for the respondent to assume the payment of the petitioners’ loan amortization to the SSS, which payments formed part of the purchase price of the property.&nbsp; The evidence shows that upon the payment made by the respondent of the amount of <s>P</s>27,000.00 on June 4, 1987, the petitioners vacated their house and delivered possession thereof to the respondent.&nbsp; Conformably to Article 1477 of the New Civil Code, the ownership of the property was transferred to the respondent upon such delivery.&nbsp; The petitioners cannot re-acquire ownership and recover possession thereof unless the contract is rescinded in accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The failure of the respondent to complete the payment of the purchase price of the property within the stipulated period merely accorded the petitioners the option to rescind the contract of sale as provided for in Article 1592 of the New Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The contract entered into by the parties was not a contract to sell because there was no agreement for the petitioners to retain ownership over the property until after the respondent shall have paid the purchase price in full, nor an agreement reserving to the petitioners the right to unilaterally resolve the contract upon the buyer’s failure to pay within a fixed period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Unlike in a contract of sale, the payment of the price is a positive suspensive condition in a contract to sell, failure of which is not a breach but an event that prevents the obligation of the vendor to convey the title from becoming effective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The fact that the receipts issued by the SSS evidencing the respondent’s remittances of the monthly amortization payments of the petitioners’ loan, and that the receipts issued to the respondent for the payment of realty taxes for 1987 and 1988 were in the name of Nilus Sacramento and/or the petitioner Clemeno, Jr., does not negate the fact of the transfer of the ownership over the property to the respondent on June 4, 1987.&nbsp; Moreover, the deed of sale over the property in favor of the respondent had not yet been executed by the petitioners.&nbsp; The Spouses Sacramento and later, the petitioners, were the borrowers, as per the records of the SSS.<br><br>The contract of sale of the parties is enforceable notwithstanding the fact that it was an oral agreement and not reduced in writing as required by Article 1403(2) of the New Civil Code, which reads:<blockquote>Art. 1403. The following contracts are unenforceable, unless they are ratified:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">…</div><br>“(2) Those that do not comply with the Statute of Frauds as set forth in this number. In the following cases, an agreement hereafter made shall be unenforceable by action, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing, and subscribed by the parties charged, or by his agent; evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or a secondary evidence of its contents:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">…</div><blockquote>‘(d) An agreement for the sale of goods, chattels or things in action, at a price not less than five hundred pesos, unless the buyer accepts and receives part of such goods and chattels, or the evidences, or some of them, of such things in action, or pay at the time some part of the purchase money: but when a sale is made by auction and entry is made by the auctioneer in his sales book, at the time of the sale, of the amount and kind of property sold, terms of sale, price, names of the purchasers and person on whose account the sale is made, it is a sufficient memorandum; …’”</blockquote></blockquote>This is so because the provision applies only to executory, and not to completed, executed or partially executed contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In this case, the contract of sale had been partially executed by the parties, with the transfer of the possession of the property to the respondent and the partial payments made by the latter of the purchase price thereof.<br><br>We agree with the petitioners’ contention that the respondent did not pay the total purchase price of the property within the stipulated period.&nbsp; Moreover, the respondent did not pay the balance of the purchase price of the property. However, such failure to pay on the part of the respondent was not because he could not pay, but because petitioner Angel Clemeno, Jr. told him not to do so. The latter instructed the respondent to continue paying the monthly amortizations due to the SSS on the loan.&nbsp; Unknown to the respondent, petitioner Angel Clemeno, Jr. wanted to increase the purchase price of the property at the prevailing market value in 1992, and not its value in 1987 when the contract of sale was perfected.<br><br>The petitioners failed to prove their claim that a lease purchase agreement over the property was entered into.&nbsp; Except for their bare claim, they failed to adduce a morsel of documentary evidence to prove the same.&nbsp; On the other hand, all the receipts issued by them on the partial payments made by the respondent were for the purchase price of the property, and not as rentals thereof.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span> for lack of merit.&nbsp; Costs against the petitioners.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairman), Tinga,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Austria-Martinez, J.,</span> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Oswaldo D.
