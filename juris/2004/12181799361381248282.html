Writs were issued in 2 cases which were not yet returned at the time the audit was conducted. Furthermore, the team noted that said court did not have docket books for criminal cases and other cases which are separate from the general docket books maintained by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC of Bukidnon, Malaybalay City.  A random examination of the records of dismissed cases due to the failure of plaintiffs to prosecute and archived cases due to the accused's non-apprehension also showed that private complainants were not directly furnished with copies of the orders of dismissal or archival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In our Resolution dated September 17, 2003, we ordered Judge Barroso to explain his failure to render decisions in eight (8) cases and to resolve the motions pending in three (3) cases.  We also withheld the amount of P50,000.00 from his retirement benefits to answer for any administrative sanction that may be imposed on him.  We directed the designated Acting Presiding Judge of the said court to render decisions or resolutions in cases which may have been left undecided or unresolved by Judge Barroso and to take appropriate action on cases for archival and those cases which were not further acted upon despite the lapse of a considerable length of time.  We also directed Acting Clerk of Court Cunanan to immediately cease and desist from further conducting ex parte reception of evidence and to explain why no administrative sanction should be imposed on him for his failure to take initial action on twenty-eight (28) cases and to immediately issue summons in five (5) cases.  We ordered him to keep the prescribed docket books for criminal cases and civil/other cases which are separate from those kept in the Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Malaybalay City.  We also directed him to furnish private complainants with copies of orders dismissing or archiving their cases.<br><br>In his First Indorsement dated November 7, 2003, Judge Barroso gave the following explanation for his failure to: (a) decide Civil Cases Nos. 2716, 2727, 2887, 3001, 3157, SCA-310, SCA-311 and SCA-312; and (b) resolve the motions in Criminal Case No. 10277 and Civil Cases Nos. 2843 and 2937, within the mandatory period, viz:<br>  <blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="25%"><div align="left">Cases No. </div></td> <td width="64%">Explanation</td> <td width="11%">&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="left">A) Civil Cases: </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[1] 2716 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- submitted for resolution as of March 2003 and was decided on July 28, 2003; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[2] 2727 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Submitted for resolution as of February 2003 and was decided on August 4, 2003; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[3] 2887 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Submitted for resolution as of April 2003 and was decided on July 31, 2003;</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[4] 3001 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Submitted for resolution as of April 2003 and was decided on August 8, 2003; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[5] 3157 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Still undecided for having been overlooked; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="left">B) Special Civil Actions: </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[1] 310 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Originally raffled to RTC Branch 9, on May 30, 2002 and was subsequently transferred to this Branch in exchange of another case; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[2] 311 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Overlooked; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">[3] 312 </div></td> <td><div align="justify">- Originally filed to (sic) RTC Branch 9 on August 8, 2002 and subsequently transfered tothis branch in exchange of another case; </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="left">C) Motions </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="left">[1] Crim.

He stated that he was then preparing for the 2003 Bar Examinations but could not go on leave due to the intended retirement of Judge Barroso, hence, some oversight with respect to some records in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We find Judge Barroso and Acting Clerk of Court Cunanan remiss in their duties.<br><br>The Constitution mandates that cases or matters filed with the lower courts must be decided or resolved within three (3) months from the date they are submitted for decision or resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In the case at bar, Judge Barroso admitted that he failed to render his decision in Civil Case No. 3157 for having "overlooked" the same.  His decisions in Civil Cases Nos. 2716, 2727, 2887, 3001, SCA-311, SCA-310, and SCA-312, and his resolution in Criminal Case No. 10277, were all rendered or resolved beyond the prescribed period of three months. He also admitted to having "overlooked" the Omnibus Motion to Dismiss pending with Civil Case No. 2937, thus, leaving it unresolved for more than three (3) years from its submission for decision.  The motion pending in Civil Case No. 2843 was also left unresolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>We have ruled that the mere fact that a judge was sitting as acting judge in another sala is not sufficient to exonerate him from liability for delay in rendering decisions and resolving motions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This is not to turn a blind eye on the plight of our judges.  As we stressed in several decisions, if it becomes unavoidable for a judge to render a decision or resolve a matter beyond the mandatory period, he may seek additional time by simply filing a request for such extension seasonably and with good reasons.  Judge Barroso, however, did not make use of this remedy.  Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct directs judges to "dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The heavy load in Judge Barroso's <span style="font-style: italic;">sala</span>, though unfortunate, cannot exempt him from due observance of the rules.<br><br>Cunanan is also remiss in his duties.  Clerks of court are charged with the duty of issuing writs and processes incident to pending cases before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It is their duty to forthwith issue the corresponding summons to the defendants upon the filing of the complaint and payment of the requisite legal fees. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Their office being the hub of activities, they are expected to be assiduous in performing official duties and in supervising and managing their respective court's dockets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Cunanan did not explain why it took him more than four (4) months to act on Civil Case No. 2939 after the records of the case were transferred to their branch.  He also failed to explain why he did not immediately act upon Civil Cases Nos. 3074, 3097, and SCA-319 upon receipt of their respective records.  Furthermore, summonses in Civil Cases Nos. 3260, 3277, and SCA-340 were served only more than one month after the judicial audit was conducted.  Again, Cunanan did not explain why he did not immediately issue summonses in Civil Cases Nos. 3104, 3162, 3251, 3255, and SCA-342.<br><br>Cunanan's excuse that he was preparing for the 2003 Bar Examinations is unavailing. It is noteworthy that Civil Case No. 3104 was filed as early as September 12, 2001, but summons was issued only on July 11, 2003, or after more than one year.  There is nothing herculean in the task of issuing summons.  It is a ministerial duty which can be discharged by filling in of entries <i>pro forma</i>. Service of summons on the defendant is significant for the court to acquire jurisdiction over his or her person.  It puts the case into motion after the complaint or information has been filed and the corresponding fees paid.  As an aspiring member of the bar, he must be well aware that justice demands the prompt disposition of cases filed in court.  He was less than zealous in the prompt issuance of summons.<br><br>Under Sections 9 and 11(B), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we classified undue delay in rendering a decision or order as a less serious charge, for which any of the following sanctions shall be imposed: (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months; or (b) a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not more than P20,000.00.  Considering the number of cases which the respondent judge failed to decide on time but mitigated by his length of service and the absence of any showing that he was a habitual offender, we find the amount of P15,000.00 as a suitable fine to impose on respondent judge.<br><br>As regards the respondent clerk of court, we find him liable for simple neglect of duty.  Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations classifies this offense as less grave with a corresponding penalty of suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense, and dismissal from service for the second offense.  Considering the circumstances of the present case and that this is respondent Cunanan's first offense, we find the penalty of suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day as sufficient.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, we hold retired Judge Jesus M. Barroso, Jr., administratively liable for undue delay in rendering decisions or orders and he is ordered to pay a fine of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00), to be deducted from the P50,000.00 retirement benefits withheld from him pursuant to our Resolution dated September 17, 2003.  The remainder of the withheld amount is ordered released to him. We further hold respondent Pedrito A. Cunanan administratively liable of simple neglect of duty, for which he is suspended for one (1) month and one (1) day, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely in the future.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr., </i>and <i>Tinga, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Chico-Nazario, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Re:  Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the RTC, Branch 10, Malaybalay, Bukidnon.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Dated August 8, 2003.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Headed by Atty.
