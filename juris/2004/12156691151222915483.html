				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span></div><br>This is a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 13 December 2000 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 48784.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 21, Cebu City (“trial court”), which held that Milagros Orbiso Montesclaros is entitled to survivorship pension.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span></div><br>Sangguniang Bayan member Nicolas Montesclaros (“Nicolas”) married Milagros Orbiso (“Milagros”) on 10 July 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Nicolas was a 72- year old widower when he married Milagros who was then 43 years old.<br><br>On 4 January 1985, Nicolas filed with the Government Service Insurance System (“GSIS”) an application for retirement benefits effective 18 February 1985 under Presidential Decree No. 1146 or the Revised Government Service Insurance Act of 1977 (“PD 1146”).&nbsp;&nbsp; In his retirement application, Nicolas designated his wife Milagros as his sole beneficiary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Nicolas’ last day of actual service was on 17 February 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On 31 January 1986, GSIS approved Nicolas’ application for retirement “<span style="font-style: italic;">effective 17 February 1984</span>,” granting a lump sum payment of annuity for the first five years and a monthly annuity thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Nicolas died on 22 April 1992. Milagros filed with GSIS a claim for survivorship pension under PD 1146. On 8 June 1992, GSIS denied the claim because under Section 18 of PD 1146, the surviving spouse has no right to survivorship pension if the surviving spouse contracted the marriage with the pensioner within three years before the pensioner qualified for the pension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> According to GSIS, Nicolas wed Milagros on 10 July 1983, less than one year from his date of retirement on “<span style="font-style: italic;">17 February 1984</span>.”<br><br>On 2 October 1992, Milagros filed with the trial court a special civil action for declaratory relief questioning the validity of Section 18 of PD 1146 disqualifying her from receiving survivorship pension.<br><br>On 9 November 1994, the trial court rendered judgment declaring Milagros eligible for survivorship pension. The trial court ordered GSIS to pay Milagros the benefits due including interest. Citing Articles 115<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and 117<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the Family Code, the trial court held that retirement benefits, which the pensioner has earned for services rendered and for which the pensioner has contributed through monthly salary deductions, are onerous acquisitions. Since retirement benefits are property the pensioner acquired through labor, such benefits are conjugal property. The trial court held that the prohibition in Section 18 of PD 1146 is deemed repealed for being inconsistent with the Family Code, a later law.&nbsp; The Family Code has retroactive effect if it does not prejudice or impair vested rights.<br><br>GSIS appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision of the trial court.&nbsp; Hence, this petition for review.<br><br>In the meantime, in a letter dated 10 January 2003, Milagros informed the Court that she has accepted GSIS’ decision disqualifying her from receiving survivorship pension and that she is no longer interested in pursuing the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Commenting on Milagros’ letter, GSIS asserts that the Court must decide the case on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Court will resolve the issue despite the manifestation of Milagros. The issue involves not only the claim of Milagros but also that of other surviving spouses who are similarly situated and whose claims GSIS would also deny based on the proviso.&nbsp; Social justice and public interest demand that we resolve the constitutionality of the proviso.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span></div><br>The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the retirement benefits are onerous and conjugal because the pension came from the deceased pensioner’s salary deductions.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that the pension is not gratuitous since it is a deferred compensation for services rendered.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span></div><br>GSIS raises the following issues:<blockquote><ol><li>Whether Section 16 of PD 1146 entitles Milagros to survivorship pension;</li><br><li>Whether retirement benefits form part of conjugal property;</li><br><li>Whether Articles 254 and 256 of the Family Code repealed Section 18 of PD 1146.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span></div><br>The pertinent provisions of PD 1146 on survivorship benefits read:<blockquote>SEC. 16.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Survivorship Benefits</span>.&nbsp; When a member or pensioner dies, the beneficiary shall be entitled to survivorship benefits provided for in sections seventeen and eighteen hereunder.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Under PD 1146, the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">primary beneficiaries are (1) the dependent spouse until such spouse remarries, and (2) the dependent children</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The secondary beneficiaries are the dependent parents and legitimate descendants except dependent children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The law defines <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">dependent</span> as “the legitimate, legitimated, legally adopted, acknowledged natural or illegitimate child who is unmarried, not gainfully employed, and not over twenty-one years of age or is over twenty-one years of age but physically or mentally incapacitated and incapable of self-support.” The term also includes <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the legitimate spouse dependent for support on the member</span>, and the legitimate parent wholly dependent on the member for support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The main question for resolution is the validity of the proviso in Section 18 of PD 1146, which proviso prohibits the dependent spouse from receiving survivorship pension if such dependent spouse married the pensioner within three years before the pensioner qualified for the pension (“the proviso”).<br><br>We hold that the proviso, which was the sole basis for the rejection by GSIS of Milagros’ claim, is unconstitutional because it violates the due process clause. The proviso is also discriminatory and denies equal protection of the law.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Retirement Benefits as Property Interest</span></div><br>Under Section 5 of PD 1146, it is mandatory for the government employee to pay monthly contributions.&nbsp; PD 1146 mandates the government to include in its annual appropriation the necessary amounts for its share of the contributions. It is compulsory on the government employer to take off and withhold from the employees’ monthly salaries their contributions and to remit the same to GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The government employer must also remit its corresponding share to GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Considering the mandatory salary deductions from the government employee, the government pensions do not constitute mere gratuity but form part of compensation.<br><br>In a pension plan where employee participation is mandatory, the prevailing view is that employees have contractual or vested rights in the pension where the pension is part of the terms of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The reason for providing retirement benefits is to compensate service to the government. Retirement benefits to government employees are part of emolument to encourage and retain qualified employees in the government service. Retirement benefits to government employees reward them for giving the best years of their lives in the service of their country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thus, where the employee retires and meets the eligibility requirements, he acquires a vested right to benefits that is protected by the due process clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Retirees enjoy a protected property interest whenever they acquire a right to immediate payment under pre-existing law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, a pensioner acquires a vested right to benefits that have become due as provided under the terms of the public employees’ pension statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> No law can deprive such person of his pension rights without due process of law, that is, without notice and opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In addition to retirement and disability benefits, PD 1146 also provides for benefits to survivors of deceased government employees and pensioners.&nbsp; Under PD 1146, the dependent spouse is one of the beneficiaries of survivorship benefits.&nbsp; A widow’s right to receive pension following the demise of her husband is also part of the husband’s contractual compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Denial of Due Process</span></div><br>The proviso is contrary to Section 1, Article III of the Constitution, which provides that “[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.”&nbsp; The proviso is unduly oppressive in outrightly denying a dependent spouse’s claim for survivorship pension if the dependent spouse contracted marriage to the pensioner within the three-year prohibited period. There is outright confiscation of benefits due the surviving spouse without giving the surviving spouse an opportunity to be heard.&nbsp; The proviso undermines the purpose of PD 1146, which is to assure comprehensive and integrated social security and insurance benefits to government employees and their dependents in the event of sickness, disability, death, and retirement of the government employees.<br><br>The “whereas” clauses of PD 1146 state:<blockquote>WHEREAS, the Government Service Insurance System in promoting the efficiency and welfare of the employees of the Government of the Philippines, administers the laws that grant to its members social security and insurance benefits;<br><br>WHEREAS, it is necessary to preserve at all times the actuarial solvency of the funds administered by the System; to guarantee to the government employee all the benefits due him; and to expand and increase the benefits made available to him and his dependents to the extent permitted by available resources;<br><br>WHEREAS, provisions of existing laws have impeded the efficient and effective discharge by the System of its functions and have unduly hampered the System from being more responsive to the dramatic changes of the times and from meeting the increasing needs and expectations of the Filipino public servant;<br><br>WHEREAS, provisions of existing laws that have prejudiced, rather than benefited, the government employee; restricted, rather than broadened, his benefits, prolonged, rather than facilitated the payment of benefits, must now yield to his paramount welfare;<br><br>WHEREAS, the social security and insurance benefits of government employees must be continuously re-examined and improved to assure comprehensive and integrated social security and insurance programs that will provide benefits responsive to their needs and those of their dependents in the event of sickness, disability, death, retirement, and other contingencies; and to serve as a fitting reward for dedicated public service;<br><br>WHEREAS, in the light of existing economic conditions affecting the welfare of government employees, there is a need to expand and improve the social security and insurance programs administered by the Government Service Insurance System, specifically, among others, by increasing pension benefits, expanding disability benefits, introducing survivorship benefits, introducing sickness and income benefits, and eventually extending the compulsory coverage of these programs to all government employees regardless of employment status.</blockquote>PD 1146 has the following purposes:<blockquote><ol type="A"><li>to preserve at all times the actuarial solvency of the funds administered by the System;</li><br><li>to guarantee to the government employee all the benefits due him; and</li><br><li>to expand, increase, and improve the social security and insurance benefits made available to him and his dependents such as:</li><br><ul type="disc"><li>increasing pension benefits</li><br><li>expanding disability benefits</li><br><li>introducing survivorship benefits</li><br><li>introducing sickness income benefits</li><br><li>extending compulsory membership to all government employees irrespective of status<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></li></ul></ol></blockquote>The law extends survivorship benefits to the surviving and qualified beneficiaries of the deceased member or pensioner to cushion the beneficiaries against the adverse economic effects resulting from the death of the wage earner or pensioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Violation of the Equal Protection Clause</span></div><br>The surviving spouse of a government employee is entitled to receive survivor’s benefits under a pension system.&nbsp; However, statutes sometimes require that the spouse should have married the employee for a certain period before the employee’s death <span style="font-weight: bold;">to prevent sham marriages contracted for monetary gain</span>.&nbsp; One example is the Illinois Pension Code which restricts survivor’s annuity benefits to a surviving spouse who was married to a state employee for at least one year <span style="font-weight: bold;">before the employee’s death</span>.&nbsp; The Illinois pension system classifies spouses into those married less than one year before a member’s death and those married one year or more. The classification seeks to prevent conscious adverse risk selection of deathbed marriages where a terminally ill member of the pension system marries another so that person becomes eligible for benefits. In <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Sneddon v. The State Employee’s Retirement System of Illinois</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Appellate Court of Illinois held that such classification was based on difference in situation and circumstance, bore a rational relation to the purpose of the statute, and was therefore not in violation of constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.<br><br>A statute based on reasonable classification does not violate the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The requirements for a valid and reasonable classification are: (1) it must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) it must be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) it must apply equally to all members of the same class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, the law may treat and regulate one class differently from another class provided there are real and substantial differences to distinguish one class from another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The proviso in question does not satisfy these requirements.&nbsp; The proviso discriminates against the dependent spouse who contracts marriage to the pensioner within three years before the pensioner qualified for the pension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Under the proviso, even if the dependent spouse married the pensioner more than three years before the pensioner’s death, the dependent spouse would still not receive survivorship pension if the marriage took place within three years before the pensioner qualified for pension.&nbsp; The object of the prohibition is vague.&nbsp; There is no reasonable connection between the means employed and the purpose intended.&nbsp; The law itself does not provide any reason or purpose for such a prohibition.&nbsp; If the purpose of the proviso is to prevent “<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">deathbed marriages</span>,” then we do not see why the proviso reckons the three-year prohibition from the date the pensioner qualified for pension and not from the date the pensioner died. The classification does not rest on substantial distinctions. Worse, the classification lumps all those marriages contracted within three years before the pensioner qualified for pension as having been contracted primarily for financial convenience to avail of pension benefits.<br><br>Indeed, the classification is discriminatory and arbitrary.&nbsp; This is probably the reason Congress deleted the proviso in Republic Act No. 8291 (“RA 8291”),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> otherwise known as the “Government Service Insurance Act of 1997,” the law revising the old charter of GSIS (PD 1146).&nbsp; Under the implementing rules of RA 8291, the surviving spouse who married the member immediately before the member’s death is still qualified to receive survivorship pension unless the GSIS proves that the surviving spouse contracted the marriage solely to receive the benefit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Thus, the present GSIS law does not presume that marriages contracted within three years before retirement or death of a member are sham marriages contracted to avail of survivorship benefits.&nbsp; The present GSIS law does not automatically forfeit the survivorship pension of the surviving spouse who contracted marriage to a GSIS member within three years before the member’s retirement or death.&nbsp; The law acknowledges that whether the surviving spouse contracted the marriage mainly to receive survivorship benefits is a matter of evidence. The law no longer prescribes a sweeping classification that unduly prejudices the legitimate surviving spouse and defeats the purpose for which Congress enacted the social legislation.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is DENIED for want of merit. We declare VOID for being violative of the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection of the law the proviso in Section 18 of Presidential Decree No. 1146, which proviso states that “the dependent spouse shall not be entitled to said pension if his marriage with the pensioner is contracted within three years before the pensioner qualified for the pension.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government Service Insurance System cannot deny the claim of Milagros O.
