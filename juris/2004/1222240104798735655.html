At any time, either of the prospective contracting parties may stop the negotiation and withdraw the offer.<br><br>In the present case, in fact, there was only an offer and a counteroffer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that did not sum up to any final arrangement containing the elements of a contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, no meeting of minds was established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp;<i>First</i>, only after the bid bond had lapsed were post-qualification proceedings, inspections, and credit investigations conducted.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, the inter-office memoranda issued by petitioner, as well as other memoranda between it and its own project manager, were simply documents to which respondent was not privy.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, petitioner proposed a counteroffer to adjust respondent’s bid to accommodate the wage increase of December 3, 1993.<br><br>In effect, the rule on the concurrence of the offer and its acceptance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> did not apply, because other matters or details — in addition to the subject matter and the consideration — would still be stipulated and agreed upon by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; While there was an initial offer made, there was no acceptance; but when there allegedly came an acceptance that could have had a binding effect, the offer was already lacking.&nbsp; The offer and its acceptance “did not meet to give birth to a contract.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Civil Code provides that no contract shall arise unless its acceptance is communicated to the offeror.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> That is, the mere determination to accept the proposal of a bidder does not constitute a contract; that decision must be communicated to the bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Although consent may be either express or implied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Instruction to Bidders prepared by petitioner itself <i>expressly</i> required (1) a formal acceptance and (2) a period within which such acceptance was to be made known to respondent.&nbsp; The effect of giving the Notice of Award to the latter would have been the perfection of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> No such acceptance was communicated to respondent; therefore, no consent was given.&nbsp; Without that express manifestation, as required by the terms of its proposal, there was no contract.&nbsp; The due execution of documents representing a contract is one thing, but its perfection is another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>There is no issue as regards the subject of the contract or the cause of the obligation.&nbsp; The controversy lies in the consent — whether there was an acceptance by petitioner of the offer made by respondent; <i>and</i>, if so, whether that acceptance was communicated to the latter, thereby perfecting the contract.&nbsp; The period given to the former within which to accept the offer was not itself founded upon or supported by any consideration.&nbsp; Therefore, under the law, respondent still had the freedom and the right to withdraw the offer by communicating such withdrawal to petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> before the latter’s acceptance of the offer;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> or, if the offer has been accepted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> before the acceptance came to be known by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that an acceptance was made, but this allegation has not been proven.&nbsp; Respondent had no knowledge of such acceptance when it communicated its withdrawal to the former.&nbsp; Notably, this right to withdraw was not exercised whimsically or arbitrarily by respondent.&nbsp; It did send a formal letter on April 5, 1994, expressing and explaining its withdrawal.&nbsp; As of that date, the decision to award the contract had not been made according to the terms of the Instruction to Bidders.<br><br>Besides, the subsequent acts between the parties did not even serve as a confirmation of that decision.&nbsp; The existence of a second proposal — petitioner’s request for an adjustment of the bid to accommodate the wage increase — in fact belies the perfection of any contract arising from the first.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> To the Court’s mind, there was indeed no acceptance of the offer made by respondent.&nbsp; Such failure to comply with a condition imposed for the perfection of a contract resulted in failure of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>Subsistence of an Offer<br>Even Without a Bid Bond</i></u></b><br><br>Certainly, the “bid bond is an indispensable requirement for the validation of a bid proposal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> This requisite ensures the good faith of bidders and binds them to enter into a contract with the owner, should their proposal be accepted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> One who submits a bid not only signifies assent to the terms and conditions of a proposal, but impliedly binds oneself to them, if and when the bid is considered.&nbsp; The Invitation to Bidders even provided that incomplete proposals might be sufficient cause for their rejection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> If mere insufficiency of a bond required of a bidder is a ground for rejection, <i>a fortiori</i>, all the more so is the total want thereof.<br><br>The proposal of respondent was merely validated by its bid bond, which was considered by petitioner.&nbsp; The expiration of the bond on January 8, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> did not mean that the bid also lapsed on the same date.&nbsp; The bond, which was an accessory, merely guaranteed the performance of the principal obligation and could not exist without the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The former was given for the benefit of petitioner, which could legally waive it.&nbsp; The bid continued without a bond, but still no formal acceptance was made.&nbsp; Again, on that basis, no contract was perfected.<br><br>In the interpretation of a contract, the literal meaning of its stipulations controls, if their terms are clear and leave no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> When “there is no ambiguity in the language of a contract, there is no room for construction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> only compliance.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> This rule applies to the Instruction to Bidders, which provides that “failure to execute the Contract shall constitute a breach of agreement as effected by acceptance of the proposal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The language is clear and, like contracts in general, is the law between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The contract must be fulfilled according to its literal sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>No Estoppel</i></u></b><br><br>As aptly held by the appellate court, respondent’s acts subsequent to the expiration of the bid bond did not constitute a waiver of Section 9 of the Instruction to Bidders.&nbsp; To be valid and effective, waivers must be couched in clear and unequivocal terms, leaving no doubt as to the intention of those giving up a right or a benefit that legally pertains to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Respondent, contrary to the claim of petitioner, despite its repeated requests, never received a copy of the Notice of Award.&nbsp; Indeed, the former never adopted an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct that caused loss or injury to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The attendance of respondent in the pre-construction conference and the ground-breaking ceremony was part of the negotiation process.&nbsp; Thus, petitioner’s claim of estoppel against it could not be applied.<br><br>“Estoppel cannot be sustained by mere argument or doubtful inference; it must be clearly proved in all its essential elements by clear, convincing and satisfactory evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> It is hardly separable from the waiver of a right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The party claiming estoppel must show the following elements: “(1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) reliance, in good faith, upon the conduct or statements of the party to be estopped; and (3) action or inaction based thereon of such character as to change the position or status of the party claiming the estoppel, to his injury, detriment or prejudice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>None of these elements was proven.<br><br><i>First</i>, petitioner had the knowledge and the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question.&nbsp; It had the means of knowing if respondent had been served a copy of the Notice of Award, yet the former did not preserve a copy of such Notice, which supposedly bore the signature of the latter’s employee who had received it.&nbsp; Petitioner did not even enter in its corporate logbooks the release to and receipt by respondent of that copy.&nbsp; The latter had every reason to withdraw its bid, given that the “prerequisite paper work and attendant processing could not be fast-tracked.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, respondent’s conduct and statements were always consistent and reliable.&nbsp; The manner of acceptance of all bids was prescribed by petitioner itself.&nbsp; Applying Article 1321 of the Civil Code, such prescription must be complied with,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> yet it did not follow its own rules.&nbsp; Of no moment was its reliance in good faith upon respondent.&nbsp; Good faith is always presumed, unless contrary evidence is adduced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>, the action or inaction of petitioner that caused its own injury was its own fault.&nbsp; The written Notice of Award, which constituted the acceptance of the proposal, was a <i>sine qua non</i> to the perfection of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> The misplacement of such vital document was inexcusable.&nbsp; Without it, there was no contract.&nbsp; Moreover, the March 14, 1994 Notice to Proceed clearly stated that its issuance would depend upon the execution of the construction agreement.<br><br>Estoppel is a shield against injustice;
