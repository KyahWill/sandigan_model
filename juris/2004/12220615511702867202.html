				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 25, 1995, complainant Biomie Sarenas-Ochagabia lodged a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against her former counsel, respondent Atty. Balmes L. Ocampos, whose legal services she, together with her aunts Toribia Garban de Detalla and Rosenda Garban vda. de Denore as co-plaintiffs, engaged in Civil Case No. 91-39 before Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court of Ozamis City (for recovery of possession and ownership of a parcel of land).<br><br>An adverse decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> having been rendered against the plaintiffs in above-mentioned civil case on September 7, 1992, Atty. Ocampos filed a notice of appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> at the behest of the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals gave the plaintiffs-appellants 45 days from notice to file their brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> but before the lapse of the period, their counsel Atty. Ocampos, upon motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was granted a 90-day extension of time to file the brief. The extended period lapsed, without, however, any appellants’ brief being filed, prompting the appellate court to dismiss the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The dismissal of the appeal was not challenged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Thus spawned the present complaint against Atty. Ocampos.<br><br>In his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> filed on August 29, 1995, the then 73-year old respondent claimed that he merely agreed to handle the case <i>gratis et amore</i> upon the request of a friend who is incidentally the son-in-law of herein complainant and Clerk of Court of one of the city courts in Ozamis City. And he explained that he appeared only at the later part of the proceedings when defendants were already presenting their evidence, he adding that when the decision of the trial court was promulgated, the plaintiffs’ principal counsel, Atty. Placidtrank Osorio, was out of town, hence, he was requested by the plaintiffs to appeal the decision before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Respondent additionally claimed that he was constrained to ask for extension of time within which to file appellants’ brief due to pressure of work and gastrointestinal illness, and that he had in fact made arrangements with herein complainant to ask Atty. Osorio to, in his stead, prepare the brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finally, Atty. Ocampos claimed that based on the evidence presented before the trial court, the possibility that the decision of the trial court would be reversed was remote, hence, no serious or irreparable damage could have been caused by the dismissal of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The complaint was referred by this Court on September 20, 1995 to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for “investigation and [recommendation].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Upon motion of complainant, venue of the investigation was transferred to Ozamis City, all the parties being residents thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In her Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> submitted on June 9, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> complainant reiterated her charge in her complaint, she contending that respondent violated his duty to inform her of his failure to file appellants’ brief and of the dismissal of the appeal. Worse, complainant went on, respondent denied such dismissal when she asked him about the status of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Despite the grant of respondent’s motion for extension of time to submit his position paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> he failed to submit one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The committee created for the purpose of investigating the case in Ozamis City thereupon recommended that the case be resolved on the basis of the pleadings and records on file.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Investigating Commissioner Victoria G. de los Reyes, in her Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated August 29, 2003, faulted respondent for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, “particularly Rule 18.01<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and Rule 18.03 x x x,” and recommended the imposition of the penalty of suspension for six months, she observing as follows:<br><blockquote>It is worthwhile to mention here that in the case of “<b><i>In re Santiago F. Marcos</i></b>, 156 SCRA 844 (1987)”, a lawyer’s failure to file brief for his client amounts to inexcusable negligence. x x x<br><br>In the instant case, the respondent Atty. Ocampos had no justifiable excuse for not preparing and filing the needed appellants’ brief. Granting that he was ill during that time, he could have written to the complainant about it so that the latter will be able to hire another lawyer to handle the case for her and to prepare and file the appellants’ brief. He also failed to make the necessary Manifestation and Motion with the Court of Appeals. Sad to state, the respondent failed to do all these in blatant violation of his duty towards his client and to the Courts.<br><br>We therefore maintain that a lawyer’s neglect of duty should not be tolerated and for such inaction he has to be penalized.<br><br>The undersigned Commissioner could have recommended for a stiffer penalty. But considering that he is now in the twilight years of his life, and for humanitarian reasons, it is recommended that he just be suspended from the practice of law. (Emphasis in the original)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>By Resolution of September 27, 2003, the IBP Board of Governors adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner with the modification that the penalty of suspension should only be for four months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>This Court finds the IBP Board Resolution faulting respondent in order. A lawyer engaged to represent a client in a case bears the responsibility of protecting the latter’s interest with utmost diligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> By failing to file appellants’ brief, respondent was remiss in the discharge of such responsibility. He thus violated the Code of Professional Responsibility which provides:<br><blockquote>Rule 12.03. A lawyer shall not, after obtaining extensions of time to file pleadings, memoranda or briefs, let the period lapse without submitting the same or offering an explanation for his failure to do so.<br><br>Rule 18.03. A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable.<br></blockquote>That respondent accepted to represent complainant et al. <i>gratis et amore</i> does not justify his failure to exercise due diligence in the performance of his duty to file appellants’ brief. Every case a lawyer accepts deserves full attention, diligence, skill, and competence regardless of its importance and whether he accepts it for a fee or for free.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>It bears emphasis that a client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy and defense that is authorized by the law and expects his lawyer to assert every such remedy or defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondent’s claim that he conferred with complainant to request Atty. Osorio to draft and file the appellants’ brief does not persuade, especially given his filing of a motion of extension of time to file brief upon the grounds therein stated, without him mentioning that Atty. Osorio was going to be the one to prepare and file it.<br><br>Until his final release from the professional relationship with a client, a counsel of record is under obligation to protect the client’s interest. That is why if a party has a counsel of record, a court does not recognize any other representation on behalf thereof unless it is in collaboration with such counsel of record or until a formal substitution of counsel is effected. Since respondent had not then withdrawn as counsel as he, it bears repeating, in fact filed a motion for extension of time to file brief, he was under obligation to discharge his professional responsibility.<br><br>As for complainant’s allegation that respondent denied that the appeal was dismissed by the appellate court, it does not merit consideration, no factual finding thereof being reflected in the IBP Report and Recommendation.<br><br>A word on the penalty to be imposed. In administrative complaints, this Court has exercised its discretion on what penalty to impose on the basis of the facts thereof. Thus, for a lawyer’s failure to file a brief or other pleading, this Court imposed penalties ranging from reprimand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> warning with fine,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> suspension<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and, in aggravated cases, disbarment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the present case, owing to respondent’s advanced age, this Court imposes upon him the penalty of suspension for three months.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, respondent Atty. Balmes L. Ocampos is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for three (3) months effective upon the finality hereof, with WARNING that a repetition thereof will be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Vitug, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez,</i> and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 4-22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 34-36.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 19-20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 31-36.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 31.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 32.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 33.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 41.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 53, 147.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 114-125.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 148.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 117.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 139.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 141.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 141, 148.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 145-149.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Rule 18.01.
