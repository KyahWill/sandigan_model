The PSB disapproved his application.&nbsp; Nevertheless, respondent Rogelio Miranda paid the first quarterly installment on the petitioners’ loan on March 21, 1986 in the amount of <s>P</s>29,190.28.&nbsp; The said amount was paid for the account of the petitioners.&nbsp; Respondent Rogelio Miranda, likewise, paid the second quarterly installment in the amount of <s>P</s>29,459.00 on June 23, 1986, also for the account of the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, respondent Rogelio Miranda secured the services of petitioner Orlando Rayos as his counsel in a suit he filed against the Manila Banking Corporation, relative to a loan from the bank in the amount of <s>P</s>100,000.00.&nbsp; Both parties agreed to the payment of attorney’s fees, as follows:<blockquote>Our agreement is as follows:<br><ol><li>You will pay me <s>P</s>700.00 as filing fee and other miscellaneous expenses which I personally received from you this morning;</li><br><li>Award to you of any amount in terms of moral, exemplary or actual and other forms of damages shall accrue to you in the amount of 70% thereof;</li><br><li>30% of the award to you in the concept of No. 2 hereof shall pertain to me as my contingent fee;</li><br><li>All attorney’s fees that the court shall award to me or by the management of TMBC if they agree to extrajudicially settle shall pertain exclusively to me;</li><br><li>Execution of judgment expenses shall be for your account;</li><br><li>Should the case be appealed, my contingent fee shall increase by 10% if the appeal is to the Intermediate Appellate Court on questions of facts and law, and if appealed from there to the Supreme Court, then another 10% shall accrue to me.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>On May 14, 1986, petitioner Orlando Rayos filed respondent Rogelio Miranda’s complaint against the bank with the Regional Trial Court of Makati, docketed as Civil Case No. 13670.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In the meantime, the latter paid the third quarterly installment on the PSB loan account amounting to <s>P</s>29,215.66, for which the bank issued a receipt for the account of the petitioners.<br><br>The parties executed a Compromise Agreement in Civil Case No. 13670 in which they agreed that each party shall pay for the respective fees of their respective counsels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The trial court rendered judgment on October 23, 1986 based on the said compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Petitioner Orlando Rayos demanded the payment of attorney’s fees in the amount of <s>P</s>5,631.93, but respondent Rogelio Miranda refused to pay.<br><br>On November 12, 1986, petitioner Orlando Rayos wrote to respondent Rogelio Miranda and enclosed a copy of his motion in Civil Case No. 13670 for the annotation of his attorney’s lien at the dorsal portion of the latter’s title used as security for the loan with the Manila Banking Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The respondent opposed the motion, claiming that the petitioner agreed to render professional services on a contingent basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Orlando Rayos again wrote respondent Rogelio Miranda on November 30, 1986, reminding the latter of the last quarterly payment of his loan with the PSB.&nbsp; He also advised the respondent to thereafter request the bank for the cancellation of the mortgage on his property and to receive the owner’s duplicate of his title over the same.&nbsp; Petitioner Orlando Rayos also wrote that their dispute over his attorney’s fees in Civil Case No. 13670 should be treated differently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Orlando Rayos then received a Letter dated November 27, 1986 from the PSB, reminding him that his loan with the bank would mature on December 24, 1986, and that it expected him to pay his loan on or before the said date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Fearing that the respondents would not be able to pay the amount due, petitioner Orlando Rayos paid <s>P</s>27,981.41<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to the bank on December 12, 1986, leaving the balance of <s>P</s>1,048.04.&nbsp; In a Letter dated December 18, 1986, the petitioner advised the PSB not to turn over to the respondents the owner’s duplicate of the title over the subject property, even if the latter paid the last quarterly installment on the loan, as they had not assumed the payment of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On December 24, 1986, respondent Rogelio Miranda arrived at the PSB to pay the last installment on the petitioners’ loan in the amount of <s>P</s>29,223.67.&nbsp; He informed the bank that the petitioners had executed a deed of sale with assumption of mortgage in their favor, and that he was paying the balance of the loan, conformably to said deed.&nbsp; On the other hand, the bank informed the respondent that it was not bound by said deed, and showed petitioner Orlando Rayos’ Letter dated December 18, 1986.&nbsp; The respondent was also informed that the petitioners had earlier paid the amount of <s>P</s>27,981.41 on the loan.&nbsp; The bank refused respondent Rogelio Miranda’s offer to pay the loan, and confirmed its refusal in a Letter dated December 24, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On even date, respondent Rogelio Miranda wrote the PSB, tendering the amount of <s>P</s>29,223.67 and enclosed Interbank Check No. 01193344 payable to PSB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thereafter, on December 29, 1986, the petitioners paid the balance of their loan with the bank in the amount of <s>P</s>1,081.39 and were issued a receipt therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> On January 2, 1987, the PSB wrote respondent Rogelio Miranda that it was returning his check.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On January 2, 1987, respondent Rogelio Miranda filed a complaint against the petitioners and the PSB for damages with a prayer for a writ of preliminary attachment with the RTC of Makati.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 15639 and raffled to Branch 61 of the court.&nbsp; The respondent alleged <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span> that the petitioners and the PSB conspired to prevent him from paying the last quarterly payment of the petitioners’ loan with the bank, despite the existence of the deed of sale with assumption of mortgage executed by him and the petitioners, and in refusing to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn over the owner’s duplicate of TCT No. 100156, thereby preventing the transfer of the title to the property in his name.&nbsp; Respondent Rogelio Miranda prayed that:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, ordering the latter, jointly and severally, as follows:<ol type="A"><li>To pay to plaintiff the sum of <s>P</s>267,197.33, with legal interest from date of demand, as actual or compensatory damages representing the unreturned price of the land;</li><br><li>To pay to plaintiff the sum of <s>P</s>500,000.00 as consequential damages;</li><br><li>To pay to plaintiff the sum of <s>P</s>1,000,000.00 as moral damages;</li><br><li>To pay to plaintiff the sum of <s>P</s>100,000.00 as exemplary damages by way of example or correction for the public good;</li><br><li>To pay to plaintiff the sum of <s>P</s>100,000.00 for and as attorney’s fees;</li><br><li>To pay for the costs of suit;

No. 87-150.&nbsp; He, likewise, filed a complaint for disbarment in this Court against petitioner Orlando Rayos, docketed as Administrative Case No. 2974.&nbsp; Unaware of the said complaint, the petitioner wrote the respondent on January 3, 1986 that as soon as his payment to the PSB of <s>P</s>29,223.67 was refunded, the owner’s duplicate of the title would be released to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On January 5, 1986, petitioner Orlando Rayos wrote respondent Rogelio Miranda, reiterating that he would release the title in exchange for his cash settlement of <s>P</s>29,421.41.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The respondent failed to respond.<br><br>In the meantime, the PSB executed on January 8, 1987 a Release of Real Estate Mortgage in favor of the petitioners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and released the owner’s duplicate of title of TCT No. 100156.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> On January 17, 1987, petitioner Orlando Rayos wrote respondent Rogelio Miranda, reiterating his stance in his Letters of January 3 and 5, 1987.<br><br>In the meantime, the petitioners received the complaint in Civil Case No. 15639 and filed their Answer with Counterclaim in which they alleged that:<blockquote><ol start="14"><li>That plaintiff has no cause of action against defendants Rayos, the latter are willing to deliver the title sought by plaintiff under the terms set out in their letters dated January 3, 5, 17, and 20, hereto marked as Annexes “1,” “1-A,” “1-B” and “1-C;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner Orlando Rayos filed a complaint on February 1, 1987 against respondent Rogelio Miranda with the Regional Trial Court of Makati, docketed as Civil Case No. 15984 for Specific Performance with Damages for the collection of the amount of <s>P</s>29,223.67 which he had paid to the PSB on&nbsp; December 12 and 19, 1986, and his attorney’s fees in Civil Case No. 13670.&nbsp; The trial court consolidated the cases in Branch 62 of the RTC.<br><br>Respondent Rogelio Miranda filed an Amended Complaint in Civil Case No. 15639 for specific performance with damages, impleading the officers of the PSB as parties-defendants.&nbsp; He alleged that of the purchase price of the property of <s>P</s>214,000.00, he had paid the entirety thereof to the petitioners, and that petitioner Orlando Rayos acted unethically in trying to collect <s>P</s>5,631.93 from him as his attorney’s fees in Civil Case No. 13670, and in having such claim annotated at the dorsal portion of his title over the property he mortgaged to the Manila&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banking Corporation.<br><br>Respondent Rogelio Miranda prayed that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in his favor, thus:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, as follows:<ol type="A"><li>Ordering defendants spouses Orlando A.

No. 87-150, as cited by this Court in its decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Miranda v. Rayos</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> where it was also held that petitioner Orlando Rayos paid the last quarterly installment because he thought that the respondents would not be able to pay the same.&nbsp; The petitioners argue that they had no other alternative but to pay the last quarterly installment due on their loan with the PSB, considering that they received a demand letter from the bank on November 28, 1986, coupled by its denial of the respondents’ request to assume the payment of the loan.&nbsp; They insist that they did not block the respondents’ payment of the balance of the loan with the bank.&nbsp; The petitioners contend that even if the parties committed a breach of their respective obligations under the contract to sell, it behooved the Court of Appeals to apply Article 1192 of the Civil Code in the instant case, which reads:<blockquote>… The power to rescind obligation is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<br><br>The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case.&nbsp; He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.<br><br>The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.<br><br>This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with articles 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law.</blockquote>The petition has no merit.<br><br>The assailed ruling of the Court of Appeals reads:<blockquote>After due study, the Court finds that there was no basis in fact and law for the appellants to usurp the payment of the last amortization on the mortgage upon the parcel of land it had conveyed to the Mirandas.&nbsp; Even if the appellants wanted to keep their good credit standing, they should not have preempted Miranda in paying the final amortization.&nbsp; There is no sufficient showing that Miranda was in danger of defaulting on the said payment.&nbsp; In fact, it appears that he approached the bank to tender payment, but he was refused by the bank, because he was beaten to the draw, so to speak, by the appellants.&nbsp; Appellants were able to do so because, for some reasons, the Mirandas’ assumption of the mortgage has not been approved by the bank.&nbsp; In doing so, the appellants had unilaterally cancelled the deed of sale with assumption of mortgage, without the consent of the Mirandas.&nbsp; This conduct by the appellants is, to say the least, injudicious as under Article 1308 of the Civil Code, contracts must bind both contracting parties and their validity or compliance cannot be left to the will of one of them.<br><br>Just as nobody can be forced to enter into a contract, in the same manner, once a contract is entered into, no party can renounce it unilaterally or without the consent of the other.&nbsp; It is a general principle of law that no one may be permitted to change his mind or disavow and go back upon his own acts, or to proceed contrary thereto, to the prejudice of the other party.&nbsp; In a regime of law and order, repudiation of an agreement validly entered into cannot be made without any ground or reason in law or in fact for such repudiation.<br><br>In the same way that the Rayos spouses must respect their contract with the Mirandas for the sale of real property and assumption of mortgage, Rogelio Miranda has to recognize his obligations under his agreement to pay contingent attorney’s fees to Orlando Rayos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>The Court of Appeals erred in so ruling.<br><br>The findings and disquisitions of the Court of Appeals cannot prevail over our findings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Miranda v. Rayos</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> a case which involves the same parties, and where we held that the petitioners cannot be faulted for paying the amortization due for the last quarterly installment on their loan with the PSB:<blockquote>It is difficult to imagine that complainant would be so naïve as to be totally unaware of the provisions of the original contract between the PSB and the spouses Rayos.&nbsp; He is a degree holder (A.B. Pre-Law and B.S.C.) and Acting Municipal Treasurer of Las Piñas.&nbsp; In short, he is not an ordinary layman.&nbsp; As a buyer with a knowledge of law, it was unnatural for him to read the provisions of the real estate mortgage wherein it is provided, among others, that the sale of the property covered by the mortgage does not in any manner relieve the mortgagor of his obligation but that “on the contrary, both the vendor and the vendee, or the party in whose favor the alienation or encumbrance is made shall be, jointly and severally, liable for said mortgage obligations.” There is every reason to believe that it was pursuant to the said provision in the real estate mortgage that complainant tried to assume the loan obligation of the Rayoses by filling up and submitted the loan application (page 30, records) sent by Orland Rayos.&nbsp; By signing the loan application and the general information sheet (page 31, records) in connection with said application, complainant showed that he knew that there was a need to formally apply to the bank in order for him to assume the mortgage.<br><br>We find respondent spouses’ version that when complainant’s application to assume the mortgage loan was disapproved he begged that he be allowed to pay the quarterly amortization credible, owing to the fact that complainant made the payments for the account of the Rayoses.&nbsp; Hence, complainant knew that since his application to the PSB was not approved, there was no substitution of parties and so he had to pay for the account of respondent spouses as shown by the receipts issued by the PSB.<br><br>As for the charge that Rayos paid the last installment to block complainant from getting the title and transferring the same to his name, respondents’ version is more satisfactory and convincing.&nbsp; Respondent Orland Rayos paid the last amortization when it became apparent that complainant would not be able to give the payment on the due date as he was still trying to sell his Lancer car.&nbsp; Even if complainant was able to pay the last installment of the mortgage loan, the title would not be released to him as he knew very well that his application to assume the mortgage was disapproved and he had no personality as far as PSB was concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote>Contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals, the petitioners did not unilaterally cancel their contract to sell with the respondents when they paid the total amount of <s>P</s>29,062.80 to the PSB in December 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In fact, the petitioners wrote the respondents on January 3, 5 and 17, 1987, that they were ready to execute the deed of absolute sale and turn over the owner’s duplicate of TCT No. 100156 upon the respondents’ remittance of the amount of <s>P</s>29,223.67.&nbsp; The petitioners reiterated the same stance in their Answer with Counterclaim in Civil Case No. 15639.&nbsp; The petitioners cannot, likewise, be faulted for refusing to execute a deed of absolute sale over the property in favor of the respondents, and in refusing to turn over the owner’s duplicate of TCT No. 100156 unless the respondents refunded the said amount.&nbsp; The respondents were obliged under the contract to sell to pay the said amount to the PSB as part of the purchase price of the property.&nbsp; On the other hand, it cannot be argued by the petitioners that the respondents committed a breach of their obligation when they refused to refund the said amount.<br><br>It bears stressing that the petitioners and the respondents executed two interrelated contracts, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>: the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage dated December 26, 1985, and the Contract to Sell dated January 29, 1986.&nbsp; To determine the intention of the parties, the two contracts must be read and interpreted together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Under the two contracts, the petitioners bound and obliged themselves to execute a deed of absolute sale over the property and transfer title thereon to the respondents after the payment of the full purchase price of the property, inclusive of the quarterly installments due on the petitioners’ loan with the PSB:<blockquote><ol start="3"><li>That upon full payment of the consideration hereof, the SELLER shall execute a Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of the BUYER that the payment of capital gains tax shall be for the account of the SELLER and that documentary stamps, transfer tax, registration expenses for the transfer of title including the notarization and preparation of this Contract and subsequent documents if any are to be executed, real estate taxes from January 1, 1986 and other miscellaneous expenses shall be for the account of the BUYER; the SELLER hereby represents that all association dues has been paid but that subsequent to the execution of this Contract the payment of the same shall devolve upon the BUYER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Construing the contracts together, it is evident that the parties executed <span style="font-style: italic;">a contract to sell and not a contract of sale</span>.&nbsp; The petitioners retained ownership without further remedies by the respondents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> until the payment of the purchase price of the property in full.&nbsp; Such payment is a positive suspensive condition, failure of which is not really a breach, serious or otherwise, but an event that prevents the obligation of the petitioners to convey title from arising, in accordance with Article 1184 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Lacanilao v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> we held that:<blockquote>It is well established that where the seller promised to execute a deed of absolute sale upon completion of payment of the purchase price by the buyer, the agreement is a contract to sell.&nbsp; In contracts to sell, where ownership is retained by the seller until payment of the price in full, such payment is a positive suspensive condition, failure of which is not really a breach but an event that prevents the obligation of the vendor to convey title in accordance with Article 1184 of the Civil Code.</blockquote>The non-fulfillment by the respondent of his obligation to pay, which is a suspensive condition to the obligation of the petitioners to sell and deliver the title to the property, rendered the contract to sell ineffective and without force and effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The parties stand as if the conditional obligation had never existed.&nbsp; Article 1191 of the New Civil Code will not apply because it presupposes an obligation already extant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> There can be no rescission of an obligation that is still non-existing, the suspensive condition not having happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>However, the respondents may reinstate the contract to sell by paying the <s>P</s>29,223.67, and the petitioners may agree thereto and accept the respondents’ late payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">In this case, the petitioners had decided before and after the respondents filed this complaint in Civil Case No. 15639 to accept the payment of <s>P</s>29,223.67, to execute the deed of absolute sale over the property and cause the transfer of the title of the subject property to the respondents.&nbsp; The petitioners even filed its amended complaint in Civil Case No. 15984 for the collection of the said amount</span>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals cannot, thus, be faulted for affirming the decision of the trial court and ordering the petitioners to convey the property to the respondents upon the latter’s payment of the amount of <s>P</s>29,223.67, provided that the property has not been sold to a third-party who acted in good faith.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is DENIED DUE COURSE.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
