Philippine General Hospital Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, who examined the complainant; (3) Eldee Eusebio; and (4) Dante Magat.<br><br>The Solicitor General summarized the prosecution’s version of the incident in the People’s Brief as follows:<br><blockquote>On December 31, 1999, about 7 o’clock in the evening, appellant and his companions (names not on record) were having a drinking spree outside the house of Jun Rianzares xxx. (p. 5, TSN, May 22, 2000).<br><br>About 2 o’clock in the morning of the following day or right after the New Year’s eve celebration, Jun Rianzares left their house to see a friend. His wife, Rowena Rianzares, was left behind sleeping inside the room of their house with their daughter [six (6) years old] and son [three (3) years old] (pp. 3-4, <i>ibid</i>.).<br><br>After a while, Rowena Rianzares heard a knock at the door of their room. Consequently, she rose from the bed and partially opened the door to look [at] who was knocking. It was appellant. Appellant tried to push open the door, telling Rowena Rianzares that her husband was asking for money to buy liquor. Rowena Rianzares got suspicious because her husband had money at that time and he would not ask money from her. Rowena Rianzares thus closed the door (pp. 3-5, <i>ibid</i>.)<br><br>Thereafter, Rowena Rianzares went back to sleep. A few minutes later, she heard appellant upstairs repeatedly shouting that her husband was very mad because he did not have money to buy liquor. When she heard appellant say that her husband was allegedly mad, she opened the door of their room and went out. She went inside appellant’s room which was located in front of their room to confront him. She told appellant: “<i>Bakit hihingi ng pera si Kuya Jun mo may pera naman siya?</i>” Immediately thereafter, appellant rushed to her back and placed his left arm around her neck with his right hand holding a kitchen knife, about twelve (12) inches long (pp. 5-6 and 12, <i>ibid</i>.).<br><br>Rowena Rianzares got surprised and, consequently, pushed appellant’s left arm. In the process, Rowena Rianzares got off balance and fell down xxx the stairway screaming. She asked for help shouting her husband’s name (p. 11, <i>ibid</i>.)<br><br>Appellant immediately went after Rowena Rianzares and upon catching up with her, appellant held her hair and left arm. He then dragged her upstairs towards his (appellant’s) room (pp. 5-6, <i>ibid</i>.)<br><br>Inside the room, appellant asked Rowena Rianzares to undress while pointing the knife he was holding at her right rear side of the body. He threatened to kill Rowena Rianzares if she did not undress herself. Out of fear, she was forced to undress herself.<br><br>Then, appellant kissed the different parts of her body. Rowena Rianzares struggled and resisted. She grappled for possession of the knife and succeeded in holding its bladed portion causing her injury on the right palm. She persisted in grappling for possession of the knife but failed. In the process, she sustained a further injury on her left arm. Instead of relenting, appellant pulled her and slapped the back of her head. Thereafter, appellant dragged and forced her to lie down on the lower portion of the double [deck] bed located inside appellant’s room (pp. 6-13, <i>ibid</i>.).<br><br>While Rowena Rianzares was xxx lying down xxx with her legs spread apart, appellant placed himself on top of her. He placed his left foot under Rowena Rianzares’ left leg and his right foot on Rowena Rianzares’ right leg. While in that position, appellant forced his private organ into Rowena Rianzares’ private part. Rowena Rianzares continued to shout for help but appellant poked the knife at the left side of her body. While appellant was raping her, he pointed the knife at Rowena Rianzares’ private part and told her that he wanted to get [a] thrill out of it because he could not get a full erection since he was under the influence of “shabu.” Rowena Rianzares pleaded [with] appellant to stop and assured him that she would help him get out xxx but appellant remained unmoved (pp. 13-17, <i>ibid</i>.).<br><br>About ten (10) minutes after Rowena Rianzares was dragged by appellant to his room, somebody knocked at appellant’s door and shouted: “<i>Bernie ano ba ang ginagawa mo dyan?</i>” Appellant answered back: “<i>Umalis kayo kundi papatayin ko ito.</i> “ (pp. 18-19, <u>ibid</u>.).<br><br>Eldee Eusebio, a neighbor of spouses Jun and Rowena Rianzares at Firmeza Street, Sampaloc, Manila (p. 7, TSN, May 30, 2000), testified that on January 1, 2000, about 2:15 in the morning, he went to the house of his <i>Kuya</i> Jose “Jun” Rianzares because he was summoned by the latter (p. 4, TSN, May 30, 2000). When he was about to enter the house, Eldee Eusebio heard Rowena Rianzares shout. Immediately, Eldee Eusebio kicked the entrance gate of the house to open it. He then hurriedly went upstairs and saw Rowena Rianzares using her feet in trying to prevent the door of appellant’s room from closing. After the door was closed, he immediately knocked at the door. Appellant, however, shouted, telling him to leave and nobody should go up; otherwise, he would kill Rowena Rianzares (pp. 4-5, <u>ibid</u>.).<br><br>Consequently, Eldee Eusebio went outside the house to look for Jun Rianzares because he did not see him inside the house. When he found Jun Rianzares, he told him that there was a problem in his house (p. 5, <u>ibid</u>.).<br><br>About thirty (30) minutes later, Rowena Rianzares’ husband arrived. Jun Rianzares knocked at appellant’s door and asked appellant what was he doing to his wife. Appellant pounded the floor, using the handle of the knife and shouted. He asked Jun Rianzares to leave him alone; otherwise, he would kill his wife (pp. 18-19, May 22, 2000).<br><br>Thirty (30) minutes thereafter, Barangay Councilor Nida Magat, together with her husband, Dante Magat, arrived. She and her relatives negotiated for Rowena Rianzares’ release. However, appellant told them to leave; otherwise, he would kill Rowena Rianzares. While they were negotiating for Rowena Rianzares’ release, appellant was still on top of her (Rowena Rianzares) (pp. 19-20, <u>ibid</u>.).<br><br>After more than an hour of failed negotiations by Barangay Councilor Nida Magat, the policemen took over (pp. 2-4, TSN, July 11, 2000).<br><br>The policemen (names not on record) forcibly opened the door and immediately, thereafter, they got hold of appellant. Before they could get hold of appellant, however, he (appellant tried to stab Rowena Rianzares but the latter was able to evade the thrust. Instead, she was hit on her left arm. Then a certain Colonel Castro pulled Rowena Rianzares and immediately covered her with a blanket (p. 20, TSN, May 22, 2000).<br><br>xxx<br><br>Dr. Mirasol Pangan testified that she was the one who physically examined Rowena Rianzares. She testified that she examined Rowena Rianzares’ body from head to foot. She found the following injuries on her body:<br><ol><li>one (1) hematoma on the right neck;<br></li><li>two (2) abrasions at the left lower hip approximately 0.5cm.;<br></li><li>one (1) abrasion at the left forearm;<br></li><li>one (1) abrasion hematoma-circular at the left lower arm;<br></li><li>multiple abrasion hematoma at the volar aspect of the second, fourth digits of right hand and under the nose;<br></li><li>one (1) hematoma at the back and the anterior tract the largest of which measures 6 x1 cm.;<br></li><li>one (1) stab wound at the left forearm; and<br></li><li>one (1) hematoma measuring two cm. at the right labia minora of the genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><center><b><i>Version of the Defense<br><br></i></b></center>Appellant Leonardo Nuguid was the sole witness for the defense. The Public Attorney summarized the defense’s version of what transpired, as follows:<br><blockquote>Leonardo Nuguid testified that he knew the victim because he worked in the latter’s Manila K-9 college as their dog trainer. He had been working with the Rianzares [spouses] for five (5) years. (TSN, September 11, 2000, pp. 1-4)<br><br>On December 31, 1999 at about 10:30 p.m., Rowena Rianzares entered his room. He asked her what she wanted but Rowena did not answer and instead she kissed him on the lips. He had sex with Rowena and the latter’s husband arrived. Jun called up for Rowena but the latter told her husband that she was in the accused-appellant’s room talking with the latter. Jun left at around 11:00 pm and Rowena stayed in his room until the police called by her husband arrived. He told Rowena to go out of the room but the latter refused to do so. The police kept on convincing them to go out of the room but Rowena told them that they were just talking and they would go out soon. The police kicked the door open and he was arrested. He was brought to the police station wherein he was mauled and was forced to confess that he raped Rowena. The first time he had sexual intercourse with Rowena was the middle of 1998 when they went to Bulacan. Rowena told her then that she saw in him what was lacking in her husband. Rowena’s husband was an alcoholic and a drug user. He does not know why she filed [t]his serious illegal detention with rape [charge] against him. (TSN, September 11, 2000, pp. 1-15)<br><br>He testified that he had worked with Rianzares from 1995-2000.&nbsp; There was a time he had an argument with Jun so he was asked to leave the Rianzares’ house. (TSN, September 11,2000, pp. 15-16)<br><br>The first time he had sexual intercourse with Rowena was when they went to Bulacan to get rice from Rowena’s parents. Prior to January 1, 2000, he had several sexual intercourse (sic) with Rowena. Rowena gave him several lovenotes but he lost them all. (TSN, September 11, 2000, pp. 15-16)<br><br>On January 1, 2000, he did not notice that Rowena was bleeding when she emerged from the room. He was holding a knife when the police arrested him because he was forced to fight back at the police who were mauling him inside his room. He had a kitchen knife inside his room because Rowena’s husband told him to bring the kitchen knife inside him (sic) room so that he could easily open the box of firecrackers in case anybody came to buy. (TSN, September 11, 2000, pp. 24-30)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The trial court considered the testimonies of Rowena and the other prosecution witnesses to be straightforward and credible. The physical injuries Rowena suffered, confirmed by the examining physician and observed by the trial court, corroborated her version of the events.<br><br>On the other hand, the trial court found dubious appellant’s story that he and Rowena were sweethearts. The trial court held that:<br><blockquote>The accused’s sweetheart defense is of doubtful nature and undeserving of credence. Firstly, the accused’s version of the incident is unnatural and contrary to common human experience. If it was true that the complainant was in the accused’s room on the second floor at 11:00 p.m., when her husband called her from the ground floor, she would surely had quickly gotten out of the room, instead of coolly telling her husband that she was with the accused in the latter’s room. Secondly, the accused’s declaration is contradicted not only by the straightforward, convincing and believable testimonies of the complainant and prosecution witnesses Eusebio and Magat, but also by the physical evidence of the injuries sustained by the complainant on the occasion of the commission of the crime, Exhibits “F” and “F-1 “.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court ruled that the acts of the appellant in locking up Rowena against her will in his room for three hours, threatening to kill her and then sexually assaulting her, constituted the crime of serious illegal detention with rape. The dispositive portion of the trial court’s Decision of 16 May 2001 reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the accused Leonardo Nuguid y Mayao, is hereby convicted of the crime of serious illegal detention with rape under Article 267 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer the severe penalty of death by lethal injection and accessory penalties provided by law and to pay the costs.<br><br>On the civil liability of the accused, he is also sentenced to pay the complainant, Rowena Rianzares y Miranda, moral and nominal damages in the respective sums of P100,000.00 and P50,000.00, with interest thereon at the legal rate of 6% per annum from this date until fully paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<br><center><br><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>Appellant seeks the reversal of his conviction by contending that:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING APPELLANT OF SERIOUS ILLEGAL DETENTION WITH RAPE WHEN THE LATTER’S GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant, arguing through the Public Attorney, alleged that the trial court erred in rejecting his sweetheart defense, which was not unlikely since he spent most of his time with Rowena. In the alternative, appellant claims he is liable only for simple rape because the prosecution failed to show that his primary purpose was to detain Rowena, thus:<br><blockquote>xxx It is undeniable that the accused-appellant’s primary purpose was to have carnal knowledge of Rowena Rianzares. The accused-appellant immediately ordered Rowena Rianzares to undress and raped her. As a matter of fact, even at the time the police forcibly opened the door, Rowena and the accused-appellant were still both naked and the accused-appellant was still positioned on top of Rowena.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>The Solicitor General agreed that appellant is only liable for simple rape under Article 335<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code because: (1) it necessarily follows from the Court’s ruling in <b><i>People v. Lactao</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> that there is no complex crime of illegal detention with rape;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and (2) appellant did not release Rowena after the rape only because her husband and the police were outside appellant’s room.<br><br>In the Reply Brief, the Public Attorney raised as an additional ground for reversal the presiding judge’s alleged lack of impartiality in deciding the case.<br><center><br><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b><br></center><br>The Court shall first discuss the Solicitor General’s contention that there is no complex crime of serious illegal detention with rape. &nbsp;In <b><i>People v. Lactao</i></b>, the Court ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>It may be worth to mention at the outset that there is <u>no complex crime of rape with serious illegal detention</u>. &nbsp;If the purpose is to deprive the offended party of liberty, the crime committed is illegal detention. &nbsp;And, if during the course of the illegal detention, the offended party is raped, a separate crime of rape is committed; in this instance, two independent crimes are committed. However, if the objective of the offender is to rape the victim only, and in the process, the latter had to be illegally detained, only the crime of rape is committed since illegal detention is deemed absorbed in rape.<br><br>Hence, in <i>People v. Ching Suy Sionga</i>, Sionga was found guilty of two independent crimes, i.e., serious illegal detention and acts of lasciviousness, because the two acts did not come within the purview of Art. 48 of the Revised Penal Code which applies to complex crimes, for certainly, one cannot be considered as a means to commit the other. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The decision in <b><i>Lactao</i></b>, promulgated on 29 October 1993, explained the rules on the treatment of serious illegal detention and rape at that time. Prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 7659 (“RA 7659”) on 31 December 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> when the person kidnapped or illegally detained was raped, two independent crimes of kidnapping and rape were committed.<br><br>RA 7659, however, amended the last paragraph of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code on serious illegal detention and kidnapping to read:<br><br><b>When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed.</b><br><br>Under this provision, when the person kidnapped or illegally detained is raped, the offense committed is the <b>special complex crime</b> of serious illegal detention or kidnapping with rape, punishable with the maximum penalty of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The last paragraph of Article 267 applies only to instances where the person illegally detained or kidnapped is raped. It does not provide for a <b>complex crime</b> of rape with serious illegal detention. &nbsp;As the Court ruled in <b><i>Lactao</i></b>, there is no complex crime of illegal detention with rape under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code. &nbsp;There is also no complex crime of kidnapping with attempted rape under Article 48 because there is no single act which results in two or more grave or less grave felonies. &nbsp;Neither is illegal detention a necessary means for committing rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court concurs with the Public Attorney and the Solicitor General that the crime committed in this case is not serious illegal detention with rape. Rather, appellant is guilty of rape qualified by the use of a deadly weapon.<br><br>The elements of kidnapping and serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> are: (1) the offender is a private individual; (2) he kidnaps or detains another or in any other manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (3) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (4) in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances is present: (a) the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than 3 days; or (b) it is committed by simulating public authority; or (c) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or (d) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The essence of illegal detention is the deprivation of the victim’s liberty. &nbsp;The prosecution must prove actual confinement or restriction of the victim, and that such deprivation was the intention of the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The accused must have acted purposely or knowingly to restrain the victim because what constitutes the offense is taking coupled with intent to restrain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Public Attorney that the facts in the present case indicate that appellant’s principal objective was not to deprive Rowena of her liberty. &nbsp;We quote from the findings of the trial court:<br><blockquote>xxx Caught by surprise, the complainant struggled to free herself from the hold of the accused and ran down the stairway, but in her haste she stumbled and fell down.&nbsp; The accused followed her down; held her hair and left hand and dragged her upstairs to his room, while she shouted for help. Once inside the room, the accused forced the complainant to undressed (sic) and then he kissed all the parts of her body.&nbsp; The complainant tried to resist and in the process, she sustained a wound in her left arm and a knife wound in her right palm, Exhibit “F”.&nbsp; The accused forced the complainant to lie on a bed and placed himself on top of her and at the same time position his knees between her legs and forced them to separate.&nbsp; After which he proceeded to rape her, and while doing so, he remarked to her, “<i>Weng</i> (complainant’s nickname), <i>pasensiya ka na. Nakabato kasi ako</i>.” (Please forgive me because I am high on drug[s]). He further told her that he would insert the knife he was holding in her vagina to enhance his excitement. xxx Finally, at around 5:00 a.m., the police officer forced open the door and barged inside the room, and <b>subdued the dumbfounded accused who was then on top of the complainant</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>From this narration, it is clear that appellant’s real aim was to have carnal knowledge of Rowena. &nbsp;Appellant took Rowena no further than to his room - which was only across the hall from Rowena’s room - where he immediately forced her to undress. In fact, appellant was so intent on raping her that he was still naked and on top of her when the police broke into the room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Taken together, these circumstances engender doubt that the intention of appellant was to detain Rowena. The detention was merely incidental to the real objective of appellant.<br><br>It is true that appellant kept Rowena inside his room for more than an hour while the police tried to negotiate with him. &nbsp;However, this does not constitute illegal detention in light of the fact that appellant was on top of Rowena raping her even while he was shouting at the police and other people outside. &nbsp;This is borne out by Rowena’s testimony:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td scope="col" width="10%">Q:</td> <td scope="col" width="90%"><div align="justify">Could you tell us what was the position of the accused when the policemen forcibly opened the door?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">He was on top of me.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td><div align="justify">For how long [did] the accused stayed (sic) on top of you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Almost two hours from the very start.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Appellant maintained this position until the police barged into the room and subdued him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Given these facts, appellant is not liable for the crime of serious illegal detention with rape.<br><br>However, appellant is still liable for the crime of rape. When the information charges a complex crime and the evidence fails to support one of the component offenses, the defendant is still liable for the other offense supported by the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus, in <b><i>People v. Oliva</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court found Carlito Oliva guilty of statutory rape even if the information charged him of kidnapping with rape.<br><br>Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353, provide:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. Rape; When And How Committed. - Rape is Committed -<br>1)&nbsp; By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; Through force, threat, or intimidation;<br>xxx.<br></div><br>Article 266-B. Penalties. - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Whenever the <b>rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon</b> or by two or more persons, the <b>penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death</b>.<br>xxx.

The subject remarks were made after appellant was subjected to extensive direct and cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The examination of appellant was no more rigorous than that of Rowena’s, in which Judge Laguio also frequently intervened by posing clarificatory questions. &nbsp;The trial court did not prohibit appellant from presenting additional evidence or witnesses, although appellant chose not to do so. At the request of appellant’s counsel, Judge Laguio ordered a continuance for the defense to continue its presentation of evidence after appellant’s testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Further, contradictions and inconsistencies marred appellant’s testimony.

Aside from being inherently weak, it was uncorroborated by any evidence other than the self-serving testimony of appellant. Appellant admitted that he had no notes, letters, gifts or any other item to show for an affair that had allegedly been ongoing since 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The Information specifically alleged the use of a deadly weapon, a knife, in the commission of the rape and the prosecution proved that appellant used such a weapon. Under Article 266-B, the use of a deadly weapon qualifies the rape and the penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>Since <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death are two indivisible penalties, Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code applies. Article 63 provides:<br><blockquote><ol><li>When in the commission of the deed there is present only one aggravating circumstance, the greater penalty shall be applied.<br><br></li><li>When there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br><br></li><li>When the commission of the act is attended by some mitigating circumstance and there is no aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br><br></li><li>When both mitigating and aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the act, the courts shall reasonably allow them to offset one another in consideration of their number and importance, for the purpose of applying the penalty in accordance with the preceding rules, according to the result of such compensation.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In rape with the use of a deadly weapon, the presence of an aggravating circumstance increases the penalty to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In the present case, appellant raped Rowena in her dwelling, which is an aggravating circumstance under Article 14 (3) of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> However, the Information did not specifically allege dwelling as an aggravating circumstance. In <b><i>People v. Gallego</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court ruled that where the information did not allege the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, dwelling could not raise the penalty to death. The Court held:<br><blockquote>xxx The accused must thence be afforded every opportunity to present his defense on an aggravating circumstance that would spell the difference between life and death in order for the Court to properly “exercise extreme caution in reviewing the parties’ evidence.” This, the accused can do only if he is appraised of the aggravating circumstance raising the penalty imposable upon him to death. Such aggravating circumstance must be alleged in the information, otherwise the Court cannot appreciate it. The death sentence being irrevocable, we cannot allow the decision to take away life to hinge on the inadvertence or keenness of the accused in predicting what aggravating circumstance will be appreciated against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>The 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure now require the complaint or information to state the qualifying and aggravating circumstances attending an offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> When the law or rules specify certain circumstances that can aggravate an offense, or circumstances that would attach to the offense a greater penalty than that ordinarily prescribed, such circumstances must be both alleged and proved to justify the imposition of the increased penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Further, the circumstance of dwelling could not be considered in the present case even if it were properly alleged in the Information. Where the offender resided in the same house as the victim when the offense was committed, dwelling could not be considered as an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It is undisputed in this case that appellant was a “live-in” dog trainer and that he stayed in the Rianzares’ house in a room across Rowena’s room. Therefore, the penalty imposable on appellant is reclusion perpetua.<br><br>A word on the examination of Rowena. A rape victim is physically, socially, psychologically and emotionally scarred, resulting in trauma which may last a lifetime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It was thus highly inconsiderate for the prosecutor and the defense counsel to trade quips at the precise time Rowena was reliving her harrowing experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Courts are looked up to by people with high respect and are regarded as places where litigants are heard, rights and conflicts settled and justice solemnly dispensed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Levity has no place in the courtroom during the examination of a victim of rape, and particularly not at her expense.<br><br>The trial court awarded moral and nominal damages but failed to award indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>.
