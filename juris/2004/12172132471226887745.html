to apply on account or for value, knowing at the time of issue that he does not have sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment of such check in full upon its presentment, which check is subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for insufficiency of funds or credit or would have been dishonored for the same reason had not the drawer, without any valid reason, ordered the bank to stop payment, <span style="font-weight: bold;">shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than thirty days but not more than one (1) year or by a fine of not less than but not more than double the amount of the check which fine shall in no case exceed Two Hundred Thousand Pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court</span>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The same penalty shall be imposed</span> upon any person who, having sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank when he makes or draws and issues a check, shall fail to keep sufficient funds or to maintain a credit to cover the full amount of the check if presented within a period of ninety (90) days from the date appearing thereon, for which reason it is dishonored by the drawee bank.&nbsp; Where the check is drawn by a corporation, company or entity, the person or persons who actually signed the check in behalf of such drawer shall be liable under this Act.<br><br>Where the check is drawn by a corporation, company or entity, the person or persons who actually signed the check in behalf of such drawer shall be liable under this Act.” (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>provides <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> the imposition of <span style="font-weight: bold;">imprisonment or fine, or both</span>, in cases of violation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Batas Pambansa Blg</span>. 22.&nbsp; Thus, she should not suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of non-payment of the fines imposed by the trial court.<br><br>The Solicitor General disagrees with petitioner and prays that the Decision of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.<br><br>The petition must fail.<br><br>The imposition of subsidiary imprisonment is expressly provided under Articles 38 and 39 of the Revised Penal Code, thus:<blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">ART. 38</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Pecuniary liabilities</span> – <span style="font-style: italic;">Order of payment</span>. – In case the property of the offender should not be sufficient for the payment of all his pecuniary liabilities, the same shall be met in the following order:<blockquote>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preparation of the damage caused.<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnification of consequential damages.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fine.</span><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs of the proceedings.&nbsp; (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">ART. 39</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Subsidiary penalty</span>. – <span style="font-weight: bold;">If the convict has no property with which to meet the fine mentioned in paragraph 3 of the next preceding article, he shall be subject to a subsidiary personal liability at the rate of one day for each eight pesos, subject to the following rules:</span><ol><li>If the principal penalty imposed be <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto</span> and fine, he shall remain under confinement until his fine referred in the preceding paragraph is satisfied, but his subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed one-third of the term of the sentence, and in no case shall it continue for more than one year, and no fraction or part of a day shall be counted against the prisoner.</li><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><li>When the principal penalty imposed be only a fine, the subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed six months, if the culprit shall have been prosecuted for a grave or less grave felony, and shall not exceed fifteen days, if for a light felony.</li></span><br><li>When the principal penalty imposed is higher than <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> no subsidiary imprisonment shall be imposed upon the culprit.</li><br><li>If the principal penalty imposed is not to be executed by confinement in a penal institution, but such penalty is of fixed duration, the convict, during the period of time established in the preceding rules, shall continue to suffer the same deprivation as those of which the principal penalty consists.</li><br><li>The subsidiary personal liability which the convict may have suffered by reason of his insolvency shall not relieve him from the fine in case his financial circumstances should improve.”&nbsp; (Underscoring ours)</li></ol></blockquote>We hold that the above provisions on subsidiary imprisonment can be applied suppletorily to <span style="font-style: italic;">Batas Pambansa Blg</span>. 22 pursuant to Article 10 of the same Code, which provides:<blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">ART. 10</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Offenses not subject to the provisions of this Code</span>. – Offenses which are or in the future may be punishable under special laws are not subject to the provisions of this Code.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">This Code shall be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">supplementary</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">to such laws,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">unless the latter should specially provide the contrary</span>.” &nbsp;(Underscoring ours)</blockquote>As early as 1959, this Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Cubelo</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> held:<blockquote>“Appellant’s contention that the trial court committed error in ordering him to serve subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the payment of fine with the reason that Act No. 4003, which prohibits fishing with the use of explosive, fails to provide for such subsidiary imprisonment, and that being a special law, it is not subject to the provisions of the Revised Penal Code, is untenable.&nbsp; The second paragraph of Article 10 of the said Code provides that ‘this Code shall be supplementary to such laws, unless the latter should specially provide the contrary.’&nbsp;&nbsp; Articles 100 (civil liability) and 39 (subsidiary penalty) are applicable to offenses under special laws (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Moreno</span>, 60 Phil. 178; <span style="font-style: italic;">Copiaco vs. Luzon Brokerage</span>, 66 Phil. 184).”</blockquote>Indeed, the absence of an express provision on subsidiary imprisonment in <span style="font-style: italic;">Batas Pambansa Blg</span>. 22 does not and cannot preclude its imposition in cases involving its violations.<br><br>It bears stressing that on February 14, 2001, we issued Administrative Circular No. 13-2001 clarifying the imposition of imprisonment for violations of <span style="font-style: italic;">Batas Pambansa Blg</span>. 22 and subsidiary imprisonment upon the accused found guilty but is unable to pay the fine he is sentenced to pay.&nbsp; In clarifying the imposition of subsidiary imprisonment, the Circular states that if the accused is unable to pay the fine imposed by the trial court, “there is no legal obstacle to the application of the Revised Penal Code provisions on subsidiary imprisonment.”&nbsp; The full text of the Circular reads:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCULAR NO. 13-2001</div><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: justify;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>TO</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ALL JUDGES</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>SUBJECT</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>CLARIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCULAR NO. 12-2000 ON THE PENALTY FOR VIOLATION OF BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 22, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE BOUNCING CHECKS LAW</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Clarification has been sought by concerned Judges and other parties regarding the operation of Administrative Circular 12-2000 issued on 21 November 2000. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In particular, queries have been made regarding the authority of Judges to</span><blockquote><ol><li>Impose the penalty of imprisonment for violations of <span style="font-style: italic;">Batas Pambansa Blg</span>. 22; and</li><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><li>Impose subsidiary imprisonment in the event that the accused, who is found guilty of violating the provisions of B.P. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blg</span>. 22, is unable to pay the fine which he is sentenced to pay</li></span></ol></blockquote>considering that Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 adopted the rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Eduardo Vaca v. Court of Appeals</span> (G.R. No. 131714, 16 November 1998, 298 SCRA 656) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Rosa Lim v. People of the Philippines </span>(G.R. No. 130038, 18 September 2000) as a policy of the Supreme Court on the matter of the imposition of penalties for violations of B.P. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blg</span>. 22, without mentioning whether subsidiary imprisonment could be resorted to in case of the accused’s inability to pay the fine.<br><br>The clear tenor and intention of Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 is not to remove imprisonment as an alternative penalty, but to lay down a rule of preference in the application of the penalties provided for in B.P. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blg</span>. 22.<br><br>The pursuit of this purpose clearly does not foreclose the possibility of imprisonment for violators of B.P. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blg</span>. 22.&nbsp; Neither does it defeat the legislative intent behind the law.<br><br>Thus, Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 establishes a rule of preference in the application of the penal provisions of B.P. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blg</span>. 22 such that where the circumstances of both the offense and the offender clearly indicate good faith or a clear mistake of fact without taint of negligence, the imposition of a fine alone should be considered as the more appropriate penalty.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Needless to say, the determination of whether the circumstances warrant the imposition of a fine alone rests solely upon the Judge</span>.&nbsp; Should the Judge decide that imprisonment is the more appropriate penalty, Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 ought not be deemed a hindrance.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is, therefore, understood that</span><ol><li>Administrative Circular 12-2000 does not remove imprisonment as an alternative penalty for violations of B.P. <span style="font-style: italic;">Blg</span>. 22;</li><br><li>The Judges concerned may, in the exercise of sound discretion, and taking into consideration the peculiar circumstances of each case, determine whether the imposition of a fine alone would best serve the interests of justice or whether forbearing to impose imprisonment would depreciate the seriousness of the offense, work violence on the social order, or otherwise be contrary to the imperatives of justice;</li><br><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Should only a fine be imposed and the accused be unable to pay the fine, there is no legal obstacle to the application of the Revised Penal Code provisions on subsidiary imprisonment</span>.</li></ol>The issuance of this Administrative Circular was authorized by the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> in A.M. No. 00-11-01-SC at its session of 13 February 2001.<br><br>The Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court and the Court Administrator shall immediately cause the implementation of this Administrative Circular.<br><br>This Administrative Circular shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation not later than 20 February 2001.<br><br>Issued this 14<sup>th</sup> day of February, 2001.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(Sgd.)<br>HILARIO G.
