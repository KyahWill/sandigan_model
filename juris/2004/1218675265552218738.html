				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative matter arose from a Memorandum dated July 4, 2000 issued by respondent Darryl C. Montealto (Montealto), Clerk of Court II of the 2nd Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Sapang Dalaga-Concepcion, Misamis Occidental to the personnel of said court regarding their failure to accomplish Daily Time Records (DTRs) on time and/or falsification thereof and non-observance of prescribed office hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In view of the gravity of the allegations in the <i>Memorandum</i>, Judge Paulino L. Conol, Jr. (Judge Conol), then Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Calamba, Misamis Occidental, indorsed the same to Acting Presiding Judge Teodoro L. Dipolog (Judge Dipolog) for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>After investigating the matter, Judge Dipolog issued a <i>Resolution</i> dated August 28, 2000, stating that Montealto issued the <i>Memorandum</i> as a reminder to the court personnel concerned; that after the issuance thereof, the MCTC personnel started observing punctuality; and that the irregularities referred to by Montealto in the <i>Memorandum</i> may have been a product of differences between himself and the employees concerned. Since the averments in the <i>Memorandum</i> were not supported by substantial evidence, and the DTRs in question were certified to be correct by Montealto himself, Judge Dipolog deemed it unnecessary to investigate the matter further. Judge Dipolog, however, recommended that Montealto and the other respondents, namely: Court Interpreter I Pedro Rio G. Bation (Bation), Court Stenographer I Fe O. Pao (Pao), Court Stenographer I Brillo B. Portacion (Portacion), Clerk II Phebe A. Velez (Velez), Junior Process Server Cesario E. Alumbro (Alumbro) and Utility Worker I Zaldy V. Pamatong (Pamatong) be reprimanded for having failed to maintain a harmonious relationship among the employees in the MCTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In their <i>Joint Comment</i> dated May 4, 2001, respondents Bation, Pao, Alumbro, Portacion, Velez and Pamatong generally agreed with the findings of Judge Dipolog in his August 28, 2000 <i>Resolution</i>.&nbsp; They averred that there was no longer any need to reprimand Montealto because they had already settled their differences with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Montealto filed a separate comment. In his letter dated May 4, 2001, he argued that he should not be named a respondent to the case because he was not a party to the falsification of the DTRs.&nbsp; According to Montealto, he did not intend his <i>Memorandum</i> to be an administrative complaint against the other respondents, although he would not hesitate to file charges against them in the future should the other respondents commit similar offenses in the future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On March 13, 2002, the Court, adopting the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), issued a <i>Resolution</i> referring the matter to then Executive Judge Paulino L. Conol, Jr. (Judge Conol) for investigation, report and recommendation in view of the gravity of the offenses alleged by Montealto and the possibility of collusion among the other respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In view of the retirement of Judge Conol on November 9, 2002, Ms. Vivian I. Berioso, Officer-in-Charge and Court Stenographer III, requested that another RTC Judge from Oroquieta City be assigned to investigate the matter.&nbsp; Thus, on January 22, 2003, the Court issued another <i>Resolution</i> referring the case for investigation to Executive Judge Ma. Nimfa Penaco-Sitaca (Judge Sitaca) of the RTC, Branch 13, Oroquieta City.<br><br>In her Report dated June 30, 2003, Judge Sitaca observed that none of the respondents denied the charges made by Montealto in his July 4, 2000 <i>Memorandum</i>.&nbsp; They merely offered excuses for their absences on the dates when Judge Conol visited their branch and did not see them in the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They also explained that Montealto issued the <i>Memorandum</i> because he had personal differences with some of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Judge Sitaca found that Pao, Alumbro, Portacion, Velez and Pamatong have, for over a period of four years,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> repeatedly committed the acts mentioned by Montealto in his July 4, 2000 <i>Memorandum, i.e.</i>, failure to fill out DTRs daily, failure to observe office hours, and accomplishing their DTRs for each month without indicating the days when they were absent during that period.&nbsp; The investigating judge also found that there was no record of the frequency with which the aforementioned respondents committed the acts.&nbsp; It was further stated by Judge Sitaca that Montealto lacked the courage to discipline the erring employees of the MCTC and that he would not have written the <i>Memorandum</i> had Judge Conol not demanded him to issue a written admonition to the employees.&nbsp; Thereafter, although Montealto issued the <i>Memorandum</i>, he tried to downgrade respondents’ liability by saying that they committed the acts mentioned in the <i>Memorandum</i> “only once a month.” He also certified to the correctness of respondents’ DTRs even though he knew that they did not indicate their absences therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Judge Sitaca recommended that Montealto be reprimanded for not having the courage to require the erring MCTC employees to indicate true and correct entries in their DTRs and for certifying to the correctness of their falsified DTRs; that respondents Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong be dismissed from the service and that Bation be exculpated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In its <i>Memorandum</i> dated January 16, 2004, the OCA, citing the findings of Judge Sitaca, recommended that Montealto, Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong be held liable for gross neglect of duty and be meted the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or the commission of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.&nbsp; It also recommended that the complaint against respondent Bation be dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>According to the OCA, by turning a blind eye to the dishonesty of Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong and their falsification of the DTRs, Montealto in effect cooperated in their commission of the offenses.&nbsp; His issuance of the July 4, 2000 <i>Memorandum</i> cannot exonerate him because he did not issue said memorandum out of his own initiative.&nbsp; He was compelled to make such issuance by Judge Conol who made several surprise visits to the MCTC and discovered during those instances that Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong were either loafing or frequently out of the office during office hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Moreover, Montealto was remiss in his duty of keeping a reliable record of attendance of all officials and employees of the MCTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>With respect to Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong, the OCA noted that they made superficial denials regarding the charges against them and that their respective answers during the investigation were flimsy and not responsive.&nbsp; They failed to refute the charges against them in Montealto’s July 4, 2000 <i>Memorandum</i>.<br><br>The OCA added that although the acts of dishonesty and falsification of Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong are grave offenses which carry the penalty of dismissal, it recommended that the fact that they have never been administratively charged be considered as a mitigating circumstance pursuant to Section 53 of the Civil Service Commission Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases (CSC Revised Uniform Rules) and that the penalty next lower to dismissal, i.e., suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year be imposed upon them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The record supports the findings of Judge Sitaca and the OCA that respondents Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong did not specifically deny the charges that they failed to comply with the requirement that they fill out their respective DTRs upon arrival at, and departure from, the office; that they were frequently out of the office during office hours and that they falsified their entries in their DTRs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Moreover, they failed to satisfactorily explain their disappearance from their respective work stations during the three instances when Judge Conol made surprise visits to the MCTC and saw for himself that the said respondents were not in the office.&nbsp; Their acts of loafing during official hours and incurring frequent unauthorized absences are penalized under the CSC Revised Uniform Rules with suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense and with dismissal for the second offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Judge Sitaca and the OCA also found that Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong also made false entries in their DTRs by indicating therein that they were present at work when in fact they were somewhere else.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the logbooks of the MCTC from 1996 to July 4, 2000 are not properly accomplished and therefore cannot establish which particular entries in the DTRs of the aforementioned respondents are false.&nbsp; his notwithstanding, said respondents may still be held administratively liable for their acts of falsification which they did not deny nor disprove during the investigation conducted by Judge Sitaca on June 23, 2003 and in their Joint Comment dated May 4, 2001.&nbsp; It was established by substantial evidence that Judge Conol saw that they were not at their respective work stations during his three surprise visits to the MCTC and that because of their frequent loafing, Judge Conol directed Montealto to issue the July 4, 2000 <i>Memorandum</i> to call their attention to their transgressions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Their absence from the office, even for a few hours in one day, is certainly inconsistent with their declaration in their DTRs that they were present at work during those hours.&nbsp; Such declarations in the DTR undeniably amount to acts of falsification.<br><br>Falsification of an official document such as the DTR is considered a grave offense under the CSC Revised Uniform Rules and is penalized with dismissal for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It is also punishable as a criminal offense under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The Court has repeatedly held that everyone in the judiciary, from the presiding judge to the clerk, must always be beyond reproach and must be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility as to let them be free of any suspicion that may taint the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As the Court explained in <i>Mirano v. Saavedra</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><blockquote>Public service requires utmost integrity and strictest discipline. A public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity.&nbsp; The administration of justice is a sacred task.&nbsp; By the very nature of their duties and responsibilities, all those involved in it must faithfully adhere to, hold inviolate, and invigorate the principle solemnly enshrined in the 1987 Constitution that a public office is a public trust; and all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.&nbsp; The conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.&nbsp; Their conduct, at all times, must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, must be above suspicion.&nbsp; Indeed, every employee of the judiciary should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>It has also held that frequent unauthorized absences on the part of a court employee not only undermine his or her efficiency but can also adversely affect the prompt delivery of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>With respect to Montealto, the Court agrees with the OCA and Judge Sitaca that he cannot be exonerated from the charges against him because it was not he who made false entries in the DTRs of the other respondents.&nbsp; Contrary to Montealto’s claim, he is liable for dishonesty because he certified to the correctness of the DTRs of the other respondents even though he knew that they were not always present as they claimed they were in their DTRs. Dishonesty is a grave offense which is penalized with dismissal under the CSC Revised Uniform Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Montealto is also liable for gross neglect of duty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> for his failure to discipline the other employees of the MCTC despite their brazen and repeated violations of civil service rules on attendance, observance of official time and submission of DTRs.&nbsp; The Court has previously held that Clerks of Court are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts.&nbsp; As such they must exhibit competence, honesty, and probity since they are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Respondents Pao, Portacion, Velez, Alumbro and Pamatong are liable for two administrative offenses—first, for Loafing and/or Frequent Unauthorized Absences, and second, Falsification of Official Document.&nbsp; The first offense is penalized with suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first infraction, while the second offense is penalized with dismissal even for the first offense.&nbsp; Section 17, Rule XIV of the CSC Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> provides that when the respondent is guilty of two or more charges, the penalty for the most serious charge should be imposed and the other charges may be considered as aggravating circumstances.<br><br>Montealto, on the other hand, is liable for dishonesty and gross neglect of duty, both of which are grave offenses penalized with dismissal even for the first offense under the CSC Revised Uniform Rules.<br><br>However, the OCA recommends that the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day be imposed upon respondents instead of dismissal because the fact that respondents have not been administratively charged prior to this case may be considered as a mitigating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the recommendation of the OCA.<br><br>Section 53 of the CSC Revised Uniform Rules grants the disciplining authority the discretion to consider mitigating circumstances although not pleaded by the respondent.<br><br>The Court has, in several cases, refrained from imposing the extreme penalty of dismissal where the erring employee had not been previously charged with an administrative offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Inasmuch as the respondents in this case (except respondent Bation) have not been administratively charged prior to this case, the Court deems it proper to apply such mitigating circumstance in their favor and accordingly, to reduce the penalty imposable upon each of them to suspension for a period of six (6) months and one (1) day.<br><br>WHEREFORE, respondent Darryl C. Montealto, Clerk of Court II, is found guilty of Dishonesty and Gross Neglect of Duty and is hereby SUSPENDED for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of a similar offense shall warrant a more severe penalty.<br><br>Respondents Fe O. Pao, Court Stenographer I; Brillo B. Portacion, Court Stenographer I; Phebe A. Velez, Clerk II; Cesario E. Alumbro, Junior Process Server; and Zaldy V. Pamatong, Utility Worker I, are found guilty of Falsification of Official Document and are hereby suspended for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay.&nbsp; Respondents are sternly warned that a repetition of a similar offense shall warrant a more severe penalty.<br><br>The charges against respondent Pedro Rio C. Bation, Court Interpreter I, are DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Austria-Martinez, Callejo, Sr.,</i> and <i>Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Memorandum reads in full:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 360px;">July 4, 2000<br></div><br>MEMORANDUM TO:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 120px;">All Court Personnel<br>MCTC, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental<br></div><br>FROM: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Clerk of Court<br><br>Subject: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conformity with ENTRY IN THE LOG BOOK and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENTRY IN THE DAILY TIME RECORD<br><br>It has been observed that despite several admonitions made by the undersigned, the following irregularities are still habitually committed by some personnel of this Court, to wit:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">[N]on-filling up of DTR’s (sic) daily.
