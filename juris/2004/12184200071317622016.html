				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SATIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>On appeal is the decision of the Regional Trial Court of San Fernando, Pampanga, Branch 45, convicting appellant Rodaniel Villafuerte of the crime of statutory rape, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> and ordering him to pay private complainant civil indemnity <i>ex-delicto</i> of P50,000.00, as well as moral damages of P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup><br><div align="justify"><br>Appellant was fifteen years of age in 1998 at the time of the incident while the victim, Cristina “Christine” Joy C. Santos was then six years old.<br><br>The facts as established by the prosecution revealed that on February 18, 1998, at or around 4:00 p.m., Christine and her two cousins, Rosemarie and Dessa, were playing the game “Sasara ang Bulaklak” near appellant’s house in San Juan, San Fernando, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Appellant joined them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>When the girls finished playing, appellant asked Christine to continue playing with him. It will just be the two of them since Rosemarie and Dessa had already finished playing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Christine asked where they will play and appellant answered, “in the bathroom.”<br><br>Appellant led Christine to an old bathroom located at the back of his house. Once inside, he removed her clothes and underwear and undressed himself. He told her not to shout.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>While both of them were sitting on the floor facing each other, appellant inserted his penis into Christine’s genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Christine felt pain,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> causing her to stand up and kick appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Christine hurriedly went home and reported what happened to her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>That evening, Christine’s mother and one of their neighbors accompanied her to the police station. There, Christine recounted her experience to the investigating officer. After explaining to Christine the contents of her narration in typewritten form, the investigating officer asked her to place her thumb mark on the same document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On February 19, 1998, Dr. Emerita Cristobal-Danac, a physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, conducted a physical examination on Christine. She observed that Christine Joy’s <i>labia majora</i> and <i>labia minora</i> had no laceration and the same were coapted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup> No sign of external injury outside Christine’s genitalia was evident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup><br><br>Appellant was charged in an Information dated March 31, 2000 with the crime of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, before the RTC of San Fernando, Pampanga, Branch 45,<i> viz:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote> That on or about the 18th day of February 1998, in the municipality of San Fernando, province of Pampanga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Rodaniel Villafuerte, with lewd design, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with Christine Joy C. Santos, six (6) years old, a minor, inserting his male organ into her vagina against her will and without her consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<br></blockquote>On arraignment, appellant pleaded “not guilty” to the charge. After the pre-trial conference, trial on the merits ensued. Appellant denied the charge of statutory rape against him. In his defense, he presented a different version of the events of February 18, 1998.<br><br>As narrated by Rosemarie “Rose” Villafuerte, the thirteen year old playmate of Christine and a niece of appellant, she was playing “Lutu-lutuan” on February 18, 1998 at or around 4:00 p.m. with Christine and Popoy, a six or seven year old male playmate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She called appellant who passed by and asked him to fix the “bahay-bahayan.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Appellant fixed the “<i>bahay-bahayan</i>” for about half an hour, after which he left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rose then continued playing with Christine for another half hour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [17]</sup> They went home together at 5:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered a decision finding appellant guilty as charged of statutory rape, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Rodaniel Villafuerte<i>Guilty</i> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <i>Statutory Rape,</i> hereby imposing him a penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua.</i><br><br>Accused is likewise ordered to indemnify Christine Joy Santos in the amount of P50,000.00 as well as another P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br>Hence this appeal, based on the following assignment of errors:<br><br><center> I </center><br>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AND NOT CONSIDERING THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED.<br><br><center> II </center><br>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br></blockquote>The appeal must fail.<br><br>Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in giving full credence to the testimony of private respondent Christine Joy. He points to the incredible, inconsistent and contradicting statements of Christine Joy which showed that the charge against the accused was patently a mere concoction. He argues that Christine Joy gave inconsistent statements in her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> and in her testimony during the trial on whether he was able to insert his penis in her vagina. Moreover, appellant emphasizes the alleged incredibility of Christine Joy’s description of how the crime was committed.<br><br>We are not persuaded. The alleged inconsistencies pointed out by appellant are not the kind which discredits Christine Joy’s testimony. Rather, the discrepancies bolster Christine Joy’s candidness and spontaneity. It must be remembered that Christine Joy executed the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> when she was just six years old. The <i>salaysay</i> itself was prepared by someone else and was merely thumb marked by Christine Joy. On the other hand, she testified in court when she was nine years old and she was able to express herself more effectively and clearly. The trial court itself found the testimony of Christine Joy, in its entirety, to be straightforward and characterized by such candor and simplicity as would be expected from an innocent child.<br><br>We have held time and again that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature deserve full credence, considering that no young woman,  especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an  examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subject to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It is highly improbable for an innocent girl, who is very naïve to the things of this world, to fabricate a charge so humiliating not only to herself but to her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> We agree with the trial court that it is beyond the mindset of a six-year old child to fabricate a malicious accusation against appellant if the crime did not truly transpire.<br><br>During the initial phase of Christine Joy’s testimony, she broke down on the witness stand when the prosecution started asking questions which directly dealt with the incident, for which reason her testimony was suspended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> When the proceedings continued, the court asked Christine what exactly was done to her by the appellant. Christine Joy testified as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"> <br></td> <td colspan="2">PROS.

Her testimony established appellant’s penetration of her female organ which produced such pain which she vividly remembered. That the medical examination conducted on her showed no lacerations or other physical injury on the genitalia does not preclude the possibility that rape was consummated. A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present. Rape under the first paragraph of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, is consummated when there is penetration, no matter how slight, of the victim’s genitalia under any of the circumstances enumerated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In order to sustain a conviction for rape, penetration of the female genital  organ by the male is not indispensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> What is fundamental is that the entrance, or at least the introduction, of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum is proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [25]</sup> The prosecution has proven the consummation of the offense through the testimony of Christine Joy. We find the said testimony credible and sufficient to prove that there was penetration of the victim’s sexual organ. This fact is enough to convict appellant of the crime of rape.<br><br>Appellant, for his part, relied merely on his alibi. For his alibi to be credible and given due  weight, he must show that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission. His defense of alibi is not only self-serving and easily fabricated, but is also the weakest defense he could interpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> We have uniformly held that denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Appellant claims that after he fixed the “<i>bahay-bahayan</i>” as requested by Christine Joy and her playmates, he immediately went home to his house which according to him was located about ten meters away from the place where Christine Joy and her playmates were playing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The old toilet where the crime actually happened was, in turn, about four to five meters, by appellant’s estimation, from the place where the “<i>bahay-bahayan</i>” was set up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Even the testimony of Rosemarie Villafuerte, appellant’s niece and one of Christine Joy’s playmates on the day of the incident, does not help appellant’s case. During her testimony, Rosemarie stated that in relation to the place where they were playing, appellant’s house was nearer compared to Christine Joy’s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> While it may be true that she and Christine Joy went home together, it is still possible that appellant might have intercepted Christine Joy when the latter was on her way home and lured her into the old toilet where the crime was perpetrated.<br><br>Appellant’s defense of alibi was an exercise in futility for his failure to substantiate his claim that he was somewhere else at the time of the commission of the crime or that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the crime imputed upon him. More importantly, his defense cannot stand against the positive identification and straightforward testimony of Christine Joy herself.<br><br>We affirm the findings of the trial court that Christine Joy was only six years and three months old on the date of the incident, having been born on November 25, 1991. This qualifying circumstance was properly alleged in the Information and was accordingly proved during the proceedings through the Record of Birth of Christine Joy which was issued by the Municipal Civil Registrar of San Fernando, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Under the law, the imposable penalty should be death. However, appellant himself was only fifteen years old on the date of the incident, and turned eighteen only on December 3, 2000. Hence, he is rightfully entitled to the special mitigating circumstance of minority which has the effect of lowering  the penalty by one degree. Therefore, appellant was correctly sentenced to<i> reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>Anent appellant’s civil liability, Christine Joy is entitled to civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 as ordered by the trial court. The award of moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 should likewise be affirmed in view of the victim’s injury inherently concomitant with and necessarily resulting from the detestable crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the  decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 45 of the City of San Fernando, in Criminal Case No. 011 finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and ordering him to pay the victim the sum of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> in toto.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio.</i><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, Carpio </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, JJ., </span>concur. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), </span>on official leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> *</span> On official leave. <br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</span> Working Chairman. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Decision penned by Judge Adelaida Ala-Medina on 11 June 2002.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, Direct Examination of Christine Joy C.
