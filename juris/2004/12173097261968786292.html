No. 239, which requires the plan to be re-verified and approved by the Director of the Bureau of Lands, in this case, Plan (LRC) SWO-150.&nbsp; The petitioner prayed OCT No. 0662 issued in favor of the private respondents be declared null and void.<br><br>In their answer, the private respondents averred that the subject lot had been theirs and their predecessors’ private and exclusive property for more than fifty years, and that OCT No. 0662 covering the same was issued in their favor on September 20, 1976.&nbsp; The private respondents contended that the duty to comply with the requirement under Section 51 of CA No. 141, that the Solicitor General through the Director of the Bureau of Lands be served a copy of the application for the judicial confirmation of imperfect or incomplete title, devolved upon the clerk of court of the land registration court.&nbsp; They also averred that a report on the pre-verification and approval of Plan (LRC) SWO-150 had been forwarded by the Regional Director of the Bureau of Lands to the Director of the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp; Moreover, Plan (LRC) SWO-150 covering the subject lot had been duly processed and approved by the Land Registration Commission.&nbsp; According to the respondents, even if there were deficiencies on the part of the administrative officials in complying with the procedures relative to land registration, the same was not jurisdictional, but merely a procedural flaw.&nbsp; As such, the failure of the Bureau of Lands and the Land Registration Commission to comply with the law did not result in nullifying the proceedings in LRC Case No. N-531.&nbsp; Finally, the respondents countered, the action of the petitioner had long since prescribed.<br><br>In its reply, the petitioner alleged that Plan (LRC) SWO-150 was never submitted, much less approved, to the Director of the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp; The report required by Section 2 of P.D. No. 239 is one which the Director of the Bureau of Lands actually submitted to the court.&nbsp; The petitioner alleged that no such report was submitted in this case.<br><br>On October 16, 1976, the private respondents filed a motion in LRC Case No. N-531 for the issuance of a writ of possession and the demolition of the houses of the occupants.&nbsp; The court granted the motion.&nbsp; The Director of the Bureau of Lands, likewise, prayed for the suspension of the enforcement of the writ pending final resolution of Civil Case No. 7514.&nbsp; The court refused to suspend the enforcement of its decision.<br><br>On November 19, 1981, the Republic of the Philippines, through the Director of the Bureau of Lands, filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with this Court, docketed as G.R.

No. 72218, this Court, in its Resolution dated July 21, 1986, set aside the said order and directed the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> to proceed with the hearing of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, the court issued an Order on April 6, 1988 denying the said motion for leave to intervene.&nbsp; The court later denied the motion for the reconsideration of the said order.&nbsp; Thereafter, Undersecretary and Officer-in-Charge of the Bureau of Lands Rolleo Ignacio executed a Special Power of Attorney authorizing Atty. Vicente Seriña of the Office of the Regional Director of the Bureau of Lands to represent the petitioner during the pre-trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>During the hearing of March 27, 1989, the parties agreed to forego a full-blown trial and to instead file their respective “Memorandum of Authority” and to submit evidence in support of their respective contentions.&nbsp; The court issued an order on the said date, giving the parties thirty days to submit their respective memoranda and evidence.<br><br>The petitioner submitted its memorandum, appending thereto the documents marked respectively as follows:<br><br>1) <u>Exhibit A</u> – The Certification made by the Officer-in-Charge of the Regional Director’s Office for Forestry that the property had been certified on September 3, 1973 as alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>2) <u>Exhibit B</u> – The letter of the representatives of the Philippine Constabulary Provincial Commander and those of the Bureau of Lands, Bureau of Forest Development, and Department of Agrarian Reform to the Provincial Commander that there were 73 bona fide tillers on the property seeking to have the property subdivided and distributed to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>3) <u>Exhibit C</u> – The Letter dated October 3, 1977 from the Chief, Regional Director of the Bureau of Lands directing the District Land Officer of Cagayan de Oro to submit a report within two days from notice thereof on the letter of the occupants requesting for the subdivision of the property, <i>viz.</i>: <blockquote> Considering the urgency of the case, you are hereby directed to submit the report within five (5) days from receipt hereof.&nbsp; In your report you should state whether the copy of the petition for registration was received by that Office considering that the case has come into your knowledge and if so, the date of its receipt thereof, and why the same has not been forwarded to us immediately.&nbsp; You should also secure a certification from the District Forest Office regarding the date of release of the area from the forest zone, as it appears that the land was only released on September 13, 1973.&nbsp; This information is necessary to determine whether the applicant has acquired a registerable title to the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </blockquote> 4) <u>Exhibit D</u> – The Report dated July 15, 1975 of the Chief Surveyor of the Land Registration Commission and Acting Chief, Division of Original Registration of the Land Registration Commission to the Court in LRC Case No. N-531.&nbsp; Thus: <blockquote> That a certain parcel of land described on plan LRC Swo-1507, Lot 2821, Cagayan Cadastre 237, Case 1, is applied for registration of title in the above-entitled land registration case;<br><br>That upon verification of our Record of Cadastral Lots, Book No. 64, under Cad.

The petitioner asserts that under Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, the court may render judgment on the pleadings only when the respondents’ answer fails to tender an issue or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party’s pleadings.&nbsp; Furthermore, it was not proper for the trial court to render summary judgment under Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, for the simple reason that the private respondents, in their answer, tendered genuine issues of fact which called for the presentation of evidence.<br><br>We do not agree with the petitioner.&nbsp; The trial court dispensed with a full-blown trial because, precisely, the parties themselves agreed thereto, on the claim that the issues raised may be resolved on the basis of the pleadings, the memoranda and the appended documents, without need of presenting witnesses thereon.&nbsp; A party may waive its right to present testimonial evidence and opt to adduce documentary evidence and thereafter, submit the case for resolution based solely on their pleadings and documentary evidence.&nbsp; In this case, no less than the petitioner, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General through Special Attorney Vicente Seriña, agreed to dispense with a full-blown trial.<br><br>On the second issue, we agree with the petitioner that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the private respondents and that the CA committed a reversible error in affirming the same.<br><br>The CA ruled that the petitioner was burdened to prove that the issuance of OCT-0662 was marred by irregularities.&nbsp; It further held that a title issued under the torrens system of registration is presumed valid, and unless and until the petitioner adduced competent and strong evidence to prove otherwise, government officials such as the personnel of the CFI and the Land Registration Commission and the Director of the Bureau of Lands are presumed to have performed their duties in accordance with law.&nbsp; According to the CA, the petitioner failed to adduce such evidence.&nbsp; The appellate court took note that the private respondents even appended documentary evidence to their memorandum showing compliance with the statutory requirement.<br><br>For its part, the petitioner contends that as defendants in the trial court, it was the burden of the private respondents to prove the existence of a fact – that the land registration court had acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petition and over the persons of the respondent therein; conversely, the private respondents, as applicants therein, were obliged to adduce in evidence the survey plan approved by the Director of the Bureau of Lands as required by P.D. Nos. 239 and 1529.&nbsp; According to the petitioner, there is no presumption in favor of the jurisdiction of a court of limited jurisdiction, such as a land registration court.&nbsp; It contends that where the jurisdiction of a court depends upon the existence of facts, it has no right or power to proceed or act upon a pleading which does not substantially set forth such facts.<br><br>We find for the petitioner.&nbsp; As applicants in LRC Case No. N-531, the private respondents had the burden of complying with the statutory requirement of serving the Director of the Bureau of Lands with a copy of their application and amended application, and to show proof of their compliance thereon.&nbsp; However, we also agree with the CA that it was the burden of the petitioner in the trial court to prove the material allegations of its complaint.&nbsp; This is provided in Section 1, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court which reads: <blockquote> <i>Burden of proof. </i>– Burden of proof is the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to establish his claim or defense by the amount of evidence required by law. </blockquote> Obviously, the burden of proof is, in the first instance, with the plaintiff who initiated the action.&nbsp; But in the final analysis, the party upon whom the ultimate burden lies is to be determined by the pleadings, not by who is the plaintiff or the defendant.&nbsp; The test for determining where the burden of proof lies is to ask which party to an action or suit will fail if he offers no evidence competent to show the facts averred as the basis for the relief he seeks to obtain,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and based on the result of an inquiry, which party would be successful if he offers no evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In ordinary civil cases, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the material allegations of the complaint which are denied by the defendant, and the defendant has the burden of proving the material allegations in his case where he sets up a new matter.&nbsp; All facts in issue and relevant facts must, as a general rule, be proven by evidence except the following: <blockquote> (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegations contained in the complaint or answer immaterial to the issues.<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts which are admitted or which are not denied in the answer, provided they have been sufficiently alleged.<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those which are the subject of an agreed statement of facts between the parties; as well as those admitted by the party in the course of the proceedings in the same case.<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts which are the subject of judicial notice.<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts which are legally presumed.<br><br>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the opposite party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </blockquote> The effect of a presumption upon the burden of proof is to create the need of presenting evidence to overcome the <i>prima facie</i> case created thereby which if no proof to the contrary is offered will prevail; it does not shift the burden of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this case, the personnel of the Land Registration Commission and the CFI in LRC Case No. N-531 are presumed to have performed their duty of serving a copy of the application and its appendages to the petitioner.&nbsp; It was thus the burden of the petitioner to prove that: (a) it was not served with a copy of the application of the private respondents and its annexes; (b) the private respondents failed to append to their application the survey plan of Lot No. 2821, duly approved by the Director of the Bureau of Lands as required by P.D. Nos. 1529 and 239.&nbsp; Unless the same were admitted by the respondents, the petitioner should have adduced in evidence the relevant portions of the records of LRC Case No. N-531, including the decision of the trial court, to prove that the Director of the Bureau of Lands was not served with a copy of the application and the amended application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Section 13, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provides as follows: <blockquote> SEC. 13.&nbsp; <i>Proof of service.</i> – Proof of personal service shall consist of a written admission of the party served, or the official return of the server, or the affidavit of the party serving, containing a full statement of the date, place and manner of service.&nbsp; If the service is by ordinary mail, proof thereof shall consist of an affidavit of the person mailing of facts showing compliance with section 7 of this Rule.&nbsp; If service is made by registered mail, proof shall be made by such affidavit and the registry receipt issued by the mailing office.&nbsp; The registry return card shall be filed immediately upon its receipt by the sender, or in lieu thereof the unclaimed letter together with the certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee. </blockquote> Such proof of service should be found in the records of the case in which the application/amended application was filed, in this case, LRC Case No. N-531.&nbsp; The same records will also show whether or not the private respondents appended the survey plan duly approved by the Director of the Bureau of Lands to their application, as mandated by P.D.
