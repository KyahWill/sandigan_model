The petitioners also sought the quashal of the Informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 27556 and 27558 on the ground that the said Informations failed to specify and quantify the alleged undue injury to the Municipality of Taal, Batangas, or to the government as a whole; to prove the same with moral certainty; and to state that the petitioners therein gave any unwarranted benefits to a third-party private individual. The petitioners noted that the Informations merely alleged that “the accused gave unwarranted benefits to himself/herself.”<br><br>The petitioners cited the decisions of this Court in <i>Mendoza-Arce v. Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Llorente v. Sandiganbayan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Garcia-Rueda v.

The graft court ruled that as gleaned from all the Informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 27555 and 27557, the petitioners caused undue injury to the Municipality of Taal, Batangas, the government and to the public interest, and that they gave unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to the Diamond Laboratories, Inc. The graft court also ruled that under the Informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 27556 and 27558, petitioners Librado and Fe Cabrera gave unwarranted benefits to themselves by allocating and collecting the amounts ofP27,651.83 and P170,987.66, respectively, representing expenses they incurred during their unauthorized and illegal travels, thereby causing undue injury to the Municipality of Taal.  The Sandiganbayan relied on the rulings of the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Jacinto v.

Sandiganbayan</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The Sandiganbayan also ruled that the elements of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 enumerated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Jacinto </span>are more consistent with the law and in harmony with the ruling of this Court in Santiago.  The Sandiganbayan further declared that the rulings in Jacinto and Santiago had not as yet been overruled by the Court.<br><br>The petitioners filed a motion for the reconsideration of said resolution, contending that the Sandiganbayan should have relied on more recent rulings of this Court, the latest of which is <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza-Arce v. Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas).</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On February 18, 2004, the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution denying the said motion.<br><br>The petitioners now seek relief in this Court <span style="font-style: italic;">via </span>their petition for certiorari contending that:<br><blockquote>WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ISSUING THE QUESTIONED RESOLUTIONS DATED 12 NOVEMBER 2003 AND 18 FEBRUARY 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>The threshold issue in this case is whether or not all the essential elements of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 are alleged in the four (4) Informations filed against the petitioners.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that the acts or omissions constituting the offense must be stated in the Information or criminal complaint:<br><blockquote>SEC. 8.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Designation of the offense.</span> – The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances.  If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.<br></blockquote>The petitioner must be apprised of the facts that are imputed on him as he is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.  The Information must contain a specific allegation of every fact and circumstance necessary to constitute the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Also, the Information must state only the relevant facts; the reason therefor could be proved during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The accused may file a motion to quash the Information under Section 3(a), Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, on the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense.<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. Grounds. – The accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the following grounds:<br></blockquote>(a) That the facts charged do not constitute an offense.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">…<br></div><br>The fundamental test in determining the sufficiency of the material averments of an Information is whether or not the facts alleged therein, which are hypothetically admitted, would establish the essential elements of the crime defined by the law.  The Court has ruled<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">aliunde </span>or matters extrinsic of the Information are not to be considered:<br><blockquote>Section 3(a) of Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court authorizes the quashal of an information when the facts therein averred do not amount to an offense. The fundamental test in reflecting on the viability of a motion to quash under this particular ground is whether or not the facts asseverated, if hypothetically admitted, would establish the essential elements of the crime defined in the law.  In this examination, matters aliunde are not considered.  Anent the sufficiency of the information, Section 6, Rule 110, of the Rules of Court requires, inter alia, that the information must state the acts or omissions so complained of as constitutive of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Corrupt practices of public officers.</span> - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">…<br></div><br>(e)  Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.<br></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Jacinto v. Sandiganbayan</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court en banc enumerated the essential elements of the crime, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions;<br><br></li><li>He must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or inexcusable negligence; and<br><br></li><li>That his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>There are two (2) ways by which a public official violates Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 in the performance of his functions, namely: (a) by causing undue injury to any party, including the Government; or (b) by giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. The accused may be charged under <span style="text-decoration: underline;">either mode or under bo</span>th.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Quibal v. Sandiganbayan</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court held that the use of the disjunctive term “or” connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Sec. 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019.<br><br><u>In fine, the delictual act of the accused may give rise to or cause either an undue injury to any party, including the government; or the giving to any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference, or both undue injury and warranted benefits, advantage or preference. </u> As explained by the Court in Bautista v. Sandiganbayan:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote>Indeed, Sec. 3, par. (e), RA 3019, as amended, provides as one of its elements that the public officer should have acted by causing any undue injury to any party, including the government, or by giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions. T<span style="text-decoration: underline;">he use of the disjunctive term "or" connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Sec. 3, par. (e), or as aptly held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santiago</span>, as two (2) different modes of committing the offense. This does not, however, indicate that each mode constitutes a distinct offense, but rather, that an accused may be charged under <span style="font-style: italic;">either </span>mode or under <span style="font-style: italic;">both</span>.</span><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Santiago</span>, petitioner therein assailed the failure of respondent to include the phrase "causing of undue injury to any party, including the Government" in the amended informations filed against her. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Refuting the claim, the Court cited the minute resolution in Uy v. Sandiganbayan and clarified that the "act of giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference" is not an indispensable element of the offense of "causing any undue injury to any party,"<span style="font-style: italic;"> although there maybe instances where both elements concur. </span>Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pareño v. Sandiganbaya</span>n, the information charged the public officers with "willfully and unlawfully causing undue injury to the Government <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>giving unwarranted benefits to Tanduay Distillery, Inc." by failing to verify and act on the validity and/or veracity of the claim for tax credit filed by the corporation before the BIR.</span><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Pilapil v. Sandiganbayan</span>, petitioner Pilapil was only charged with having "willfully caused undue injury to the Municipality of Tigaon, Camarines Sur, when he failed to deliver the ambulance received by him on behalf of the municipality in a <span style="font-style: italic;">Deed of Donatio</span>n executed by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office in its favor, to the prejudice and damage of the municipal government."<br><br>Likewise, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Diaz v. Sandiganbayan</span>, the PCGG Commissioners as public officers were charged only with having given Enrique Razon, Jr., a stockholder or officer of the sequestered corporation Metro Port, unwarranted benefits and/or advantage by the approval of his loan application for P5,000,000.00 belonging to the same sequestered corporation.<br><br>By analogy, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallego v. Sandiganbayan</span> finds application in the instant case. There, petitioners claimed that the Information charged the accused with three (3) distinct offenses, to wit: (a) the giving of "unwarranted" benefits through manifest partiality; (b) the giving of "unwarranted" benefits through evident bad faith; and, (c) the giving of "unwarranted" benefits through gross inexcusable negligence while in the discharge of their official and/or administrative functions; and thus moved for the quashal of the Information. The Sandiganbayan denied the motion to quash and held that the phrases "manifest partiality," "evident bad faith" and "gross inexcusable negligence" merely described the different modes by which the offense penalized in Sec. 3, par. (e), of RA 3019, as amended, could be committed, and the use of all these phrases in the same Information did not mean that the indictment charged three (3) distinct offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Evangelista v. People</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the ruling of the Court in Bautista and Santiago, thus:<br><blockquote>R.A. 3019, Section 3, paragraph (e), as amended, provides as one of its elements that the public officer should have acted by causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or by giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions. The use of the disjunctive term "or" connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3, paragraph (e), or as aptly held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santiago</span>, as two (2) different modes of committing the offense.  This does not, however, indicate that each mode constitutes a distinct offense, but rather, that an accused may be charged under either mode or under both.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>We note that, as pointed out by the petitioners, the Court held in Mendoza-Arce and other cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that the essential elements for violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 are the following:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The accused is a public officer or private person charged in conspiracy with him;<br><br></li><li>Said public officer commits the prohibited acts during the performance of his official duties or in relation to his public position;<br><br></li><li>He causes undue injury to any party, whether the government or private party;<br><br></li><li>Such undue injury is caused by giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to such parties; and<br><br></li><li>The public officer has acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The petitioners posit that, as gleaned from the enumerations by the Court of the essential elements of the crime, the only mode by which a public officer may commit a crime for violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 is by causing undue injury to any party, both the government or private party, the giving of unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to such party being only a mode of causing such undue injury, which is inconsistent with the rulings of this Court in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Jacinto, Santiago, Bautista</span> and other cases.<br><br>We find the contention of the petitioners to be untenable.  For one thing, we have reviewed the rulings of the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza-Arce</span> and kindred cases and find that the issue of whether or not violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019 may be committed only by causing undue injury to the government or to a private individual, the giving of unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference being only a mode of causing undue injury to the government or to a private party had not been raised therein, nor resolved by the Court.  In any event, the ruling in this case has categorized any perceived inconsistencies spawned by the rulings of the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza-Arce</span> and other cases and those in J<span style="font-style: italic;">acinto, Santiago, Evangelista, Quibal</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bautista</span>.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallego v. Sandiganbayan</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court ruled that “unwarranted” means lacking adequate or official support; unjustified; unauthorized; or without justification or adequate reasons. “Advantage” means a more favorable or improved position or condition; benefit or gain of any kind; benefit from course of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> “Preference” signifies priority or higher evaluation or desirability; choice or estimation above another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019, which was approved by Congress in Spanish reads:<br><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">(e) Causar algun perjuicio indebido a cualquiera, incluyendo al Gobierno, o dar a alguna persona particular  cualesquier beneficios, vengaja o preferencia injustificados en el desempeño de sus funciones administrativas   judiciales de indole oficial con manifiesta parcialidad, evidente mala fe o crasa negligencia inexcusable. Esta disposicion se aplicara a los funcionarios y empleados de oficinas o de las corporaciones del gobierno encargados de otorgar licencias o permisos u otras concesiones.<br></blockquote>“<i>Perjuicio</i>” means prejudice, mischief, injury, damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Prejudice means injury or damage, due to some judgment or action of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Mischief connotes a specific injury or damage caused by another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">“Indebido” </span>means undue, illegal, immoral, unlawful, void of equity and moderations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Pecho v.

It is sufficient that the injury suffered or benefits received can be perceived to be substantial enough and not merely negligible.<br><br>In this case, the Court finds that the four (4) Informations allege the essential elements of violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019.  The Information in Criminal Case No. 27555 specifically alleges that petitioners Librado Cabrera and Leonor, being then the Municipal Mayor and Municipal Councilor, respectively, of the Municipality of Taal, Batangas, conspired and connived with each other and, in relation to their office, through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or inexcusable negligence, gave unwarranted benefits to Diamond Laboratories, Inc., a corporation owned by the relatives of petitioner Librado Cabrera.  The petitioners’ felonious act consisted of directly purchasing medicines on several occasions for the total price of P503,920.35 only from the said corporation,without the benefit of public bidding or canvass from a duly-licensed manufacturer; in consummating the crime,  petitioner Leonor acted as the duly-authorized representative of Diamond Laboratories, Inc. and received the payments for the purchases for and in behalf of the corporation.  On the other hand, the Information in Criminal Case No. 27557 alleges that petitioners Fe Cabrera and Leonor, being then the Municipal Mayor and Municipal Councilor, respectively, of the Municipality of Taal, Batangas, conspired and connived with each other and, in relation to their office, took advantage of their official positions; and through patently evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence, gave unwarranted benefits to Diamond Laboratories, Inc., a corporation owned by relatives of petitioner Fe Cabrera, by directly purchasing medicines on several occasions for the total amount of P1,042,902.46 only from the Diamond Laboratories, Inc. without the benefit of public bidding or canvass from different licensed manufacturers.
