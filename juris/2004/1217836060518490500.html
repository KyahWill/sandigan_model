He also issued and delivered to the COLF, upon the execution of the lease agreement in 1982, eighteen (18) postdated checks in the amount of P44,980.00 each, payable to the COLT, drawn against his account with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC).  Each check was to be encashed or deposited by the COLF in its account on their respective due dates in payment of the monthly rental of the equipment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At the time, the bank had extended credit facilities to the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The COLF deposited the checks for the rentals of July to December 1992, and these checks were duly honored by the drawee bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The COLF thereafter deposited, in its account, Check No. 233533 postdated January 4, 1983 for the amount of P44,980.00 in payment for the January 1983 rental of the equipment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This check was, however, dishonored by the drawee bank for “insufficient funds.” The COLF wrote Sia on January 5, 1983, informing the latter of the dishonor of the check and requesting for the replacement thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On March 4, 1983, COLF deposited in its account Check No. 233534 postdated March 4, 1983 in the amount of P44,980.00 in payment for the  March 1983 rental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, the check was, again, dishonored by the drawee bank, this time for the    reason “account closed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On March 7, 1983, the COLF wrote Sia informing him of the dishonor of the check.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The COLF finally decided to terminate the lease and, on March 10, 1983, wrote Sia informing him that it was terminating the lease agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Sia received the letter but did not respond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Despite the termination of the lease, the COLF still deposited    Check No. 233535 in the amount of P44,980.00 on April 4, 1983.

The court thereafter issued a Writ of Seizure against the plaintiff’s property with the requisite bond therefor.  Sia received the complaint and summons on October 21, 1983, but failed to file an answer.  On motion of the plaintiff, Sia was declared in default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The plaintiff adduced its evidence, ex parte, on February 8, 1984.  The sheriff, however, failed to locate the equipment declared in the complaint and failed to seize and take possession thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, the COLF charged Sia with violating Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 22 by reason of the dishonor of the checks postdated January 4, 1983, March 4, 1983 and April 4, 1983, respectively.  On August 3, 1984, three Informations were filed with the RTC of Makati charging Sia with violating B.P. Blg. 22, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos.    11865, 11866, and 11867.  The accusatory portions of the said Informations are as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about June 1982, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously make, draw and issue in favor of Consolidated Orient Leasing &amp; Finance Corporation represented by Eduardo R. Alvarez, a check numbered 233532, drawn against the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), a duly established domestic banking institution, in the amount of P44,980.00 Philippine Currency, dated January 4, 1983 in payment of an obligation, knowing fully well at the time of issue that he did not have any sufficient funds in the drawee bank for the payment of such check; that upon presentation of said check to the said bank for payment the same was dishonored for the reason that the drawer thereof    accused Willy G. Sia did not have sufficient funds therein and despite notice of dishonor thereof, accused failed and refused and still fails and refuses to redeem or make good said check, to the damage and prejudice of the said Consolidated Orient Leasing &amp; Finance Corporation is (sic) the aforesaid sum.<br><br>Contrary to law.<br>Crim.

Case No. 11867<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>When arraigned, Sia, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of not guilty.<br><br><center><b>The Case for Petitioner Sia</b><br></center><br>Sia testified that, upon the execution of the lease agreement in 1982, he drew and delivered to COLF eighteen (18) postdated checks drawn against his account with the RCBC, each check in the amount of P44,980.00 corresponding to the rental for the leased property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Every month, as each check fell due, he informed the COLF whether to deposit or encash the checks, or to apply the current deposit for the payment of the rental due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He made good the first six postdated checks but failed to fund the ensuing checks for January, March, and April 1983. He reasoned that his financial condition was adversely affected by the implementation of his project in Nueva Vizcaya and the RCBC had since then refused to give him credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> To facilitate payment of the checks, Sia then asked COLF, through its assistant manager, Go Hong Ko, to apply his guaranty deposit for the postdated checks to    cover the rentals from January 1983.  Go Hong Ko told Sia that there would be no problem as his guaranty deposit of P216.250.00 was still intact and more than enough to answer for the said checks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus, Sia no longer funded his account with the drawee bank, thinking that his guaranty deposit would answer for the checks.<br><br>Sia alleged that he never received the January 5, 1983,  March 7, 1983 and April 6, 1983 letters of the COLF, and that the latter never notified him that the checks postdated January 4, 1983, March 3, 1983 and April 4, 1983, respectively, were deposited with the drawee bank, and that the same were subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank.  He was surprised when he learned about the charges against him for violation of B.P. Blg. 22 when he received a subpoena from the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati, requiring him to submit his counter-affidavit to the criminal complaint of the COLF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Furthermore, he was not informed why his guaranty deposit was not applied to the payment of the three dishonored checks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, on March 12, 1984, the RTC rendered judgment in Civil Case No. 3958, in favor of COLF, the dispositive portion of which reads, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Ordering defendant WGS Construction Specialists to pay plaintiff:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">P179,920.00, representing accrued rentals;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">3% of the above amount as penalty per month from January, 1983, up to May 17, 1983;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">P5,000.00 as and for attorney’s fees;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">P494,780.00, representing the actual value of the leased property not recovered, plus interest thereon at the legal rate computed from date hereof;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">e)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The costs of suit.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">The guaranty deposit of P216,250.00 made by said defendant shall be applied to the satisfaction of the aforementioned amounts.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Ordering defendants Willy G.

The Decision of this Court dated November 17, 1995 finding accused Willy G. Sia GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 in Criminal Cases Nos. 11865 and 11866 and is sentenced to suffer imprisonment of one (1) year and to pay a fine of P50,000.00 for each case STANDS.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Sia (the appellant therein), ascribed the following errors to the trial court:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE ACCUSED’S DEPOSIT OF P216,250.00 IN THE POSSESSION OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS TO BE APPLIED OR COULD BE APPLIED TO THE RENTALS.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE ACCUSED HAD TOLD THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT TO APPLY THE P216,250.00 TO THE PAYMENT OF THE RENTALS STARTING WITH THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1983.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE ACCUSED HAD ACTUALLY APPLIED THE P216,250.00 TO THE PAYMENT OF THE RENTALS FOR JANUARY AND MARCH 1983.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO NOTICE OF DISHONOR GIVEN TO THE ACCUSED.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF VIOLATING BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 22.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>On May 31, 2001, the appellate court rendered judgment affirming the decision of the RTC, as amended, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby <i><b>DISMISSED</b></i>, and the decision appealed from, as modified in the order dated June 4, 1996, is hereby <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b><i> in toto.</i><br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court held that it was of no moment whether the COLF notified Sia of the dishonor of the checks by letter, or if Sia failed to receive such notices.  Sia admitted when he testified that he knew that his funds with the drawee bank were insufficient when the subject checks fell due, and that he failed to fund the same.  The court also held that the application of Sia’s guaranty deposit to the amounts due under the subject checks was optional on the part of the COLF.<br><br>Sia, now the petitioner, comes to this Court contending as follows:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>NOTICE OF DISHONOR IS NECESSARY IN A CRIMINAL CASE FOR VIOLATION OF BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 22.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>SUCH NOTICE OF DISHONOR IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY IN THE INSTANT CASE BECAUSE THE SUBJECT CHECKS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED BY THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE PROSECUTION WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THAT NOTICE OF DISHONOR HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE PETITIONER.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE PETITIONER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED FOR FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner asserts that a notice or letter informing him of the dishonor of the subject checks so as to give him a period of five (5) banking days from receipt thereof to pay the amounts of the checks, or to make arrangements with the drawee bank for the payment of the said checks are mandatory requirements. He argues that the notice or letter informing him of the dishonor of the subject checks, as well as the lapse of the five-day period, are conditions precedent, without which he cannot be convicted, much less charged under Section 1, first paragraph of B.P. Blg. 22.<br><br>The petitioner contends that the failure of the COLF or the drawee bank to notify him of the dishonor of the subject checks deprived him of a chance to pay the amounts thereof.  He asserts that his admission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> did not relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the following: (a) that the said checks were deposited by COLF in its account; (b) that the said checks were dishonored by the drawee bank either for insufficiency of funds or that his account with the said bank was already closed; (c) that the petitioner was notified in writing of the dishonor of the said checks; and, (d) that five banking days from such notice of dishonor had already elapsed, without him paying the amounts due or making arrangements with the drawee bank for the payment of the said checks.  The petitioner avers that this did not amount to an admission that when he issued and delivered the subject checks to the COLF, he did not have sufficient funds in his account with the drawee bank to answer for the amounts of the checks and that he had knowledge thereof.<br><br>The petitioner further avers that there was no factual basis for his indictment for violation of Section 1, first paragraph of B.P. 22 because he and the COLF, thru Go Hong Ko, had agreed that the latter would apply his guaranty deposit of P216,250.00 to the payment of the subject checks, amounting to only P99,960.00.  The petitioner cited the ruling of this Court in <i>Ting v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> to support his plea for a reversal of the decisions of the appellate court and the trial court.<br><br>In its Comment on the petition, the Office of the Solicitor General asserts that contrary to the petitioner’s contention, the latter’s admission relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove that the petitioner had knowledge of the insufficiency of his funds in the drawee bank when he drew and issued the subject checks in 1982 to COLF.  The OSG also avers that under the lease agreement, it was optional on the part of COLF to apply the petitioner’s guaranty deposit to the payment of his back rentals and the subject checks.  It behooved the petitioner to fund the subject checks on due dates thereof to avoid his indictment for violation of B.P. Blg. 22.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 1, B.P. Blg. 22 under which the petitioner was charged in the RTC reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.  <i>Checks without sufficient funds</i>. – Any person who makes or draws and issues any check to apply on account or for value, knowing at the time of issue that he does not have sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment of such check in full upon its presentment, which check is subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for insufficiency of funds or credit or would have been dishonored for the same reason had not the drawer, without any valid reason, ordered the bank to stop payment, shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than thirty days but not more than one (1) year or by a fine of not less than but not more than double the amount of the check which fine shall in no case exceed Two Hundred Thousand Pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court. …<br></blockquote>The act sought to be prevented by the law is the act of making and issuing a check with the knowledge that, <b><i>at the time of issue</i></b>, the drawer issuing the check does not have sufficient funds in or credit with the bank for payment and the check was subsequently dishonored upon presentment.  What the law punishes is the issuance of a worthless check and not the purpose for which such check was issued nor the terms or conditions relating to its issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The thrust of the law is to prohibit, under pain of penal sanctions, the making of worthless checks and putting them in circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The crime is one against public order and is <i>malum prohibitum</i>.  The law is intended to safeguard the interests of the banking system and the legitimate checking account user.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It is not intended nor designed to coerce a debtor to pay his debt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> nor to favor or encourage those who seek to enrich themselves through manipulation and circumvention of the purpose of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This Court has held that in criminal cases involving violations of Section 1, B.P. Blg. 22, the prosecution is burdened to prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements:<br><blockquote><ol><li> The accused makes, draws or issues any check to apply to account or for value.<br><br></li><li>The check is subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for insufficiency of funds or credit; or it would have been dishonored for the same reason had not the drawer, without any valid reason, ordered the bank to stop payment.<br><br></li><li>The accused knows at the time of the issuance that he or she does not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, drawee bank for the payment of the check in full upon its presentment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>To hold a person liable, the prosecution must prove that the accused knew, <i><b>at the time of issue</b></i>, that he does not have sufficient funds in or credit for the full payment of such check upon its presentment.  The prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of the evidence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Knowledge on the part of the drawer or maker of the insufficiency of funds or credit in the drawee bank for the payment of a check upon its presentment is an essential element of the offense.  This element involves a state of the mind of the drawer or maker of the check which is difficult for the prosecution to prove.  To ease the burden of the prosecution, Section 2 of B.P. Blg. 22 created a <i>prima facie</i> presumption of knowledge on the part of the drawer or maker of the check of the insufficiency of his fund in the drawee bank, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2.  <i>Evidence of knowledge of insufficient funds.</i>-The making, drawing and issuance of a check payment of which is refused by the drawee because of insufficient funds in or credit with such bank, when presented within ninety (90) days from the date of the check, shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge of such insufficiency of funds or credit unless such maker or drawer pays the holder thereof the amount due thereon, or makes arrangements for payment in full by the drawee of such check within five (5) banking days after receiving notice that such check has not been paid by the drawee.<br></blockquote>However, for the presumption to arise, the prosecution must adduce evidence to prove the factual basis for its onset, namely,  (a) the check is presented within ninety (90) days from the date of the check; (b) the drawer or maker of the check receives notice that such check has not been paid by the drawer; and, (c) the drawer or maker of the check fails to pay the holder of the check the amount due thereon, or makes arrangements for payment in full within five (5) banking days after receiving notice that such check has not been paid by the drawer.  With the onset of the presumption, the burden of evidence is shifted on the drawer/maker of the check to prove that, when he issued the subject check, he had no knowledge that he had insufficient funds in the drawee bank to answer for the amount due.  The notice of dishonor may be sent to the drawer or maker by the drawee bank, the holder of the check, or the offended party, either by personal delivery or by registered mail. The drawer or maker of a check has a right, under the law, to demand that a written notice of dishonor be sent to and received by him to enable him to avoid indictment for violation of B.P. Blg. 22.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Construing Section 2 of the said law, we held in <i>Domagsang v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that the notice of dishonor of a check to the maker must be <b><i>in writing.</i></b>  A mere oral notice to the drawer or maker of the dishonor of his check is not enough:<br><blockquote>Petitioner counters that the lack of a <i>written notice</i> of dishonor is fatal.  The Court agrees.<br><br>While, indeed, Section 2 of B.P. Blg. 22 does not state that the notice of dishonor be in writing, taken in conjunction, however, with Section 3 of the law. <i>i.e</i>., “that where there are no sufficient funds in or credit with such drawee bank, such fact <i>shall always be explicitly stated in the notice of dishonor or refusal</i>,” a mere oral notice or demand to pay would appear to be insufficient for conviction under the law.  The Court is convinced that both the spirit and letter of the Bouncing Checks Law would require for the act to be punished thereunder not only that the accused issued a check that is dishonored, but that likewise the accused has actually been notified in writing of the fact of dishonor.  The consistent rule is that penal statutes have to be construed strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>Unless and until the drawer or maker of the check receives a written notice of dishonor of the check, or where there is no proof as to when such notice of dishonor was received by the drawer or maker, the five-day period within which the drawer or maker has to pay the amount due or made arrangements with the drawee bank for the payment of the check, cannot be determined.  In such case, the <i>prima facie</i> presumption cannot arise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Emphasizing the intent of the State in providing a five-day banking period from notice of dishonor of a check within which the maker or drawer may pay the amount due or make arrangements with the drawee bank for its payment, the Court declared in <i>Lao v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><blockquote>It has been observed that the State, under this statute, actually offers the violator “a compromise by allowing him to perform some act which operates to preempt the criminal action, and if he opts to perform it the action is abated.” This was also compared “to certain laws allowing illegal possessors of firearms a certain period of time to surrender the illegally possessed firearms to the Government, without incurring any criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>If the maker or drawer pays, or makes arrangements with the drawee bank for the payment of the amount due within the five-day period from notice of the dishonor given to the drawer, it is a complete defense; the accused may no longer be indicted for violation of Section 1, B.P. Blg. 22.  If he is so indicted, he may set up the payment of the amount due as a complete defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution failed to prove that the COLF or the drawee bank ever sent any written notice of dishonor of the subject checks to the petitioner and that the latter received the same.  The only witness presented by the prosecution to prove its case against the petitioner was Eduardo R. Alvarez, who was in charge of the COLF collection department.  He testified that he signed the letters dated January 5, 1983<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and July 7, 1983,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> addressed to the petitioner notifying the latter of the dishonor of the subject checks.  However, Alvarez admitted that, after signing the said letters, he had the same transmitted to the collection department and had no personal knowledge whether the said letters were sent to and actually received by the petitioner.  The collection department merely told him that the letters were sent to the petitioner.<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You also talk of demand letters dated January 5, March 7 and April 6, all in the year 1983, which are marked Exhibits E, F, and G, respectively.

The COLF did not adduce in evidence the complaint for replevin and damages in Civil Case No. 3958 against the petitioner.  Furthermore, the trial court did not declare in its decision that the COLF sent notices of dishonor of the subject checks to the petitioner, and that the latter received such notices of dishonor.<br><br>The trial court convicted the petitioner of the crime of violating Section 1, B.P. Blg. 22, relying principally on the petitioner’s admission that, when Check No. 233533 became due, his funds in the drawee bank were insufficient to pay for the amount of the check; that his account with the drawee bank had already been closed when COLF deposited Check No. 233534; and, that he no longer funded his account to pay for the amounts of the ensuing checks.  The trial court concluded that on the basis of the said admission, there was no longer a need for the prosecution to prove that the petitioner received notices or letters notifying him of the dishonor of the subject checks after the dishonor thereof.  The appellate court agreed with the trial court.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Indeed, the petitioner admitted when he testified in his defense, that, on the due date of Check No. 233533, he was aware that he did not have funds in the drawee bank for the payment of the said check, and that when Check No. 233534 fell due on March 4, 1983, the bank had already closed the said account.  This, however, did not amount to an admission that, when he issued the said checks in June 1982, he had known that he had no funds in the drawee bank sufficient to pay for the amounts of the checks.  In fact, the petitioner testified that in 1983, he was granted credit facilities by the drawee bank and that the postdated checks he issued to the COLF for the rentals due from June to December, 1982 had been duly honored.  The drawee bank subsequently closed the petitioner’s account only because the latter had suffered financial reverses.<br><br>Assuming that the petitioner had knowledge that he had insufficient funds in the drawee bank when he issued the questioned checks, he could still have paid the checks or made arrangements with the drawee bank for the payment of the said checks if he had been duly notified of their dishonor.  In not sending a notice or letter of dishonor to the petitioner as required by law, the COLF deprived the petitioner of his right to avoid prosecution for violation of B.P.
