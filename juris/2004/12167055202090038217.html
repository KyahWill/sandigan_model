				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 28 October 2002 and its <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> promulgated on 14 January 2004 denying petitioner’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>.<br><br>The case stemmed from an action for Quieting of Title, Recovery of Possession and Damages with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction filed by the heirs of Alejo and Teresa Santiago against herein petitioner Daniel Celino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Petitioner filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> alleging that complainant Juliet Santiago did not have the legal capacity to sue, since she did not have the corresponding written authority to represent her co-plaintiffs, and since the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> failed to state a cause of action.&nbsp; The trial court, presided by Judge Antonio C. Reyes, denied the said motion on the ground that the issues posed by petitioner could best be resolved during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It likewise denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, pre-trial was held.&nbsp; There, plaintiff Juliet Santiago presented through counsel, a copy of the Special Power of Attorney<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> executed by Virginia S. Robertson and Gloria S. Tinoyan, two of the plaintiffs in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span>, authorizing counsels Juan Antonio R. Alberto III and Alexander A. Galpo to represent them in the pre-trial of the case.&nbsp; Likewise submitted was a Special Power of Attorney<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> executed by Romeo Santiago, Juliet Santiago and Larry Santiago in favor of above-named counsels to represent them in the pre-trial conference.<br><br>Trial ensued and plaintiffs therein, now respondents, presented their evidence.&nbsp; Petitioner filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer to Evidence</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> still on the ground of Juliet Santiago’s alleged lack of legal capacity to sue.&nbsp; Petitioner claimed that the evidence presented by Santiago should not be admitted since she failed to present any evidence of authority to file the complaint for and in behalf of her co-plaintiffs.&nbsp; In an <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> dated 29 April 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Judge Reyes denied the <span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer</span>, stating that Juliet Santiago had submitted the necessary authorization.&nbsp; On 10 July 2002, the Judge denied petitioner’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Petitioner thereafter filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition For Review on Certiorari</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> seeking to nullify and set aside the 29 April 2002 and the 10 July 2002 orders of the trial court.&nbsp; In its <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> dated 28 October 2003, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, stating that petitioner’s allegation of lack of legal capacity to sue is not the ground contemplated by the Rules of Court to support an adverse party’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer to Evidence</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thereafter, petitioner filed his <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which was denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner now submits the following issues:<blockquote><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER OR NOT A DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE UNDER RULE 33 OF THE REVISED RULES OF COURT MAY BE RESORTED TO WHEN CLEARLY THE COMPLAINT (SIC) HAS NO AUTHORITY TO SUE FOR AND IN BEHALF OF HER CO-PLAINTIFFS.</li><br><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPLAINT MAY BE DISMISSED FOR FAILURE OF CO-PLAINTIFFS TO EXECUTE AND SIGN THE CERTIFICATION AGAINST NON-FORUM SHOPPING.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>A demurrer to evidence is a motion to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of evidence and is presented after the plaintiff rests his case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It is an objection by one of the parties in an action, to the effect that the evidence which his adversary produced is insufficient in point of law, whether true or not, to make out a case or sustain the issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The evidence contemplated by the rule on demurrer is that which pertains to the merits of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus, as correctly held by the Court of Appeals, lack of legal capacity to sue is not a proper ground for a demurrer to evidence, pertaining as it does to a technical aspect, and it having nothing to do with the evidence on the merits of the complaint. &nbsp;Consequently, petitioner’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer to Evidence</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span> should be denied, as the trial court did.<br><br>Anent the second issue, we hold that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> may not be dismissed on account of the failure of the other plaintiffs to execute and sign the certification against non-forum shopping.<br><br>Respondents herein are co-owners of two parcels of land owned by their deceased mother.&nbsp; The properties were allegedly encroached upon by the petitioner.&nbsp; As co-owners of the properties, each of the heirs may properly bring an action for ejectment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> forcible entry and detainer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or any kind of action for the recovery of possession of the subject properties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, a co-owner may bring such an action, even without joining all the other co-owners as co-plaintiffs, because the suit is deemed to be instituted for the benefit of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> However, if the action is for the benefit of the plaintiff alone, such that he claims the possession for himself and not for the co-ownership, the action will not prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>It is clear from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> that the same was made precisely to recover possession of the properties owned in common, and as such, will redound to the benefit of all the co-owners.&nbsp; Indeed, in the verification of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span>, Juliet Santiago claimed that she caused the preparation and the filing of the said pleading as a co-owner of the subject properties and as a representative of the other plaintiffs.&nbsp; Hence, the instant case may prosper even without the authorization from Juliet Santiago’s co-plaintiffs.<br><br>From the procedural perspective, the instant petition should also fail.&nbsp; Petitioner questioned Juliet Santiago’s authority to sue in behalf of his co-plaintiffs in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span> dated 24 August 1999, which the lower court denied in its <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> dated 16 March 2000.&nbsp; After filing a motion for reconsideration dated 30 March 2000, as well as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Supplemental to Motion for Reconsideration</span> dated 11 April 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which the lower court denied in its <span style="font-style: italic;">Order</span> dated 02 May 2000, he did nothing until he filed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer to Evidence</span> dated 11 February 2002.&nbsp; But that was after the pre-trial and trial on the merits were conducted and plaintiffs had presented their evidence-in-chief.&nbsp; On the assumption that the lower court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Dismiss</span>’ petitioner as defendant should have filed the corresponding petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; He failed to do so within the period prescribed therefor, which is not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the order denying the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Thus, it is clear that even his petition under Rule 65 before the Court of Appeals was filed way out of time, it having been presented only on 31 July 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>While the instant petition seeks only to resolve the above-stated issues, this Court will not close its eyes to any irregularity or defect in any decision or disposition, which, if tolerated, may result to confusion, and even injustice to any of the litigants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, not only was the trial court miscreant in appreciating the documents presented before it, it was also injudicious in its&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;understanding of the nature of a demurrer to evidence.<br><br>Relying on the two Special Powers of Attorney presented by the plaintiff, the trial court denied petitioner’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer to Evidence</span> in the following manner:<blockquote>“Considering that plaintiff <span style="font-weight: bold;">Juliet Santiago has submitted the necessary Special Power of Authority from her co-plaintiffs authorizing her to institute the instant action</span> against the defendant, the Demurrer to Evidence is denied for lack of merit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>As correctly pointed out by the petitioner, the said instruments were grants of authority to plaintiffs’ counsel to represent them in the pre-trial conference and cannot in any way be constituted as a source of authority for Juliet Santiago to be the legal representative of her co-heirs.&nbsp; As such, plaintiff Juliet Santiago has not in fact presented any evidence supporting her claim that she is the duly constituted representative of the other named plaintiffs in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span>.&nbsp; Despite the very clear wording of the instruments, the trial court failed to appreciate the import of the same and equated the Special Powers of Attorney executed in favor of counsel to an authorization in favor of Juliet Santiago.<br><br>In this regard, Judge Antonio Reyes of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu is well-advised to be prudent and meticulous in appreciating the documents and evidence presented before him.&nbsp; The duty to be well-informed of the law and legal procedures is ingrained in the position of court judge.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the instant <span style="font-style: italic;">Petition</span> is DENIED for lack of merit.&nbsp; The assailed <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span> dated 28 October 2002 and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 14 January 2004 are hereby AFFIRMED.
