P1,000,000.00, as nominal damages; 2.) P50,000.00, as exemplary damages; 3.) P1,000.000.00, as moral damages; 4.) P50,000.00, as attorney’s fees; and 5.) Costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote> Respondents’ motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the trial court’s decision having been denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of March 2, 1993, they appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>Citing <i>Borjal et al. v. Court of Appeals et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which held that: <blockquote> The doctrine of fair comment means that while in general every discreditable imputation publicly made is deemed false, because every man is presumed innocent until his guilt is judicially proved, and every false imputation is deemed malicious, nevertheless, when the discreditable imputation is directed against a public person in his public capacity, it is not necessarily actionable.&nbsp;      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In order that such discreditable imputation to a public official maybe actionable, it must either be a false allegation of fact or a comment based on a falsesupposition.&nbsp; If the comment is an expression of opinion, based on established facts, thenit is immaterial that the opinion happens to be mistaken, as long as it might be reasonablyinferred from the facts.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Underscoring supplied), </blockquote> the CA found that herein petitioner “was not able to prove by a preponderance of evidence that [herein respondents] were motivated by a sinister intent to cause harm and injury to [herein petitioner] . . .” Accordingly, by Decision of July 31, 2001, the CA reversed and set aside the trial court’s decision and dismissed petitioner’s complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the appellate court’s decision was denied by Resolution of October 12, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> hence, the petition at bar.<br><br>The petition revolves around the issue of whether the CA erred in holding that the publication of the news item was not attended with malice to thus free respondents of liability for damages.<br><br>It bears noting that the complaint petitioner instituted is one for damages under Article 33 of the Civil Code which provides: <blockquote> Art. 33. In cases of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party.&nbsp; Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, shall require only a preponderance of evidence. </blockquote> Article 33 contemplates a civil action for the recovery of damages that is entirely unrelated to the purely criminal aspect of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  A civil action for libel under this article shall be instituted and prosecuted to final judgment and proved by preponderance of evidence separately from and entirely independent of the institution, pendency or result of the criminal action because it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">governed by theprovisions of the New Civil Code</span> and not by the Revised Penal Code governing the criminal offense charged and the civil liability arising therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The pertinent provisions of the Civil Code, those found in the Chapter on Human Relations, namely Articles 19 and 21, provide: <blockquote> Art. 19. Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.<br><br>Art. 21. Any person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage. </blockquote> In actions for damages for libel, it is axiomatic that the published work alleged to contain libelous material must be examined and viewed as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <blockquote> The article must be construed as an entirety including the headlines, as they may enlarge, explain, or restrict or be enlarged, explained or strengthened or restricted by the context.&nbsp; Whether or not it is libelous, depends upon the scope, spirit and motive of the publication taken in its entirety. x x x<br><br>A publication claimed to be defamatory must be read and construed in the sense in which the readers to whom it is addressed would ordinarily understand it.&nbsp; So, the whole item, including display lines, should be read and construed together, and its meaning and signification thus determined.<br><br>In order to ascertain the meaning of a published article, the whole of the article must be considered, each phrase must be construed in the light of the entire publication x x x&nbsp; The headlines of a newspaper must also be read in connection with the language which follows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </blockquote> Petitioner brands the news item as a “malicious sensationalization” of a patently embellished and salacious narration of fabricated facts involving rape and attempted rape incidents.&nbsp; For, so petitioner argues, the police blotter which was the sole basis for the news item plainly shows that there was only one count of abduction and rape reported by Emelita.<br><br>The entry made by Patrolman Chio in the police blotter which respondent Morales scrutinized at the WPD headquarters recorded indeed Emelita’s complaint about only a case for abduction with rape which occurred on March 14, 1987.&nbsp; In her above-quoted sworn statement, however, earlier given before the same Patrolman Chio <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the presence of Morales who subsequently interviewed her,</span> Emelita reported about an abduction with rape incident which occurred on March 14, 1987 <b>and</b> an abduction incident which occurred on April 13, 1987.<br><br>Petitioner’s anchoring of his complaint for damages on a charge of “malicious” sensationalization of fabricated facts thus fails.<br><br>The presentation of the news item subject of petitioner’s complaint may have been in a sensational manner, but it is not <i>per se</i> illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Respondents could of course have been more circumspect in their choice of words as the headline and first seven paragraphs of the news item give the impression that a certain director of the NIAS actually committed the crimes complained of by Emelita.&nbsp; The succeeding paragraphs (in which petitioner and complainant Emelita were eventually identified) sufficiently convey to the readers, however, that the narration of events was only an account of what Emelita had reported at the police headquarters.<br><br>In determining the manner in which a given event should be presented as a news item and the importance to be attached thereto, newspapers must enjoy a certain degree of discretion. <blockquote> Every citizen of course has the right to enjoy a good name and reputation, but we do not consider that the respondents, under the circumstances of this case, had violated said right or abused the freedom of the press.&nbsp;    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The newspapers should be given such leeway and tolerance as to enable them to courageously and effectively perform their important role in our democracy.&nbsp; In the preparation of stories, press reporters and [editors] usuallyhave to race with their deadlines; and consistently with good faith and reasonable care,they should not be held to account, to a point of suppression, for honest mistakes orimperfection in the choice of words.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> In fine, this Court finds that case against respondents has not been sufficiently established by preponderance of evidence.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez,</i> and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Vitug, (Chairman),</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 37-49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, April 12, 1991 at 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit “2,” Records at 450-451.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exhibit “1”, Records at 449.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, May 3, 1991 at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, April 12, 1991 at 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> TSN, May 3, 1991 at 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Exhibit “B,” Records at 386-387.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 29-65.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 109-114.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 93-94.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 347-353.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 353.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 354-375.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 424.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 301 SCRA 1 (1999).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> CA <i>Rollo</i> at 190-214.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Azucena v.
