				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Assailed in this petition for review is the Resolution dated August 19, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 71576<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which dismissed outright the petition for review filed by herein petitioners, as well as its Resolution dated January 10, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>In August 1993, spouses Marcelino B. Barba and Fortuna Marcos Barba filed an ejectment suit against the Pingkian III Homeowners Association, Inc. and its members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> docketed as Civil Case No. 7608, with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City. Included as defendant was herein petitioner Isidoro A. Padilla, Jr. Plaintiffs alleged that they were the registered owners of a 5.6-hectare property located at Pingkian Village, Pasong Tamo, Quezon City, under Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) Nos. 59721, 59725, 59726, and 59727 and that the defendants were illegal squatters thereon. In their answers, the defendants countered that they have been occupying the subject property since time immemorial; that the plaintiffs’ TCTs were spurious and fake; and, that they have pending applications for segregation of title with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City. After trial, the MeTC of Quezon City, Branch 36, decided the case in favor of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; The decision became final and executory on June 19, 1998 after resort to the RTC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and, finally, to this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> by the defendants proved to no avail.<br><br>A few years after or on December 13, 2001, Isidoro A. Padilla, Jr., his sister, Clara Rita A. Padilla, and their caretaker/overseer, Joseph Haldos, filed an action for ejectment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> root of the present petition, against respondent spouses Luis and Milagros Alipio. Petitioners alleged that they were the lawful and peaceful possessors, with a preferential right to buy, of a 288-square meter property located at No. 80 Ilang-Ilang St., Pingkian Village III, Brgy. Pasong Tamo, Quezon City; and, that respondent spouses illegally usurped possession thereof sometime in 1998 and refused to pay them rent. Respondent spouses denied that petitioners were the peaceful and lawful possessors of the subject property. On the contrary, they were defendants in Civil Case No. 7608 for ejectment against whom a judgment for eviction was rendered in favor of the spouses Marcelino and Fortuna Barba who had executed a Contract to Sell the disputed property in respondents’ favor since then.<br><br>On November 6, 2001, the MeTC of Quezon City, Branch 39, decided the case in favor of respondents. It held, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of the foregoing, the instant case is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of legal and factual merit.<br><br>The plaintiffs are hereby declared to have no right to the physical possession, use and occupation of the subject property in consonance to (<i>sic</i>) the final judgment rendered by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 32 (<i>sic</i>) of Quezon City in Civil Case No. 7608; each plaintiffs to pay, jointly and severally, each of the herein defendants the amount of P20,000.00 by way of moral damages and the sum of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages; to pay the sum of P10,000.00 as Attorney’s fees plus cost of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC of Quezon City affirmed the MeTC decision on appeal citing the law of the case doctrine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals. On August 19, 2002, the Court of Appeals issued the now assailed Resolution, which reads –<br><blockquote>The instant <b><i>petition for review is</i> DISMISSED <i>outright</i></b> in view of the fact that the petition is not accompanied by true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition (Section 2, Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners moved for reconsideration but was denied in the second assailed Resolution dated January 10, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 42 of the <b>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</b> governing petitions for review from decisions of the RTCs to the Court of Appeals provides, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Form and contents</i>.- The petition shall be filed in seven (7) legible copies, with the original copy intended for the court being indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall (a) state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the lower courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or respondents; (b) indicate the specific material dates showing that it was filed on time; (c) set forth concisely a statement of the matters involved, the issues raised, the specification of errors of fact or law, or both, allegedly committed by the Regional Trial Court, and the reasons or arguments relied upon for the allowance of the appeal; <u>(d) be accompanied by clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court, the requisite number of plain copies thereof and of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition</u>.&nbsp; (underscoring ours)<br></blockquote>The appellate court denied the petition for review filed by herein petitioners because it was “not accompanied by true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.”<br><br>A perusal of the petition for review filed with the Court of Appeals reveals that certified true copies of the RTC Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and of the RTC Order denying reconsideration were annexed therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The fact that no certified true copy of&nbsp; the&nbsp; MeTC Decision was similarly annexed is not enough to warrant dismissal of the petition. In <b>Silverio v. Court of Appeals</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> we ruled that failure to attach the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) decision to the petition for review filed with the Court of Appeals did not adversely affect the sufficiency of the petition because the Court of Appeals was supposed to review, not the MTC decision, but the RTC decision, a certified true copy of which has been attached to the petition. Moreover, we note that in the instant case, the RTC Decision was but an affirmation <i>in toto</i> of the MeTC Decision, the entire six (6) pages of which had been almost wholly quoted <i>verbatim</i> in the eight-paged RTC Decision.<br><br>With respect to the pleadings and other relevant portions of the record, a careful reading of the 297-paged petition for review filed with the Court of Appeals reveals that quoted therein were material portions of the complaint for ejectment, position paper, and comment on the respondents’ position paper filed by petitioners with the MeTC, as well as relevant portions of their memorandum on appeal and motion for reconsideration of the RTC Decision filed with the latter court. In <b>Cusi-Hernandez v. Diaz</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> citing <b>Cadayona v. Court of Appeals</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> we reiterated that supporting documents to the petition are not required to be certified true copies, it being enough that the assailed judgment, order or resolution is a certified true copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; At any rate, petitioners annexed copies of the supporting documents as well as a certified true copy of the MeTC Decision in their Motion for Reconsideration. Submission of a document together with the motion for reconsideration constitutes substantial compliance with the requirement that relevant or pertinent documents be submitted along with the petition, and calls for the relaxation of procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> We reiterated the same in <b>Serrano v. Galant Maritime Services, Inc.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on the reasoning that cases ought to be decided on the merits, rather than on technicalities, after full opportunity for the ventilation of their causes and defenses shall have been given to the parties. Indeed, while the right to appeal is a statutory, not a natural right, nonetheless, it is an essential part of our judicial system; and courts should proceed with caution so as not to deprive a party of the right to appeal, but rather, ensure that every party-litigant has the amplest opportunity for the proper and just disposition of his cause, freed from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances, therefore, we rule that there was substantial compliance with Sec. 2, Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, and that the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in dismissing the petition for review.<br><br>We shall not deal with the other issues in the petition, and instead remand the case to the Court of Appeals considering that petitioners raise factual issues in arguing that the law of the case doctrine should not have been applied by the RTC, jurisdiction over which pertains to the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 42. Moreover, questions of fact cannot be raised in an appeal via <i>certiorari</i> before this Court and are not proper for its consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The challenged Resolutions dated August 19, 2002 and January 10, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 71576 are <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to the Court of Appeals for decision on the merits.
