				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us on automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 9, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 81, Romblon, Romblon, in Criminal Case No. 2156 finding Cesar Glorioso Lagronio Padilla (a.k.a. “Erick Padilla”), appellant, guilty of rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death and to pay the victim P75,000.00 “as actual or compensatory.”<br><br>The Amended Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed against appellant reads: <blockquote> “The undersigned (prosecutor) accuses CESAR GLORIOSO LAGRONIO PADILLA, a.k.a. Erick Padilla, of the crime of rape as penalized under Republic Act No. 7659, in relation to Republic Act No. 8353, committed as follows:<br><br>“That on or about the 18<sup>th</sup> day of April 1999, in barangay Palje, municipality of Romblon, province of Romblon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, being the <u>live-in partner of her mother</u>, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one LAIZA MALLORCA-SALVADOR, an 8 year-old girl, and against her will.<br><br>“Contrary to law.” </blockquote> Upon arraignment, appellant, duly assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, Atty. Cesar M. Madrona of the Public Defender’s Office, pleaded “not guilty” to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>During the pre-trial, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts, among which are the following: (1) Laiza Mallorca-Salvador, the victim was born out of wedlock to Larry Salvador and Elisa Mallorca at Barangay Agbaluto, Romblon, Romblon; (2) in 1993, Larry and Elisa separated; (3) in August 1996, Elisa and appellant started living together as common-law husband and wife at barangay Palje, Romblon, Romblon continuously until April 18, 1999 when the instant crime was committed; and (4) during the live-in relationship of Elisa and appellant, Laiza was under their care and custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Upon termination of the pre-trial proceedings, trial ensued.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution reveals that in the morning of April 18, 1999, Laiza, a 9-year old Grade 3 pupil, was left alone with appellant in their house at barangay Palje, Romblon, Romblon. At that time, her mother Elisa was away looking for coconut to be used for making <i>bukayo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Laiza. was then washing the plates in the kitchen located outside their house when appellant commanded her to go inside. She did not readily obey him because she was scared that he would rape her again just what he did to her several times when she was in Grades 1 and 2.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He reacted violently, drawing his balisong as he repeated his command. This time she nervously went inside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He followed her. Once inside, he ordered her to lie down. He then removed her underwear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> When he held her vagina, she felt pain and struggled to free herself, but again, he drew his <i>balisong</i>. He went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. She shouted for help as she felt excruciating pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> But no one heard her desperate cries since they have no neighbors. Feeling helpless, she just cried. After sometime, he stood and she noticed a sticky substance coming out of his penis. Before he left, he threatened to kill her and her clan if she would reveal the incident to anyone. She just sat down crying as she noticed her vagina bleeding. Then she put on her underwear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Due to extreme pain of her vagina, Laiza mustered enough courage to report this harrowing incident to her mother. Without delay, they went to the police and filed a complaint against appellant. Laiza also submitted herself to a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> During the trial, she positively identified appellant as the one who raped her on April 18, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> She declared that he is a wicked person, a rapist,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and that he should be punished with death.<br><br>On April 20, 1999, Dr. Victorino F. Benedicto, Municipal Health Officer of Romblon, examined Laiza<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and issued a Medico-Legal Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> stating that her hymen was already ruptured with a healed laceration at 2:00 o’clock position. The laceration may have been caused by the penetration of an erect penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He noticed that the laceration was not fresh. He could not determine with certainty the exact date the laceration was inflicted.<br><br>Manuela R. Musa, Assistant Registration Officer of the Municipal Registrar of Romblon, presented to the trial court Laiza’s Certificate of Live Birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> showing that she was born to Elisa Mallorca and Larry Salvador on February 23, 1990 at barangay Agbaluto, Romblon, Romblon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Appellant, on the other hand, had a different story to tell. According to him, when he woke up in the morning of April 18, 1999, he was watching Elisa, his common-law wife, while washing clothes. Beside him was Laiza playing with her toys. Suddenly, Laiza climbed on his back with her right thigh on his right shoulder and her left thigh on his left shoulder. She was holding his head. When he stood, she lost her balance, but he quickly caught her with his hand which accidentally hit her vagina. This caused injury to her sex organ. Elisa immediately approached them and checked Laiza’s condition. She removed Laiza’s underwear and bathed her despite his objection since the injury in her vagina might get infected. Two days after, or on April 20, 1999, Laiza had fever due to infection. Thus, he instructed Elisa to bring Laiza to a doctor. Dr. Victorino F. Benedicto attended to Laiza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant further testified that on April 23, 1999, while working at the construction site, he was arrested by the police on account of Laiza’s complaint that he raped her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which he denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> &nbsp;He claimed that Elisa and Laiza had ill-motive in filing the rape charge because she (Elisa) found that he was courting a lady in their place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The defense also presented Dr. Victorio F. Benedicto as its witness to prove that Laiza had infection on her vagina when he examined her on April 20, 1999. Dr. Benedicto, however, testified that on such date, Laiza and a companion went to his clinic for consultation because of her (Laiza’s) complaint that she was raped and not because her vagina got infected. He was not even informed that Laiza was accidentally injured. When he examined Laiza, he did not notice any infection in her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On March 9, 2000, the trial court rendered its Decision convicting the appellant of rape, thus: <blockquote> “WHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused CESAR GLORIOSO LAGRONIO PADILLA, a.k.a. “ERICK PADILLA,” GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentences him to suffer the extreme penalty of death, as well as to pay the victim Laiza M. Salvador the sum of P75,000.00 as actual or compensatory, not moral, damages.<br><br>xxx<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </blockquote> Appellant, in his Brief, assails the Decision of the court <i>a quo</i>, contending that: <blockquote> “THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </blockquote> The Amended Information alleges that the crime was committed on April 18, 1999. Thus, the law applicable to the case at bar is Republic Act No. 8353 (otherwise known as “The Anti-Rape Law of 1997”), Section 2 of which provides: <blockquote> “Sec. 2. <i>Rape as a Crime Against Persons.</i> - The crime of rape shall hereafter be classified as a Crime Against Persons under Title Eight of Act No. 3815, as amended, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, there shall be incorporated into Title Eight of the same Code a new chapter to be known as Chapter Three on Rape, to read as follows: <blockquote> “Art. 266-A. <i>Rape; When and How Committed.</i> - <b>Rape is committed</b> -<br><br>1) By a <b>man</b> who shall <b>have carnal knowledge of a woman</b> under <b>any of the following circumstances:</b> <blockquote> a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br><br>xxx </blockquote> “Art. 266-B. <i>Penalties.</i> - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>xxx<br><br>The <b>death penalty</b> shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with <b>any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances</b>:<br><br>1) When the <b>victim is under eighteen (18) years of age</b> and the <b>offender</b> is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or <b>the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim</b>;<br><br>x x x.” (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote></blockquote> The elements of rape under the above-quoted provisions are: (1) the offender is a man who had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; or when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented.<br><br>The same provisions likewise categorized rape as either simple or qualified. It is qualified only when any of the qualify ing/aggravating circumstances which attended the commission of the crime is alleged in the Information and proven during trial, as for instance the victim is below 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s lone assignment of error is anchored on Dr. Benedicto’s testimony that when he examined Laiza on April 20, 1999, or two days after the incident, he found that the laceration in her hymen was <b>not fresh</b>, and that he could <b>not</b> determine with certainty the <b>exact date it was inflicted</b>. According to appellant, “the prosecution failed to indubitably prove” that Laiza was raped on April 18, 1999, and that he was the author of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General, in his Brief, counters that appellant’s contention is devoid of merit since the absence of fresh hymenal laceration is not indispensable in the prosecution for rape. It is Laiza’s testimony that she was sexually molested by appellant that is essential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Solicitor General.<br><br>In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in cases of rape, the victim’s testimony is crucial in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime in which only two persons are normally involved. He may be convicted on the basis of her lone, uncorroborated testimony provided it is clear, positive, convincing, and consistent with human nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, her testimony must be scrutinized with extreme caution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>We have assiduously reviewed the records and found that Laiza categorically and positively identified the appellant as the one who <b>had carnal knowledge of her by using force and intimidation on April 18, 1999</b>. An extract from Laiza’s testimony, quoted hereunder, indubitably shows such fact:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“PROSECUTOR BENEDICTO:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">You are testifying in a case of rape today, do you know that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">And the accused is Cesar Glorioso Lagronio Padilla alias Erick Padilla, do you know that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">If he is in the courtroom, will you stand and point to us the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">Will you go down from the witness stand and point to us the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">INTERPRETER:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Witness was asked to step down from the witness stand and asked to point the accused inside the courtroom and she pointed to the accused in the courtroom, and when asked his name answered ‘Erick Padilla.’</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">Do you remember where you were on April 18, 1999?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Inside the house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">In what barangay?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify">Palje.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">Where was your mother on April 18, 1999 while you were in your house at Palje?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Looking for coconut to be used for making bukayo.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">How about the accused Erick?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">In the house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">In whose house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Our house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">What were you doing at that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

She testified in a straightforward, candid and convincing manner, leaving no room for doubt that, on the day in question, she was indeed ravished by appellant, her mother’s live-in partner or common-law husband. Not even the information given her by appellant’s counsel that appellant could be meted the penalty of death because of her testimony, could change her account. At a tender age of 9, living in a remote barrio and absolutely inexperienced in the ways of the world, she could not have narrated in a spontaneous manner the sordid details of her horrifying ordeal in the hands of appellant had it not really happened to her. Appellant, by wielding his <i>balisong</i> and threatening her with death just before and after he deflowered her, clearly employed force and intimidation in consummating his bestial act.<br><br>It is settled jurisprudence that the testimony of a child-victim is given full weight and credence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> considering that when a woman, specially a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We find unmeritorious appellant’s contention that the prosecution failed to indubitably establish that he raped Laiza on April 18, 1999, simply because Dr. Benedicto, when he examined her two days after, had found healed/old (not fresh) laceration in the victim’s hymen and he could not determine the date when such laceration was inflicted.<br><br>It should not surprise appellant that the laceration in Laiza’s hymen is no longer fresh. It could be explained by the fact that, as testified by her, he sexually assaulted her when she was in Grades 1 and 2, the last time of which was on April 18, 1999.<br><br>In any event, it bears stressing that the medical findings of injuries or hymenal lacerations in the victim’s genitalia are not essential elements of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> To be sure, even the absence of such injuries does not negate rape. What is indispensable is that there was penetration of the penis, however slight, into the labia or lips of the female organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the case at bar, Laiza convincingly testified that appellant, through force and intimidation, inserted his penis into her vagina on April 18, 1999.<br><br>As against the positive and categorical testimony of Laiza, appellant could only proffer the defense of denial by narrating a totally different version of what actually happened in the morning of April 18, 1999 in their house. He merely speculated that Laiza’s hymen may have been ruptured not because he raped her but because it was accidentally hit by his hand when he tried to hold her while falling down.<br><br>Such defense burdens the imagination, to say the least. It is utterly preposterous, if not incredible. Dr. Benedicto, his own witness, contradicted appellant’s theory as he found no sign of infection on Laiza’s vagina. He even declared that she submitted herself to a physical examination because she complained of being raped, not on account of any alleged accidental injury. We have consistently held that the defense of denial, as in the instant case, is inherently weak, and it becomes even weaker in the face of the positive identification by the victim of the appellant as the violator of her honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Appellant, nonetheless, imputes ill-motive on Laiza and her mother Elisa in charging him with rape contending that the latter was jealous when she found that he was courting a woman in their place.<br><br>Again, appellant’s excuse is simply too frail to cause resentment and ill will on the part of Laiza and her mother against him.
