				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">All controversies on the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), even though they raise questions that are also legal or constitutional in nature.&nbsp; All doubts should be resolved in favor of the DAR, since the law has granted it special and original authority to hear and adjudicate agrarian matters.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the March 15, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the June 18, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR SP No. 58536.&nbsp; In the challenged Decision, the CA disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>“As previously stated, the principal issue raised in the court below involves a pure question of law.&nbsp; Thus, it being clear that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> has jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of the case below, it did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it issued the assailed order denying petitioner’s motion to dismiss and granting private respondent’s application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">denied due course</span> and is accordingly <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote> The assailed Resolution, on the other hand, denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>The CA narrated the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>“Private respondent Roberto J. Cuenca is the registered owner of a parcel of land designated as Lot No. 816-A and covered by TCT No. 1084, containing an area of 81.6117 hectares, situated in Brgy. Haguimit, La Carlota City and devoted principally to the planting of sugar cane.<br><br>“On 21 September 1999, Noe Fortunado, Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of La Carlota City issued and sent a NOTICE OF COVERAGE to private respondent Cuenca placing the above-described landholding under the compulsory coverage of R.A. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).&nbsp; The NOTICE OF COVERAGE also stated that the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) will determine the value of the subject land pursuant to Executive Order No. 405 dated 14 June 1990.<br><br>“On 29 September 1999, private respondent Cuenca filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 63, La Carlota City, a complaint against Noe Fortunado and Land Bank of the Philippines for ‘Annulment of Notice of Coverage and Declaration of Unconstitutionality of E.O. No. 405, Series of 1990, With Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order.’&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 713.<br><br>“In his complaint, Cuenca alleged, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that the implementation of CARP in his landholding is no longer with authority of law considering that, if at all, the implementation should have commenced and should have been completed between June 1988 to June 1992, as provided in the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL); that the placing of the subject landholding under CARP is without the <span style="font-style: italic;">imprimatur</span> of the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) and the Provincial Agrarian Reform Coordinating Committee (PARCOM) as required by R.A. 7905; that Executive Order No. 405 dated 14 June 1990 amends, modifies and/or repeals CARL and, therefore, it is unconstitutional considering that on 14 June 1990, then President Corazon Aquino no longer had law-making powers; that the NOTICE OF COVERAGE is a gross violation of PD 399 dated 28 February 1974.<br><br>“Private respondent Cuenca prayed that the Notice of Coverage be declared null and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> and Executive Order No. 405 dated 14 June 1990 be declared unconstitutional.<br><br>“On 05 October 1999, MARO Noe Fortunado filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> has no jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of the action, pursuant to R.A. 6657.<br><br>“On 12 January 2000, the respondent Judge issued a Temporary Restraining Order directing MARO and LBP to cease and desist from implementing the Notice of Coverage.&nbsp; In the same order, the respondent Judge set the hearing on the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction on January 17 and 18, 2000.<br><br>“On 14 January 2000, MARO Fortunado filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the order granting the TRO contending inter alia that the DAR, through the MARO, in the course of implementing the Notice of Coverage under CARP cannot be enjoined through a Temporary Restraining Order in the light of Sections 55 and 68 of R.A. 6657.<br><br>“In an order dated 16 February 2000, the respondent Judge denied MARO Noe Fortunado’s motion to dismiss and issued a Writ of Preliminary&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Injunction directing Fortunado and all persons acting in his behalf to cease and desist from implementing the Notice of Coverage, and the LBP from proceeding with the determination of the value of the subject land.<br><br>“The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) [thereafter filed before the CA] a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, assailing the writ of preliminary injunction issued by respondent Judge on the ground of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>“It is the submission of the petitioner that the assailed order is ‘in direct defiance… of Republic Act 6657, particularly Section 55 and 68’ thereof, which read:<br><blockquote>‘SECTION 55. NO RESTRAINING ORDERS OR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS – No court in the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction against the PARC or any of its duly authorized or designated agencies in any case, dispute or controversy arising from, necessary to, or in connection with the application, implementation, or&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;enforcement or interpretation of this Act and other pertinent laws on agrarian reform.’<br><br>‘SECTION 68 – IMMUNITY OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM COURT’S INTERFERENCE – No injunction, Restraining Order, prohibition or mandamus shall&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;be issued by the lower court against the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), the Department of Agriculture (DA), the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the implementation of their program.’ </blockquote> “Petitioner contends that by virtue of the above provisions, all lower courts, such as the court presided over by respondent Judge, ‘are barred if not prohibited by law to issue orders of injunctions against the Department of Agrarian Reform in the full implementation of the Notice of Coverage which is the initial step of acquiring lands under R.A. 6657.’<br><br>“Petitioner also contends that the nature and subject matter of the case below is purely agrarian in character over which the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> has no jurisdiction and that therefore, it had no authority to issue the assailed injunction order.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Stressing that the issue was not simply the improper issuance of the Notice of Coverage, but was mainly the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 405, the CA ruled that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) had jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Consonant with that authority,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> also had the power to issue writs and processes to enforce or protect the rights of the parties.<br><br>The appellate court likewise held that petitioner’s reliance on Sections 55 and 68 of RA 6657 had been misplaced, because the case was not about a purely agrarian matter.&nbsp; It opined that the prohibition in certain statutes against such writs pertained only to injunctions against administrative acts, to controversies involving facts, or to the exercise of discretion in technical cases.&nbsp; But on issues involving pure questions of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;law, courts were not prevented from exercising their power to restrain or prohibit administrative acts.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In its Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp; The Honorable Court of Appeals committed serious error by not taking into cognizance that the issues raised in the complaint filed by the private respondent, which seeks to exclude his land from the coverage of the CARP, is an agrarian reform matter and within the jurisdiction of the DAR, not with the trial court.<br><br>“2.&nbsp; The Honorable Court of Appeals, with due respect, gravely abused its discretion by sustaining the writ of injunction issued by the trial court, which is a violation of Sections 55 and 68 of Republic Act No. 6657.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </blockquote> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition has merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jurisdiction<br><br></span> </span></div> In its bare essentials, petitioner’s argument is that private respondent, in his Complaint for Annulment of the Notice of Coverage, is asking for the exclusion of his landholding from the coverage of the Comprehensive&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).&nbsp; According to the DAR, the issue involves the implementation of agrarian reform, a matter over which the DAR has original and exclusive jurisdiction, pursuant to Section 50 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (RA 6657).<br><br>On the other hand, private respondent maintains that his Complaint assails mainly the constitutionality of EO 405.&nbsp; He contends that since the Complaint raises a purely legal issue, it thus falls within the jurisdiction of the RTC.&nbsp; We do not agree.<br><br>Conflicts involving jurisdiction over agrarian disputes are as tortuous as the history of Philippine agrarian reform laws.&nbsp; The changing jurisdictional landscape is matched only by the tumultuous struggle for, and resistance to, the breaking up and distribution of large landholdings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Two Basic Rules</span></span><br><br>Two basic rules have guided this Court in determining jurisdiction in these cases.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, jurisdiction is conferred by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> And <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, the nature of the action and the issue of jurisdiction are shaped by the material averments of the complaint and the character of the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The defenses resorted to in the answer or motion to dismiss are disregarded; otherwise, the question of jurisdiction would depend entirely upon the whim of the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Grant of Jurisdiction</span></span><br><br>Ever since agrarian reform legislations began, litigants have invariably sought the aid of the courts.&nbsp; Courts of Agrarian Relations (CARs) were organized under RA 1267<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> “[f]or the enforcement of all laws and regulations governing the relation of capital and labor on all agricultural lands under any system of cultivation.” The jurisdiction of these courts was spelled out in Section 7 of the said law as follows:<br><blockquote>“Sec. 7. Jurisdiction of the Court. - The Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over the entire Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide, and settle all questions, matters, controversies or disputes involving all those relationships established by law which determine the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the parties works the land, and shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance over employer and farm employee or labor under Republic Act Numbered six hundred two and over landlord and tenant involving violations of the Usury Law (Act No. 2655, as amended) and of inflicting the penalties provided therefor.”<br></blockquote>All the powers and prerogatives inherent in or belonging to the then Courts of First Instance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (now the RTCs) were granted to the CARs.&nbsp; The latter were further vested by the Agricultural Land Reform Code (RA 3844) with original and exclusive jurisdiction over the following matters:<br><blockquote>“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All cases or actions involving matters, controversies, disputes, or money claims arising from agrarian relations: x x x<br><br>“(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All cases or actions involving violations of Chapters I and II of this Code and Republic Act Number eight hundred and nine; and<br><br>“(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expropriations to be instituted by the Land Authority: x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </blockquote> Presidential Decree (PD) No. 946 thereafter reorganized the CARs, streamlined their operations, and expanded their jurisdiction as follows:<br><blockquote>“Sec. 12. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jurisdiction over Subject Matter</span>. - The Courts of Agrarian Relations shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over:<br><blockquote>a) Cases involving the rights and obligations of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land except those cognizable by the National Labor Relations&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Commission; x x x ;<br><br>b) Questions involving rights granted and obligations imposed by laws, Presidential Decrees, Orders, Instructions, Rules and Regulations issued and promulgated in relation to the agrarian reform program; Provided, however, That matters involving the administrative implementation of the transfer of the land to the tenant-farmer&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;under Presidential Decree No. 27 and amendatory and related decrees, orders, instructions, rules and regulations, shall be exclusively cognizable by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, namely:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) classification and identification of landholdings;<br>(2) x x x;<br>(3) parcellary mapping;<br>(4) &nbsp;x x x;<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>m) Cases involving expropriation of all kinds of land in furtherance of the agrarian reform program;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br> </div> p) Ejectment proceedings instituted by the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Land Bank involving lands under their administration and disposition, except urban properties belonging to the Land Bank;<br><br>q) Cases involving violations of the penal provisions of Republic Act Numbered eleven hundred and ninety-nine, as amended, Republic Act Numbered thirty eight hundred and forty-four, as amended, Presidential Decrees and laws relating to agrarian reform; Provided, however, That violations of the said penal provisions committed by any Judge shall be tried by the courts of general jurisdiction; and<br><br>r)&nbsp; Violations of Presidential Decrees Nos. 815 and 816. </blockquote></blockquote> The CARs were abolished, however, pursuant to Section 44<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (approved August 14, 1981), which had fully been implemented on February 14, 1983. Jurisdiction over cases theretofore given to the CAR’s was vested in the RTCs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Then came Executive Order No. 229.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Under Section 17 thereof, the DAR shall exercise “quasi-judicial powers to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters involving implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the DENR and the Department of Agriculture [DA].” The DAR shall also have the “powers to punish for contempt and to issue subpoena, subpoena duces tecum and writs to enforce&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;its orders or decisions.”<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Quismundo v. CA</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> this provision was deemed to have repealed Section 12 (a) and (b) of Presidential Decree No. 946, which vested the then Courts of Agrarian Relations with “original exclusive jurisdiction over cases and questions involving rights&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;granted and obligations imposed by presidential issuances promulgated in relation to the agrarian reform program.”<br><br>Under Section 4 of Executive Order No. 129-A, the DAR was also made “responsible for implementing the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Program.”&nbsp; In accordance with Section 5 of the same EO, it possessed the following powers and functions:<br><blockquote>“(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement all agrarian laws, and for this purpose, punish for contempt and issue subpoena, subpoena duces tecum, writs of execution of its decisions, and other legal processes to ensure successful and expeditious program implementation; the decisions of the Department may in proper cases, be appealed to the Regional Trial Courts but&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shall be immediately executory notwithstanding such appeal;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br> </div> “(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide free legal services to agrarian reform beneficiaries and resolve agrarian conflicts and land-tenure related problems as may be provided for by law;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br> </div> “(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have exclusive authority to approve or disapprove conversion of agricultural lands for residential, commercial, industrial, and other land uses as may be provided x x x." </blockquote> The above grant of jurisdiction to the DAR covers these areas:<br><blockquote>(a) adjudication of all matters involving implementation of agrarian reform;<br><br>(b) resolution of agrarian conflicts and land tenure related problems; and<br><br>(c) approval or disapproval of the conversion, restructuring or readjustment of agricultural lands into residential, commercial, industrial, and other non-agricultural uses. </blockquote> The foregoing provision was as broad as those “theretofore vested&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;in the Regional Trial Court by Presidential Decree No. 946,” as the Court ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Vda. de Tangub v. CA</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which we quote:<br><blockquote>“x x x. The intention evidently was to transfer original jurisdiction to the Department of Agrarian Reform, a proposition stressed by the rules formulated and promulgated by the Department for the implementation of the executive orders just quoted. The rules included the creation of the Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board designed to exercise the adjudicatory functions of the Department, and the allocation to it of —<br><blockquote>‘x x x [O]riginal and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter vested upon it by law, and all cases, disputes, controversies and matters or incidents involving the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program under Executive Order No. 229, Executive Order No. 129-A, Republic Act No. 3844, as amended by Republic Act No. 6289, Presidential Decree No. 27 and other agrarian laws and their implementing rules and regulations.’ </blockquote> “The implementing rules also declare that ‘(s)pecifically, such jurisdiction shall extend over but not be limited to x x x (that theretofore vested in the Regional Trial Courts, i.e.) (c)ases involving the rights and obligations of persons engaged in the cultivation and use of agricultural land covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) and other agrarian laws x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </blockquote> In the same case, the Court also held that the jurisdictional competence of the DAR had further been clarified by RA 6657 thus:<br><blockquote>“x x x. The Act [RA 6657] makes references to and explicitly recognizes the effectivity and applicability of Presidential Decree No. 229.&nbsp; More particularly, the Act echoes the provisions of Section 17 of Presidential Decree No. 229, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, investing the Department of Agrarian Reform with original jurisdiction, generally, over all cases involving agrarian laws, although, as shall shortly be pointed out, it restores to the Regional Trial Court, limited jurisdiction over two groups of cases.&nbsp; Section 50 reads as follows:<br><blockquote>‘SEC. 50. Quasi-Judicial Powers of the DAR. — The DAR is hereby vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture [DA] and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources [DENR].<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br> </div> ‘It shall have the power to summon witnesses, administer oaths,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;take testimony, require submission of reports, compel the production of books and documents and answers to interrogatories and issue subpoena and subpoena duces tecum and to enforce its writs through sheriffs or other duly deputized officers. It shall likewise have the power to punish direct and indirect contempt in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as provided in the Rules of Court.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </blockquote></blockquote> Nonetheless, we have held that the RTCs have not been completely divested of jurisdiction over agrarian reform matters. Section 56 of RA 6657 confers special jurisdiction on “Special Agrarian Courts,” which are actually RTCs designated as such by the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Under Section 57 of the same law, these Special Agrarian Courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over the following matters:<br><blockquote>“1) ‘all petitions for the determination of just compensation to land-owners,’ and<br><br>“2) ‘the prosecution of all criminal offenses under x x x [the] Act.’” </blockquote> The above delineation of jurisdiction remains in place to this date.&nbsp; Administrative Circular No. 29-2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of this Court stresses the distinction between the quasi-judicial powers of the DAR under Sections 50 and 55 of RA 6657 and the jurisdiction of the Special Agrarian Courts referred to by Sections 56 and 57 of the same law.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Allegations of the Complaint</span></span><br><br>A careful perusal of respondent’s Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> shows that the principal averments and reliefs prayed for refer -- not to the “pure question of law” spawned by the alleged unconstitutionality of EO 405 --but to the annulment of the DAR’s Notice of Coverage. Clearly, the main thrust of the allegations is the propriety of the Notice of Coverage, as may be gleaned from the following averments, among others:<br><blockquote>“6.
