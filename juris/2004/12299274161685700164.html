				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 54354 affirming with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, 7th Judicial Region, Cebu City, Branch 20, in Civil Case No. CEB-5963 for breach of contract of carriage, damages and attorney’s fees, and the Resolution dated February 26, 1999 denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.<br><br>The following facts are undisputed:<br><br>At about 10:00 p.m. of March 15, 1987, the cargo truck marked “Condor Hollow Blocks and General Merchandise” bearing plate number GBP-675 was loaded with firewood in Bogo, Cebu and left for Cebu City. Upon reaching Sitio Aggies, Poblacion, Compostela, Cebu, just as the truck passed over a bridge, one of its rear tires exploded. The driver, Sergio Pedrano, then parked along the right side of the national highway and removed the damaged tire to have it vulcanized at a nearby shop, about 700 meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Pedrano left his helper, Jose Mitante, Jr. to keep watch over the stalled vehicle, and instructed the latter to place a spare tire six fathoms away<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> behind the stalled truck to serve as a warning for oncoming vehicles. The truck’s tail lights were also left on. It was about 12:00 a.m., March 16, 1987.<br><br>At about 4:45 a.m., D’ Rough Riders passenger bus with plate number PBP-724 driven by Virgilio Te Laspiñas was cruising along the national highway of Sitio Aggies, Poblacion, Compostela, Cebu. The passenger bus was also bound for Cebu City, and had come from Maya, Daanbantayan, Cebu. Among its passengers were the Spouses Pedro A. Arriesgado and Felisa Pepito Arriesgado, who were seated at the right side of the bus, about three (3) or four (4) places from the front seat.<br><br>As the bus was approaching the bridge, Laspiñas saw the stalled truck, which was then about 25 meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He applied the breaks and tried to swerve to the left to avoid hitting the truck. But it was too late; the bus rammed into the truck’s left rear. The impact damaged the right side of the bus and left several passengers injured.&nbsp; Pedro Arriesgado lost consciousness and suffered a fracture in his right colles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> His wife, Felisa, was brought to the Danao City Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was later transferred to the Southern Island Medical Center where she died shortly thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Respondent Pedro A. Arriesgado then filed a complaint for breach of contract of carriage, damages and attorney’s fees before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 20, against the petitioners, D’ Rough Riders bus operator William Tiu and his driver, Virgilio Te Laspiñas on May 27, 1987. The respondent alleged that the passenger bus in question was cruising at a fast and high speed along the national road, and that petitioner Laspiñas did not take precautionary measures to avoid the accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thus:<blockquote><ol start="6"><li>That the accident resulted to the death of the plaintiff’s wife, Felisa Pepito Arriesgado, as evidenced by a Certificate of Death, a xerox copy of which is hereto attached as integral part hereof and marked as ANNEX – “A”, and physical injuries to several of its passengers, including plaintiff himself who suffered a “COLLES FRACTURE RIGHT,” per Medical Certificate, a xerox copy of which is hereto attached as integral part hereof and marked as ANNEX – “B” hereof.</li><br><li>That due to the reckless and imprudent driving by defendant Virgilio Te Laspiñas of the said Rough Riders passenger bus, plaintiff and his wife, Felisa Pepito Arriesgado, failed to safely reach their destination which was Cebu City, the proximate cause of which was defendant-driver’s failure to observe utmost diligence required of a very cautious person under all circumstances.</li><br><li>That defendant William Tiu, being the owner and operator of the said Rough Riders passenger bus which figured in the said accident, wherein plaintiff and his wife were riding at the time of the accident, is therefore directly liable for the breach of contract of carriage for his failure to transport plaintiff and his wife safely to their place of destination which was Cebu City, and which failure in his obligation to transport safely his passengers was due to and in consequence of his failure to exercise the diligence of a good father of the family in the selection and supervision of&nbsp; his employees, particularly defendant-driver Virgilio Te Laspiñas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The respondent prayed that judgment be rendered in his favor and that the petitioners be condemned to pay the following damages: <br><blockquote>1). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>30,000.00 for the death and untimely demise of plaintiff’s wife, Felisa Pepito Arriesgado;<br><br>2). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>38,441.50, representing actual expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with the death/burial of plaintiff’s wife;<br><br>3). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>1,113.80, representing medical/hospitalization expenses incurred by plaintiff for the injuries sustained by him;<br><br>4). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00 for moral damages;<br><br>5). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00 by way of exemplary damages;<br><br>6). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>20,000.00 for attorney’s fees;<br><br>7). To pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the amount of <s>P</s>5,000.00 for litigation expenses. <br><br>PLAINTIFF FURTHER PRAYS FOR SUCH OTHER RELIEFS AND REMEDIES IN LAW AND EQUITY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The petitioners, for their part, filed a Third-Party Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on August 21, 1987 against the following: respondent Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc. (PPSII), petitioner Tiu’s insurer; respondent Benjamin Condor, the registered owner of the cargo truck; and respondent Sergio Pedrano, the driver of the truck.&nbsp; They alleged that petitioner Laspiñas was negotiating the uphill climb along the national highway of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sitio</span> Aggies, Poblacion, Compostela, in a moderate and normal speed. It was further alleged that the truck was parked in a slanted manner, its rear portion almost in the middle of the highway, and that no early warning device was displayed. Petitioner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laspiñas promptly applied the brakes and swerved to the left to avoid hitting the truck head-on, but despite his efforts to avoid damage to property and physical injuries on the passengers, the right side portion of the bus hit the cargo truck’s left rear. The petitioners further alleged, thus:<blockquote><ol start="5"><li>That the cargo truck mentioned in the aforequoted paragraph is owned and registered in the name of the third-party defendant Benjamin Condor and was left unattended by its driver Sergio Pedrano, one of the third-party defendants, at the time of the incident;</li><br><li>That third-party defendant Sergio Pedrano, as driver of the cargo truck with marked (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) “Condor Hollow Blocks &amp; General Merchandise,” with Plate No. GBP-675 which was recklessly and imprudently parked along the national highway of Compostela, Cebu during the vehicular accident in question, and third-party defendant Benjamin Condor, as the registered owner of the cargo truck who failed to exercise due diligence in the selection and supervision of third-party defendant Sergio Pedrano, are jointly and severally liable to the third-party plaintiffs for whatever liability that may be adjudged against said third-party plaintiffs or are directly liable of (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) the alleged death of plaintiff’s wife;</li><br><li>That in addition to all that are stated above and in the answer which are intended to show reckless imprudence on the part of the third-party defendants, the third-party plaintiffs hereby declare that during the vehicular accident in question, third-party defendant was clearly violating Section 34, par. (g) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code…</li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">…</div><ol start="10"><li>That the aforesaid passenger bus, owned and operated by third-party plaintiff William Tiu, is covered by a common carrier liability insurance with Certificate of Cover No. 054940 issued by Philippine Phoenix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surety and Insurance, Inc., Cebu City Branch, in favor of third-party plaintiff William Tiu which covers the period from July 22, 1986 to July 22, 1987 and that the said insurance coverage was valid, binding and subsisting during the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time of the aforementioned incident (Annex “A” as part hereof);</li><br><li>That after the aforesaid alleged incident, third-party plaintiff notified third-party defendant Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc., of the alleged incident hereto mentioned, but to no avail;</li><br><li>That granting, et arguendo et arguendi, if herein third-party plaintiffs will be adversely adjudged, they stand to pay damages sought by the plaintiff and therefore could also look up to the Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc., for contribution, indemnification and/or reimbursement of any liability or obligation that they might [be] adjudged per insurance coverage duly entered into by and between third-party plaintiff William Tiu and third-party defendant Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc.;…<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The respondent PPSII, for its part, admitted that it had an existing contract with petitioner Tiu, but averred that it had already attended to and settled the claims of those who were injured during the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It could not accede to the claim of respondent Arriesgado, as such claim was way beyond the scheduled indemnity as contained in the contract of insurance. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After the parties presented their respective evidence, the trial court ruled in favor of respondent Arriesgado. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff as against defendant William Tiu ordering the latter to pay the plaintiff the following amounts:<br><br>1 - The sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (<s>P</s>50,000.00) as moral damages;<br><br>2 - The sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (<s>P</s>50,000.00) as exemplary damages;<br><br>3 - The sum of THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY-ONE PESOS (<s>P</s>38,441.00) as actual damages;<br><br>4 - The sum of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (<s>P</s>20,000.00) as attorney’s fees;<br><br>5 - The sum of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (<s>P</s>5,000.00) as costs of suit;<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>According to the trial court, there was no dispute that petitioner William Tiu was engaged in business as a common carrier, in view of his admission that D’ Rough Rider passenger bus which figured in the accident was owned by him; that he had been engaged in the transportation business for 25 years with a sole proprietorship; and that he owned 34 buses. The trial court ruled that if petitioner Laspiñas had not been driving at a fast pace, he could have easily swerved to the left to avoid hitting the truck, thus,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; averting the unfortunate incident. It then concluded that petitioner Laspiñas was negligent.<br><br>The trial court also ruled that the absence of an early warning device near the place where the truck was parked was not sufficient to impute negligence on the part of respondent Pedrano, since the tail lights of the truck were fully on, and the vicinity was well lighted by street lamps.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It also found that the testimony of petitioner Tiu, that he based the selection of his driver Laspiñas on efficiency and in-service training, and that the latter had been so far an efficient and good driver for the past six years of his employment, was insufficient to prove that he observed the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of his employees.<br><br>After the petitioner’s motion for reconsideration of the said decision was denied, the petitioners elevated the case to the Court of Appeals on the following issues:<blockquote><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER THIRD PARTY DEFENDANT SERGIO PEDRANO WAS RECKLESS AND IMPRUDENT WHEN HE PARKED THE CARGO TRUCK IN AN OBLIQUE MANNER;</li><br><li>WHETHER THE THIRD PARTY DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE DIRECTLY TO PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE OR TO DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS FOR WHATEVER LIABILITY THAT MAY BE ADJUDGED TO THE SAID DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS;</li><br><li>WHETHER DEFENDANT-APPELLANT VIRGILIO TE LASPIÑAS WAS GUILTY OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE;</li><br><li>WHETHER DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WILLIAM TIU HAD EXERCISED THE DUE DILIGENCE OF A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY IN THE SELECTION AND SUPERVISION OF HIS DRIVERS;</li><br><li>GRANTING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WILLIAM TIU IS LIABLE TO PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, WHETHER THERE IS LEGAL AND FACTUAL BASIS IN AWARDING EXCESSIVE MORAL DAMAGES, EX[E]MPLARY DAMAGES, ATTORNEY’S FEES AND LITIGATION EXPENSES TO PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE;</li><br><li>WHETHER THIRD PARTY DEFENDANT PHILIPPINE PHOENIX SURETY AND INSURANCE, INC. IS LIABLE TO DEFENDANT- APPELLANT WILLIAM TIU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The appellate court rendered judgment affirming the trial court’s decision with the modification that the awards for moral and exemplary damages were reduced to P25,000. The dispositive portion reads:<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">WHEREFORE</span></span>, the appealed Decision dated November 6, 1995 is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">MODIFIED</span></span> such that the awards for moral and exemplary damages are each reduced to P25,000.00 or a total of P50,000.00 for both. The judgment is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> in all other respects.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">SO ORDERED.</span></span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>According to the appellate court, the action of respondent Arriesgado was based not on quasi-delict but on breach of contract of carriage. As a common carrier, it was incumbent upon petitioner Tiu to prove that extraordinary diligence was observed in ensuring the safety of passengers during transportation. Since the latter failed to do so, he should be held liable for respondent Arriesgado’s claim.&nbsp; The CA also ruled that no evidence was presented against the respondent PPSII, and as such, it could not be held liable for respondent Arriesgado’s claim, nor for contribution, indemnification and/or reimbursement in case the petitioners were adjudged liable.<br><br>The petitioners now come to this Court and ascribe the following errors committed by the appellate court:<blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT DECLARING RESPONDENTS BENJAMIN CONDOR AND SERGIO PEDRANO GUILTY OF NEGLIGENCE AND HENCE, LIABLE TO RESPONDENT PEDRO A. ARRIESGADO OR TO PETITIONERS FOR WHATEVER LIABILITY THAT MAY BE ADJUDGED AGAINST THEM.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING PETITIONERS GUILTY OF NEGLIGENCE AND HENCE, LIABLE TO RESPONDENT PEDRO A. ARRIESGADO.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING PETITIONER WILLIAM TIU LIABLE FOR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, ATTORNEY’S FEES AND LITIGATION EXPENSES.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING RESPONDENT PHILIPPINE PHOENIX SURETY AND INSURANCE, INC. LIABLE TO RESPONDENT PEDRO A. ARRIESGADO OR TO PETITIONER WILLIAM TIU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>According to the petitioners, the appellate court erred in failing to appreciate the absence of an early warning device and/or built-in reflectors at the front and back of the cargo truck, in clear violation of Section 34, par. (g) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. They aver that such violation is only a proof of respondent Pedrano’s negligence, as provided under Article 2185 of the New Civil Code. They also question the appellate court’s failure to take into account that the truck was parked in an oblique manner, its rear portion almost at the center of the road. As such, the proximate cause of the incident was the gross recklessness and imprudence of respondent Pedrano, creating the presumption of negligence on the part of respondent Condor in supervising his employees, which presumption was not rebutted. The petitioners then contend that respondents Condor and Pedrano should be held jointly and severally liable to respondent Arriesgado for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; payment of the latter’s claim.<br><br>The petitioners, likewise, aver that expert evidence should have been presented to prove that petitioner Laspiñas was driving at a very fast speed, and that the CA could not reach such conclusion by merely considering the damages on the cargo truck. It was also pointed out that petitioner Tiu presented evidence that he had exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of his drivers.<br><br>The petitioners further allege that there is no legal and factual basis to require petitioner Tiu to pay exemplary damages as no evidence was presented to show that the latter acted in a fraudulent, reckless and oppressive manner, or that he had an active participation in the negligent act of petitioner Laspiñas.<br><br>Finally, the petitioners contend that respondent PPSII admitted in its answer that while it had attended to and settled the claims of the other injured passengers, respondent Arriesgado’s claim remained unsettled as it was beyond the scheduled indemnity under the insurance contract. The petitioners argue that said respondent PPSII should have settled the said claim in accordance with the scheduled indemnity instead of just denying the same.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent Arriesgado argues that two of the issues raised by the petitioners involved questions of fact, not reviewable by the Supreme Court: the finding of negligence on the part of the petitioners and their liability to him; and the award of exemplary damages, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses in his favor. Invoking the principle of equity and justice, respondent Arriesgado pointed out that if there was an error to be reviewed in the CA decision, it should be geared towards the restoration of the moral and exemplary damages to <s>P</s>50,000 each, or a total of <s>P</s>100,000 which was reduced by the Court of Appeals to <s>P</s>25,000 each, or a total of only <s>P</s>50,000.<br><br>Respondent Arriesgado also alleged that respondents Condor and Pedrano, and respondent Phoenix Surety, are parties with whom he had no contract of carriage, and had no cause of action against. It was pointed out that only the petitioners needed to be sued, as driver and operator of the ill-fated bus, on account of their failure to bring the Arriesgado Spouses to their place of destination as agreed upon&nbsp; in the contract of carriage, using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons with due regard for all circumstances.<br><br>Respondents Condor and Pedrano point out that, as correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, the proximate cause of the unfortunate incident was the fast speed at which petitioner Laspiñas was driving the bus owned by petitioner Tiu. According to the respondents, the allegation that the truck was not equipped with an early warning device could not in any way have prevented the incident from happening. It was also pointed out that respondent Condor had always exercised the due diligence required in the selection and supervision of his employees, and that he was not a party to the contract of carriage between the petitioners and respondent Arriesgado.<br><br>Respondent PPSII, for its part, alleges that contrary to the allegation of petitioner Tiu, it settled all the claims of those injured in accordance with the insurance contract. It further avers that it did not deny respondent Arriesgado’s claim, and emphasizes that its liability should be within the scheduled limits of indemnity under the said contract. The respondent concludes that while it is true that insurance contracts are contracts of indemnity, the measure of the insurer’s liability is determined by the insured’s compliance with the terms thereof.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span></div><br>At the outset, it must be stressed that this Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Factual findings of the Court of Appeals are final and may not be reviewed on appeal by this Court, except when the lower court and the CA arrived at diverse factual findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The petitioners in this case assail the finding of both the trial and the appellate courts that petitioner Laspiñas was driving at a very fast speed before the bus owned by petitioner Tiu collided with respondent Condor’s stalled truck. This is clearly one of fact, not reviewable by the Court in a petition for review under Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On this ground alone, the petition is destined to fail.<br><br>However, considering that novel questions of law are likewise involved, the Court resolves to examine and rule on the merits of the case.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Petitioner Laspiñas</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Was negligent in driving</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Ill-fated bus</span><br><br>In his testimony before the trial court, petitioner Laspiñas claimed that he was traversing the two-lane road at Compostela, Cebu at a speed of only forty (40) to fifty (50) kilometers per hour before the incident occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He also admitted that he <span style="font-style: italic;">saw</span> the truck which was parked in an “oblique position” at about 25 meters before impact,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and tried to avoid hitting it by swerving to the left. However, even in the absence of expert evidence, the damage sustained by the truck<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> itself supports the finding of both the trial court and the appellate court, that the D’ Rough Rider bus driven by petitioner Laspiñas was traveling at a fast pace. Since he saw the stalled truck at a distance of 25 meters, petitioner Laspiñas had more than enough time to swerve to his left to avoid hitting it; that is, if the speed of the bus was only 40 to 50 kilometers per hour as he claimed. As found by the Court of Appeals, it is easier to believe that petitioner Laspiñas was driving at a very fast speed, since at 4:45 a.m., the hour of the accident, there were no oncoming vehicles at the opposite direction. Petitioner Laspiñas could have swerved to the left lane with proper clearance, and, thus, could have avoided the truck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Instinct, at the very least, would have prompted him to apply the breaks to avert the impending disaster which he must have foreseen when he caught sight of the stalled truck. As we had occasion to reiterate:<blockquote>A man must use common sense, and exercise due reflection in all his acts; it is his duty to be cautious, careful and prudent, if not from instinct, then through fear of recurring punishment. He is responsible for such results as anyone might foresee and for acts which no one would have performed except through culpable abandon. Otherwise, his own person, rights and property, and those of his fellow beings, would ever be exposed to all manner of danger and injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>We agree with the following findings of the trial court, which were affirmed by the CA on appeal:<blockquote>A close study and evaluation of the testimonies and the documentary proofs submitted by the parties which have direct bearing on the issue of negligence, this Court as shown by preponderance of evidence that defendant Virgilio Te Laspiñas failed to observe extraordinary diligence as a driver of the common carrier in this case. It is quite hard to accept his version of the incident that he did not see at a reasonable distance ahead the cargo truck that was parked when the Rough Rider [Bus] just came out of the bridge which is on an (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) [more] elevated position than the place where the cargo truck was parked. With its headlights fully on, defendant driver of the Rough Rider was in a vantage position to see the cargo truck ahead which was parked and he could just easily have avoided hitting and bumping the same by maneuvering to the left without hitting the said cargo truck. Besides, it is (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) shown that there was still much room or space for the Rough Rider to pass at the left lane of the said national highway even if the cargo truck had occupied the entire right lane thereof. It is not true that if the Rough Rider would proceed to pass through the left lane it would fall into a canal considering that there was much space for it to pass without hitting and bumping the cargo truck at the left lane of said national highway. The records, further, showed that there was no incoming vehicle at the opposite lane of the national highway which would have prevented the Rough Rider from not swerving to its left in order to avoid hitting and bumping the parked cargo truck. But the evidence showed that the Rough Rider instead of swerving to the still spacious left lane of the national highway plowed directly into the parked cargo truck hitting the latter at its rear portion; and thus, the (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) causing damages not only to herein plaintiff but to the cargo truck as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>Indeed, petitioner Laspiñas’ negligence in driving the bus is apparent in the records. By his own admission, he had just passed a bridge and was traversing the highway of Compostela, Cebu at a speed of 40 to 50 kilometers per hour before the collision occurred.

Accordingly, it is difficult to see what role, if any, the common law of last clear chance doctrine has to play in a jurisdiction where the common law concept of contributory negligence as an absolute bar to recovery by the plaintiff, has itself been rejected, as it has been in Article 2179 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Thus, petitioner Tiu cannot escape liability for the death of respondent Arriesgado’s wife due to the negligence of petitioner Laspiñas, his employee, on this score.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Respondents Pedrano and<br>Condor were likewise<br>Negligent<br><br></span>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Phoenix Construction, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> where therein respondent Dionisio sustained injuries when his vehicle rammed against a dump truck parked askew, the Court ruled that the improper parking of a dump truck without any warning lights or reflector devices created an unreasonable risk for anyone driving within the vicinity, and for having created such risk, the truck driver must be held responsible. In ruling against the petitioner therein, the Court elucidated, thus:<blockquote>… In our view, Dionisio’s negligence, although later in point of time than the truck driver’s negligence, and therefore closer to the accident, was not an efficient intervening or independent cause. What the petitioners describe as an “intervening cause” was no more than a foreseeable consequence of the risk created by the negligent manner in which the truck driver had parked the dump truck. In other words, the petitioner truck driver owed a duty to private respondent Dionisio and others similarly situated not to impose upon them the very risk the truck driver had created. Dionisio’s negligence was not that of an independent and overpowering nature as to cut, as it were, the chain of causation in fact between the improper parking of the dump truck and the accident, nor to sever the <span style="font-style: italic;">juris vinculum</span> of liability. …<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">…</div><br>We hold that private respondent Dionisio’s negligence was “only contributory,” that the “immediate and proximate cause” of the injury remained the truck driver’s “lack of due care.”…<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote>In this case, both the trial and the appellate courts failed to consider that respondent Pedrano was also negligent in leaving the truck parked askew without any warning lights or reflector devices to alert oncoming vehicles, and that such failure created the presumption of negligence on the part of his employer, respondent Condor, in supervising his employees properly and adequately. As we ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Poblete v. Fabros</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><blockquote>It is such a firmly established principle, as to have virtually formed part of the law itself, that the negligence of the employee gives rise to the presumption of negligence on the part of the employer. This is the presumed negligence in the selection and supervision of employee. The theory of presumed negligence, in contrast with the American doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">respondeat superior</span>, where the negligence of the employee is <span style="font-style: italic;">conclusively</span> presumed to be the negligence of the employer, is clearly deducible from the last paragraph of Article 2180 of the Civil Code which provides that the responsibility therein mentioned shall cease if the employers prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damages. …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote>The petitioners were correct in invoking respondent Pedrano’s failure to observe Article IV, Section 34(g) of the Rep. Act No. 4136, which provides:<blockquote>(g)&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Lights when parked or disabled. – </span>Appropriate parking lights or flares <span style="font-style: italic;">visible one hundred meters away</span> shall be displayed at a corner of the vehicle whenever such vehicle is parked on highways or in places that are not well-lighted or is placed in such manner as to endanger passing traffic.</blockquote>The manner in which the truck was parked clearly endangered oncoming traffic on both sides, considering that the tire blowout which stalled the truck in the first place occurred in the wee hours of the morning. The Court can only now surmise that the unfortunate incident could have been averted had respondent Condor, the owner of the truck, equipped the said vehicle with lights, flares, or, at the very least, an early warning device.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Hence, we cannot subscribe to respondents Condor and Pedrano’s claim that they should be absolved from liability because, as found by the trial and appellate courts, the proximate cause of the collision was the fast speed at which petitioner Laspiñas drove the bus. To accept this proposition would be to come too close to wiping out the fundamental principle of law that a man must respond for the foreseeable consequences of his own negligent act or omission. Indeed, our law on quasi-delicts seeks to reduce the risks and burdens of living in society and to allocate them among its members. To accept this proposition would be to weaken the very bonds of society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Liability of<br>Respondent PPSII<br>as Insurer<br><br></span>The trial court in this case did not rule on the liability of respondent PPSII, while the appellate court ruled that, as no evidence was presented against it, the insurance company is not liable.<br><br>A perusal of the records will show that when the petitioners filed the Third-Party Complaint against respondent PPSII, they failed to attach a copy of the terms of the insurance contract itself.

It claimed, however, that it had attended to and settled the claims of those injured during the incident, and set up the following as special affirmative defenses:<blockquote>Third party defendant Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc. hereby reiterates and incorporates by way of reference the preceding paragraphs and further states THAT:-<ol start="8"><li>It has attended to the claims of Vincent Canales, Asuncion Batiancila and Neptali Palces who sustained injuries during the incident in question.

In fact, there were negotiations to that effect. Only that it cannot accede to the demand of said claimant considering that the claim was way beyond the scheduled indemnity as per contract entered into with third party plaintiff William Tiu and third party defendant (Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc.). Third party Plaintiff William Tiu knew all along the limitation as earlier stated, he being an old hand in the transportation business; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>…</li></ol></blockquote>Considering the admissions made by respondent PPSII, the existence of the insurance contract and the salient terms thereof cannot be dispatched. It must be noted that after filing its answer, respondent PPSII no longer objected to the presentation of evidence by respondent Arriesgado and the insured petitioner Tiu. Even in its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> before the Court, respondent PPSII admitted the existence of the contract, but averred as follows:<blockquote>Petitioner Tiu is insisting that PPSII is liable to him for contribution, indemnification and/or reimbursement. This has no basis under the contract. Under the contract, PPSII will pay all sums necessary to discharge liability of the insured subject to the limits of liability but not to exceed the limits of liability as so stated in the contract. Also, it is stated in the contract that in the event of accident involving indemnity to more than one person, the limits of liability shall not exceed the aggregate amount so specified by law to all persons to be indemnified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote>As can be gleaned from the Certificate of Cover, such insurance contract was issued pursuant to the Compulsory Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Law. It was expressly provided therein that the limit of the insurer’s liability for each person was P12,000, while the limit per accident was pegged at P50,000. An insurer in an indemnity contract for third party liability is directly liable to the injured party up to the extent specified in the agreement but it cannot be held solidarily liable beyond that amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The respondent PPSII could not then just deny petitioner Tiu’s claim; it should have paid <s>P</s>12,000 for the death of Felisa Arriesgado,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and respondent Arriesgado’s hospitalization expenses of <s>P</s>1,113.80, which the trial court found to have been duly supported by receipts. The total amount of the claims, even when added to that of the other injured passengers which the respondent PPSII claimed to have settled,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> would not exceed the <s>P</s>50,000 limit under the insurance agreement.<br><br>Indeed, the nature of Compulsory Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance is such that it is primarily intended to provide compensation for the death or bodily injuries suffered by innocent third parties or passengers as a result of the negligent operation and use of motor vehicles. The victims and/or their dependents are assured of immediate financial assistance, regardless of the financial capacity of motor vehicle owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> As the Court, speaking through Associate Justice Leonardo A. Quisumbing, explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Government Service Insurance System v. Court of Appeals</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><blockquote>However, although the victim may proceed directly against the insurer for indemnity, the third party liability is only up to the extent of the insurance policy and those required by law. While it is true that where the insurance contract provides for indemnity against liability to third persons, and such persons can directly sue the insurer, the direct liability of the insurer under indemnity contracts against third party liability does not mean that the insurer can be held liable in <span style="font-style: italic;">solidum</span> with the insured and/or the other parties found at fault. For the liability of the insurer is based on contract; that of the insured carrier or vehicle owner is based on tort. …<br><br>Obviously, the insurer could be held liable only up to the extent of what was provided for by the contract of insurance, in accordance with the CMVLI law. At the time of the incident, the schedule of indemnities for death and bodily injuries, professional fees and other charges payable under a CMVLI coverage was provided for under the Insurance Memorandum Circular (IMC) No. 5-78 which was approved on November 10, 1978. As therein provided, the maximum indemnity for death was twelve thousand (<s>P</s>12,000.00) pesos per victim. The schedules for medical expenses were also provided by said IMC, specifically in paragraphs (C) to (G).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Damages to be<br>Awarded<br><br></span>The trial court correctly awarded moral damages in the amount of P50,000 in favor of respondent Arriesgado.&nbsp; The award of exemplary damages by way of example or correction of the public good,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> is likewise in order. As the Court ratiocinated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Kapalaran Bus Line v.

For if common carriers carefully observed the statutory standard of extraordinary diligence in respect of their own passengers, they cannot help but simultaneously benefit pedestrians and the passengers of other vehicles who are equally entitled to the safe and convenient use of our roads and highways. The law seeks to stop and prevent the slaughter and maiming of people (whether passengers or not) on our highways and buses, the very size and power of which seem to inflame the minds of their drivers.

It was later on amended by LOI No. 479, issued on November 15, 1976. The pertinent provisions are as follows:<blockquote><ol><li>That all powers, users or drivers of motor vehicles shall have at all times in their motor vehicles at least one (1) pair of early warning device consisting of a triangular, collapsible reflectorized plates in red and yellow colors at least 5 cm. at the base and 40 cms. at the sides.</li><br><li>Whenever any motor vehicle is stalled or disabled or is parked for thirty (30) minutes or more on any street or highways, including expressways or limited access roads, the owner, user or driver thereof shall cause the warning device mentioned herein to be installed at least four meters away to the front and rear of the motor vehicle stalled, disabled or parked.</li><br><li>The Land Transportation Commissioner shall require every motor vehicle owner to procure from any source and present at registration of his vehicle, one pair of reflectorized triangular early warning device, as described herein, of any brand or make chosen by said motor vehicle owner.
