Jocson examined Susan and issued a Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> with the following findings:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">“1)</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Whitish vaginal discharge noted at the introitus;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>2)</td> <td><div align="justify">Inflamed vulvar area with abrasion noted at the left labia minora;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>3)</td> <td><div align="justify">New lacerations noted around the hymenal ring: one at the 3 o’clock position another at the 7 o’clock position and another at the 10 o’clock position; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>4)</td> <td>&nbsp;Vaginal introitus admits 2 fingers with ease.”</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Dr. Jocson confirmed on the witness stand that the inflammation, abrasion and lacerations at Susan’s hymen were caused by the insertion of a penis in her vagina.<br><br>Dr. Ester Regina Baron-Servando, a psychiatrist at the Bacolod City Health Department, testified that on November 26, 1996 and December 4, 1996, she examined Susan and found that she was suffering from a major depression.<br><br>Appellant vehemently denied the charges.&nbsp; He testified that he initially courted Susan when they were schoolmates at Ramon Torres High School at Bago City.&nbsp; He was then a senior student, while she was a sophomore.&nbsp; After graduation, he was employed as a security guard by Tirad Pass Security Agency at Bacolod City and eventually assigned at the Jet’s Lechon Manok Eatery where Susan worked as a waitress. There he again courted her and finally they became sweethearts.&nbsp; From then on, he accompanied her whenever she visited her parents in E.B. Magalona, Tabigui, Negros Occidental.&nbsp; He was surprised when her mother, during his and Susan’s visit on November 20, 1996, demanded P20,000.00, with threat that she will file rape charges against him should he fail to comply with her demand.<br><br>According to appellant, what transpired between him and Susan were sexual trysts, they being sweethearts.&nbsp; He explained that he could not have committed the crimes considering that his twelve (12) hour shift at the eatery was from 6:00 o’clock in the evening to 6:00 o’clock in the morning, and that he applied for leave of absence from October 30, 1996 to November 3, 1996 to attend an in-service re-training course conducted by the NEMA Agency in Barangay Villamonte, Bacolod City.<br><br>During her rebuttal testimony, Susan denied appellant’s claim that they were sweethearts; and that her mother demanded P20,000.00 from him.<br><br>Nenita Preciosa, complainant’s mother, testified denying that she threatened to file rape charges against him should he refuse to give her P20,000.00 for her husband’s medical treatment.<br><br>Criselda Bonza and Honeylyn Jimena, cashiers at Jet’s Lechon Manok Eatery, testified that Susan confided to them that appellant was indeed her sweetheart and that they planned to get married.<br><br>Gloria Villalobos, secretary of Tirad Pass Security and Investigation Agency, appellant’s employer, confirmed that from October 30, 1996 to November 3, 1996, appellant did not report for duty in Jet’s Lechon Manok Eatery as he was on leave.<br><br>On November 7, 1997, the trial court rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: <blockquote> “After a very careful evaluation of the evidence, the Court finds that the guilt of the accused for the offenses he is charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The Court therefore, declares the accused guilty as charged in all the Informations and there being no extenuating circumstances, condemns him to suffer the following penalties and civil liabilities: <blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="52%"><br></td> <td width="24%"><div align="center">Penalty</div></td> <td width="24%"><div align="center">Civil Liability</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>1.

</tbody></table></blockquote>In a prosecution for rape, the victim’s credibility becomes the single most important issue, and when her testimony satisfies the test of credibility, an accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Here, Susan’s direct and straightforward account reveals every relevant detail of the three (3) rape incidents.&nbsp; Even during the cross-examination, she never wavered in her assertion that it was appellant who raped her through force and intimidation and with the use of a firearm.<br><br>The trial court, in giving full credence to Susan’s testimony, held: <blockquote> “x x x.&nbsp; It is difficult to believe that Susan would charge the accused for rape when there was no rape.&nbsp; It is more difficult to believe that Susan and her mother would file a case for rape as a method of extortion.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been held that an unmarried Filipina would not publicly admit that she had been raped, voluntarily allow herself to be medically probed, and endure the humiliating and delicate questions in the course of the trial, if her accusations were merely malicious concoctions (<i>People vs. Bautista</i>, 236 SCRA 102 [1994]).<br><br>“Susan was very categorical that she was threatened by the accused before and after the rapes.&nbsp; As observed by the Court, Susan appears weak and frail and could readily be subdued, especially by a guard who must have learned the rudiments of physical combat. x x x.” </blockquote> It is doctrinally settled that the factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of the rape victim, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.&nbsp; This is so because the trial court has the advantage of observing the victim through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion, the sudden pallor of a discovered lie, the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer, the forthright tone of a ready reply, the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant, to exculpate himself, interposed the defense of <i>alibi</i>.&nbsp; He maintained that it was physically impossible for him to have been at Jet’s Lechon Manok on the dates the crimes were allegedly committed because he was then on official leave attending an in-service re-training course conducted by the NEMA Agency in Barangay Villamonte.<br><br>We find appellant’s defense of alibi unavailing.&nbsp; For this defense to stand, it must be shown that not only was appellant somewhere else when the crime was committed but also that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On this point, the trial court held: <blockquote> “One defense raised by the accused is the defense of alibi as he alleged to be undergoing a Re-Training course when the rapes on October 31 and November 1, 1996 happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been shown, however, that the alleged Re-Training course was held in Brgy. Villamonte in Bacolod City which is only about two (2) to three (3) kilometers from Jet.&nbsp; Even if it were true that the accused went home to&nbsp; Ma-ao, Bago City, this fact would not have precluded the accused from being at Bacolod City, specifically at Jet’s, in the morning of the day when the rape was committed as Bago could be traversed by public transportation in less than two (2) hours.” </blockquote> We sustain the trial court’s finding that it was physically possible for appellant to have been in the crime scene at the time the rape incidents were committed considering that it was “only about two (2) to three (3) kilometers” away from Barangay Villamonte where he was undergoing a re-training course.<br><br>We are not persuaded by appellant’s claim that he and Susan are sweethearts and that what transpired between them was a consensual sex.&nbsp; A “sweetheart defense,” to be credible, should be substantiated by some documentary or other evidence of the relationship – like mementos, love letters, notes, pictures and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Here, appellant categorically admitted that no such evidence exists.&nbsp; Clearly, his alleged romantic relation with Susan is just a figment of his imagination.<br><br>Assuming that appellant and Susan were sweethearts, it does not mean that he could not rape her.&nbsp; Such a relationship is not a guaranty that he will not assault and tarnish that which she holds so dearly and trample upon her honor and dignity.&nbsp; Indeed, a sweetheart can be forced to engage in sexual intercourse against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Appellant also submits that Susan’s disturbing silence and failure to report to their employer the rape incidents evince that the charges are mere fabrications.&nbsp; On this point, the Solicitor General aptly observed that appellant’s “real threat that he would kill her family if she would report the incident to anyone proved disastrous and paralyzed her from taking immediate action against appellant.”&nbsp; Indeed, no adverse inference can be drawn from complainant's hesitation or failure to immediately expose her tragic experiences. Fear of reprisal, social humiliation, family considerations, and economic reasons are sufficient explanations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Considering that appellant committed the crimes (in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-18209 and 97-18211) with the use of a firearm, a deadly weapon, the penalty imposable upon him is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, pursuant to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, quoted earlier.&nbsp; Corollarily, Article 63 of the same Code provides: <blockquote> “Art. 63.&nbsp; <i>Rules for the application of indivisible penalties.</i> – In all cases in which the law prescribes a single indivisible penalty, it shall be applied by the courts regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed.<br><br><b>“In all cases in which the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, the following rules shall be observed in the application thereof:</b> <ol><li>When in the commission of the deed there is present only one aggravating circumstance, the greater penalty shall be applied.<br><br></li><li><b>When there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the <u>lesser penalty</u> shall be applied.</b><br><br></li><li>When the commission of the act is attended by some mitigating circumstance and there is no aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br><br></li><li>When both mitigating and aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the act, the courts shall reasonably allow them to offset one another in consideration of their number and importance, for the purpose of applying the penalty in accordance with the preceding rules, according to the result of such compensation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Underscoring ours) </li></ol></blockquote> In <i>People vs. Eduardo Limos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we held: “Where no aggravating circumstance is alleged in the information and proven during the trial, the crime of rape through the use of a deadly weapon may be penalized only with <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, not death.”<br><br>In the present case, there is neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance that attended the commission of the crimes.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court correctly imposed upon appellant the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each count of rape committed with the use of a firearm.&nbsp; Likewise, the imposition of the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for the rape committed through force and intimidation&nbsp; (Criminal Case No. 97-18210) is in order, following the provision of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, earlier quoted.<br><br>With respect to appellant’s civil liability, aside from the award of civil indemnity of P50,000.00 in each case, the trial court should have awarded the victim moral damages fixed at P50,000.00 (in each case) without need of pleading or proof of basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This is so because the anguish and the pain she endured are evident.&nbsp; In our culture, which puts a premium on the virtue of purity or virginity, rape stigmatizes the victim more than the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We likewise award the victim exemplary damages of P25,000.00 in each case (Criminal Cases Nos. 97-18209 and 97-18211).&nbsp; Here, the use of a deadly weapon was alleged in both Informations and proved during the trial.&nbsp; In People vs. Ayuda,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> we held: <blockquote> “Likewise, the award of exemplary damages is justified.&nbsp; The circumstance of use of a deadly weapon was duly alleged in the information and proven at the trial.&nbsp; In <i>People vs. Edem</i> (G.R. No. 130970, February 27, 2002), we awarded exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 in a case of rape committed with the use of a deadly weapon.” </blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision dated November 7, 1997 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 50, Bacolod City, in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-18209, 97-18210 and 97-18211 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> in the sense that in addition to the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity in each case to herein victim, Susan Precioso, appellant <b>RONIE GABELINIO</b> is also ordered to pay her P50,000.00 as moral damages in each case, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-18209 and 97-18211.<br><br>With costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Corona,</i> and <i>Carpio Morales, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Vitug, J., (Chairman),</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Roberto S.
