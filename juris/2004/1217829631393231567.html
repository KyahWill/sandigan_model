				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us for automatic review is the Decision dated November 27, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, Branch 19, in Criminal Case Nos. 2522-23 finding Andres Paas Islabra guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one count of simple rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and one count of qualified rape and sentencing him to death.<br><br>The private complainant, thirteen-year-old Hilda Paas, and accused-appellant, thirty-two-year-old Andres Islabra, are first cousins, the former’s father, Rogelio, being the brother of the latter’s mother, Rosita.&nbsp; In 1997 Hilda and her brothers, Rodelio, Rolando, and Rodolfo came to Magsaysay, Sultan Kudarat to study and work as farmhands, respectively, while their parents remained in Columbo, Sultan Kudarat. They stayed in the house of accused-appellant upon the latter’s invitation while their own house was still under construction. Younger sisters Margielyn, eight years old, and Mary Jane, seven years old, joined them later on.&nbsp; All was apparently well.&nbsp; However, on July 29, 1998, Hilda executed a sworn written complaint accusing Andres of raping her on two occasions.&nbsp; Two separate Informations were filed against Andres, <i>viz</i>:<br><br>Criminal Case No. 2522 <blockquote> That on or about 8:00 o’clock in the evening of July 4, 1998, at Barangay Magsaysay, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with lewd and unchaste design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully (<i>sic</i>), unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of one HILDA A. PAAS, a thirteen (13)-year old girl, against her will and consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, as amended by Republic Act 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </blockquote> Criminal Case No. 2523 <blockquote> That on or about 11:30 o’clock in the morning of July 12, 1998, at Barangay Magsaysay, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with lewd and unchaste design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully (<i>sic</i>), unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of one HILDA A. PAAS, a thirteen (13)-year old girl, against her will and consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, as amended by Republic Act 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </blockquote> Accused-appellant pleaded “not guilty” to both Informations.&nbsp; Trial ensued.<br><br>Private complainant testified that at around 8:30 in the evening of July 4, 1998 she was sleeping in the house of accused-appellant while her three brothers were watching television in a neighbor’s house.&nbsp; Accused-appellant woke her up, warned her not to make any noise, kissed her face, removed her underwear and took his penis out of his short pants.&nbsp; She asked accused-appellant, whom she called “Kuyang Andres,” why he was doing those things but the latter again warned her not to make any noise or she would be killed. Accused-appellant then inserted his penis into her vagina but after a partial penetration, withdrew the same when complainant complained of pain.&nbsp; He threatened complainant against reporting the incident to anybody, otherwise, he would kill her and her brothers.&nbsp; After accused-appellant left, complainant cried and examined her vagina.&nbsp; Fluid was oozing from it.&nbsp; She left her cousin’s house the following morning, never to return.&nbsp; She stayed in the house of a neighbor&nbsp; until she and her brothers moved on July 9, 1998 to their newly-constructed house<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> located about a hundred meters away from that of accused-appellant. Gripped by fear, complainant did not inform her brothers of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Anent the second rape incident, complainant testified that at around 11:30 in the morning of July 12, 1998, accused-appellant arrived at their newly-constructed house and asked her and her sister Margielyn if they had eaten lunch.&nbsp; They answered “no.” Margielyn then went outside to play.&nbsp; Thereupon, accused-appellant, armed with a knife, ordered complainant into a room, instructed her not to shout, otherwise, he would kill her. Complainant complied out of fear.&nbsp; Accused-appellant ordered her to remove her underwear and likewise removed his own.&nbsp; He then laid complainant, who was already crying, on the bed, kissed her on the face and neck, inserted his penis fully into her vagina, and did push and pull movements for about seven minutes while holding complainant by her hands.&nbsp; After satisfying his lust, accused-appellant got up and put on his short pants.&nbsp; At this point, Margielyn entered the room and asked what “Kuyang Andres” was doing in the room.&nbsp; The latter did not answer.&nbsp; Instead, he told them not to report the matter to anybody, and left in a huff.&nbsp; Hilda confided to Margielyn the incident.&nbsp; When Rodelio arrived at noon, Margielyn in turn narrated to him the event.&nbsp; Rodelio cried and punched the wall of their house in anger.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; He wanted to confront accused-appellant but was restrained by Rodolfo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; After their parents were informed that Hilda had been raped, they arrived from Columbo and immediately brought their daughter to the police station where she executed her sworn written complaint.&nbsp; She was also brought to the Provincial Hospital where she was medically examined on July 29, 1998.<br><br>Accused-appellant denied the charges.&nbsp; Backed up by the testimony of his wife and mother-in-law, accused-appellant claimed that Hilda and her brothers were no longer staying in his house at the time of the alleged rape on July 4, 1998, having left the same by the time his wife gave birth on December 27, 1997.&nbsp; Hence, he said, he could not have raped her there.&nbsp; Besides, he was not home in the evening of July 4, 1998 having left the same early in the morning with his two sons, Balong and Dagol, for their farm located about two kilometers away where they spent the whole day and passed the night.&nbsp; They returned home the following morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>As to the alleged rape at noon on July 12, 1998, accused-appellant claimed that he was in the house of his neighbor Jun Movilla from nine in the morning to two o’clock in the afternoon having a drinking spree with the latter and his brother Edwin, as well as with his cousins Rodelio and Rodolfo, private complainant’s brothers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> His wife saw him the whole time since Jun’s house was just across the road from their house.<br><br>The defense likewise imputed motive on the part of complainant’s family in filing the rape charges. Rosita Calla, accused-appellant’s mother, testified that complainant’s parents, Rogelio and Marta, her brother and sister-in-law, respectively, got angry with her when she helped a granddaughter find a lawyer in 1993 after she was allegedly raped by Roger Paas, one of complainant’s brothers. Since then, Rosita’s relationship with her brother and sister-in-law turned sour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Rodrigo Islabra, accused-appellant’s brother, likewise testified that complainant’s father told him when he went to speak to private complainant after Andres was arrested for the rape charges, that they will incur the same expenses that complainant’s family incurred when it was Roger who was accused of rape in 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On November 27, 2001, the trial court rendered a decision convicting the accused and sentencing him to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in Crim. Case No. 2522, and death in Crim. Case No. 2523. He was likewise ordered to pay private complainant P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape, and to pay the costs.<br><br>Hence, this automatic review.<br><br>Accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the alleged rape committed in his house on July 4, 1998 considering that Rodelio Paas testified that he and his siblings left the same in January 1998.&nbsp; Moreover, private complainant’s unbelievably composed behavior after the rape of turning on the light, coolly examining her vagina and observing the fluid oozing therefrom are inconsistent with that of a real rape victim.&nbsp; As to the second rape incident, accused-appellant contends that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of Hilda and Mary Jane Paas and the contradictory results of the medical examination justify an acquittal.&nbsp; Even if he was indeed guilty of the second rape, the death penalty should not have been imposed considering that use of a knife in the commission thereof was not alleged in the Information.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), while maintaining that accused-appellant’s guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt in both cases, agreed that the death penalty should not have been imposed in Crim. Case No. 2523.<br><br>We affirm the trial court’s decision with modification.<br><br>The rule is well-settled that an accused in rape cases may be convicted solely on the basis of the uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim where such testimony is clear, positive, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Her credibility is the single most important issue, and when her testimony meets the test of credibility, conviction inevitably ensues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the instant cases, the court <i>a quo</i> found private complainant’s account of how she was raped by the accused in the evening of July 4, 1998 and at noon of July 12, 1998 to be clear, positive and straightforward, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">“Q:-</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">At about 8:30 o’clock that evening of July 4, 1998 while your brother Rodelio and Rodolfo were watching tv on (<i>sic</i>) the neighbor’s house and you were already sleeping in the house of your Kuyang Andres, do you remember what happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">He went to the place where we were sleeping and he awakened me, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">You said he, who was that he who went to your room where you are (<i>sic</i>) sleeping?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Andres Islabra, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Who was your companion or who were your companions in that room where you sleep (<i>sic</i>) where (<i>sic</i>) you were awakened by accused Andres Islabra?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">The eldest and his second child, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Where (<i>sic</i>) they girls?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">No, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">How old is the eldest son who was sleeping in that room?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Still young, sir.

A careful review of Rodelio’s testimony reveals that he was not unequivocal on this point.&nbsp; During his direct-examination, Rodelio testified that he and his siblings stayed in accused-appellant’s house until they moved on July 6, 1998 into their own house.&nbsp; However, in another breath, he said that they were no longer staying there on July 4, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> But during his cross-examination, he again affirmed that they were still staying in the house of their cousin on the date in question<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and reiterated the same during his re-direct examination on October 7, 1999.&nbsp; The trial judge perceived Rodelio’s vacillation as arising from his ignorance as to the proper order of the months in a year, whether January or July comes first, prompting him to ask about Rodelio’s educational attainment, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q:-</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Tell the Court once more, until when did you stay with your sibling in the house of Andres Paas and transferred to your house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">It was sometime in the month of January, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">What year?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">In 1998, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Earlier you said in your answer to the question of the Provincial Prosecutor that on July 4, 1998 you were still residing in the house of Andres Paas, and now your are telling the court that you left the house of Andres Paas on July 4, 1998, which is which now?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">I cannot remember anymore the date, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td height="21">Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">What is your educational attainment?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Only Grade VI, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know how many months (<i>sic</i>) in a year?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">What is the first month of the year?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">January, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">So, you are now telling the Court that on January 4, 1998 you have already left the house of the accused together with your brothers and sisters and transferred to your newly built (<i>sic</i>) house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">On that date January 4, 1998 we have not yet transferred to our new house, your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In light of the above, we cannot consider Rodelio’s testimony as having dented private complainant’s positive and straightforward testimony that she was raped by accused-appellant on the evening of July 4, 1998 in his own house. There is another reason for Rodelio’s apparent vacillation in his testimony.&nbsp; It can be due to the fact that he and brother Rodolfo slept in their own house from time to time, leaving their sister in accused-appellant’s house, even while their house was still undergoing construction, as testified to by accused-appellant himself, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q:-</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">The construction of the house of her brothers was finished in the month of October 1997?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">The construction of the house was not immediately finished, Your Honor, because of lack of materials to be used for the construction of their house, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">In other words, because of lack of materials the house was only completed the following year 1998?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">Actually what happened they (<i>sic</i>) built a new house and they only put roofing and in completing that they only used a tent which serves (<i>sic</i>) as walling of the house and the two were already sleeping in that house, I am referring to Balong and Sandy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify">Only the two of them?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">During nighttime only, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:-</td> <td><div align="justify">When was that when Balong and Sandy were already sleeping on (<i>sic</i>) their unfinished newly constructed house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:-</td> <td><div align="justify">After they finished putting the roofing of their house that’s the time they started sleeping in their unfinished house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We do not agree.&nbsp; It is not accurate to say that there is a typical reaction or norm of behavior among rape victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> On the contrary, people react differently to emotional stress and no standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the alleged inconsistencies between the testimonies of Hilda and Mary Jane Paas on whether Hilda was laid on the bed by accused-appellant as claimed by Hilda or on the floor as testified to by Maryjane, and whether it was Margielyn who reported what happened to Rodelio, as testified to by Hilda, or whether Rodelio learned about it during the drinking spree in Jun Movilla’s house, as claimed by Mary Jane, suffice it to say that inconsistencies on minor or trivial matters do not affect the credibility of prosecution witnesses and are, on the contrary, badges of truth and safeguards against coached testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Finally, the defense takes exception to the alleged contradictory results of the medical examination conducted on private complainant. That is, while Dra. Divinagracia Factora, Medical Officer III of the Sultan Kudarat Provincial Hospital, testified that private complainant’s labia majora and minora are well-coaptated or “magkadikit” which indicates virginity, she likewise testified that private complainant’s vaginal canal sustained healed superficial lacerations at 2:00 and 6:00 positions.<br><br>The medico-legal certificate issued by Dra. Factora showed the following findings: <blockquote> PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">-</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Labia majora and minora are well coaptated.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>-</td> <td><div align="justify">Healed superficial laceration at 2:00 and 6:00 o’clock positions of the vaginal canal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> Although Dra. Factora indeed testified in the beginning that coaptated or “<i>magkadikit</i>” labia majora and minora indicates virginity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in the latter part of her testimony, however, she clarified that the same may or may not actually be a sign of virginity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the particular case of private complainant, she could not definitely say that private complainant was a virgin or not.&nbsp; On the contrary, superficial healed lacerations at 2:00 and 6:00 positions were definitely found on her, one of the causes of which may be a hardened human penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Thus, while Dr. Factora’s explanation of “coaptated” labia may be a bit nebulous, it cannot be said that it contradicted private complainant’s testimony of the rapes committed against her.&nbsp; At any rate, a medical examination or certificate has never been considered an indispensable element in the prosecution of rape cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> being merely corroborative in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>We come to the penalty imposed in Crim. Case No. 2523: The death penalty was imposed by the trial court considering that the second rape incident was accomplished with the use of a knife.&nbsp; Under the second paragraph of Art. 266-B<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, the proper imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; The death penalty was imposed after the trial court further considered that complainant was raped in her own house, hence, the aggravating circumstance of dwelling was appreciated in her favor.<br><br>We reduce the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.
