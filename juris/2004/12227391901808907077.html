				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The commission of the offense of illegal sale of regulated drugs requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction. In a “buy-bust” operation, such as in the case at bar, what is important is the fact that the poseur-buyer received the shabu from the appellants and that the same was presented as evidence in Court. In short, proof of the transaction suffices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated December 21, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 18, Manila in Criminal Case No. 00-182559 finding Mariam Bandang, Ading Salamat and Rakima Abubakar, appellants, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of selling <i>“shabu,”</i> in violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended, and imposing upon them the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>The Information filed against appellants reads:<br><blockquote>“That on or about May 3, 2000, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one another, not having been authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any regulated drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, knowingly and jointly sell or offer and/or attempt for sale, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute 100.43 gram; 100.83 gram; 102.80 gram; 100.70 gram; 107.21 gram; 102.92 gram and 101.65 gram or with a total weight of 716.54 grams of white crystalline substance contained in seven (7) transparent plastic sachet known as shabu containing <i>methylamphetamine hydrochloride,</i> which is a regulated drug.<br><br>Contrary to law.”</blockquote>On May 31 2000, appellants, assisted by their counsel <i>de parte,</i> pleaded “not guilty”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to the charge. Thereafter, trial ensued. The prosecution presented two witnesses, namely: PO1 Olga Carpentero and PO2 Jigger Noceda.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution established the following: In the morning of May 2, 2000, the Narcotics Group Intelligence Division of the Philippine National Police (PNP), in Camp Crame, Quezon City, was notified by an informant about the drug trafficking activities of appellants Mariam Bandang and Rakima Abubakar near the Arlegui Bridge, Quiapo, Manila. The PNP organized a team composed of PO1 Olga Carpentero, as the <i>poseur-buyer,</i> and Police Senior Inspector Crisostomo Mendoza, as the team leader, to conduct surveillance and buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On the same day, PO1 Carpentero and the informant proceeded to Arlegui Bridge on board a car and were at the place between 3:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon. The informant introduced PO1 Carpentero to appellants as a prospective buyer of 700 grams of <i>shabu.</i> Appellants told PO1 Carpentero that it costs P490,000.00. When they asked her if she has the money, PO1 Carpentero replied that she will come back the following day with the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Appellants then told PO1 Carpentero to be at the place at around 5:30 in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>PO1 Carpentero reported the incident to her superior who, in turn, organized two teams - the buy-bust team and the back-up team.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They prepared boodle money in two bundles consisting of cut papers. They then placed two five hundred genuine bills on top of each bundle, wrapped and placed them in a blue transparent plastic bag. PO1 Carpentero placed her initials on the two genuine five hundred peso bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On May 3, 2000, at around 5:30 in the afternoon, the teams proceeded to Arlegui, Quiapo, Manila on board three vehicles. The informant went to the house of appellant Abubakar, leaving PO1 Carpentero alone in the car. After a little while, the three appellants came out of the house and went inside the parked car. They sat on the back seats, while the informant and PO1 Carpentero on the front seats.<br><br>Once inside the car, appellant Abubakar asked PO1 Carpentero if she has the money. When she said “yes,” appellant Bandang got the black shoulder bag from appellant Ading Salamat and gave it to PO1 Carpentero. She then opened the black shoulder bag and saw seven (7) transparent plastic sachets<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> containing white crystalline substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereupon, she handed the bundles of boodle money to appellant Abubakar and immediately pressed the button of the hazard lights of the car. The blinking of the hazard lights indicated that the deal was consummated. PO1 Carpentero then introduced herself as a police officer and arrested the three appellants. Simultaneously, the two teams rushed in and arrested<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> them and confiscated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>    the seven plastic sachets containing the white crystalline substance. PO2 Jigger Noceda recovered the boodle money from appellant Abubakar. Then the arresting police officers brought appellants to Camp Crame for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thereafter, they were detained in the City Jail of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The substance, with a total weight of 716.54 grams, was submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination. It was positive for <i>methylamphetamine hydrochloride</i> or <i>shabu.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The prosecution dispensed with the direct testimony of Cirox T. Omero, PNP forensic chemist, considering that the prosecution and the defense stipulated that: <b>(1)</b> he conducted the laboratory analysis of the 716.54 grams of white crystalline substance; <b>(2)</b> that he stated in his initial Laboratory Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and his Chemistry Report No. D-1585-00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that the substance is positive for <i>methylamphetamine hydrochloride</i> or <i>shabu,</i> and; <b>(3)</b> the seven (7) plastic bags of shabu has been identified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Nonetheless, Omero presented to the trial court the specimen and it was identified by PO1 Carpentero as the same white crystalline substance contained in a black shoulder bag handed to her by appellant Bandang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Upon order of the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> it was turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory, through Omero, for safekeeping.<br><br>All the appellants raised the defenses of alibi and frame-up.<br><br>Appellant Bandang’s testimony is as follows: she is a manicurist and a former resident of Quiapo, Manila until she transferred to Taguig, Metro Manila in 1994. <b>At the time of the incident, she was in a sidewalk store in Elizondo Street, Quiapo, Manila rendering manicure service to her old customers.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <b>She was with her mother, appellant Ading Salamat, and her one year old child.</b> On her way to another customer, she met appellant Abubakar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> At that point she saw two men being chased by another two. Then, the two men behind suddenly accosted and ordered appellants Bandang and Abubakar to board a vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <b>Appellant Bandang shouted at her mother, who was a few meters away from her, to take care of her child.</b> When her mother came near, they also dragged her inside the vehicle which sped away. The two men forced appellants to identify the two men being chased, but they could not do so. Thereafter, they were brought to Camp Crame.<br><br>When cross examined, appellant Bandang denied having met the prosecution witnesses before they arrested them (appellants) on May 3, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> She also claimed that she saw appellant Abubakar for the second time when they were arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><b> She also narrated that they were arrested inside their house,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <b>contrary to her direct testimony that she was along a sidewalk at Elizondo, Quiapo.</b><br><br><b>Appellant Salamat corroborated the testimony of her daughter appellant Bandang.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> When cross-examined, she declared that when she was arrested, she inadvertently left her grandchild on the sidewalk. The people there, however, were able to trace her residence, hence, they entrusted the child to her relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>Appellant Abubakar gave the same version in the course of her testimony.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On December 21, 2001, the trial court rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoings, herein accused Mariam Bandang y Salamat, @ Joharra, accused Ading Salamat y Guna and accused Rakima Abubakar y Usman (Abubacar) are hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the Violation of Section 15, Article III in relation to paragraphs (e), (f), (m), (o) of Section 2, Article I and in relation to Sections 20 &amp; 21, Article IV of R.A. 6425, as amended by R.A. 7659. The three accused shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with the accessory penalties provided by law. They are ordered to pay a fine of P500,000.00<br><br>The preventive imprisonment of the accused since their arrest at the buy-bust operation held on May 3, 2000 should be credited in their favor.<br><br>Forensic Chemist-Police Inspector Cirox T. Omero of PNP Crime Laboratory, Camp Crame, Quezon City is hereby ordered to immediately submit the confiscated shabu weighing 716.54 grams of <i>methylamphetamine hydrochloride</i> to the Chairman of the Dangerous Drugs Board, Champ Building, Bonifacio Drive, Intramuros, Manila, for proper disposal pursuant to Paragraph (b), Section 36 of R.A. 6425, as amended.<br><br>Also send a copy of this decision to the Chairman of the Dangerous Drugs Board of the aforesaid address; the Warden of the City Jail, Manila; to Forensic – Chemist Cirox T. Omero of the PNP Laboratory Service, Camp Crame, Quezon City, and to Police Superintendent Pancho Adelberto M. Hubilla of PNP Narcotics Group, Camp Crame, Quezon City.<br><br>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal, appellants ascribing to the trial court the following assignments of error:<br><br>By appellants Bandang and Salamat:<br><center><br>“I<br></center><blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN ACCORDING GREATER WEIGHT TO THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE PROSECUTION AND IN DISREGARDING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS’ ALIBI.<br><center><br>II<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE INHERENT WEAKNESS OF THE PROSECUTION’S EVIDENCE.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>By appellant Abubakar:<br><center><br>“I<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT HEREIN ALBEIT CLEAR FAILURE OF THE STATE TO PROVE THE CRIME CHARGED;<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT HEREIN ON THE BASIS SOLELY OF THE STIPULATION OF FACTS IN THE PRE-TRIAL ORDER OF JULY 6, 2000, WHICH PRE-TRIAL ORDER ALTHOUGH    SIGNED BY ACCUSED-APPELLANT HEREIN WAS HOWEVER, NOT SIGNED BY COUNSEL.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>The Solicitor General counters that: <b>(a)</b> all the elements of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were established by evidence beyond reasonable doubt; <b>(b)</b> that appellants’ defense of <i>alibi</i> and frame-up must fail because they did not present convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed; and (c) that the lack of signature of counsel for appellant Abubakar in the Stipulation of Facts between the parties is immaterial since the prosecution had adequately proven the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>We affirm the assailed Decision.<br><center><br><b>I. <i>Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</i></b><br><br></center>In a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the following must be proven: <b>(1)</b> that the transaction or sale took place; <b>(2)</b> the <i>corpus delicti</i> or the illicit drug was presented as evidence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and <b>(3)</b> that the buyer and seller were identified. A review of the records of this case reveals that the prosecution has proven all these elements.<br><br><b>A. <i>The Fact of Sale was<br>Established</i></b><br><br>The commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction, which happens the moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In the present case, this was sufficiently proven by PO1 Carpentero, the <i>poseur-buyer</i>. She gave a detailed account of how the sale took place, from the initial negotiation to the eventual delivery of the dangerous drugs. On May 2, 2000, she and the informant closed the deal with appellants Bandang and Abubakar for the purchase of the 700 grams of <i>shabu</i> at P490,000.00; and that the next day, the three appellants delivered to her the 700 grams of <i>shabu</i> for which she paid them the boodle money. Definitely, the testimony of PO1 Carpentero as the <i>poseur buyer</i> clearly established the consummation of the sale. Settled is the rule that as long as the police officer went through the operation as a buyer and his offer was accepted by appellants and the dangerous drugs delivered to the former, the crime is considered consummated by the delivery of the goods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We quote PO1 Carpentero’s clear and straightforward account of the transaction, thus:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><b>“PROS.
