				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Kidapawan City, Branch 23, in Criminal Case No. 2423 convicting appellant Florencio Calica of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to indemnify the heirs of Igmedio Pispis in the amount of P50,000.<br><br>A criminal complaint for multiple murder against Florencio Calica, Ernesto Calica, John Doe, Peter Doe and Richard Doe was filed in the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Makilala, Cotabato, docketed as Criminal Case No. 2070.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Appended to the complaint was the sworn statement executed by Dominga Pispis with the assistance of Atty. Solema Jubilan dated January 13, 1986 taken by T/Sgt. Ricarte Marquez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Dominga testified during the preliminary investigation. Municipal Judge Elena B. De Leon thereafter issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated March 13, 1987 dismissing the case as to Ernesto Calica on the ground of lack of <i>prima facie</i> evidence and issued a warrant of arrest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against the appellant on the same date. As the appellant and his co-accused remained at large, an alias warrant of arrest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was issued on April 7, 1988. The appellant was finally arrested sometime in 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, then Acting Judge Moises C. Carbonell issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated July 4, 1991 dismissing the case for insufficiency of evidence as the court disbelieved the testimony of Dominga. The provincial fiscal, on review, reversed the resolution.<br><br>An Information was thereafter filed on November 19, 1991 before the Regional Trial Court of Kidapawan, Cotabato, docketed as Criminal Case No. 2423, charging the appellant with multiple murder, thus:<br><blockquote>That at around 2:00 o’clock in the morning of December 23, 1986, at Barangay Malabuan, Municipality of Makilala, Province of Cotabato, Philippines, the aforenamed accused, in company with several masked and unidentified persons, conspiring, confederating together, and mutually helping one another, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully feloniously and treacherously attack, assault and fired upon JOSEPH MONTILLA, LUIS VALDEZ, JR., IGMIDIO (sic) PISPIS, ROLANDO GONZALES and CARLITO ROLLUDA (sic), thereby hitting and inflicting upon the said individuals, multiple gunshot wounds in the different parts of their bodies, which caused their death.<br><br>With further aggravating circumstances of:<br><br>Committed at nighttime, in an uninhabited place and by a band, to facilitate the commission of the crime;<br><ol type="1"><li> Evident premeditation; and<br></li><li> Taking advantage of superior strength.<br></li></ol>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>A warrant for the arrest of the appellant was issued on November 20, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> An alias warrant of arrest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was issued on June 11, 1993    as the appellant remained at large. The appellant was again arrested and later ordered committed to the Provincial Warden of the Cotabato Provincial Jail on September 2, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The appellant moved for a reinvestigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the case in view of the emergence of two new witnesses, Elias Palog and Agustin Alonzo. The court granted the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The provincial prosecutor, however, recommended that trial of the case continue, as the allegation of the two witnesses, that the appellant was not present at the scene of the crime was not enough to overturn the original resolution which recommended the filing of the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge during his arraignment on December 13, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Trial forthwith ensued.<br><center><br><u>The Case for the Prosecution</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></center><br>Spouses Igmedio and Dominga Pispis resided at Barangay Malabuan, Makilala, Cotabato. They had two daughters, one of whom was Dolores. The Pispis family lived in a hut that stood on a farm on which rubber trees grew.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>At around 1:00 a.m. of December 23, 1986, while the Pispis family slept, Rolando “Boy” Gonzales, a neighbor, and fellow Ilocanos called out and asked about “Nong Tony.” Dominga woke up and peeped through the unfinished portion of the wall of their house. She saw Gonzales, his hands tied at the back, and an armed man positioned in front of their door. Two more men, similarly armed, stood beside the house, firearms pointed towards it, while still two others were sitting on a carabao sled (<i>kangga</i>) nearby. The armed men wore bonnets over their heads.<br><br>Dominga went down to answer the door. Igmedio followed suit, but had to go back to get his pants on account of the cold. One of the armed men shouted and ordered that the light be put off. The men then shouted to Igmedio, <i>“Dalian mo!,”</i> upon which Dominga went back upstairs. She noticed that her husband was sobbing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Outside, they were suddenly surrounded by five men who were wearing bonnets<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and armed with long firearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> One of the men put an arm on Igmedio’s shoulder and forced the latter to go with them. Dominga tried to follow them and placed her arm on her husband, but the armed man parried her gesture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The armed men, with her husband in tow, proceeded to walk away. One of the men asked Igmedio why his shirt was torn, to which the latter replied, “It’s alright, sir.” Dominga, for her part, climbed up on the roof of their house and saw the group head towards the direction of the house of Regino Taruma, which also led to the rubber plantation owned by a certain Irma Martinez, her husband’s employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Dominga recognized one of the men as the appellant, Florencio Calica, who also happened to be her husband’s second cousin and a member of the Civilian Home Defense Force (CHDF) of Bato.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The appellant, who was wearing black pants and a long-sleeved uniform, positioned himself in front of the door of the hut, his firearm pointed towards Igmedio. He, like the other armed men, had a bonnet over his head; only the eyes, nose and mouth were visible. The appellant’s bonnet, however, was loose. Dominga was almost face to face with the appellant, about merely half an arm’s length away,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and saw his face in the moonlight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Then eleven-year-old Dolores, who was awakened by the    commotion, also recognized the appellant, her uncle. His bonnet was loosened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> She watched from inside the house, and peeped through the unfinished portion of the wall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Dolores saw Rolando Gonzales, Joseph Montilla, Luis Valdez, Jr. and her father being taken away by the armed men.<br><br>Not long thereafter, while Dominga and her children were praying for her husband’s safety, they heard several bursts of gunfire. Igmedio never returned. His body was found at about 6:00 a.m. near a quarry in Malabuan, about one kilometer away from Barangay Villaflores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The lifeless bodies of four others were found: Carlito Rulloda, Luis Valdez, Jr., Rolando Gonzales, and Joseph Montilla.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They were hogtied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Lorena Valdez was with her family at their house in Barangay Villaflores, Makilala, Cotabato – her husband Luis Valdez, Jr., her brother Joseph Montilla, and her young children. Suddenly, armed men wearing masks came and took her husband and her brother away. The next time Lorena saw them was in the quarry, their lifeless bodies lying on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Barangay Captain Andrino Garcia was informed that people were killed in the rubber plantation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> He went there and saw the dead bodies of five men, including that of his godson, Igmedio Pispis, and his nephew, Rulloda. He then proceeded to the Makilala municipal hall and reported the matter to the authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The police went to the scene of the crime and loaded the lifeless bodies onto a vehicle to be brought to the funeral parlor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Garcia then instructed the relatives of the victim to go to the municipal hall to report everything they saw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The respective certificates of death issued by Dr. Gervacio L. Albano indicate that the victims died of multiple gunshot wounds, and that the approximate time of death was at 2:00 a.m. of December 23, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><u><center><br>The Case for the Defense<br></center><br></u>Agustin Alonzo testified that he was a native of Barangay Bato, Makilala, Cotabato, and a CHDF volunteer. At about 2:00 a.m. of December 23, 1986, he saw CHDF Commander Pedro Lopez who asked to be accompanied to Malabuan. Commander Lopez was with six people whose faces were covered. When they reached Malabuan, the men “picked up” people, including Igmedio, who were suspected members of the New People’s Army (NPA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> When he saw that the men who were taken were killed, he ran away. Alonzo also testified that he had known the appellant since the latter was a boy. He was not among the armed men involved in the abduction and killing.<br><br>Elias Palog, also a resident of Barangay Bato, Makilala, Cotabato, testified that he was a CAFGU member and a CHDF volunteer. He claimed that at around 8:00 a.m. of December 22, 1986, he was in the house of Commander Lopez at Barangay Bato. They talked about “getting some people” (<i>kuhaonon</i>) at Malabuan who were members of the NPA, particularly the victim Igmedio Pispis who was a member of the HUKBALAHAP. He stated that the appellant was not among the group who was with Pedro Lopez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Elpidio Asidre testified that he was a farmer and a resident of Barangay Bato, Makilala, Cotabato, since 1959. He and the appellant were neighbors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> as their houses were about a hundred meters away from each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> On December 22, 1986, Asidre was at his house preparing for the death anniversary of his mother. The appellant had arrived at 8:00 a.m. that morning to help him butcher a pig and a goat for the occasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The appellant, along with Rudy Llanado, helped in preparing 80 kilos of the meat. The appellant stayed in the house until 3:00 p.m. the following day, December 23, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Asidre testified that the appellant never left the house the entire time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Asidre also testified that the house of the victim Igmedio Pispis in Barangay Malabuan was about ten kilometers away, or a three-to-four hour hike from his place. There were no other means of transportation at the time due to the difficult road conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The witness added that it was impossible for the appellant to have committed the crime charged because the latter was in their house helping with the preparations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Rudy Llanado testified that he was married and had been a resident of Barangay Bato, Makilala, for twenty years. The appellant, as well as Asidre, were his neighbors. The appellant’s wife, Estrella Llanado Calica, was his sister.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> He corroborated Asidre’s testimony that there was a special occasion in the latter’s house on December 22, 1986. He stated that he arrived in Asidre’s house to help with the preparations at 3:00 p.m. that day. There were about thirty persons in the house, including the appellant. Llanado left the place at about 3:00 p.m. the next day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>According to Llanado, he and the appellant sliced the meat of the butchered pig and served food and drinks to the visitors. The appellant never left Asidre’s house. He was, thus, surprised when the appellant was implicated in the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Alfredo Aca testified that he was a rubber tapper by profession and that he resided at Malabuan, Makilala, Cotabato. His house was about 200 meters away from that of Igmedio Pispis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> He knew the appellant even as a little boy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In the evening of December 22, 1986, he was awakened by calls from six persons. They were armed, and asked for coffee. Before they left, the men asked him for directions to Igmedio Pispis’ residence. Aca merely pointed to the house, reasoning that he could not accompany them as his wife had just recently delivered a baby. The witness testified that the appellant was not among the armed men.<br><br>The appellant denied the charge lodged against him. He testified that he was a farmer and a long-time resident of Barangay Bato, Makilala, Cotabato. He confirmed his earlier testimony to the effect that it would take one three hours to get to Barangay Malabuan from Barangay Bato on foot, as the road was very difficult and one has to pass two mountains to get there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Another option was to travel by horseback.<br><br>At 8:00 a.m. of December 22, 1986, he went to the house of Elpidio Asidre to help in the food preparations for the death anniversary of the latter’s mother. There present were Rudy Llanado, Asidre, the latter’s daughter, and some visitors. He stayed there until about 3:00 p.m. of the next day because aside from serving food to the visitors, he joined the merrymaking and the drinking spree that followed. He was unable to sleep on the evening of December 22, 1986, as they were in the process of butchering the pigs and goats. He never left the house.<br><br>The trial court thereafter rendered a decision convicting the appellant of murder, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, this Court finds and so holds that for the killing of Igmedio Pispis, accused Florencio Calica is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Appreciating the aggravating circumstances of committing the crime in the nighttime and by a band and without any mitigating circumstances attending to its commission, accused Florencio Calica shall serve the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i>. His detention from April 25, 1991 to July 4, 1991 and<br><br>subsequent detention from August 24, 1993 to July 13, 1994 is credited in full in his favor. He is directed to pay costs.<br><br>Accused Florencio Calica is directed to indemnify the heirs of deceased I[g]midio (sic) Pispis the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos.<br><br>The property bond posted for his provisional liberty is cancelled and released. The Register of Deeds of Cotabato is directed to cancel the annotation in Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-51977. The Warden of the Provincial Rehabilitation Center of Cotabato is directed to take him into custody.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal before this Court, the appellant ascribes the following errors to the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><center><br>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellant insists that the prosecution utterly failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. Not one of the witnesses presented by the prosecution personally witnessed the abduction and killing of the victim Igmedio Pispis. The appellant asserts that there was no evidence that he was present during the meeting called by CHDF Commander Pedro Lopez. Defense witnesses Elias Palog and Agustin Alonzo did not testify that the appellant was among those who attended the meeting of December 22, 1986 and abducted and killed Igmedio. Considering that the trial court based its findings on their testimony which were exculpatory of the appellant, it clearly erred when it convicted him.<br><br>The appellant, likewise, asserts that there is doubt as to the veracity of the identification made by Dominga Pispis and Dolores Gonzales; one claimed that she was able to identify the appellant because his blindfold was lost, while the other claimed that he had a loosened bonnet. The appellant points out that a bonnet and a blindfold are two different things. It would have been reckless of him to have worn a loose bonnet, thus exposing his face, since he was known to Dominga, Igmedio and their daughter. Furthermore, the prosecution failed to prove any motive on his part to kill the victim, especially considering that the victim was his own cousin. As a consequence, the appellant asserts that he was convicted on the basis of mere circumstantial evidence, which has not been adequately established much less corroborated. Hence, it cannot by itself be the basis of conviction. Finally, according to the appellant, he did not even have to establish the defense of alibi since the prosecution was unable to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence in his favor.<br><br>For his part, the Solicitor General asserts that the trial court correctly found that the evidence adduced in the instant case established the culpability of the appellant for the crime of murder beyond reasonable doubt. The inconsistencies pointed out by the appellant are minor matters which do not impair the integrity of the prosecution’s evidence, or the credibility of the witnesses who positively identified the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.<br><center><br><u>The Ruling of the Court</u><br></center><br>The threshold issue in this appeal is whether or not the prosecution was able to prove, through the collective testimonies of Dominga Pispis and her daughter, that the appellant was one of those who abducted Igmedio from his house at 1:00 a.m. on December 23, 1986, and killed him shortly thereafter.<br><br>In criminal prosecution, accusation is not synonymous with guilt. It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. By reasonable doubt is meant that doubt engendered by an investigation of the whole proof and an inability, after such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt. There is a need, therefore, for the most careful scrutiny of the evidence of the prosecution, both oral and documentary, independently of whatever defense the accused may offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the evidence of the accused. The weakness of the defense of the accused does not relieve the prosecution of its responsibility of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In every case, the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused, but whether it entertains reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Where the pieces of evidence against the accused are insufficient or doubtful to determine the  guilt of the accused with moral certainty, he should be acquitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Speculations, surmises and probabilities cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The prosecution is burdened to prove beyond reasonable doubt that (a) the crime charged was committed, and (b) the identity of the perpetrators of the said crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  In <i>People v. Esmale</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> we held that the first duty of the prosecution is not to present the crime but to prove the identity of the criminal. To warrant the conviction of the accused, the identification of the accused as one of the assailants must be positive, categorical and consistent, made by a credible witness or witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The identification of the accused as the perpetrator or one of the perpetrators of the crime charged is concededly not an easy task.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It has been observed that:<br><center><br>“[T]here are few more difficult subjects with which the administration of justice has to deal. The carelessness or superficiality of observers, the rarity of powers of graphic description, and the different force with which peculiarities of form or color or expression strike different persons, make recognition or identification one of the least reliable of facts testified to even by actual witnesses who have seen the parties in question….”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></center><br>The probative weight of an in-court identification is largely dependent upon an out-of-court identification. To resolve the admissibility and probative weight of an out-of-court identification of suspects, the totality of the following factors must be considered, <i>viz</i>.:<br><center><br>… (1) the witness’ opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness’ degree of attention at that time; (3) the accuracy of any prior description given by the witness; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification; (5) the length of time between the crime and the identification; and (6) the suggestiveness of the identification procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></center><br>The totality of circumstances test has been designed precisely to assure fairness as well as compliance with the constitutional requirement of due process in regard to out-of-court identification and to prevent the contamination of the integrity of an in-court identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>A suspect may be positively identified by his face, physical attributes, voice, mannerisms and body movements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In several cases, the Court has ruled that the suspect may be identified by the illumination by starlight and by the light of the moon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Proof of the crime charged and the identity of the suspect/suspects may consist of direct evidence and/or circumstantial evidence. It is settled that in the absence of direct proof of the commission of the crime, circumstantial evidence could be the basis of conviction as long as the following requisites concur:<br><blockquote><br>(1) There is more than one circumstance;<br><br>(2) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and,<br><br>(3) The combination of the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<br></blockquote>However, to merit approbation, the circumstances proved should constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of others, as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> A judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence may be upheld only if the circumstances proved constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion that points to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person; the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with any other hypothesis except that of guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As a corollary to the constitutional precept that the accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, a conviction based on circumstantial evidence must exclude each and every hypothesis consistent with his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution proved that Igmedio was abducted by five armed men wearing bonnets over their heads at about 1:00 a.m. in front of his house on December 23, 1986. Even the appellant presented evidence that the perpetrators were Pedro Lopez, the Commander of the CHDF, and his men who suspected that Igmedio was a member of the NPA. The core issue then is whether or not the appellant was among those men who abducted and killed the victim.<br><br>The trial court anchored the appellant’s conviction on (a) the testimony of Dominga who claimed to have witnessed the abduction of her husband and recognized the appellant when the bonnet made of knitted cloth covering his head was loosened, thus, exposing the latter’s face; (b) the testimony of her young daughter Dolores who corroborated, in part, her mother’s testimony; and, (c) the testimony of Elias Palog and Agustin Alonzo, former volunteer members of the CHDF, that the members of the CHDF led by Commander Pedro Lopez abducted and killed the victim because he was suspected of being a member of the NPA. The trial court declared, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>A day before the victim was killed there was a meeting called by CHDF Commander Pedro Lopez at his house in Bato because they will take NPAs at Malabuan specially the victim who was a hukbala-ab. Accused Calica who is a resident of Bato was seen by Dominga and Dolores at about 1:00 o’clock in the morning of December 23, 1986 seated on the carabao sled in their yard armed with a long firearm. He even held his long firearm in an aiming position. His bonnet was loosely worn leaving his face to the clear view of the two. They are familiar with his face because he is a second cousin of the deceased. About one (1) hour after accused Calica’s group took the victim, they heard gunbursts. At daylight, the body of the victim was found in a quarry in Malabuan riddled with bullets. Accused Calica and his group were the last persons to be with the victim before he was shot to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br></blockquote>We find the identification of the appellant as one of the abductors and killers of the victim dubious and unconvincing. Consequently, we acquit the appellant of the crime charged.<br><br>Dominga testified that all the armed men who arrived in their house and abducted her husband wore bonnets made of knitted cloth over their<br><br>heads. Each of the bonnets had holes through which the wearer could see, and over the mouth and nose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> However, in her sworn statement to T/Sgt. Ricarte Marquez of the Criminal Investigation Unit, Dominga, with the assistance of her counsel on January 13, 1986, declared that the appellant wore a black-colored bonnet where only his face was visible:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td width="15%"><div align="justify">15.

his eyes and mouth were visible through the bonnet he wore over his head. Even if the bonnet of the appellant was “loose,” his face could not have been exposed, unless he was not wearing it, or it was rolled up and merely covered his head. It bears stressing that Dominga’s testimony showed that from the time the armed men arrived and until they left the victim’s house, the appellant merely stood by with his knees bended a little, and his firearm pointed to the victim and Dominga.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[76]</sup></font> There is no evidence that the appellant changed his position up to the time that the armed men left with the victim. Neither Dominga nor Dolores explained how the bonnet of the appellant became loose while he was immobile, thus, revealing his face to them.<br><br>Dominga testified that she was able to identify the appellant because at one point during the abduction, the latter was only half an arm’s length from her and there was a full moon.
