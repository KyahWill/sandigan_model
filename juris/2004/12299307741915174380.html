She had never seen any <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in the room before the incident.&nbsp; Thereafter, she and appellant Zhen Hua were brought to the PARAC headquarters where they were detained.&nbsp; Chuang, the cantonese interpreter, informed her that shabu had been found in the condominium unit and that the policemen were demanding <s>P</s>5,000,000 for her release.&nbsp; She was also told that if she did not pay the amount, she would be charged with drug trafficking, and that the leader of the group who arrested her would be promoted.&nbsp; However, she told Chuang that she had no money.&nbsp; Since she could not pay the amount, she was boarded on a PARAC owner-type jeep and returned to the condominium unit where the policemen took all the household appliances, such as the television, compact discs, washing machine, including laundry detergent.&nbsp; Only the sofa and the bed were not taken.&nbsp; About ten (10) days later, the appellants secured the services of counsel.<br><br>Antonio Pangan testified that he and the policemen knocked on the door to the condominium unit but that no one responded.&nbsp; He shouted, “Sir Henry,” referring to Lao, but there was no response from inside the condominium.&nbsp; After about three (3) to five (5) minutes, a policeman kicked the door open and they entered the house.&nbsp; They went to the second floor and saw the appellants sleeping.<br><br>Pangan testified that he did not see any <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> that was seized by the policemen.&nbsp; He learned that <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> had been found and taken from the condominium unit only when he saw someone holding up the substance on television during the daily news program TV Patrol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Appellant Zhen Hua also denied the charge.&nbsp; He corroborated the testimony of appellant Lee that upon her invitation, he arrived in the Philippines on a tourist visa on October 22, 1996.&nbsp; He claimed that he did not see Anciro, Jr. in the condominium unit when policemen arrived and searched the house.&nbsp; He testified that aside from the PARAC policemen, he was also investigated by policemen from Taiwan.<br><br>After trial, the court rendered judgment on January 10, 1999, convicting both appellants of the crime charged.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the decision reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, finding accused Jogy Lee and Huang Zhen Hua GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Sec. 16, Art.

The evidence for the prosecution, as a whole, is so far as self-contradictory, inherently improbable and palpably false to be accepted as a faithful reflection of the true facts of the case;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second</span>. Appellant Huang Zhen Hua’s conviction was based merely on the trial court’s conclusion that he “is not an epitome of first class tourist and that he appeared nonchalant throughout the proceedings;”<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third</span>. In convicting said appellant, the court below completely disregarded the glaring facts and admissions of the prosecution’s principal witnesses that no regulated drug was ever found in his possession;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourth</span>. The trial court, likewise, ignored the fact that the appellant’s arrest was illegal and in violation of his constitutional and basic rights against arrest without probable cause as determined by a Judge and that his arraignment did not constitute a waiver of such right;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fifth</span>. The trial court failed to consider the fact that the presumption of regularity of performance of the police officers who took part in the search had been overcome by prosecution's own evidence, thereby wrongly giving such presumption substance over and above the constitutional presumption of innocence of the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote>For her part, appellant Lee contends that: <br><br><blockquote><table style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: justify;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>1.01</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>THE ALLEGED TWO KILOS OF <span style="font-style: italic;">SHABU</span> FOUND INSIDE ONE OF THE ROOMS IN THE TOWNHOUSE RENTED BY HENRY LAU WERE MERELY PLANTED BY PARAC OPERATIVES;</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>1.02</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEARCH WARRANT WAS HIGHLY IRREGULAR, DUBIOUS AND UNREASONABLE AS THE SEARCH WARRANT DID NOT CONTAIN ANY PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THE ROOM TO BE SEARCHED, NOR WAS THERE ANY INTERPRETER TO ASSIST AND GUIDE JOGY LEE, WHO NEITHER KNEW NOR UNDERSTAND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, DURING THE SEARCH AND EVEN DURING THE TRIAL;</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>2.</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING ACCUSED JOGY LEE UPON THE GROUND THAT HER GUILT WAS NOT ESTABLISHED BY PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) posits that appellant Zhen Hua should be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt, but that the conviction of appellant Lee should be affirmed.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span></div><br>We shall delve into and resolve the assigned errors of the appellants Huang Zhen Hua and Jogy Lee sequentially.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">On Appellant Zhen Hua</span><br><br>The OSG contends that the prosecution failed to muster the requisite quantum of evidence to prove appellant Zhen Hua’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime charged, thus:<blockquote>Huang Zhen Hua denies having anything to do with the bags of “<span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>” found in the townhouse unit of Henry Lau.&nbsp; He claims that he arrived in the Philippines as a tourist on October 22, 1996, upon the invitation of Jogy Lee.&nbsp; Allegedly, at the time of his arrest, he had been in the Philippines for barely four days. He claims that he was just temporarily billeted as a guest at the townhouse where Jogy Lee was staying. And that he had no control whatsoever over said townhouse. He puts emphasis on the fact that the search of his room turned out to be “negative” and that the raiding team failed to seize or confiscate any prohibited or regulated drug in his person or possession. He, therefore, prays for his acquittal.<br><br>The People submits that Huang Zhen Hua is entitled to acquittal. The prosecution’s evidence fails to meet the quantum of evidence required to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence; thus, regardless of the supposed weakness of his defense, and his innocence may be doubted, he is nonetheless entitled to an acquittal (<span style="font-style: italic;">Natividad v. Court of Appeals</span>, 98 SCRA 335 (1980), cited in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Fronda</span>, G.R. No. 130602, March 15, 2000).&nbsp; The constitutional presumption of innocence guaranteed to every individual is of primary importance, and the conviction of the accused must&nbsp; rest not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the evidence for the prosecution.<br><br>In the instant case, as pointed out by appellant Huang Zhen Hua, the trial court erred when it did not give much weight to the admission made by the prosecution witnesses that no regulated drug was found in his person. No regulated drug was also found inside his room or in his other belongings such as suitcases, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, he had no actual or constructive possession of the confiscated “<span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.”<br><br>Moreover, it is not disputed that Huang Zhen Hua had only been in the country for barely four (4) days at the time when he was arrested.&nbsp; The prosecution was unable to show that in these four (4) days Huang Zhen Hua committed acts which showed that he was in cahoots with the drug syndicate Henry Lau and Peter Chan. It was not even shown that he was together with Henry Lau and Peter Chan on any occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Huang Zhen Hua, therefore, there is no direct evidence of any culpability. Nor is there any circumstantial evidence from which any culpability may be inferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote>We agree with the OSG.&nbsp; In a case of recent vintage, this Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Tira</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> ruminated and expostulated on the juridical concept of “possession” under Section 16, Article III of Rep. Act No. 6425, as amended, and the evidence necessary to prove the said crime, thus:<blockquote>The essential elements of the crime of possession of regulated drugs are the following: (a) the accused is found in possession of a regulated drug; (b) the person is not authorized by law or by duly constituted authorities; and, (c) the accused has knowledge that the said drug is a regulated drug. This crime is <span style="font-style: italic;">mala prohibita</span>, and, as such, criminal intent is not an essential element.&nbsp; However, the prosecution must prove that the accused had the intent to possess (<span style="font-style: italic;">animus posidende</span>) the drugs.&nbsp; Possession, under the law, includes not only actual possession, but also constructive possession. Actual possession exists when the drug is in the immediate physical possession or control of the accused.&nbsp; On the other hand, constructive possession exits when the drug is under the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found.&nbsp; Exclusive possession or control is not necessary.&nbsp; The accused cannot avoid conviction if his right to exercise control and dominion over the place where the contraband is located, is shared with another.<br><br>Thus, conviction need not be predicated upon exclusive possession, and a showing of non-exclusive possession would not exonerate the accused.&nbsp; Such fact of possession may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence and any reasonable inference drawn therefrom. However, the prosecution must prove that the accused had knowledge of the existence and presence of the drug in the place under his control and dominion and the character of the drug.&nbsp; Since knowledge by the accused of the existence and character of the drugs in the place where he exercises dominion and control is an internal act, the same may be presumed from the fact that the dangerous drug is in the house or place over which the accused has control or dominion, or within such premises in the absence of any satisfactory explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote>In this case, the prosecution failed to prove that the appellant, at any time, had actual or constructive possession of the regulated drug found in the master’s bedroom where appellant Lee was sleeping; or that the appellant had accessed the said room at any given time; or that he had knowledge of the existence of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in appellant Lee’s bedroom.&nbsp; Appellant Zhen Hua had arrived in the Philippines upon the invitation of appellant Lee only on October 22, 1996 or barely four (4) days before the arrival of the policemen and the search conducted in the condominium unit leased by Henry Lao.&nbsp; He was a mere visitor of appellant Lee.&nbsp; There is no evidence that appellant Zhen Hua was aware of the alleged illegal drug activities and/or transactions of Henry Lao, Peter Chan and appellant Lee.&nbsp; The policemen did not find any regulated drug in the room where appellant Zhen Hua was sleeping when they made their search.<br><br>The evidence of the prosecution against appellant Zhen Hua falls short of the requisite quantum of evidence to prove conspiracy between him, appellant Lee and Chan or Lao.<br><br>There is conspiracy when two or more persons agree to commit a crime and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Conspiracy cannot be presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Conspiracy must be proved beyond reasonable doubt like the crime subject of the conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Conspiracy may be proved by direct evidence or by proof of the overt acts of the accused, before, during and after the commission of the crime charged indicative of a common design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The bare fact that on two or three occasions after the arrival of appellant Zhen Hua from China, and before the search conducted in Lao’s condominium unit, appellant Zhen Hua had been seen with Lao, Chan and appellant Lee.&nbsp;

(a) the policemen who implemented the search warrant failed in their duty to show to her the said warrant, inform her of their authority and explain their presence in the condominium unit; (b) the policemen gained entry into the condominium unit by force while she was sleeping; and (c) articles and personal effects owned by her and Lao were taken and confiscated by the policemen, although not specified in the search warrant.<br><br>The appellant concludes that the articles procured by the policemen on the occasion of the search of the condominium unit are inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>Appellant Lee, likewise, contends that she was a victim of a frame-up because the policemen planted the regulated drug on her bed even before they searched the bedroom.&nbsp; She went to the room of appellant Zhen Hua to find out if he was already awake, and when she returned to the bedroom, she noticed <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> on her bed.&nbsp; She avers that the sole testimony of Anciro, Jr., that he found the regulated drug in the master’s bedroom, is incredible because he was not with the policemen who barged into the bedroom.&nbsp; She notes that even Pangan, the caretaker of the Villa, testified that he did not see any illegal drug confiscated by the policemen.<br><br>According to appellant Lee, the trial court erred in convicting her of the crime charged, considering that Lao and Chan were the suspects identified in the search warrants, not her.&nbsp; She avers that she had no knowledge of the alleged illegal drug transactions of her lover Lao.&nbsp; She contends that there was no probable cause for her arrest as her mere presence in the condominium unit does not render her liable for the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> found in the master’s bedroom of the condominium unit leased by Lao.&nbsp; She further avers that the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution are inconsistent; hence, barren of probative weight.&nbsp; The appellant also asserts that she was deprived of her right to due process when the trial court conducted a trial without a Chinese interpreter to assist her.<br><br>The OSG, for its part, avers that the police officers are presumed to have performed their duties. Based on the testimony of Anciro, Jr., appellant Lee was shown the search warrant, through the window, and the policemen identified themselves through their uniforms.&nbsp; The security guards of the condominium also explained the search warrant to the appellant.&nbsp; Although she was, at first, reluctant to open the door, appellant Lee later voluntarily opened the door and allowed them entry into the unit.&nbsp; There was no evidence of forcible entry into the unit and no breakage of any door.&nbsp; The OSG further avers that the appellant had been in the country for quite sometime already and could not have gotten around without understanding English.&nbsp; In fact, the OSG argues that when Anciro, Jr. told the appellant to get some of her clothes since she would be brought to the police headquarters in Quezon City, she did as she was told and took her clothes from the cabinet where the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> were found by the policemen.<br><br>The OSG further points out that Pangan, the chief of security of the subdivision who was a witness for appellant Lee, even testified that the search was orderly.&nbsp; The OSG contends that there was probable cause for the appellant’s arrest because an informant had tipped off the arresting officers that the appellant was a member of a syndicate dealing with illegal drugs, and that she handled the accounts of Lao and Chan.&nbsp; The appellant was not a victim of frame-up because she was present when the policemen searched the master’s bedroom where she was sleeping and where she kept her clothes, and witnessed the discovery of the regulated drugs and paraphernalia.<br><br>We agree with the contention of the appellant that the constitutional proscription against unreasonable search and seizure applies to Filipino citizens, as well as to aliens temporarily residing in the country.&nbsp; The rule against unreasonable search and seizure forbids every search that is unreasonable; it protects all those suspected or known to be offenders, as well as the innocent.&nbsp; The guarantee is as important and imperative as the guarantee of the other fundamental rights of the citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; All owes the duty for its effective enforcement lest there shall be an impairment of the right for the purpose for which it was adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Section 7, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<blockquote>SEC. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Right to break door or window to effect search</span>. – The officer, if refused admittance to the place of directed search after giving notice&nbsp; of his purpose and authority, may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house or any part of a house or anything therein to execute the warrant or liberate himself or any person lawfully aiding him when unlawfully detained therein.</blockquote>The police officers were obliged to give the appellant notice, show to her their authority, and demand that they be allowed entry.&nbsp; They may only break open any outer or inner door or window of a house to execute the search warrant if, after such notice and demand, such officers are refused entry to the place of directed search.&nbsp; This is known as the “knock and announce” principle which is embodied in Anglo-American Law.&nbsp; The method of entry of an officer into a dwelling and the presence or absence of such notice are as important considerations in assessing whether subsequent entry to search and/or arrest is constitutionally reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Gouled v.

Officer Berman immediately walked to the doorway from which she emerged and, without entering, observed the brick-shaped package of marijuana in plain view.&nbsp; Even assuming that her presence in a small room with the contraband in a prominent position on the kitchen sink would not alone establish a reasonable ground for the officers’ belief that she was in joint possession with her husband, that fact was accompanied by the officers’ information that Ker had been using his apartment as a base of operations for his narcotics activities.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot say that at the time of her arrest there were no sufficient grounds for a reasonable belief that Diane Ker, as well as her husband, were committing the offense of possession of marijuana in the presence of the officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Draper v.
