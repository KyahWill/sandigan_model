There is no showing in the records that the petitioners were served with copies of the said order; however, their counsel received a copy of the same on August 14, 1992 and failed to file any pre-trial brief.&nbsp; The respondent filed its pre-trial brief on September 1, 1992.&nbsp; By agreement of the parties, through counsel, pre-trial was reset by the court on October 16, 1992 at 8:30 a.m.&nbsp; Petitioner Inocencio received a copy of the trial court’s Order dated September 11, 1992.&nbsp; The parties failed to appear for the pre-trial on October 16, 1992.&nbsp; Consequently, the court dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; The court granted the respondent’s motion for reconsideration of the order of dismissal and issued an Order on January 4, 1993 setting the pre-trial at 8:30 a.m. on February 19, 1993.&nbsp; The copies of the order addressed to the petitioners were returned to the court for their failure to claim the same from the post office.&nbsp; As per the notation on the face of the envelope containing the order addressed to the petitioners, the latter had vacated the houses indicated therein.<br><br>When the case was called for pre-trial on February 19, 1993, the petitioners and their counsel failed to appear before the court.&nbsp; On motion of the counsel for the respondent, the petitioners were declared as in default for their failure to appear before the court for pre-trial, and for their failure to file their pre-trial brief.&nbsp; The motion of the respondent to adduce its evidence ex parte against the petitioners was granted.&nbsp; The respondent presented Lydia C.

Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>The respondent, for its part, contends that the petitioners have themselves to blame for their failure to claim their mail matter despite notice thereof to them.&nbsp; The respondent asserts that to substantiate the petitioners’ pose would be to allow them to profit from their own negligence and that of their counsel.&nbsp; The petitioners faulted the CA for holding that they had waived their right to assail the trial court’s order of default merely because they failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the trial court or for a new trial.<br><center><br><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We agree with the petitioners that the trial court erred in declaring them as in default for their failure to file a pre-trial brief at least three days before the scheduled pre-trial set on February 19, 1993 and to appear before the trial court on said date and time.<br><br>Under Section 1, Rule 20<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the parties and their counsel are mandated to appear before the court for pre-trial and if the defendants fail to do so despite due notice and without any justifiable reason therefor, they may be declared as in default, conformably to Section 2, Rule 20 of the said Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; The parties are also mandated under Circular No. 1-89 dated January 19, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> to file their respective pre-trial briefs at least three days before the pre-trial conference and if the defendants fail to do so, they may be declared as in default.&nbsp; The parties and their counsel must be served with copies of the order of the court setting the case for pre-trial, either by personal delivery or by mail under Sections 3, 4, and 5, Rule 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> of the Rules of Court, or by substituted service under Section 6, Rule 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The rule is that service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt thereof by the addressee, except when the addressee does not claim his mail within five days from the date of the first notice of the postmaster, in which case, the service shall take effect within the said period.&nbsp; The certification from the postmaster would be the best evidence to prove that the notice had been validly made.&nbsp; However, if there is nothing on record showing how, when, and to whom, the delivery of the registry notices of the registered mail was made, the court should not rely on the notation “return to sender: unclaimed” to support the presumption of constructive service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>As admitted by the petitioners, a copy of the January 4, 1993 Order of the trial court was sent to and received by their counsel on January 14, 1993.&nbsp; A copy of the same order was placed on a sealed brown envelope, addressed to the petitioners.&nbsp; The records also contain a registry notice addressed to the petitioners at “Pandacan, Manila.”&nbsp; There is no showing that the notice was sent to or received by the petitioners.&nbsp; In fact, the respondent even failed to submit to the trial court a certificate from the postmaster stating that the clerk of court sent a notice of registered mail to the petitioners’ counsel and that the latter received the same.&nbsp; And yet, the trial court declared the petitioners as in default for their counsel’s failure to appear for pre-trial and to file their brief three days before February 19, 1993.<br><br>We are, thus, convinced that the trial court erred in declaring the petitioners as in default, in allowing the respondent to adduce its evidence ex parte, and in rendering judgment by default against the petitioners.<br><br>However, it must be stressed that the petitioners failed to file a motion for new trial under Section 1(a), Rule 37 of the Rules of Court despite receipt of notice of the trial court’s decision.&nbsp; The petitioners had the right to appeal the judgment by default on the ground that the said judgment was contrary to law or the evidence.&nbsp; They were, however, proscribed from assailing the trial court’s Order dated February 19, 1993 declaring them as in default.<br><br>On the substantial as well as the other procedural aspects, petitioner Inocencio avers that the respondent failed to adduce preponderant evidence to prove its claim for the principal amount of P477,212.33.&nbsp; She posits that she is not liable for the checks issued by petitioner Peña with respect to those purchases made by the latter’s customers.&nbsp; She insists that she merely guaranteed the payment of the said purchases, and that the respondent had to first exhaust all the payments to be made by petitioner Peña before suing her.&nbsp; The petitioners assert that Lydia Lao, the lone witness of the respondent, failed to prove that they were privies to the sales invoices,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> or were involved in the transactions covered by the same.&nbsp; They contend that there is no preponderant evidence that the transactions involving the said sales invoices were covered by the surety agreement executed by and between petitioner Inocencio and the respondent.<br><br>The burden of proof is on the petitioners to establish their defenses by a preponderance of evidence while the burden of proof is on the respondent, as plaintiff, to prove by a preponderance of evidence the material allegations of its complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> If the defendants admit the material allegations of the complaint, the plaintiff is then relieved of its burden.<br><br>In this case, the respondent alleged in its complaint that during the period of November 1990 to August 1991, it delivered to the petitioners or to their designated buyers, or upon their orders, credit or on consignment, tires and rubber products evidenced by the sales invoices appended to its complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and that the petitioners still had an outstanding account for products covered by the said sales invoices in the total amount of P329,944.50, inclusive of the total amount of P147,267.83 of the dishonored checks, all of which amounted to P477,212.33.&nbsp; The respondent was, thus, burdened to prove these allegations.<br><br>However, petitioner Peña admitted liability for the products/deliveries to Largestone Enterprises covered by the sales invoices, Annexes “B-10” to “B-19”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> in the total amount of P66,789.07, and the sales invoice, Annex “CC” of the complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> in the amount of P27,235.00.&nbsp; Petitioner Inocencio, likewise, admitted liability for the tires and rubber products covered by the sales invoices, Annexes “I,” “J,” “K,” “W,” “X,” “Z,” “AA,” “DD,” “GG,” “HH,” “D,” “E,” “V,” “W,” “Y,” “EE,” and “”FF” in the total amount of P186,706.46.&nbsp; While petitioner Inocencio claimed that the aforesaid amount of P186,706.46 had already been remitted by her to the respondent, there is no record of any receipt which was issued by the respondent to serve as evidence of such payment.&nbsp; Neither did petitioner Peña adduce any receipt that was issued by the respondent for the amount of P27,235.00.&nbsp; In fine then, petitioner Peña’s total admitted accountability amounted to P94,024.07, while that of petitioner Inocencio amounted to P186,706.46, or the total amount of P280,730.53.<br><br>The petitioners claim that they are not liable for the value of the merchandise covered by the other sales invoices on the ground that on the face of the said sales invoices, they had no involvement in the transactions covered by the same.&nbsp; Such contention of the petitioners lacks merit.<br><br>Although it appears in the other sales invoices that the petitioners were the salespersons who brokered the sales of the products covered by the said sales invoices to the vendees therein named, the said entries are not conclusive of the extent and the nature of the involvement of the petitioners in the sales of the products under the said sales invoices which are not absolutely binding.&nbsp; They may be explained and put to silence by all the facts and circumstances characterizing the true import of the dealings to which they refer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; The facts contained in the said sales invoices may be contradicted by oral testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>&nbsp; Instead, while petitioner Peña appears to be the salesperson in the sales invoices in favor of Largestone, she, however, admitted that she was in fact the purchaser of the said products.&nbsp; Moreover, Lao testified that the petitioners purchased the merchandise described in the said sales invoices from the respondent, to be delivered to their respective customers as shown therein, and that the petitioners even promised to pay the same but reneged on their promise, prompting the respondent to send letters of demand to the petitioners.&nbsp; There is no evidence on record to controvert the evidence of the respondent.&nbsp; Furthermore, under the surety contract, petitioner Inocencio bound and obliged herself, jointly and severally, with petitioner Peña to pay for the merchandise sold and delivered to the customers of the latter or growing out of the said sales or deliveries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>&nbsp; The petitioners even drew and issued checks in partial payment of the said purchases, which checks were, however, dishonored by the drawee banks.&nbsp; The petitioners cannot escape liability for the transactions covered by the sales invoices.<br><br>We do not agree with the contention of the respondent that the petitioners drew and issued the checks to it in payment of obligations separate from those covered by the sales invoices appended to its complaint.&nbsp; The respondent failed to adduce any sales invoice issued by it showing sales and deliveries of the products to the petitioners or to their customers for which the latter drew and delivered the checks.&nbsp; We are convinced that the said checks were drawn and issued by the petitioners to the respondent in partial payment of the products covered by the said sales invoices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>In fine, the petitioners are jointly and severally liable to the respondent in the principal amount of P329,944.50.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.&nbsp;
