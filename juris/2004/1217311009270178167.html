				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated September 1, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 51, Tayug, Pangasinan, convicting Maj. Emilio Comiling, Geraldo Galingan alias “Bong” and Ricky Mendoza alias “Leo” of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing them to suffer the extreme penalty of death.<br><br>The three accused were charged under an information which alleged: <blockquote> The undersigned hereby accuses MAJOR EMILIO COMILING, GIL SALAGUBANG, BONG CLOTARIO, GERALDO GALINGAN, EDDIE CALDERON, BALOT CABOTAJE and RICKY MENDOZA @ Leo of the crime of ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE and PHYSICAL INJURIES, committed as follows: <blockquote> That on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of September, 1995, in the evening, inside the Masterline Grocery located at Bonifacio Street corner Quezon Blvd., municipality of Tayug, province of Pangasinan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused including certain JOE, REY and PAUL, whose family names have not yet been known, armed with firearms and handgrenade, aboard an owner-type stainless jeep and motorized tricycle, with intent to gain and with the use of violence against or intimidations upon persons, conspiring, confederating and helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously enter the Masterline Grocery pretending to be customers and once inside, poked their guns and intimidated the owner of said grocery, MR. INCIONG CO, and his worker to open the drawers of the tables of said grocery and when opened, took and carried away EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P81,000.00) and three (3) pieces of Chinese gold necklace worth TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P26,000.00), and afterwhich the above-named accused on their way out to escape with their loot, shot and hit a responding Tayug Policeman, PO3 ERWIL V. PASTOR, mortally wounding him on his face that subsequently led to his untimely death, and when said accused were cornered by other responding policemen, ran and passed to an adjacent store (Good Taste Bakery) and used it as their exit and while there also shot, hit and mortally wounded MRS. CONCHING CO, the owner of said bakery causing her injuries, the accused having thus performed the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of Homicide as a consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the accused, and that is due to the timely and able medical assistance rendered to the said MRS. CONCHING CO, to her damage and prejudice and also to the heirs of PO3 ERWIL V. PASTOR. </blockquote> CONTRARY to Article 294, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </blockquote> Accused Eddie Calderon and Balot Cabotaje have remained at large to this day. The remaining accused (Comiling, Galingan, Mendoza, Salagubang and Clotario) pleaded not guilty during their arraignment.&nbsp; Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.<br><br>On March 28, 1997, Mendoza escaped from detention and was thus tried <i>in absentia</i>.<br><br>The records show that at sundown on September 2, 1995, Ysiong Chua, the owner of Masterline Grocery and his helper Mario were about to close the store when someone knocked on the door to buy some cigarettes.&nbsp; Masterline was located at the corner of Quezon Blvd. and Bonifacio St. in Tayug, Pangasinan.<br><br>As soon as Mario opened the door, three masked, armed men suddenly barged into the store and announced a hold-up. One of the robbers shoved Ysiong into the recesses of the grocery where he threatened to kill him if he did not give them his earnings. Ysiong retorted that he only had a small amount, which remark apparently irked the robber who then hit Ysiong’s thumb with the butt of his gun. A simultaneous kick made the grocer fall down in pain.<br><br>As Ysiong lay prostrate on the floor, he saw the two other intruders, and a little later the robber who hit him, ransacking the drawers of his desk.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was able to quickly recover from the blows; whereupon he darted to the adjacent Good Taste Bakery and out to the Tayug Police Station farther west along Quezon Blvd. to report the incident.<br><br>SPO1 Rolando Torio, PO3 Erwil Pastor and SPO4 Emilio Nagui of the Tayug Police Station rushed to the crime scene where SPO1 Torio chanced upon Sonny Rimas, a barangay councilman, and his friend Jessie Batalla at the grocery entrance.&nbsp; He asked them if they knew what was going on inside the store but the two did not answer.&nbsp; While SPO1 Torio was standing outside the store’s door, he heard three gunshots coming from inside the store, all directed towards Bonifacio Street. PO3 Pastor was then on the street while Nagui was some 50 meters away. PO3 Pastor ran and hid behind a concrete marker, then moved westward as if to return to the police headquarters. Unfortunately, in his attempt to flee, PO3 Pastor was shot in the face.&nbsp; He was rushed to the Eastern Pangasinan District Hospital. On September 6, 1995, PO3 Pastor died from the injury he suffered.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ysiong discovered that he lost three gold necklaces worth P26,000 and cash amounting to P81,000.<br><br>On September 26, 1995, bothered by her conscience, prosecution witness Naty Panimbaan decided to reveal to police authorities what she knew about the case.&nbsp; During the trial, she testified that she was present in all the four meetings in which the plan to rob the Masterline Grocery was hatched.<br><br>The first meeting was on June 30, 1995 at the Zariza Inn in Tayug, Pangasinan. Among those present were Comiling, Galingan, Salagubang, Calderon, Clotario and Mendoza, along with two other persons known only as Paul and Rey. Another meeting was held by the group in July 1995 in the house of a certain Lani Galingan also in Tayug, Pangasinan.&nbsp; There were two other meetings in August 1995. Finally, on September 2, 1995, the group met at Lani’s house where they received their final instructions and the firearms they were to use from Comiling and Galingan. The entire group headed for Masterline Grocery at around 4:00 p.m. except for Naty who stayed behind in Lani’s house.<br><br>At around 8:00 p.m., she met the group in the house of a person named Joe. Galingan blamed a companion for shooting the policeman. The group planned to escape to Manila.&nbsp; She and Lani were given $50 by Galingan for their fare to Manila. Upon arrival there on September 3, 1995, they, together with Galingan, proceeded to Comiling’s house in Parañaque.&nbsp; They discussed where she and Lani should stay as Comiling did not want them around. Comiling decided that the two of them should stay in Makati. It was while she was hiding in Makati that she was able to reflect on the events that transpired, gathering enough courage to confess the robbery to the police authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, all the accused denied culpability for the felony. Each of them claimed to be somewhere else at the time the crime happened on September 2, 1995. The witnesses for the defense also tried to impugn the credibility of the lead witness for the prosecution, Naty Panimbaan.<br><br>On&nbsp; September 1, 1999, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which read: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, the prosecution having failed to establish their alleged guilt beyond moral certainty, a judgment of ACQUITTAL is hereby rendered in favor of the accused Gil Salagubang and Mario Clotario alias “Bong,” and their respective bail bonds are hereby ordered released.<br><br>However, on the basis of the evidence the prosecution has adduced, which in the Court’s perception satisfies the requisite proof beyond reasonable doubt as mandated by Section 2, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court, the Court hereby renders a judgment, as to the accused MAJ. EMILIO COMILING of Block 18, Lot 3, Camella Classic Phase II, Bicutan, Parañaque, Metro Manila, GERALDO GALINGAN alias “Bong” of Iris, Brgy. “B,” Tayug, Pangasinan and RICKY MENDOZA, said to be a resident of Parañaque, Metro Manila, as per records of the BJMP district jail, Balugnao, Pangasinan, finding them GUILTY of the special complex crime of ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE, defined and penalized under paragraph 1, Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code as amended, and pursuant to paragraph 1, Article 63, same Code, hereby sentences them to each suffer the penalty of DEATH, and in solidum to restitute, when possible, to private complainant Ysiong Chua his lost valuables, otherwise to make reparation therefor and pay to him their value of P26,000.00, plus the cash amount aggregating P81,000.00, and the heirs of PO3 Erwil Pastor, P50,000.00 for his death, and P100,000.00 for consequential damages as naturally must have arisen therefrom; and, to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote> Appellants Comiling and Galingan filed separate appeal briefs.<br><br>Appellant Comiling, who was a major in the Philippine Army, assails his conviction by asserting that the killing of PO3 Erwil Pastor happened after the robbery took place, hence the “homicide” could not have been a necessary means of committing the robbery.&nbsp; Neither could it be said that the robbery produced another offense.<br><br>The argument is specious.&nbsp; As correctly stressed by the Solicitor General, robbery with homicide is a “special complex crime.”&nbsp; It is enough that in order to sustain a conviction for this crime, the killing, which is designated as “homicide,” has a direct relation to the robbery, regardless of whether the latter takes place before or after the killing. For as long as the killing occurs during or because of the heist, even if the killing is merely accidental, robbery with homicide is committed.<br><br>Comiling also questions the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, particularly Naty Panimbaan, who was supposedly a polluted source since she was one of the conspirators.&nbsp; The reasoning is out of line.&nbsp; This Court is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; All we have to discern from the records to believe the trial court’s findings is a reasonable basis for its method of examining the credibility of witnesses and its assessment thereof.&nbsp; We do not second-guess the court a quo for as long as it does not gravely abuse such power.<br><br>In the case at bar, there is nothing to suggest that the trial court was whimsical or capricious in the performance of its tasks. Thus we have no recourse but to uphold its findings on the credibility of Naty Panimbaan and of the other prosecution witnesses. In any event, as correctly stated by the Solicitor General, Naty Panimbaan was examined three times not only under the close scrutiny of two defense counsels but also, in some instances, under the abrasive tirades of the trial judge who called her a “whore.”&nbsp; Yet, despite the trial court’s apparent misgivings about her character, it still gave full credence to her testimony: <blockquote> None of their dark attributes dissuades the Court from giving credence to their respective narratives, however.&nbsp; The Court agrees that Panimbaan knew too much, for her open-court testimony was abundantly detailed, generally consistent, straightforward and credible.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>The Court believes Panimbaan’s testimony that finally, at around 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon of September 2, 1995 the accused Comiling, Galingan, Calderon, Clotario and Mendoza, together with Rimas, Paul, Rey and Jose left Lani’s place, while she stayed behind.<br><br>The Court believes Panimbaan’s testimony that all throughout the four meetings conducted before September 2, the accused Comiling and Galingan presided, gave instructions and provided firearms and explosives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote> We find no compelling reason to disturb the factual findings and conclusions of the trial court. Indeed, prosecution witness Naty Panimbaan proved credible during the trial. She never wavered in her testimony on the details of the crime:<br><br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

We do not doubt her credibility.<br><br>The time-tested rule is that, between the positive assertions of prosecution witnesses and the mere denials of the accused, the former undisputedly deserve more credence and are entitled to greater evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant Comiling likewise contends that Naty’s testimony was inadmissible against him to prove conspiracy because of the <span style="font-style: italic;">res inter alios acta</span> rule under Section 30, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court which provides: <blockquote> Admission by conspirator. – The act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its existence, may be given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration. </blockquote> This rule prescribes that any declaration made by a conspirator relating to the conspiracy is admissible against him alone but not against his co-conspirators unless the conspiracy is first shown by other independent evidence.<br><br>According to Comiling, Naty’s testimony showed that she was also a conspirator, thus, the existence of conspiracy must be shown by evidence other than Naty’s admission. As there was no independent proof of conspiracy except the testimony of Naty, the latter’s testimony concerning appellant’s participation in the conspiracy was inadmissible against him.&nbsp; This contention is misplaced. The <span style="font-style: italic;">res inter alios acta</span> rule refers only to extrajudicial declarations or admissions and not to testimony given on the witness stand where the party adversely affected has the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the present case, Naty’s admission implicating appellant Comiling was made in open court and therefore may be taken in evidence against him.<br><br>Lastly, Comiling asserts that he cannot be held liable for robbery as he was not physically present at the Masterline Grocery and had no ostensible participation therein. The contention is off-tangent.&nbsp; Although Comiling was never tagged as one of the three robbers who entered the store of Ysiong Chua nor the one who mauled the victim or who shot PO3 Erwil Pastor to death, his participation was his leadership in the conspiracy to commit robbery with homicide and his inducement to his cohorts to perpetrate the same.&nbsp; As held in <i>People vs. Assad</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> one who plans the commission of a crime is a principal by inducement.&nbsp; As testified to by Naty Panimbaan:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">And what happened to this fourth meeting, Madam Witness?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">They talked about the projected robbery and Major Comiling decided that they will push through on September 2.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">What else happened during that fourth meeting?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Major Comiling gave their respective assignments.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">You said Major Comiling gave their respective assignments to the members of this group, what assignments if you know was given to Bong Galingan?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Bong Galingan should be in front of the LBC.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">How about Sonny Rimas?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">COURT:<br><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Your answer should be one at a time.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">WITNESS:<br><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Sonny Rimas and Bong Clotario should be at the tricycle.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

The fact that the heist was finally executed only on September 2, 1995 indicated that Comiling had indomitably clung to his determination.&nbsp; Principalship by inducement (or by induction) presupposes that the offender himself is determined to commit the felony and must have persistently clung to his determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In all the meetings prior to the commission of the crime, Comiling was seen and heard presiding over and leading the group.&nbsp; He was even the one who assigned each of his men his specific role in the robbery. Then, in the house where the perpetrators regrouped after the commission of the crime, Comiling was handed the money and jewelry stolen from the grocery store. It was also Comiling who instructed Naty and Lani to hide in Makati after the incident. He paid for the monthly rental of the room where Naty and Lani stayed.&nbsp; All this can only prove that Comiling was the acknowledged leader of the group.<br><br>Moreover, another witness for the prosecution, Sonny Rimas, testified that while serving beer to the accused at Zariza Inn, he heard that Comiling was planning the robbery of Masterline. He even heard Comiling say, “We will enter the place of Isko,” referring to Ysiong Chua’s store. Indeed, appellant Comiling was the undisputable mastermind.&nbsp; The judgment of conviction of Emilio Comiling must therefore be affirmed.<br><br>For his part, appellant Galingan interposed the defense of alibi. He claimed that he was in the house of his uncle in Novaliches, Metro Manila when the incident happened on September 2, 1995. He was in Manila because his wife was scheduled to arrive from Hong Kong on September 4, 1995.<br><br>For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must show that he was in another place for such period of time that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In this case, Galingan did not meet the settled requirements of time and place.&nbsp; He failed to prove that he was indeed in Novaliches at the time of the commission of the crime; his alleged presence therein was not established by a positive declaration from an independent witness.&nbsp; Likewise, the place where he claimed to be on the night of the crime was not of such distance that it was impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission considering that either place could be reached in just about four hours by land. The fact that he met his wife upon arrival on September 4, 1995 was likewise inconsequential as it was two days after September 2, 1995, the date material to this case. Alibi, in order to be given full faith and credit, must be clearly established and must not leave any room for doubt as to its plausibility and verity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It should also be noted that Rimas testified that, while he was standing near the door of Masterline Grocery at around 6:30 p.m. on September 2, 1995, he noticed the arrival of an owner-type jeep. Rimas positively identified appellant Galingan as the driver thereof.<br><br>Galingan’s invocation of alibi should be disregarded not only because of its inherent weakness but also because of the circumstances pointing to its contrived nature and his positive identification by prosecution witness Rimas as one of those present during the Masterline Grocery robbery on September 2, 1995.<br><br>Appellant Galingan also impugns the credibility of prosecution witness Naty Panimbaan.&nbsp; He denies Naty’s claim that they were lovers.&nbsp; He maintains that Naty was a woman of ill-repute whom he paid P700 everytime they had sex.&nbsp; Galingan insists that the only reason why Naty implicated him in the offense was because she wanted him to leave his wife which he did not want to do.&nbsp; Furthermore, according to Galingan, Naty was a drug user and this supposedly tainted her credibility.<br><br>These attacks on Naty’s character and reputation are too flimsy and irrelevant to deserve serious consideration. The fact that a witness is a person of unchaste character or even a drug dependent does not per se affect her credibility. Character is frequently used to refer to one’s reputation in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It means the estimate attached to the individual by the community and not the qualities of the individual as conceived by one person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> With respect to a witness in both criminal and civil cases, evidence of his character, in order to affect his credibility, must refer to his “general reputation for truth, honesty or integrity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, testimonies attacking the character of a witness for the purpose of impugning his credibility must relate and be confined to the general reputation which such witness has in the community or neighborhood where he lives or has lived.&nbsp; Personal opinions on the moral character of a witness, being usually too general, sweeping or subjective, are excluded.<br><br>Measured against the foregoing standard, appellant Galingan’s testimony on the alleged bad character and unreliability as a witness of Naty Panimbaan deserves no merit.&nbsp; Other than his adverse testimony, Galingan never credibly established that Naty was reputed in the community or neighborhood to be a woman of loose morals or a drug user.&nbsp; Clearly, Galingan’s testimony and evidence concerning Naty’s character was based solely on his own self-serving claim or private opinion, and did not at all reflect the general reputation by which Naty was held by the community.&nbsp; We therefore remain convinced of Naty’s credibility as a witness.<br><br>Besides, the credibility of a witness is left primarily to the judgment of the trial judge. Given the direct opportunity to observe the witness on the stand, the trial judge is in a vantage position to assess the witness’ demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In <i>People vs. De Guzman</i>, we held that: <blockquote> In the resolution of the factual issues, the Court relies heavily on the trial court for its evaluation of the witnesses and their credibility. <span style="font-style: italic;">Having the opportunity to observe them on the stand, the trial judge is able to detect that sometimes thin line between fact and prevarication that will determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. That line may not be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the reviewing court.</span> The record will not reveal those tell-tale signs that will affirm the truth or expose the contrivance, like the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready reply. The record will not show if the eyes have darted in evasion or looked down in confession or gazed steadily with a serenity that has nothing to distort or conceal. The record will not show if tears were shed in anger, or in shame, or in remembered pain, or in feigned innocence. Only the judge trying the case can see all these and on the basis of his observations arrive at an informed and reasoned verdict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (italics ours) </blockquote> Moreover, Galingan failed to substantiate his claim that Naty was driven by ill will or false motive in testifying against him.&nbsp; His vain attempt to portray Naty as a “woman scorned by her lover” certainly did not constitute sufficient reason for Naty to accuse him of a very serious crime where the possible penalty could either be death or life imprisonment.&nbsp; In fact, the trial court did not perceive such improper motivation on the part of Naty and the other prosecution witnesses as would make them falsely implicate appellants in the commission of the very serious crime. To us, the only plausible motivation for Naty was her honest desire to speak the truth.<br><br>Our established doctrine is that the witness’ testimony deserves full faith and credit where there exists no evidence to show any dubious reason or improper motive why he should testify falsely against the accused, or why he should implicate the accused in a serious offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>More importantly, PO3 Erwil Pastor identified Galingan as the robber who shot him. In the emergency room of the Eastern Pangasinan District Hospital, at around 7:00 p.m. on September 2, 1995, Pastor moaned “I might die. I might die.” in the presence of SPO1 Conrado Hidalgo and SPO4 Emilio Nagui. Hence, PO3 Pastor’s statements were taken down by SPO1 Hidalgo who assisted PO3 Pastor in affixing his thumbmark with his own blood: <blockquote> Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shot you? <br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bong Galingan, x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </blockquote> Under Rule 130, Section 37 of the Rules of Court, the declaration of a dying person with the consciousness of impending death may be received in any case wherein his death is the subject of inquiry, as evidence of the cause and the surrounding circumstances of such death.&nbsp; There are four requisites which must concur in order that a dying declaration may be admissible: (1) it must concern the crime and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death; (2) at the time it was made, the declarant was under the consciousness of an impending death; (3) the declarant was competent as a witness; and (4) the declaration is offered in any criminal case for homicide, murder or parricide in which the declarant was the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>(1) The first requisite is present in the <i>ante-mortem</i> statements of deceased PO3 Pastor. Certainly, the narration made by Pastor at the hospital’s emergency room before SPO1 Hidalgo and SPO4 Nagui concerned the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death. The two policemen heard from the declarant’s own lips his utterance of the name “Bong Galingan” as his assailant. This fact was even testified to by these policemen.<br><br>(2) The declarant, at the time he gave the dying declaration, was conscious of his impending death. PO3 Pastor knew at the time he was being questioned that his chances of recovery were nil. In fact, he uttered the words, “I might die. I might die.” to signify his perception that death was forthcoming.<br><br>(3) PO3 Pastor, at the time he uttered the dying declaration, was competent as a witness.&nbsp; This fact is too obvious to warrant further discussion.<br><br>(4) The dying declaration of PO3 Pastor was offered as evidence in a criminal case for robbery with homicide in which the declarant was the victim.<br><br>Indubitably, PO3 Pastor’s dying declaration is complete in the sense that it was a full expression of all that he wanted to say with regard to the circumstances of his death.&nbsp; An <i>ante-mortem</i> statement is evidence of the highest order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It is doctrinal that, when a person is at the point of death, every motive of falsehood is silenced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The mind is induced by the strongest of reasons to speak the truth – the declarant’s impending meeting with his Creator.<br><br>Insofar as Ricky Mendoza is concerned, the evidence likewise confirms his responsibility for the offense. He was positively identified by prosecution witness Rimas as one of the men who alighted from the jeep, barged into the Masterline Grocery and shot his way out therefrom. Naty Panimbaan also positively confirmed his participation in the crime.&nbsp; More than that, as shown by the records, Mendoza flew the coop after he was arraigned and remains at large up to the present. Flight from justice is evidence of guilt.<br><br>The existence of conspiracy in this case cannot be doubted. The rule is, whenever homicide is committed as a consequence or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who take part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>While we are convinced that appellants are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of robbery with homicide, we cannot impose the penalty of death on them. Under Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the crime of robbery carries the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. In imposing the death penalty, the trial court appreciated the aggravating circumstances of band, evident premeditation, craft and disguise against appellants. However, these circumstances were not specifically alleged in the information as required under Rule 110, Section 8 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. Hence, inasmuch as no aggravating and mitigating circumstances can be deemed to have attended the commission of the offense, the lower penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> should be imposed on them.<br><br>On the award of damages, this Court modifies the amounts as well as the designations thereof. Thus, appellants Emilio Comiling, Geraldo Galingan alias “Bong” and accused Ricky Mendoza alias “Leo” must <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> <i>solidum</i> restore to Ysiong Chua his lost valuables, and if impossible to do so, must pay him as reparation the amount of P26,000, plus the P81,000 in cash he lost, as actual damages. They should also pay the heirs of PO3 Erwil Pastor P50,000 as civil indemnity for his death as this is in accord with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In addition, the heirs of PO3 Pastor are entitled to P25,000 as temperate damages in lieu of actual damages, pursuant to the case of <i>People vs. Abrazaldo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> However, we cannot award moral damages to the heirs of PO3 Pastor because of their failure to present any proof or testimony that they suffered anguish and distress as a result of his death.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION.</b>&nbsp; Appellants Emilio Comiling, Geraldo Galingan and accused Ricky Mendoza are hereby found guilty of robbery with homicide and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>They are also ordered to return to Ysiong Chua his lost valuables, and if this cannot be done, to pay him in solidum&nbsp;&nbsp; its value of P26,000 as reparation, plus P81,000 which was the amount of the cash stolen, as actual damages, and to pay the heirs of PO3 Erwil Pastor P50,000 as civil indemnity and P25,000 as temperate damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Vitug, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna,</i> and <i>Tinga, JJ.</i>, concur. <i><br>Puno, J.</i>, on leave. <br><i>Panganiban, J.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Ulysses Raciles Butuyan, Rollo, pp. 40-95.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, pp. 16-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> TSN, December 13, 1996, pp. 10-34; January 31, 1997, pp. 3-18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Rollo, p. 95.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rollo, p. 219.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, Dec. 13, 1996, pp. 9-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>People vs. Monteron</i>, 378 SCRA 340 [2002]; <i>Tecson vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, 318 SCRA 80 [1999].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>People vs. Flores,</i> 195 SCRA 295, [1991].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 55 Phil. 697.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, Jan. 31, 1997, pp. 3-4, Records, pp. 216-217.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Regalado, <i>Criminal Law Conspectus</i>, 2000 ed., p. 109.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>People vs. Azugue</i>, 268 SCRA 711 [1997].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>People vs. Sagario</i>, 14 SCRA 468 [1965].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Francisco, <i>Evidence,</i> Vol. VII, 1990 ed., p. 743.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Rule 132, Section 11, Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>People vs. Omar</i>, 327 SCRA 221 [2000].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 188 SCRA 407 [1990]; underscoring supplied; see also <i>People vs. Silvano</i>, 378 SCRA 672 [2002], <i>People vs. Estorco</i>, 331 SCRA 38 [2000] and <i>People vs. Cayabyab</i>, 27 SCRA 387 [1997].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>People vs. Lomerio</i>, 326 SCRA 530 [2000]; <i>People vs. Merino</i>, 321 SCRA 199 [1999].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TSN, November 25, 1996, p. 49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Moran, <i>Comments on the Rules of Court</i>, Vol. V, 1980 ed., p. 294.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>People vs. Montilla</i>, 211 SCRA 119 [1992].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Moran, <i>op cit.</i>, note 18, p. 304.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>People vs. Nunag</i>, 196 SCRA 206 [1991].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As amended by Section 9 of RA 7659.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>People vs. Delim</i>, 396 SCRA 386 [2003].<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>People vs. Abrazaldo</i>, 397 SCRA 137 [2003].</div></div>
