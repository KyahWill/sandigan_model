				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When the credibility of a witness is sought to be impeached by proof of his reputation, it is necessary that the reputation shown should be that which existed before the occurrence of the circumstances out of which the litigation arose,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> or at the time of the trial and prior thereto, but not at a period remote from the commencement of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> This is because a person of derogatory character or reputation can still change or reform himself.<br><br>For our resolution is the petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>of the Court of Appeals’ Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated January 8, 1998, in CA-G.R. SP. No. 44180, the dispositive portion of which    reads:<br><blockquote>“<b>WHEREFORE</b>, Resolution No. 966213 dated September 23, 1996 and Resolution No. 972423 dated April 11, 1997 of the respondent Civil Service Commission are hereby set aside. The complaint against petitioner Allyson Belagan filed by Magdalena Gapuz is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br>The dismissal of petitioner Belagan is lifted and he is hereby ordered to be immediately reinstated to his position without loss of seniority, retirement, backwages and other rights and benefits.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b>”<br></blockquote>The instant case stemmed from two (2) separate complaints filed respectively by Magdalena Gapuz, founder/directress of the “Mother and Child Learning Center,” and Ligaya Annawi, a public school teacher at Fort Del Pilar Elementary School, against respondent Dr. Allyson Belagan, Superintendent of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), all from Baguio City.  Magdalena charged respondent with sexual indignities and harassment, while Ligaya accused him of sexual harassment and various malfeasances.<br><br>Magdalena’s sworn complaint alleges that sometime in March 1994, she filed an application with the DECS Office in Baguio City for a permit to operate a pre-school.  One of the requisites for the issuance of the permit was the inspection of the school premises by the DECS Division Office. Since the officer assigned to conduct the inspection was not present, respondent volunteered his services.  Sometime in June 1994, respondent and complainant visited the school.  In the course of the inspection, while both were descending the stairs of the second floor, respondent suddenly placed his arms around her shoulders and kissed her cheek. Dumbfounded, she muttered, <i>“Sir, is this part of the inspection?  Pati ba naman kayo sa DECS wala ng values?</i>”  Respondent merely sheepishly smiled.  At that time, there were no other people in the area.<br><br>Fearful that her application might be jeopardized and that her husband might harm respondent, Magdalena just kept quiet.<br><br>Several days later, Magdalena went to the DECS Division Office and asked respondent,<i> “Sir, kumusta yung application ko?” </i>His reply was <i>“Mag-date muna tayo.”</i> She declined, explaining that she is married.  She then left and reported the matter to DECS Assistant Superintendent Peter Ngabit.<br><br>Magdalena never returned to the DECS Division Office to follow up her application.  However, she was forced to reveal the incidents to her husband when he asked why the permit has not yet been released. Thereupon, they went to the office of the respondent.  He merely denied having a personal relationship with Magdalena.<br><br>Thereafter, respondent forwarded to the DECS Regional Director his recommendation to approve Magdalena’s application for a permit to operate a pre-school.<br><br>Sometime in September 1994, Magdalena read from a local newspaper that certain female employees of the DECS in Baguio City were charging a    high-ranking DECS official with sexual harassment.  Upon inquiry, she learned that the official being complained of was respondent.  She then wrote a letter-complaint for sexual indignities and harassment to former DECS Secretary Ricardo Gloria.<br><br>On October 4, 1994, respondent was placed under suspension.<br><br>On the part of Ligaya Annawi, she alleged in her complaint that on four separate occasions, respondent touched her breasts, kissed her cheek, touched her groins, embraced her from behind and pulled her close to him, his organ pressing the lower part of her back.<br><br>Ligaya also charged respondent with: <b>(1) </b>delaying the payment of the teachers’ salaries; <b>(2)</b> failing to release the pay differentials of substitute teachers; <b>(3)</b> willfully refusing to release the teachers’ uniforms, proportionate allowances and productivity pay; and<b> (4)</b> failing to constitute the Selection and Promotion Board, as required by the DECS rules and regulations.<br><br>The DECS conducted a joint investigation of the complaints of Magdalena and Ligaya.  In his defense, respondent denied their charge of sexual harassment.  However, he presented evidence to disprove Ligaya’s imputation of dereliction of duty.<br><br>On January 9, 1995, the DECS Secretary rendered a Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> finding respondent guilty of four (4) counts of sexual “indignities or harassments” committed against Ligaya; and two (2) counts of “sexual advances or indignities” against Magdalena. He was ordered dismissed from the service.  The dispositive portion of the Joint Decision reads:<br><blockquote>“<b>WHEREFORE</b>, foregoing disquisitions duly considered, decision is hereby rendered in the two above-entitled cases, finding:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="8%"><div align="left">a) </div></td> <td width="92%"><div align="justify">Respondent Dr. Allyson Belagan, Superintendent of the DECS Baguio City Schools Division GUILTY of the four counts of sexual indignities or harassments committed against the person and honor of complainant Miss Ligaya Annawi, a Baguio City public school teacher, while in the performance of his official duties and taking advantage of his office.

The CSC ruled that respondent’s transgression against Magdalena constitutes grave misconduct.  Thus:<br><blockquote>“The acts of Belagan are serious breach of good conduct since he was holding a position which requires the incumbent thereof to maintain a high degree of moral uprightness. As Division Superintendent, Belagan represents an institution tasked to mold the character of children. Furthermore, one of his duties is to ensure that teachers in his division conduct themselves properly and observe the proper discipline. Any improper behavior on his part will seriously impair his moral ascendancy over the teachers and students which can not be tolerated.  <b>Therefore, his misconduct towards an applicant for a permit to operate a private pre-school cannot be treated lightly and constitutes the offense of grave misconduct.</b><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Allyson Belagan is hereby found guilty of <b>grave misconduct</b> and imposed the penalty of DISMISSAL from the service with all the accessory penalties. The decision of the DECS Secretary is modified accordingly.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 29, 1996, respondent seasonably filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that he has never been charged of any offense in his thirty-seven (37) years of service.  By contrast, Magdalena was charged with several offenses before the Municipal<br><br>Trial Court (MTC) of Baguio City, thus:<br><blockquote>“1.

This is so because even a prostitute or a woman of ill repute may become a victim of said offense.</b><br><br>As such, the fact that complainant Magdalena Gapuz is shown to have had cases before the regular courts for various offenses and was condemned by her community for wrongful behavior does not discount the possibility that she was in fact telling the truth when she cried about the lecherous advances made to her by the respondent.  x x x”<br></blockquote>Respondent then filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review.  As stated earlier, it reversed the CSC Resolutions and dismissed Magdalena’s complaint.<br><br>The Appellate Court held that Magdalena is an unreliable witness, her character being questionable.  Given her aggressiveness and propensity for trouble, “she is not one whom any male would attempt to steal a kiss.” In fact, her “record immediately raises an alarm in any one who may cross her path.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In absolving respondent from the charges, the Appellate Court considered his “unblemished” service record for 37 years.<br><br>Unsatisfied, the CSC, through the Solicitor General, filed the instant petition raising the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><b></b><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" width="10%">“I. </td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="90%"><div align="justify">The Supreme Court may rule on factual issues raised on appeal where the Court of Appeals misappreciated the facts.

This is a question of fact which, as a general rule, is not subject to this Court’s review.<br><br>It is a rule of long standing that factual findings of the Court of Appeals, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive and binding on the parties and are not reviewable by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This Court is, after all, not a trier of facts.  One of the exceptions, however, is when the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court or a<i> quasi-judicial</i> body, like petitioner herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Here, the Court of Appeals and the CSC are poles apart in their appreciation of Magdalena’s derogatory record.  While the former considered it of “vital and paramount importance” in determining the truth of her charge, the latter dismissed it as of “minor significance.” This contrariety propels us to the elusive area of character and reputation evidence.<br><br>Generally, the character of a party is regarded as legally irrelevant in determining a controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> One statutory exception is that relied upon by respondent, i.e., Section 51 (a) 3, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, which we quote here:<br><blockquote><i>“</i><b>SEC. 51</b>.<i> Character evidence not generally admissible; exceptions. </i>–<br><br>(a) In Criminal Cases:<br><br>x x x        x x x<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(3) The good or bad moral character of the offended party may be proved if it tends to establish in any reasonable degree the probability or improbability of the offense charged.”</span><br></div></blockquote>It will be readily observed that the above provision pertains only to criminal cases, not to administrative offenses.  And even assuming that this technical rule of evidence can be applied here, still, we cannot sustain respondent’s posture.<br><br>Not every good or bad moral character of the offended party may be proved under this provision.  Only those which would establish the probability or improbability of the offense charged.  This means that the character evidence must be limited to the traits and characteristics involved in the type of offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, on a charge of rape - character for chastity, on a charge of assault - character for peaceableness or violence, and on a charge of embezzlement - character for honesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In one rape case, where it was established that the alleged victim was morally loose and apparently uncaring about her chastity, we found the conviction of the accused doubtful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the present administrative case for sexual harassment, respondent did not offer evidence that has a bearing on Magdalena’s chastity.   What he presented are charges for grave oral defamation, grave threats, unjust vexation, physical injuries, malicious mischief, etc. filed against her. Certainly, these pieces of evidence are inadmissible under the above provision because they do not establish the probability or improbability of the offense charged.<br><br>Obviously, in invoking the above provision, what respondent was trying to establish is Magdalena’s lack of credibility and not the probability or the improbability of the charge.  In this regard, a different provision applies.<br><br>Credibility means the disposition and intention to tell the truth in the testimony given.  It refers to a person’s integrity, and to the fact that he is worthy of belief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A witness may be discredited by evidence attacking his general reputation for truth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> honesty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> or integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Section 11, Rule 132 of the same Revised Rules on Evidence reads:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 11</span>.<i> Impeachment of adverse party’s witness</i>. –A witness may be impeached by the party against whom he was called, by contradictory evidence,<b> by evidence that his general reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity is bad, </b>or by evidence that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony,<b> but not by evidence of particular wrongful acts, </b>except that it may be shown by the examination of the witness, or <b>the record of the judgment, that he has been convicted of an offense.”</b><br></blockquote>Although she is the offended party, Magdalena, by testifying in her own behalf, opened herself to character or reputation attack pursuant to the principle that a<b> party who becomes a witness in his own behalf places himself in the same position as any other witness, and may be impeached by an attack on his character or reputation.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>With the foregoing disquisition, the Court of Appeals is correct in holding that the character or reputation of a complaining witness in a sexual charge is a proper subject of inquiry.  This leads us to the ultimate question – <b>is Magdalena’s derogatory record sufficient to discredit her credibility?</b><br><br>A careful review of the record yields a negative answer.<br><br><i>First</i>, most of the twenty-two (22) cases filed with the MTC of Baguio City relate to acts committed in the 80’s, particularly, 1985 and 1986.  With respect to the complaints filed with the Chairmen of Barangay Gabriela Silang and Barangay Hillside, the acts complained of took place in 1978 to 1979.  In the instant administrative case, the offense was committed in <b>1994</b>.  Surely, those cases and complaints are no longer reliable proofs of Magdalena’s character or reputation. The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in according much weight to such evidence.  <b>Settled is the principle that evidence of one’s character or reputation must be confined to a time not too remote from the time in question.</b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></b><b> In other words, what is to be determined is the character or reputation of the person at the time of the trial and prior thereto, but not at a period remote from the commencement of the suit.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Hence, to say that Magdalena’s credibility is diminished by proofs of tarnished reputation existing almost a decade ago is unreasonable.  It is unfair to presume that a person who has wandered from the path of moral righteousness can never retrace his steps again. Certainly, every person is capable to change or reform.<br><br>Second, respondent failed to prove that Magdalena was convicted in any of the criminal cases specified by respondent.  The general rule prevailing in a great majority of jurisdictions is that it is not permissible to show that a witness has been arrested or that he has been charged with or prosecuted for a criminal offense, or confined in jail for the purpose of impairing his credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This view has usually been based upon one or more of the following grounds or theories:<b> (a)</b> that a mere unproven charge against the witness does not logically tend to affect his credibility,<b> (b)</b> that innocent persons are often arrested or accused of a crime, <b>(c)</b> that one accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is legally established, and <b>(d)</b> that a witness may not be impeached or discredited by evidence of particular acts of misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Significantly, the same Section 11, Rule 132 of our Revised Rules on Evidence provides that a witness may not be impeached by evidence of particular wrongful acts. Such evidence is rejected because of the confusion of issues and the waste of time that would be involved, and because the witness may not be prepared to expose the falsity of such wrongful acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As it happened in this case, Magdalena was not able to explain or rebut each of the charges against her listed by respondent.<br><br>But more than anything else, what convinces us to sustain the Resolution of the CSC is the fact that it is supported by substantial evidence.  As aptly pointed out by the Solicitor General, Magdalena testified in a straightforward, candid and spontaneous manner.  Her testimony is replete with details, such as the number of times she and respondent inspected the pre-school, the specific part of the stairs where respondent kissed her, and the matter about her transient boarders during summer.  Magdalena would not have normally thought about these details if she were not telling the truth.  We quote her testimony during the cross-examination conducted by DECS Assistant Secretary Romeo Capinpin and Undersecretary Antonio Nachura, thus:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">“Q</div></td> <td>  <div align="justify">Was there any conversation between you and Dr. Belagan during the inspection on the first floor and the second floor?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">A</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">There was, sir.

Surely, we cannot debunk it simply because of the Court of Appeals’ outdated characterization of Magdalena as a woman of bad reputation.  There are a number of cases where the triers of fact believe the testimony of a witness of bad character<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and refuse to believe one of good character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As a matter of fact, even a witness who has been convicted a number of times is worthy of belief, when he testified in a straightforward and convincing manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, it bears stressing that more than anybody else, it is the DECS investigating officials who are in a better position to determine whether Magdalena is telling the truth considering that they were able to hear and observe her deportment and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In reversing the CSC’s Resolutions, the Court of Appeals ruled that “there is ample evidence to show that Magdalena had a motive” in accusing respondent, i.e., to pressure him to issue a permit.  This is unconvincing. The record shows that respondent had already issued the permit when Magdalena filed her letter-complaint.  Indeed, she had no more reason to charge respondent administratively, except of course to vindicate her honor.<br><br>Petitioner prays that we sustain its ruling penalizing respondent for grave misconduct and not merely for disgraceful or immoral conduct which is punishable by suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Misconduct means intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior, especially by a government official.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> To constitute an administrative offense, misconduct should relate to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and duties of a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In grave misconduct as distinguished from simple misconduct, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">elements of corruption</span>, clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Corruption as an element of grave misconduct consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his station or character to procure some benefit for himself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This is apparently present in respondent’s case as it concerns not only a stolen kiss but also a demand for a “date,” an unlawful consideration for the issuance of a permit to operate a pre-school.  Respondent’s act clearly constitutes grave misconduct, punishable by dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>We are, however, not inclined to impose the penalty of dismissal from the service.  Respondent has served the government for a period of 37 years, during which, he made a steady ascent from an Elementary Grade School Teacher to Schools Division Superintendent.  In devoting the best years of his life to the education department, he received numerous awards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This is the first time he is being administratively charged.  He is in the edge of retirement.  In fact, he had filed his application for retirement when Magdalena filed her complaint.  Section 16, Rule XIV, of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 provides:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">“SEC. 16. In the determination of penalties to be imposed, mitigating and aggravating circumstances may be considered</span>. x x x.”<br></blockquote>The mitigating circumstances are enumerated in Section 53, Rule IV, of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which reads in part:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 53</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Extenuating, Mitigating, Aggravating, or Alternative Circumstances.</span> – In the determination of the penalties to be imposed, mitigating, aggravating and alternative circumstances attendant to the commission of the offense shall be considered.<br><br>The following circumstances shall be appreciated:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  x x x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">j. length of service</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  x x x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">l. and other analogous cases.”</span><br></blockquote>Conformably with our ruling in a similar case of sexual harassment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and respondent’s length of service, unblemished record in the past and numerous awards,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the penalty of suspension from office without pay for one (1) year is in order.<br><br>While we will not condone the wrongdoing of public officers and employees, however, neither will we negate any move to recognize and remunerate their lengthy service in the government.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.
