				<H3>WILLIAM S. UY, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. FERMIN L. GONZALES, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">William S. Uy filed before this Court an administrative case against Atty. Fermin L. Gonzales for violation of the confidentiality of their lawyer-client relationship.&nbsp; The complainant alleges:<br><br>Sometime in April 1999, he engaged the services of respondent lawyer to prepare and file a petition for the issuance of a new certificate of title.&nbsp; After confiding with respondent the circumstances surrounding the lost title and discussing the fees and costs, respondent prepared, finalized and submitted to him a petition to be filed before the Regional Trial Court of Tayug, Pangasinan. When the petition was about to be filed, respondent went to his (complainant’s) office at Virra Mall, Greenhills and demanded a certain amount from him other than what they had previously agreed upon.&nbsp; Respondent left his office after reasoning with him. Expecting that said petition would be filed, he was shocked to find out later that instead of filing the petition for the issuance of a new certificate of title, respondent filed a letter-complaint dated July 26, 1999 against him with the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Tayug, Pangasinan for “Falsification of Public Documents.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The letter-complaint contained facts and circumstances pertaining to the transfer certificate of title that was the subject matter of the petition which respondent was supposed to have filed.&nbsp; Portions of said letter-complaint read: <blockquote> The undersigned complainant accuses WILLIAM S. UY, of legal age, Filipino, married and a resident of 132-A Gilmore Street corner 9<sup>th</sup> Street, New Manila, Quezon City, Michael Angelo T. UY, CRISTINA EARL T. UY, minors and residents of the aforesaid address, Luviminda G. Tomagos, of legal age, married, Filipino and a resident of Carmay East, Rosales, Pangasinan, and F. Madayag, with office address at A12, 2/F Vira Mall Shopping Complex, Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila, for ESTAFA THRU FALSIFICATION OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS, committed as follows:<br><br>That on March 15, 1996, William S. Uy acquired by purchase a parcel of land consisting of 4.001 ha. for the amount of P100,000.00, Philippine Currency, situated at Brgy. Gonzales, Umingan, Pangasinan, from FERMIN C. GONZALES, as evidenced by a Deed of Sale executed by the latter in favor of the former…; that in the said date, William S. Uy received the Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-33122, covering the said land;<br><br>That instead of registering said Deed of Sale and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-33122, in the Register of Deeds for the purpose of transferring the same in his name, William S. Uy executed a Deed of Voluntary Land Transfer of the aforesaid land in favor of his children, namely, Michael Angelo T. Uy and Cristina Earl T. Uy, wherein William S. Uy made it appear that his said children are of legal age, and residents of Brgy. Gonzales, Umingan, Pangasinan, when in fact and in truth, they are minors and residents of Metro Manila, to qualify them as farmers/beneficiaries, thus placing the said property within the coverage of the Land Reform Program;<br><br>That the above-named accused, conspiring together and helping one another procured the falsified documents which they used as supporting papers so that they can secure from the Office of the Register of Deeds of Tayug, Pangasinan, TCT No. T-5165 (Certificate of Land Ownership Award No. 004 32930) in favor of his above-named children.&nbsp; Some of these Falsified documents are purported Affidavit of Seller/Transferor and Affidavit of Non-Tenancy, both dated August 20, 1996, without the signature of affiant, Fermin C. Gonzales, and that on that said date, Fermin C. Gonzales was already dead… ;<br><br>That on December 17, 1998, William S. Uy with deceit and evident intent to defraud undersigned, still accepted the amount of P340,000.00, from Atty. Fermin L. Gonzales, P300,000.00, in PNB Check No. 0000606, and P40,000.00, in cash, as full payment of the redemption of TCT No. 33122…knowing fully well that at that time the said TCT cannot be redeemed anymore because the same was already transferred in the name of his children;<br><br>That William S. Uy has appropriated the amount covered by the aforesaid check, as evidenced by the said check which was encashed by him…;<br><br>That inspite of repeated demands, both oral and in writing, William S. Uy refused and continue to refuse to deliver to him a TCT in the name of the undersigned or to return and repay the said P340,000.00, to the damage and prejudice of the undersigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </blockquote> With the execution of the letter-complaint, respondent violated his oath as a lawyer and grossly disregarded his duty to preserve the secrets of his client.&nbsp; Respondent unceremoniously turned against him just because he refused to grant respondent’s request for additional compensation.&nbsp; Respondent’s act tarnished his reputation and social standing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In compliance with this Court’s Resolution dated July 31, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> respondent filed his Comment narrating his version, as follows:<br><br>On December 17, 1998, he offered to redeem from complainant a 4.9 hectare-property situated in Brgy. Gonzales, Umingan, Pangasinan covered by TCT No. T-33122 which the latter acquired by purchase from his (respondent’s) son, the late Fermin C. Gonzales, Jr..&nbsp; On the same date, he paid complainant P340,000.00 and demanded the delivery of TCT No. T-33122 as well as the execution of the Deed of Redemption.&nbsp; Upon request, he gave complainant additional time to locate said title or until after Christmas to deliver the same and execute the Deed of Redemption.&nbsp; After the said period, he went to complainant’s office and demanded the delivery of the title and the execution of the Deed of Redemption.&nbsp; Instead, complainant gave him photocopies of TCT No. T-33122 and TCT No. T-5165.&nbsp; Complainant explained that he had already transferred the title of the property, covered by TCT No.T-5165 to his children Michael and Cristina Uy and that TCT No. T-5165 was misplaced and cannot be located despite efforts to locate it.&nbsp; Wanting to protect his interest over the property coupled with his desire to get hold of TCT No. T-5165 the earliest possible time, he offered his assistance <i>pro bono</i> to prepare a petition for lost title provided that all necessary expenses incident thereto including expenses for transportation and others, estimated at P20,000.00, will be shouldered by complainant.&nbsp; To these, complainant agreed.<br><br>On April 9, 1999, he submitted to complainant a draft of the petition for the lost title ready for signing and notarization.&nbsp; On April 14, 1999, he went to complainant’s office informing him that the petition is ready for filing and needs funds for expenses.&nbsp; Complainant who was with a client asked him to wait at the anteroom where he waited for almost two hours until he found out that complainant had already left without leaving any instructions nor funds for the filing of the petition.&nbsp; Complainant’s conduct infuriated him which prompted him to give a handwritten letter telling complainant that he is withdrawing the petition he prepared and that complainant should get another lawyer to file the petition.<br><br>Respondent maintains that the lawyer-client relationship between him and complainant was terminated when he gave the handwritten letter to complainant; that there was no longer any professional relationship between the two of them when he filed the letter-complaint for falsification of public document; that the facts and allegations contained in the letter-complaint for falsification were culled from public documents procured from the Office of the Register of Deeds in Tayug, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated October 18, 2000, the Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Commissioner Rebecca Villanueva-Maala ordered both parties to appear on April 2, 2003 before the IBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On said date, complainant did not appear despite due notice. There was no showing that respondent received the notice for that day’s hearing and so the hearing was reset to May 28, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On April 29, 2003, Commissioner Villanueva-Maala received a letter from one Atty. Augusto M. Macam dated April 24, 2003, stating that his client, William S. Uy, had lost interest in pursuing the complaint he filed against Atty. Gonzales and requesting that the case against Atty. Gonzales be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On June 2, 2003, Commissioner Villanueva-Maala submitted her report and recommendation, portions of which read as follows: <blockquote> The facts and evidence presented show that when respondent agreed to handle the filing of the Verified Petition for the loss of TCT No. T-5165, complainant had confided to respondent the fact of the loss and the circumstances attendant thereto.&nbsp; When respondent filed the Letter-Complaint to the Office of the Special Prosecutor in Tayug, Pangasinan, he violated Canon 21 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which expressly provides that “A lawyer shall preserve the confidences and secrets of his client even after the attorney-client relation is terminated.”&nbsp; Respondent cannot argue that there was no lawyer-client relationship between them when he filed the Letter-Complaint on 26 July 1999 considering that as early as 14 April 1999, or three (3) months after, respondent had already terminated complainant’s perceived lawyer-client relationship between them.&nbsp; The duty to maintain inviolate the client’s confidences and secrets is not temporary but permanent.&nbsp; It is in effect perpetual for “it outlasts the lawyer’s employment” (Canon 37, Code of Professional Responsibility) which means even after the relationship has been terminated, the duty to preserve the client’s confidences and secrets remains effective.&nbsp; Likewise Rule 21.02, Canon 21 of the Rules of Professional Responsibility provides that “A lawyer shall not, <b>to the disadvantage of his client</b>, use information acquired in the course of employment, nor shall he use the same to his own advantage or that of a third person, unless the client with the full knowledge of the circumstances consents thereto.”<br><br>On 29 April 2003, the Commission received a letter dated 24 April 2003 from Atty. Augusto M. Macam, who claims to represent complainant, William S. Uy, alleging that complainant is no longer interested in pursuing this case and requested that the same be dismissed.&nbsp; The aforesaid letter hardly deserves consideration as proceedings of this nature cannot be “<i>interrupted by reason of desistance, settlement, compromise, restitution, withdrawal of the charges, or failure of the complainant to prosecute the same.</i>&nbsp; (Section 5, Rule 139-B, Rules of Court).&nbsp; Moreover, in Boliver vs. Simbol, 16 SCRA 623, the Court ruled that “<i>any person may bring to this Court’s attention the misconduct of any lawyer, and action will usually be taken regardless of the interest or lack of interest of the complainant, if the facts proven so warrant.</i>”<br><br>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, we find respondent Atty. Fermin L. Gonzales to have violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and it is hereby recommended that he be <b>SUSPENDED</b> for a period of <b>SIX (6) MONTHS</b> from receipt hereof, from the practice of his profession as a lawyer and member of the Bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </blockquote> On June 21, 2003, the Board of Governors of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines issued Resolution No. XV-2003-365, thus: <blockquote> RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner of the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution/Decision as Annex “A”; and finding the recommendation fully supported by the evidence on record and applicable laws and rules, and considering that respondent violated Rule 21.02, Canon 21 of the Canons of Professional Responsibility, Atty. Fermin L. Gonzales is hereby <b>SUSPENDED</b> from the practice of law for six (6) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </blockquote> Preliminarily, we agree with Commissioner Villanueva-Maala that the manifestation of complainant Uy expressing his desire to dismiss the administrative complaint he filed against respondent, has no persuasive bearing in the present case.<br><br>Sec. 5, Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court states that: <blockquote> ….<br><br>No investigation shall be interrupted or terminated by reason of the desistance, settlement, compromise, restitution, withdrawal of the charges, or failure of the complainant to prosecute the same. </blockquote> This is because: <blockquote> A proceeding for suspension or disbarment is not in any sense a civil action where the complainant is a plaintiff and the respondent lawyer is a defendant.&nbsp; Disciplinary proceedings involve no private interest and afford no redress for private grievance.&nbsp; They are undertaken and prosecuted solely for the public welfare.&nbsp; They are undertaken for the purpose of preserving courts of justice from the official ministration of persons unfit to practice in them.&nbsp; The attorney is called to answer to the court for his conduct as an officer of the court.&nbsp; The complainant or the person who called the attention of the court to the attorney's alleged misconduct is in no sense a party, and has generally no interest in the outcome except as all good citizens may have in the proper administration of justice. Hence, if the evidence on record warrants, the respondent may be suspended or disbarred despite the desistance of complainant or his withdrawal of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </blockquote> Now to the merits of the complaint against the respondent.<br><br>Practice of law embraces any activity, in or out of court, which requires the application of law, as well as legal principles, practice or procedure and calls for legal knowledge, training and experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> While it is true that a lawyer may be disbarred or suspended for any misconduct, whether in his professional or private capacity, which shows him to be wanting in moral character, in honesty, probity and good demeanor or unworthy to continue as an officer of the court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> complainant failed to prove any of the circumstances enumerated above that would warrant the disbarment or suspension of herein respondent.<br><br>Notwithstanding respondent’s own perception on the matter, a scrutiny of the records reveals that the relationship between complainant and respondent stemmed from a personal transaction or dealings between them rather than the practice of law by respondent.&nbsp; Respondent dealt with complainant only because he redeemed a property which complainant had earlier purchased from his (complainant’s) son.&nbsp; It is not refuted that respondent paid complainant P340,000.00 and gave him ample time to produce its title and execute the Deed of Redemption.&nbsp; However, despite the period given to him, complainant failed to fulfill his end of the bargain because of the alleged loss of the title which he had admitted to respondent as having prematurely transferred to his children, thus prompting respondent to offer his assistance so as to secure the issuance of a new title to the property, in lieu of the lost one, with complainant assuming the expenses therefor.<br><br><i>As a rule, an attorney-client relationship is said to exist when a lawyer voluntarily permits or acquiesces with the consultation of a person, who in respect to a business or trouble of any kind, consults a lawyer with a view of obtaining professional advice or assistance.&nbsp; It is not essential that the client should have employed the attorney on any previous occasion or that any retainer should have been paid, promised or charged for, neither is it material that the attorney consulted did not afterward undertake the case about which the consultation was had, for as long as the advice and assistance of the attorney is sought and received, in matters pertinent to his profession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></i><br><br>Considering the attendant peculiar circumstances, said rule cannot apply to the present case.&nbsp; Evidently, the facts alleged in the complaint for “Estafa Through Falsification of Public Documents” filed by respondent against complainant were obtained by respondent due to his personal dealings with complainant. Respondent volunteered his service to hasten the issuance of the certificate of title of the land he has redeemed from complainant.&nbsp; Respondent’s immediate objective was to secure the title of the property that complainant had earlier bought from his son.&nbsp; Clearly, there was no attorney-client relationship between respondent and complainant.&nbsp; The preparation and the proposed filing of the petition was only incidental to their personal transaction.<br><br>Canon 21 of the Code of Professional Responsibility reads: <blockquote> Canon 21 – A LAWYER SHALL PRESERVE THE CONFIDENCE AND SECRETS OF HIS CLIENT EVEN AFTER THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATION IS TERMINATED.<br><br>Rule 21.01 – A lawyer shall not reveal the confidences or secrets of his client except: <blockquote> a) When authorized by the client after acquainting him of the consequences of the disclosure; <br>b) When required by law; <br>c) When necessary to collect his fees or to defend himself, his employees or associates or by judicial action. </blockquote></blockquote> The alleged “secrets” of complainant were not specified by him in his affidavit-complaint. Whatever facts alleged by respondent against complainant were not obtained by respondent in his professional capacity but as a redemptioner of a property originally owned by his deceased son and therefore, when respondent filed the complaint for estafa against herein complainant, which necessarily involved alleging facts that would constitute estafa, respondent was not, in any way, violating Canon 21.&nbsp; There is no way we can equate the filing of the affidavit-complaint against herein complainant to a misconduct that is wanting in moral character, in honesty, probity and good demeanor or that renders him unworthy to continue as an officer of the court.&nbsp; To hold otherwise would be precluding any lawyer from instituting a case against anyone to protect his personal or proprietary interests.<br><br>WHEREFORE, Resolution No. XV-2003-365 dated June 21, 2003 of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> and the administrative case filed against Atty. Fermin L. Gonzales, docketed as A.C.
