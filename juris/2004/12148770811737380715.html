				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Once again, the Court is confronted with the issue of the admissibility of an extrajudicial confession.&nbsp; This appeal particularly involves the question of whether a <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain who is a lawyer can be considered an independent counsel within the purview of Section 12, Article III of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>On December 17, 1996, the Cebu City Prosecutor filed an Information charging appellant with Murder, committed as follows:<blockquote>That on or about the 15th day of December, 1996, about 2:30 a.m., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, armed with a bladed instrument (tres cantos), with deliberate intent, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there suddenly and unexpectedly attack, assault and use personal violence upon one Jaquelyn Luchavez Tatoy, by stabbing her with said bladed instrument, hitting her on the vital parts of her body, thereby inflicting upon her physical injuries causing:<blockquote>“CARDIO RESPIRATORY ARREST DUE TO SHOCK &amp; HEMORRHAGE SEC. TO STAB WOUNDS TO THE TRUNK (POSTERIOR ASPECT)”</blockquote>as a consequence of which, Jaquelyn Luchavez Tatoy died almost instantaneously.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>On arraignment, appellant pleaded “not guilty” to the charge,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and trial thereafter ensued.<br><br>There were no eyewitnesses to the incident, and the prosecution’s evidence, aside from appellant’s extrajudicial confession, was mainly circumstantial.&nbsp;<br><br>As presented by the prosecution, the facts are as follows:<br><br>At around 11:00 in the evening of December 14, 1996, appellant Elizar Tomaquin @ Hapon, together with Rico and Romy Magdasal, Noel Labay, and a certain Cardo, were drinking “Red Horse” beer in Itom Yuta, Lorega, Cebu City.&nbsp; Appellant left the group&nbsp; at around&nbsp; 1:00 in the morning, saying he has a headache.&nbsp; At the behest of Rico Magdasal, the group transferred to Lorega proper.&nbsp; A few minutes later, they heard Rustica Isogan shouting for help as the latter heard Jaquelyn<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Tatoy, her goddaughter, asking for help.&nbsp; Isogan got two flashlights and they proceeded upstairs to Jaquelyn’s house.&nbsp; The first to go up was a certain Moises, followed by the brothers Rico and Romy Magdasal, while Noel and Cardo remained downstairs.&nbsp; Rico noticed that the hinge and the “walling” of the main door were damaged, as if it were kicked open, and only the light in the kitchen was turned on.&nbsp; Rico also saw a black shoe on the stairs and another in the <span style="font-style: italic;">sala</span>, which he claims belong to appellant.&nbsp; When they went into the kitchen, they saw Jaquelyn bloodied and sprawled face-up on the floor, with her head inside a plastic container.&nbsp; Jaquelyn was brought to the hospital, where she expired.&nbsp; A neighbor later found a <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> with blood on it by the stairs, which Rico also identified to be appellant’s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; A certain Rey got the black pair of shoes and <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> for safekeeping which were later turned over to Policeman Tariao of the Homicide Section, Ramos Police Station.&nbsp; The person who turned over the objects to Policeman Tariao was not identified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At around 12:00 in the afternoon of December 15, 1996, barangay tanods Julius Yosores and Armando Zabate of Lorega, Cebu City, searched for appellant because of the information given by Rico Magdasal that the shoes and <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> found in the scene of the crime belonged to appellant.&nbsp; Together with Rico, they went to the house of Wilson Magdasal where appellant was temporarily staying, and found him sleeping.&nbsp; Appellant was wearing a bloodstained <span style="font-style: italic;">maong</span> shorts.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">tanods</span> told appellant that he is a suspect in the killing of Jaquelyn, and brought him to the house of <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain Atty. Fortunato Parawan.&nbsp; There, appellant was asked about the shirt he was wearing and he told them that it was in Wilson Magdasal’s house.&nbsp; It was Edgar Magdasal who found his shirt, wet and bloodstained, among the soiled clothes.&nbsp; Atty. Parawan then told his tanods to take appellant to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the morning of the next day, December 16, 1996, appellant was investigated by SPO2 Mario Monilar of the Homicide Section, Ramos Police Station in Cebu City.&nbsp; After being apprised of his constitutional rights, appellant told SPO2 Monilar that he was willing to confess and asked for Atty. Parawan, the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain, to assist him. SPO2 Monilar called Atty. Parawan but the latter told him that he will be available in the afternoon.&nbsp; When Atty. Parawan arrived at 2:00 in the afternoon, he conferred with appellant for around fifteen minutes.&nbsp; Atty. Parawan then called SPO2 Monilar and told him that appellant was ready to give his statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant’s extrajudicial confession, which was taken down completely in the Cebuano dialect,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> reads:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: justify;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Pasiuna:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Mr. ELIZAR TOMAQUIN, pahibaloon ko ikaw nga ubos sa atong batakang balaod (Constitution) aduna kay katungod nga pahibaloon sa imong mga katungod, sama sa imong katungod sa pagpakahilum, ingon man duna kay katungod sa pagdamgop/pagpilig sa abogado o manlalaban aron motabang kanimo niining maong imbestighasyon nga may kalabutan sa kamatayon ni Jaqueline Tatoy niadtong mga alas 2:30 sa kaadlawon kapin kongkulang niadtong petsa 15 sa bulan sa Disyembra 1996, didto sa Brgy Lorega proper, Siyudad sa Sugbo.&nbsp; Kong ugaling dili ka maka-abot pagbayad o pagpangitago abogado aron motabang kanimo karon, ako isip negrepresenttar sa Estado mohatag akong abogado kanimo.&nbsp; Nasabtan ba kini nimo?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Tubag:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>OO, nasabtan ka ang akong katungod?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Pangutana:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Pahabloon ko usab ikaw nga sumala usab sa atong Batakang Balaod, anfg tanan nga imong isulti karon dinhi, mahimong magamit ebedensya pabor o batok kanimo sa bisan asaing husgado sa atong nasud.&nbsp; Nasabtan be usab kini nimo?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Tubag:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>OO, nasabtan ko usab kanang taan.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Pangutana:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Tinuod ba gayod nga nasabtan pag-ayo nimo anf mao nimong mga katungod ug anadam ka ba nga moperma karon dinhi timailhan sa imong tina-aw nga nga pagsabut? ingon man andam ka ba sa pagsulti sa matuod walay lain kon kili ang matuod lamang gayud?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Tubag:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>O</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Tubag:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oo, andam ako nga mpemar Sir ug ania karon dinhi ai Atty Parawan ang among Brgy Captain nga maoy akong giisip nga abogado nga akong pinili nga maoy motabang kanako karon.&nbsp; Aron sa pagmatuod, ako kining pirmahan ning ika petsa 16 sa bulan sa Disyembre 1996.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>. . .</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Pangutana:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Sunlion ko, andama bas a pagsulti sa matuod Elizar Tomaquin kon dili ang matuod lamang gayud?&nbsp; Ingon man andam ka ba nga modawat sa resulta o linugdangan niini?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Tubag:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oo, andam gyud ako.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Pangutana:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Palihog isulti ang imong ngalan inong man ang tanan nga circumstacia o rmay kalambigitan sa imong pagkatawo, sa imong grado, imong trabaho, imong pinuy-anan ug uban pa?</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Tubag:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Ako si Elizar Tomaquin kinsa nagdala sa bansagon o apelyedo sa akong mama sanglit dili man kasado and akong mama ug papa.&nbsp; Ang apelyedo sa akong papa, Cabagui ug and akon angga Hapon.&nbsp; Ako 19 anyos ang panuigon, ulitawo ug kasamtangan nga nagpuyo sa Brgy Lorega proper duol sa kapilaya San Roque apan ako lumad nga taga Bo.

His version of the incident is that it was Rico who committed the crime and not him.&nbsp; Appellant testified that Rico asked his help in stealing the television set from the Tatoy’s residence.&nbsp; When Jacquelyn saw them, she ran towards the kitchen but she did not reach it as Rico had stabbed her on the back with the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span>.&nbsp; Appellant claims that it was Rico who owns the tres cantos, as well as the pair of shoes, left inside Tatoy’s house.&nbsp; Afraid of what happened, appellant went home to Wilson Magdasal’s house and slept there.&nbsp; He was awakened the next morning by <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">tanod</span> Julius Yosores who kicked him.&nbsp; Yosores also boxed and poked a gun at him.&nbsp; Appellant claims that Rico and Edgar Magdasal maltreated him in the presence of <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain Atty. Fortunato Parawan when he was brought to the latter’s house. He was made to admit committing the crime because Rico has a family while he is single.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Appellant also repudiated his extrajudicial confession, saying that Atty. Parawan merely asked him to sign a blank sheet of paper and in exchange, Atty. Parawan promised to assist and help him with his expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (Branch 18) (RTC for brevity) rendered its decision on October 24, 1997, convicting appellant of the crime of Murder, to wit:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, accused Elizar Tomaquin is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and is hereby imposed the penalty of RECLUSION PERPERTUA, with the accessory penalties of the law; to indemnify the heirs of Jaquelyn Tatoy in the sum of <s>P</s>50,000.00 and to pay the costs.&nbsp; The accused is, however, credited in full during the whole period of his detention provided he will signify in writing that he will abide by all the rules and regulations of the penitentiary.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>In his Brief, appellant raises the following Assignment of Errors:<blockquote><ol><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN SHE (SIC) CONVICTED ACCUSED-APPELLANT BASED ON HIS UNCOUNSELLED CONFESSION;</li><br><li>THE TRIAL COURT LIKEWISE ERRED WHEN SHE (SIC) GAVE FULL CREDENCE AND FULL FAITH ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Appellant’s extrajudicial confession was taken and transcribed entirely in the Cebuano dialect.&nbsp; Rule 132, Section 33 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides:<blockquote>Sec. 33. <span style="font-style: italic;">Documentary evidence in an unofficial language</span>.-- Documents written in an unofficial language shall not be admitted as evidence, unless accompanied with a translation into English or Filipino.&nbsp; To avoid interruption of proceedings, parties or their attorneys are directed to have such translation prepared before trial.</blockquote>The rule is that when there is presented in evidence an exhibit written in any language other than the official language (Filipino or English), if there is an appeal, that exhibit should be translated by the official interpreter of the court, or a translation should be agreed upon by the parties, and both original and translation sent to this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there is no official translation of appellant’s extrajudicial confession in the Filipino or English language. If the Court were to strictly follow the rule, then appellant’s extrajudicial confession should not have been admitted by the trial court as evidence for the prosecution.<br><br>Nevertheless, considering that appellant did not interpose any objection thereto, and the parties and the judicial authorities or personnel concerned appeared to be familiar with or knowledgeable of Cebuano in which the document was written,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> such extrajudicial confession was appropriately considered by the trial court as evidence for the prosecution.<br><br>As stated at the outset, the crucial issue in this case is whether or not the extrajudicial confession executed by appellant, with the assistance of Atty. Fortunato Parawan, is admissible in evidence against him.&nbsp; There is no need at this point to secure an official translation of the confession to English.<br><br>Section 12, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides:<blockquote>(1) Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.&nbsp; If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.&nbsp; These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.</blockquote>The words “<span style="font-style: italic;">competent and independent counsel</span>” in the constitutional provision is not an empty rhetoric.&nbsp; It stresses the need to accord the accused, under the uniquely stressful conditions of a custodial investigation, an informed judgment on the choices explained to him by a diligent and capable lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As heretofore stated, Atty. Fortunato Parawan, at that time, was the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain of Barangay Lorega, Cebu City.&nbsp; Under the 1991 Local Government Code, a <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain performs the following duties and functions:<blockquote>(a)&nbsp; The punong barangay, as the chief executive of the barangay government, shall exercise such powers and perform such duties and functions, as provided by this Code and other laws.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; For efficient, effective and economical governance, the purpose of which is the general welfare of the barangay and its inhabitants pursuant to Section 16 of this Code, the punong barangay shall:<blockquote>(1)&nbsp; Enforce all laws and ordinances which are applicable within the barangay;<br><br>. . .<br><br>(3)&nbsp; Maintain public order in the barangay and, in pursuance thereof, assist the city or municipal mayor and the sanggunian members in the performance of their duties and functions;&nbsp; . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Simply put, Atty. Parawan, as <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain, is called upon to enforce the law and ordinances in his <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> and ensure peace and order at all times.<br><br>In fact, as <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain, Atty. Parawan is deemed a person in authority under Article 152 of the Revised Penal Code, to wit:<blockquote>ART. 152.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Persons in authority and agents of persons in authority</span>. – <span style="font-style: italic;">Who shall be deemed as such</span>. – In applying the provisions of the preceding and other articles of this Code, any person directly vested with jurisdiction, whether as an individual or as a member of some court or government corporation, board, or commission, shall be deemed a person in authority.&nbsp; A barrio captain and a barangay chairman shall also be deemed a person in authority.</blockquote>On these bases, it is not legally possible to consider Atty. Parawan as an independent counsel of appellant.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Culala</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court reiterated the rule that a municipal attorney cannot be an independent counsel because as a legal officer of the municipality, he provides legal assistance and support to the mayor and the municipality in carrying out the delivery of basic services to the people, <span style="font-style: italic;">including the maintenance of peace and order</span>, and it was seriously doubted whether he can effectively undertake the defense of the accused without running into conflict of interests.&nbsp; Thus, the Court held that he is no better than a fiscal or a prosecutor who cannot represent the accused during custodial investigations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>This is reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Taliman</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Velarde</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> where we further ruled that a municipal mayor cannot likewise be an independent counsel as required by the Constitution.<br><br>Similarly in this case, considering that Atty. Parawan’s role as a <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain, was a peacekeeping officer of his <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> and therefore in direct conflict with the role of providing competent legal assistance to appellant who was accused of committing a crime in his jurisdiction, Atty. Parawan could not be considered as an independent counsel of appellant, when the latter executed his extrajudicial confession.&nbsp; What the Constitution requires is the presence of an independent and competent counsel, one who will effectively undertake his client’s defense without any intervening conflict of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Neither does Atty. Parawan qualify as a competent counsel, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., an effective and vigilant counsel.&nbsp; An “effective and vigilant counsel” necessarily and logically requires that the lawyer be present and able to advise and assist his client from the time the confessant answers the first question asked by the investigating officer until the signing of the extrajudicial confession.&nbsp; As held in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Velarde</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><blockquote>. . .&nbsp; The competent and independent lawyer so engaged should be present at all stages of the interview, <span style="font-style: italic;">counseling or advising caution reasonably at every turn of the investigation, and stopping the interrogation once in a while either to give advice to the accused that he may either continue, choose to remain silent or terminate the interview</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, the lawyer should ascertain that the confession is made voluntarily and that the person under investigation fully understands the nature and the consequence of his extrajudicial confession in relation to his constitutional rights.&nbsp; A contrary rule would undoubtedly be antagonistic to the constitutional rights to remain silent, to counsel and to be presumed innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The assistance rendered by Atty.

Parawan could have effectively safeguarded appellant’s rights as an accused during the investigation when he himself entertained the suspicion that appellant is guilty of the crime charged, and naturally, he would want appellant to admit having committed it.<br><br>It was posited that appellant cannot challenge Atty. Parawan’s qualification as a competent and independent counsel because he was his choice.<br><br>As provided in Section 12, Article III of the 1987 Constitution, “(A)ny person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right … to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.&nbsp; Ideally, the lawyer called to be present during such investigations should be as far as reasonably possible, the choice of the individual undergoing questioning, but the word "preferably" does not convey the message that the choice of a lawyer by a person under investigation is exclusive as to preclude other equally competent and independent attorneys from handling his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; What is imperative is that the counsel should be <span style="font-style: italic;">competent and independent</span>.&nbsp; That appellant chose Atty. Parawan does not estop appellant from complaining about the latter’s failure to safeguard his rights.<br><br>It appears that appellant chose Atty. Parawan because he was the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> captain of Brgy. Lorega where appellant resides, and apparently, appellant trusts Atty. Parawan to protect his rights.&nbsp; The latter, however, fell short in tending to the trust reposed on him.&nbsp; Appellant did not finish Grade 1 and does not know how to read &nbsp;and &nbsp;write.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As between him and Atty. Parawan who presumably knows the intricacies of the law and appellant’s predicament, Atty. Parawan should have known better and exercised his sound judgment before conceding to appellant’s choice.&nbsp; But it did not occur to him to inhibit himself from acting as appellant’s counsel and instead, he even let appellant go through the investigation and execute the extrajudicial confession knowing fully well that he was biased as regards appellant’s innocence.&nbsp; Quoted verbatim, Atty.

Parawan failed to meet the exacting standards of an <span style="font-style: italic;">independent</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">competent</span> counsel as required by the Constitution.&nbsp; Thus, the extrajudicial confession executed by appellant, even if gospel truth, is deemed an uncounselled confession and therefore, inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>In this regard, it may not be amiss to repeat the declaration of the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Deniega</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> stressing the role of the courts in ascertaining that extrajudicial confessions meet the exacting standards of the Constitution:<blockquote>Every so often, courts are confronted with the difficult task of taking a hard look into the sufficiency of extra-judicial confessions extracted by law enforcement authorities as the sole basis for convicting accused individuals. In cases of crimes notable for their brutality and ruthlessness, the impulse to find the culprits at any cost occasionally tempts these agencies to take shortcuts and disregard constitutional and legal safeguards intended to bring about a reasonable assurance that only the guilty are punished. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our courts, in the process of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt, play a central role in bringing about this assurance by determining whether or not the evidence gathered by law enforcement agencies scrupulously meets exacting standards fixed by the Constitution. If the standards are not met, the Constitution provides the corresponding remedy by providing a strict exclusionary rule, i.e., that "[a]ny confession or admission obtained in violation of (Article III, Section 12(1) . . . hereof shall be inadmissible in evidence."</span></blockquote>Without appellant’s extrajudicial confession, the prosecution’s case now teeters precariously on circumstantial evidence, namely:<blockquote><ol><li>Rico Magdasal’s testimony that:</li><br><ol type="A"><li>appellant left their drinking session at 1:00&nbsp; in the morning of December 16, 1996;</li><br><li>the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> and pair of shoes found inside Jaquelyn’s residence belongs to appellant; and</li><br><li>appellant was wearing a pair of <span style="font-style: italic;">maong</span> shorts and white <span style="font-style: italic;">sando</span> shirt on the night of the crime, which blood-stained shirt was found among the soiled clothes in Wilson Magdasal’s house;</li><br></ol><li>Medical Technologist Jude Daniel Mendoza’s testimony that the blood stains on appellant’s <span style="font-style: italic;">sando</span> shirt and the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> was of human origin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>These circumstances, however, are not sufficient to demonstrate positively and convincingly that it was appellant who killed Jaquelyn.<br><br>Under Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court, circumstantial evidence would be sufficient to convict if (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; As jurisprudentially formulated, a judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence can be upheld only if the circumstances proven constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person, i.e., the circumstances proven must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with any other hypothesis except that of guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The circumstantial evidence in this case does not constitute an unbroken chain leading to one fair and reasonable conclusion that appellant is the guilty person.<br><br>For one, appellant’s act of leaving the drinking session at 1:00 in the morning does not establish appellant’s whereabouts at the time the crime was committed.&nbsp; There is nothing in the testimony of Rico Magdasal and the other prosecution witnesses that will show if appellant indeed went to Jaquelyn’s house after he left the group.&nbsp; No one saw him enter or leave her residence.&nbsp; If at all, what was proved is that appellant was found by the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay tanods</span> sleeping at home in the afternoon of the same day.<br><br>Added to that is the prosecution’s failure to establish the chain of custody of these valuable pieces of evidence.<br><br>Prosecution witness Armando Zabate testified that the pair of black shoes and <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> were given to a certain Rey for safekeeping.&nbsp; These were later turned over to a Policeman Tariao of the Ramos Police Station.&nbsp; Zabate, however, did not identify the person who turned over the objects to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; There was no showing who turned over those articles to the police and Rey was not presented to identify if these were the same pair of shoes and <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> found in Jaquelyn’s house and turned over to the police.&nbsp; Policeman Tariao was not called to the witness stand so as to confirm if those articles were the same evidence turned over to him and later presented in court.&nbsp; Ordinarily, it would not be indispensable for the prosecution to allege and prove every single fact of the case.&nbsp; But in this case, the pieces of evidence are crucial to the prosecution’s case.&nbsp; Also, the fact that a civilian obtained and received the evidence, the possibility that the integrity of these articles could have been compromised cannot be ignored.&nbsp; The Court even noted that during his direct examination, SPO2 Monilar was confused as to whether the pair of shoes presented in court was the same ones that were turned over to the police.&nbsp; It turned out that the marking he made on the shoes were washed off because at one time, the shoes fell in the canal located in front of the police station and they had to clean and wash the shoes!<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Such sloppy handling renders the chain of custody of those pieces of evidence dubious, and damaging to the prosecution’s case.<br><br>And even if appellant did own the pair of shoes and <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span>, the fact that it was found in the scene of the crime merely proved that he was in the residence of Jaquelyn at some point in time.&nbsp; But it does not prove when particularly he was there, his authorship of the crime or his motive for being there.&nbsp; While the motive of an accused in a criminal case is generally held to be immaterial, not being an element of the crime, motive becomes important when, as in this case, the evidence of the commission of the crime is purely circumstantial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The prosecution’s evidence that is perceived to be conclusive of appellant’s guilt is mainly the testimony of Rico Magdasal.&nbsp; Such testimony, however, is uncorroborated.&nbsp; The rule is that the testimony of one witness is sufficient to sustain a conviction, <span style="font-weight: bold;">if such testimony positively establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the doctrine of long standing that the testimony of a lone witness, if credible and positive, is sufficient to convict an accused <span style="font-weight: bold;">applies only to eyewitnesses</span>.&nbsp; Thus, an uncorroborated circumstantial evidence is certainly not sufficient for conviction when the evidence itself is in serious doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rico’s lone testimony is not sufficient to establish appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In addition, appellant vehemently denied Rico’s allegations.&nbsp; According to appellant, it was Rico who actually owns the pair of shoes and <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span>; that it was he who bid appellant to go to the Tatoys’ residence and lift their TV set; and that it was Rico who stabbed Jaquelyn.&nbsp; Considering appellant’s denial and his different version of the incident, it became incumbent upon the prosecution to rebut appellant's allegations with further evidence to corroborate the statement of Rico.&nbsp; It must be noted that there were other persons present during their drinking spree, namely, Romy Magdasal, Noel Labay, and a certain Cardo.&nbsp; These persons could have been presented as witnesses to back up Rico’s claim but the prosecution did not do so.&nbsp; Rico testified that appellant owned the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> found by the stairs;&nbsp; but Rico also stated he only “heard” that the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> was found by the stairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Who found the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> that was supposed to have been used to stab Jaquelyn?&nbsp; The neighbor who allegedly found it by the stairs was not presented in court to identify if the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span> presented by the prosecution was the alleged weapon in the stabbing of Jaquelyn.&nbsp; Such failure of the prosecution to corroborate the material points of Rico’s testimony weakened their case.<br><br>The Court also has serious misgivings on the probative value of the white <span style="font-style: italic;">sando</span> shirt that appellant was allegedly wearing at the time of stabbing Jaquelyn, which Edgar Magdasal later found bloodstained among the soiled clothes.<br><br>First, when appellant was asked by the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay tanods</span> about the shirt he was wearing, he told them that it was in Wilson Magdasal’s house.&nbsp; According to <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay tanod</span> Armando Zabate, it was Edgar Magdasal who found the shirt, “somewhat wet and bloody,” among the soiled clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Edgar Magdasal, however, was not presented to testify as to where he found the shirt, the state the shirt was in when he found it, and how he knew that it was the shirt worn by appellant.<br><br>Second, Medical Technologist Jude Daniel Mendoza testified that the bloodstains on appellant’s <span style="font-style: italic;">sando</span> shirt, as well as the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span>, were human blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Mendoza, however, did not conduct further tests to ascertain the type of blood found on these pieces of evidence nor did he match it with the victim’s blood type,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> hence, it does not connect the bloodstains to the herein victim.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Rodriguez</span>, the Court ruled that the <span style="font-style: italic;">maong</span> pants allegedly belonging to appellant and found positive of type O blood has no probative value since the blood type of appellant and the victim were not taken for purposes of comparison.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The same ruling applies with regard to the bloodstains found on the <span style="font-style: italic;">tres cantos</span>.<br><br>Appellant enjoys in his favor the presumption of innocence until the contrary is proven.&nbsp; Proof of the guilt of the accused should not be tainted with ambiguity.&nbsp; Although appellant’s defense is weak, conviction must come from the strength of the prosecution's evidence and not from the weakness of the defense.&nbsp;
