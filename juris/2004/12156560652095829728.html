Guanio upheld Alusitain’s position in this wise:<blockquote>After carefully considering the respective submissions of the parties and the evidence they adduced in support of their opposing claims, this Office rules in favor of the complainant.<br><br>To substantiate his allegation that he had continued working for the respondents even after his supposed resignation on February 19, 1991, the complainant submitted in evidence his sworn statement and that of his eldest daughter, Gloria Alusitain.&nbsp; In his affidavit, the complainant swore that: “Bagamat ako ay pensionado ng SSS, ako ay patuloy na naglilingkod/nagtratrabaho sa kompanya ng Rufina Patis Factory hanggang noong buwan ng Enero 1995.”&nbsp; By way of corroboration, his daughter on the other hand, stated under oath that since elementary school (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>), she was the one who brought food to her father at work in the Rufina Patis Factory; and that the last time she brought him food at the said factory was in the month of January 1995.<br><br>While the foregoing statements may appear to be self-serving, still they have the ring of truth.&nbsp; From experience, it is quite common that the eldest daughter would be tasked with the duty of taking lunch to her father at work.&nbsp; Besides, the respondents failed to controvert these sworn declarations by submitting their counter-affidavits.&nbsp; If it is true that the complainant had in fact stopped working on February 1991, the respondents could have produced a number of witnesses who could have attested to this.&nbsp; Hence, their failure to submit even a single affidavit does not speak well of their credibility in this regard.<br><br>Thus, this Office finds that the complainant had executed the letter of resignation and affidavit of separation from employment in 1991 only for the purpose of securing a pension from the SSS, but that despite this he remained in the employ of the respondents until his actual retirement on January 31, 1995, two years after the effectivity of Republic Act 7641 on January 7, 1993.&nbsp; At the time of his retirement, the complainant was already sixty-five (65) years of age and had served the respondent company for forty-seven (47) years and therefore, he is legally entitled to the retirement benefits granted by R.A. 7641 which is one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service which as computed will amount to a total of <s>P</s>88,595.00 (<s>P</s>1,885.00 x 47 years).<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the respondents “Rufina Patis Factory” and Jesus Lucas, Sr., jointly and severally to pay complainant Juan Alusitain his retirement benefits in the amount of <s>P</s>88,595.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>On appeal, the NLRC, by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of May 17, 1999, affirmed the Labor Arbiter’s decision.<br><br>Aggrieved by the NLRC resolution, petitioners brought the case on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to the Court of Appeals which, by the assailed decision, dismissed it, holding that the NLRC committed no error much less any grave abuse of discretion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> as Alusitain was able to sufficiently establish that his letter of resignation and Affidavit of Separation were executed only for the purpose of securing a pension from the SSS and that he remained in the employ of petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Their motion for reconsideration having been denied by the Court of Appeals by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of December 6, 2000, petitioners lodged the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioners argue that the appellate court erred when it did not give weight and probative value to Alusitain’s letter of resignation and Affidavit of Separation, choosing instead to give credence to his self-serving sworn statement and that of his daughter that he remained in the employ of petitioners until January 31, 1995.<br><br>Petitioners assert that the Affidavit of Separation, being a public document, is entitled to full faith and credit upon its face, and proof is required to assail and controvert the same, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Cacho v.

Zaballero</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is instructive.&nbsp; In said case, the creditor executed on December 1, 1944 a notarial document stating that he was releasing a real estate mortgage as the debtor had already paid his debt.&nbsp; On even date, the creditor subsequently executed an affidavit without the debtor’s knowledge stating that he had accepted the payment under protest and “<span style="font-style: italic;">obligado por las circunstancias actuales</span>.” This Court held that the creditor’s statement in his affidavit that he received the money “<span style="font-style: italic;">obligado por las circunstancias actuales</span>” is self-serving evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>A contrary rule would undermine the confidence of the public in the integrity of notarial documents.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Dequito v. Llamas</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court held:<blockquote>After executing the affidavit voluntarily wherein he made admissions and declarations against his own interest under the solemnity of an oath, he cannot be allowed to spurn them and undo what he has done. He cannot, even “with great repentance, retrieve the body he forsook and now wishes to live.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote>Neither is the sworn statement of Alusitain’s daughter sufficient to prove that he indeed retired on January 31, 1995.&nbsp; The February 6, 1997 Decision of Labor Arbiter Guanio relates the material portion of the sworn statement of Alusitain’s daughter as follows:<blockquote>. . . By way of corroboration, his daughter on the other hand, stated under oath that since elementary school (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>), she was the one who brought food to her father at work in the Rufina Patis Factory; <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">and that the last time she brought him food at the said factory was in the month of January 1995</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Alusitain’s daughter did not state, however, that her father worked for petitioner Rufina Patis Factory until his alleged retirement on January 31, 1995.&nbsp; All she said was that the last time she brought him food at the factory was in January 1995.&nbsp; To conclude that Alusitain was still employed on January 1995 from the mere fact that his daughter brought him food at the Rufina Patis Factory is <span style="font-style: italic;">non sequitur</span>.<br><br>Lastly, while it is evident that Alusitain’s subsequent sworn statement is in the nature of a retraction of his May 22, 1991 Affidavit of Separation, such retraction does not necessarily negate the affidavit.&nbsp; For retractions are generally unreliable and looked upon with considerable disfavor by the courts as they can easily be fabricated.&nbsp; Thus, before accepting a retraction, it is necessary to examine the circumstances surrounding it and possible motives for reversing the previous declaration, as these motives may not necessarily be in consonance with the truth.&nbsp; To automatically adopt them hook, line and sinker would allow unscrupulous individuals to throw wide open the doors to fraud.<br><br>In the case at bar, Alusitain’s retraction is highly suspect.&nbsp; Other than his bare and self-serving allegations and the sworn statement of his daughter which, as reflected above, cannot be relied upon, he has not shown any scintilla of evidence that he was employed with petitioner Rufina Patis Factory at the time R.A. 7641 took effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not produce any documentary evidence such as pay slips, income tax return, his identification card, or any other independent evidence to substantiate his claim.<br><br>While the NLRC and its Labor Arbiters are not bound by technical rules of procedure and evidence in the adjudication of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> this should not be construed as a license to disregard fundamental rules on evidence in proving one’s allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In fine, Alusitain having failed to prove that he was an employee of petitioner at the time R.A. 7641 took effect, his claim for retirement benefits thereunder must be disallowed.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals June 23, 2000 Decision and December 6, 2000 Resolution in CA-G.R.

Drilon</span> (179 SCRA 175, 181-182 [1989]) where this Court had interpreted Art. 287 of the Labor Code as not being a source of retirement benefits if there was no collective bargaining agreement or voluntary company policy granting such benefit.&nbsp; Thus, this Court through Justice Florentino Feliciano said:<br><br>Our Labor Code has only one article that deals with the subject of “retirement from the service.” Article 287 of the Code reads as follows:<br><br>Article 287.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Retirement</span>.&nbsp; – Any employee may be retired upon reaching the retirement age established in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Collective Bargaining Agreement or other applicable employment contract</span>.<br><br>In case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned <span style="font-style: italic;">under existing laws</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">any collective bargaining or other agreement</span>.&nbsp; (Italics in the original)<br><br>Examination of Article 287 above shows that entitlement to retirement benefits may accrue either (a) under existing laws or (b) under a collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract. It is at once apparent that Article 287 does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> itself purport to impose any <span style="font-style: italic;">obligation</span> upon employers to set up <span style="font-style: italic;">a retirement scheme</span> for their employees <span style="font-style: italic;">over and above that already established under existing laws</span>.&nbsp; In other words, Article 287 recognizes that existing laws already provide for a scheme by which retirement benefits may be earned or accrue in favor of employees, as part of a broader social security system that provides not only for retirement benefits but also death and funeral benefits, permanent disability benefits, sickness benefits and maternity leave benefits.&nbsp; As is commonplace knowledge, the Social Security Act provides for retirement benefits which essentially consist of the right to receive a monthly pension for the rest of the covered employee’s life provided that: (1) such employee had paid at least one hundred twenty (120) monthly contributions prior to retirement; and (2) has reached the age of sixty (60) years (if his salary is less than <s>P</s>300.00 a month) or 65 years.&nbsp; The retirement scheme here established is <span style="font-style: italic;">compulsory</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">contributory</span> in character on the part of both the employer and the employee, backed up by criminal sanctions and administered by a large and elaborate bureaucracy.&nbsp; (Italics in the original; citation omitted<br><br>In order to overturn the effect of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Llora Motors</span> ruling, House Bill No. 317 was introduced in the House of Representatives which was later consolidated with the Senate version – Senate Bill No. 132.&nbsp; Representative Alberto S. Veloso states the following in his House Bill’s explanatory note:<br><br>When the Labor Code came into effect in 1974, retirement pay had, as a matter of course, been granted to employees in the private sector when they reach the age of sixty (60) years.&nbsp; This had practically been the rule observed by employers in the country pursuant to the rules and regulations issued by the then Minister of Labor and Employment to implement the provisions of the Labor Code, more particularly, where there is no provision for the same in the collective bargaining agreement or retirement plan of the establishment.<br><br>At present, however, such benefit of retirement pay is no longer available where there is no collective agreement thereon or any retirement plan at all.&nbsp; This is so because, in a decision of the Supreme Court (<span style="font-style: italic;">Llora Motors vs. Drilon and NLRC, et al</span>., G.R. No. 82895, November 7, 1989), it was held that the grant of such benefit under the rules implementing the Labor Code is not supported by any express provision of the Labor Code itself.&nbsp; In short, there is no specific statutory basis for the grant of retirement benefits for employees in the private sector reaching the age of 60 years.<br><br>Since the time of such nullification by the Supreme Court of said implementing rules on retirement pay for private sector employees, many employers simply refuse or neglect to adopt any retirement plan for their workers, obviously emboldened by the thought that, after said ruling, there is no longer any legal compulsion to grant such retirement benefits. In our continuous quest to promote social justice, unfair situations like this, productive of grievance or irritants in the labor-management relations, must immediately be corrected or remedied by legislation.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">J.V.
