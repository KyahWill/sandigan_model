				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In rape, the “sweetheart” defense must be proven by compelling evidence: <i>first,</i> that the accused and the victim were lovers; and, second, that she consented to the alleged sexual relations. The <i>second </i>is as important as the first, because this Court has held often enough that love is not a license for lust.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>Sonny Bautista y Lacanilao appeals the September 13, 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila (Branch 26) in Criminal Case No. 96-148248, finding him guilty of rape. The dispositive part of the Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court finds accused SONNY BAUTISTA y LACANILAO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt [of] the crime of Rape under Article 335 of the Revised [P]enal Code of the Philippines, as charged in the information. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with all the accessory penalties provided by law; to indemnify the private complainant Mischel Amparo the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos by way of moral damages; and to pay the costs of this suit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated March 14, 1996, charged appellant in these words:<br><blockquote>“That on or about March 8, 1996, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously by means of force, violence and intimidation, to wit: by then and there forcibly carrying her and lying her in bed, placing himself on top of her and kissing and embracing her tightly, and when said complainant is resisting and pushing him away from her, said accused punched her thighs, remov[ed] her clothes and panty and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her against her will and consent.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Upon his arraignment on April 16, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> appellant, assisted by his counsel <i>de oficio,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> pleaded not guilty. After trial in due course, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered the assailed Decision.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Version of the Prosecution</span><br></div><br>In its Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution’s version of the facts in the following manner:<br><blockquote>“On March 8, 1996, appellant Sonny Bautista went to the house of Mischel Amparo at Bagong Silang, Quezon City. Mischel, who was fifteen <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> years old and in her third year in high school, knew appellant very well. He is the godchild by marriage of her parents and had previously rented a room in their house for a year. Appellant’s wife Analisa Sagot and Mischel’s mother, Crispina Amparo, were the best of friends and both worked as janitresses at Paz Manpower Agency. Thus, Crispina had readily agreed to Analisa’s request for the newly-wed couple to stay at their house.<br><br>“The bond between the two (2) women had drawn appellant and the Amparo family closer. Appellant, who worked as a taxi driver, was like a son to them. Mischel and her siblings addressed him as ‘Kuya Sonny.’<br><br>“Appellant pleaded [with] Mischel to skip her classes and to go with him and his wife to a supposed field trip in Cavite. Having complete trust [i]n him as a family friend and remembering the couple’s acts of kindness such as giving food to her family, Mischel agreed to go with him although she still had a class at 12:00 noon.<br><br>“Appellant told Mischel that they would fetch his wife in Sta. Mesa before going to Cavite. They boarded a bus going to Cubao. From Cubao, they took a jeep bound for Sta. Mesa. When they arrived in Sta. Mesa, Mischel asked appellant regarding her ‘Ate Ana.’ Appellant replied that since she had yet to arrive with her co-employees, they should just pass time at the SM Centerpoint. When they arrived at the    mall at 2:00 p.m., appellant invited her to see a movie. Without thinking that he just might be deceiving her, Mischel went along.<br><br>“While watching the film, appellant muttered to Mischel that his wife was domineering. She would get quarrelsome over small matters and would be very angry if he could not give her seven hundred pesos (P700.00) a week. He likewise told her that his sister had been behaving strangely. She once took a bath while exposed to appellant and had once taken off her clothes in front of him. Appellant then remarked that Mischel should do the same. Mischel advised him to understand his wife and then inquired if they could go to ‘Ate Ana.’ He replied that his wife would arrive at 4:30 p.m.<br><br>“Before the film was finished, appellant and Mischel went out of the mall. She asked him again if they could go to her ‘Ate Ana.’ Appellant answered that they were going to fetch her. He hailed a taxi and invited her to board it. Thinking that they were indeed going to meet appellant’s wife, Mischel boarded the taxi although she had no specific idea where they were heading.<br><br>“When the taxi had reached Town and Country Motel, appellant told the young girl that they were going to wait for her ‘Ate Ana’ in a room in the motel. She had no idea that the place they were in was a motel.<br><br>“Inside the room, appellant told Mischel that he had to take a bath since Cavite was quite far. Mischel believed him. However, she was surprised when appellant told her that she should take a bath as well. She refused. Whereupon, appellant threatened to leave her. He then urged Mischel to take a bath since there was no water in the place they were going.<br><br>“A male attendant went to the room and handed two (2) shampoo sachets to appellant. He took a bath. Not knowing what to do, Mischel meanwhile sat on a chair.<br><br>“Appellant went out of the bathroom and again told Mischel to take a bath. Again, she refused. This enraged appellant. His display of wrath unnerved Mischel. He held her hand and pushed her inside the bathroom, forcing her into taking a short bath.<br><br>“A few minutes later, she emerged from the bathroom. Appellant suddenly carried her to the bed and poured kisses on her neck. He removed the towel covering his waist, leaving him completely naked.<br><br>“Mischel resisted appellant fiercely. She slapped him on the face four (4) times. But appellant, who is bigger and taller, returned each slap with fist blows on the young girl’s left thigh. She felt her strength drain away.<br><br>“Although she tried to push appellant away and free herself, appellant nevertheless proceeded to undress Mischel methodically. First, he took off her T-shirt and her skirt. Next, he stripped of[f] her bra and then finally removed her panty.<br><br>“The young girl was now lying naked with her back on the bed. Appellant, equally bare, knelt on the bed. He forced Mischel to part her legs. Appellant went away quickly to wet his fingers. When he returned, he drove his wet finger into Mischel’s vagina. She felt pain.<br><br>“After a while, appellant mounted Mischel. He spread her legs open and tried to insert his penis into her vagina. Mischel continued to struggle with her remaining strength so that appellant failed to penetrate her sexually.<br><br>“Appellant decided to change Mischel’s position. By kicking the young girl, he let her know    that he wanted her to assume a prone position (‘pinatuwad’) in the bed. In that position, appellant parted Mischel’s legs and then plunged his penis into her vagina. This time, the penetration was successful. The pain felt by Mischel weakened her further. Fear gripped her as her genitals bled.<br><br>“After abusing Mischel in such position for fifteen minutes, appellant stood up and took a piece of cloth. He tied up her hands and legs. Mischel sat on the bed. Appellant then told her that he would kill her and her family. In sheer terror, Mischel pleaded to him, ‘huwag mo akong papatayin, hindi ako magsusumbong kahit kanino.’<br><br>“Appellant untied Mischel. He told her that they were going home. Appellant left the room and paid the bill. Mischel put back her clothes and went out of the room after thirty (30) minutes. She saw appellant waiting at the gate of the motel. They boarded a jeep going to Cubao. Upon arrival, appellant left her. She went home.<br><br>“When Mischel arrived at their home around 11:30 p.m., Crispina noticed her tears. She asked her what happened. Unable to contain herself, she blurted out that she was raped by appellant.     Crispina cried and looked at the panty of her daughter. She saw blood. Mother and daughter went to the barangay hall for assistance. With the help of the Quezon City Police, appellant was apprehended in his house in Sta. Ana on the same night.<br><br>“Mischel was examined by Dr. Maximo Reyes, a medical-legal officer of the NBI, on March 9, 1996. He found a kiss mark on the neck of the    victim and contusions on her left thigh. He opined that the bruises could be caused by a bare hand which forcefully hit the victim. He also concluded that the laceration on the hymen of Mischel was caused by a fully-erect penis. The medical report he issued reads:<br><br>‘March 11, 1996<br><br>PRELIMINARY REPORT<br><br>To Whom It May Concern:<br><blockquote>This is to certify that Dr. Maximo L. Reyes, NBI Medico-Legal Officer, conducted a medico-genital examination on Mischel Amparo y Amparado, 15 yrs. old, single, of Gen. De Dios Ext., Purok 4 Bgy. Bagong Silang, Q.C. on March 9, 1996 with the hereunder findings:<br><ol type="1"><li> Extragenital physical injuries present<br><br></li><li> Healing complete hymenal laceration, present.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Version of the Defense</span><br></div><br>Appellant does not deny that he had sexual intercourse with the victim who, he claims, had consented to it; hence, no rape was committed. His version of the incident is as follows:<br><blockquote>“x x x [T]he accused fetched the victim from her house on March 8, 1996 at around 11:00 or 12:00 [noon] in order to watch a movie. The victim’s parent[s] disapproved but [she still] went with him. They went to the SM Centerpoint in Sta. Mesa, Manila and they arrived thereat at around 2:00 p.m. Inside the movie house, the accused placed his arm around the shoulder of the victim, and he kissed her twice on the lips and cheeks. She got mad, since she was concentrating in watching the movie and he was disturbing her. The accused kept quiet and also focused his attention on the movie. They left the movie house at around 4:00 or 4:30 P.M. They boarded a taxi and proceeded to Anito Lounge, but they were not    admitted since the victim looked very young, hence, they proceeded to Town and Country located at V. Mapa. Upon arriving thereat, they paid the fare and the accused called the room boy. [T]he accused went up first and the victim followed. They entered Room No. 48. The ac[c]used took a bath while the victim watched T.V. After taking a bath, he asked the victim, if she wanted to take a bath and the latter replied ‘yes.’ Since there was no shampoo, he requested for one and the roomboy gave him the shampoo which he in turn gave to the victim. The victim took a bath. Afterwards, she went out of the bathroom wearing only a T-shirt and towel wrapped around her waist. She sat beside the accused. The accused started kissing the victim and the latter did not get angry. He removed her T-shirt and started kissing her breast, and she did not get angry. He continued kissing her on the lips and she felt tickled. He removed her panty and she did not object, but said that the mother might know about it and get angry, but he told her that if she really love[d] him, they alone [would] be responsible. He placed himself on top of her and she felt pain after which he removed himself from her. The victim told him that her mother might learn about it and the latter might kill her. He in turn replied that she should not worry, since he will take the responsibility. The victim embraced him and he kissed her on the forehead. They dressed up and the accused paid at the counter. They walked towards the corner of Sta. Mesa and boarded a jeepney going to Cubao. Upon reaching the said place, he gave the victim P50.00 for her transportation and his telephone number. He even accompanied her in boarding a bus bound for Fairview. The accused went home to Sta. Ana where he ate and slept. At around 3:00 A.M., someone knocked at the door. There were policemen who pointed a .45 caliber gun at him and handcuffed him. He was taken to police precinct No. 6 in Quezon City. His wife visited him and informed him that the victim’s parents came to know about it and mauled the victim to admit where she came from and who her companion [was]. The accused denied that he forced the victim as she actually agreed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>The trial court ruled that appellant had employed deception as well as force and intimidation upon the victim, in order to consummate his libidinous desire. It was convinced that appellant -- on the pretext that he had been sent by his wife to fetch the victim for an excursion -- inveigled the girl to a motel, where he forced himself upon her. The lower court was impressed by the straightforward, positive and convincing testimony of the victim.<br><br>The court <i>a quo</i> likewise ruled that her credibility was enhanced by 1) the fact that she had immediately reported the incident to her mother; 2) there was no showing of any motive on the part of the girl to testify falsely against the accused; and 3) the medicolegal report indicated contusions on her body and the laceration of her hymen.<br><br>On the other hand, it discarded the sweetheart defense of appellant for its intrinsic weakness and lack of corroboration.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In his Brief, appellant raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><br><center><br>“I.<br></center><blockquote>The court a quo gravely erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br><center><br>“II.<br></center><br>The court a quo gravely erred in not giving weight and credence to the evidence for the defense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The issues boil down to whether the prosecution evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of rape, and whether his so-called sweetheart defense was credible.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">First Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Sufficiency of Evidence</span><br></div><br>Appellant faults the trial court for relying heavily on the testimony of the victim that she was deceived and later forced to have sexual intercourse with him. He maintains that, on the contrary, her testimony revealed that she had been forewarned of danger; and that she had reasonable time and opportunity to escape if she had wanted to.<br><br>In particular, he argues that it is highly inconceivable for the victim -- a 15-year-old, third-year high school student -- not to have sensed danger. She herself testified that 1) in the movie house, he had suggested that she should take her clothes off in front of him, as his sister had done; and 2) the taxi took them to a motel instead of Cavite, where they were supposed to meet his wife.<br><br>Moreover, he pointed out that the victim had several opportunities to ask for help or to escape, but she chose not to do so. In the motel, she did not ask for help either from the attendant who had met and accompanied them up to their room, or from the other one who had given them two shampoo sachets. Appellant added that she also had the chance to flee while he was taking a bath, but she just sat on a chair. And, supposedly, during the thirty long minutes he was at the counter paying their bill, she failed to call for help or to break away from him.<br><br>He further contends that her testimony was marred by serious inconsistencies that weakened her credibility. Notably, he said that she gave conflicting accounts as to when he had tied her hands and feet. He likewise alleges that she lied when she first told the court that she was not able to talk to the room attendant, who had immediately gone down after fixing the room. It was supposedly clear from her testimony that the attendant had accompanied them to their room to provide water.<br><br>The factual matters now raised by appellant have been passed upon by the RTC. As a rule, its findings deserve weight and respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The same is true as regards the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, because it is the trial judge who hears them and observes their demeanor while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>    It is only when the trial court has overlooked or misapprehended some facts or circumstances of weight and influence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that these matters are re-opened for independent examination and review by appellate courts.<br><br>We have meticulously scrutinized the records of this case, while following these basic principles in reviewing rape cases: (1) although an accusation of rape can easily be made, it is difficult to prove; and it is even more difficult for the person accused -- though innocent -- to disprove; (2) since only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the prosecution’s evidence must stand or fall on its own merit and should not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In the present case, nothing in the records indicates that the prosecution evidence was wanting; or that the victim had any ill motive to fabricate a false accusation; or that the trial judge mistakenly believed her testimony.<br><br>Like the trial court, we believe her narration of the incident that appellant had carnal knowledge of her by force and without her consent. Her account of the harrowing experience was replete with explicit and sordid details that could not have been conjured by the imagination of an inexperienced 15-year-old girl. She recounted what had transpired at the motel, as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">“PROS.

The fact that appellant boxed the victim on her thighs when she resisted and struggled against him sufficiently indicated force. The force required in rape cases need not be overpowering or irresistible. Failure to offer tenacious resistance does not make the submission by the complainant to the criminal acts of the accused voluntary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> What is necessary is that the force employed against her be sufficient to consummate the purpose which he has in mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the medical findings corroborated the declarations of the victim that appellant had boxed her thighs a number of times when she resisted his advances.

This truism was reiterated in <i>People v. Dreu,</i> from which we quote:<br><blockquote><b>“A sweetheart cannot be forced to have sex against her will. Definitely, a man cannot demand sexual gratification from a fiancee and, worse, employ violence upon her on the pretext of love. Love is not a license for lust.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>Also noteworthy is the fact that it was the wife of appellant who (1) accompanied the victim and her mother to police authorities to report the incident and (2) informed them of his whereabouts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Such reaction was obviously inconsistent with that of a wife whose trust was betrayed by her husband -- as the situation would have been, if he and the victim were indeed lovers.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, the conviction of appellant is inevitable.
