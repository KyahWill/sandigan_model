				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, of the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 22761 dated September 27, 1990, dismissing the petition for certiorari of the petitioners (except petitioner Rolando Javier), on the ground that the petition was insufficient in substance and its Resolution dated March 8, 1991 denying their motion for the reconsideration of the said resolution.<br><center><br><u>The Antecedents</u><br><br></center>The late Don Francisco Gonzales was the owner of the Gonzales Estate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> with an area of 871,982 square meters located in Barrio Baesa, Caloocan City, Metro Manila, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 34486 issued by the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City.&nbsp; Upon his death, the Gonzales Estate was subdivided and registered in the names of his heirs: Leon Gonzales, Juan Gonzales-de Leon, Francisco Gonzales, Jr., Concepcion Gonzales Virata, Maria Clara Gonzales-Hilario and Consuelo Gonzales-Prinscilla under TCT Nos. 1368 — 1374 issued by the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City.<br><br>The Gonzales Estate was actually occupied and tilled by more than two hundred tenants and their families.&nbsp; Later, these tenants banded together and sought the help of the government so that the land could be conveyed and distributed to them.&nbsp; Pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 539, the Republic of the Philippines, through the Rural Progress Administration, filed on January 24, 1947 an application for the expropriation of the property before the then Court of First Instance of Rizal docketed as Civil Case No. 131.&nbsp; On March 29, 1950, the CFI of Rizal rendered a Decision in favor of the government and ordered the expropriation of the Gonzales Estate, subject to the condition that the same shall be reconveyed to the occupants for the price of P1.50 per square meter.&nbsp; Among the occupants-tenants were the Spouses Gregorio and Saturnina Bajamonde who claimed the right to purchase Lots 54 and 75 with a total area of 9,177 square meters.&nbsp; On appeal, this Court affirmed the decision with the modification that the property be resold to the occupants-tenants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On August 4, 1954, the Rural Progress Administration was succeeded by the Philippine Housing and Homesite Corporation (PHHC) which then acquired the Gonzales Estate.&nbsp; A problem ensued when on March 15, 1960, the President of the Republic, pursuant to Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 539, ordered the PHHC to limit the area to be sold to one thousand square meters per tenant; the <u>bigger portion of the property was to be sold to other qualified low-income families</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Seventy-five of the occupants-tenants of the Gonzales Estate objected to the order of the President, insisting that the property should be deeded solely to them to the exclusion of others who were not occupants-tenants thereof.&nbsp; On October 29, 1960, the tenants, including Gregorio Bajamonde, filed a Complaint before the then CFI of Rizal (Pasig), docketed as Civil Case No. 6376, to compel the Republic, through the PHHC, to sell the property only to the occupants-tenants of the Gonzales Estate.&nbsp; The case was transferred to the RTC of Caloocan City and redocketed as <u>Civil Case No. C-760</u>. The plaintiffs prayed therein that after due proceedings, judgment be rendered as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that this Honorable Court renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants ordering the latter to resell the property above referred to, the plaintiffs herein in accordance with the above-mentioned decisions; and to pay plaintiffs attorney’s fees in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND (P5,000.00) PESOS and the costs of this suit.<br><br>Plaintiffs pray for such other and further reliefs which may be legal, just and proper in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>On April 29, 1961, the then Araneta Institute of Agriculture (AIA) filed a Complaint-in-Intervention in Civil Case No. C-760.&nbsp; It alleged that on November 28, 1961, the fifty-two plaintiffs had executed a “<i>Kasunduan Na May Patnubay Kapangyarihan Hinggil Sa Asyenda Gonzales, Baesa, Caloocan, Rizal</i>” with the AIA where the tenants, through their attorney-in-fact, Marciano Baylon, conveyed to the AIA their priority rights to purchase (<i>pangunahing karapatang bilhin</i>) from the PHHC a total of 507,376 square meters which would surely be adjudicated to them as their share in the Gonzales Estate.&nbsp; However, the PHHC did not conform to the <i>Kasunduan</i>. On August 2, 1961, the lower court issued an order allowing the AIA to intervene.&nbsp; The AIA, thereafter, produced a Compromise Agreement dated November 28, 1961 purportedly entered into by only thirteen of the tenants, including Gregorio Bajamonde, with the AIA.&nbsp; It appeared therein that the aforesaid tenants sold their rights to purchase the lots occupied by them to the AIA.&nbsp; However, the PHHC and the Republic were not signatories to the aforementioned compromise agreement.&nbsp; On July 2, 1968, the lower court rendered judgment dismissing the intervention of the AIA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The AIA appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On December 11, 1961, twenty-eight out of the fifty-seven tenants-plaintiffs entered into a partial compromise agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> covering the lands respectively occupied by them, this time with the PHHC.&nbsp; Included therein was Gregorio Bajamonde, the tenant of Lot 54 and Lot 75 covering an area of 8,967 square meters and 9,427 square meters, respectively.&nbsp; In the said agreement, the Board of Directors of the PHHC approved Resolution No. 269 dated December 1, 1961 agreeing to resell the lots to the tenants with the following conditions:<br><ol> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants agree to sell said lots, at the rate of P3.80 per square meter, and the plaintiffs herein agree to buy the same and pay the purchase price thereof, in the following manner:<br></ol><blockquote>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An amount equivalent to thirty (30%) of the purchase price thereof, upon execution of the corresponding deeds of sale in favor of the plaintiffs herein;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balance thereof, to be paid within a period of 5 years in equal semestral installments, deferred payments to bear 6% interest per annum, and to be secured by a first mortgage on the same property in favor of the defendants, and further subject to the condition that no subsequent conveyance or transfer or other form of encumbrance shall be made on the property without the prior written consent of the PHHC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Subsequently, on December 23, 1961, the trial court rendered a Partial Decision in Civil Case No. 6376 (C-760) based on the Compromise Agreement dated November 28, 1961 between AIA and thirteen tenants of the Estate.&nbsp; On the same date, another decision was rendered by the court approving the Compromise Agreement of the parties dated December 11, 1961.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On December 28, 1961, twenty-four tenants, including some of those who signed the compromise agreement on December 11, 1961, entered into another compromise agreement with the PHHC covering the lots tenanted by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On January 2, 1962, the trial court rendered a partial decision based on the December 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement of the tenants and the PHHC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The plaintiffs caused the annotation of a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> at the dorsal portion of the title covering the subject lot.<br><br>On February 6, 1962, the trial court granted the motion of thirteen tenants for an immediate execution of the Partial Decision of the court dated December 23, 1961 based on the Compromise Agreement of November 28, 1961.&nbsp; The PHHC objected, on its contention that it was not a signatory to the same.&nbsp; The trial court denied the PHHC’s motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; This Court dismissed the petition for certiorari and prohibition for the nullification of the orders of the trial court filed by the PHHC, docketed as G.R. L-20643.&nbsp; On November 20, 1965, the Court denied the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Other tenants filed separate complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> with the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City against the AIA for the annulment of the November 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; In CA-G.R. No. 45530-R, the Court of Appeals ruled that the AIA did not acquire any right to purchase the lots covered by the Compromise Agreement dated November 28, 1961 because the PHHC did not conform thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, on July 13, 1978, the AIA and Gregorio Bajamonde with the conformity of his wife, Saturnina Bajamonde, executed an amicable settlement that the AIA and Gregorio Bajamonde shall have equal rights over Lots 54 and 75 of the Gonzales Estate with a total area of 9,197 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Again, the PHHC, now the National Housing Authority (NHA), did not conform to the deed.&nbsp; On September 11, 1978, the AIA, now renamed the Gregorio Araneta University Foundation (GAUF), filed a motion for the execution of the partial decision based on the November 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement specifically against Sixta Cleofas and Aniceto Cosca.&nbsp; On November 13, 1978, the trial court issued an Order granting the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 1979, the NHA finally executed a Deed of Absolute Sale over Lots 54 and 75 in favor of the Spouses Gregorio Bajamonde, conformably to the December 11, 1961 Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On the basis of the said deed, TCT No. 21017 over the lots was issued in favor of the spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> But on May 23, 1979, the Spouses Gregorio and Saturnina Bajamonde executed a Deed of Conveyance of their rights over Lots 54 and 75 covered by TCT No. C-21017 in favor of the GAUF, conformably to their November 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; On May 25, 1979, the Register of Deeds issued TCT No. C-21017 in the name of the GAUF with all the annotations on TCT No. C-21017 carried over in the dorsal portion of the latter title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In a parallel development, the trial court in Civil Case No. 17347 nullified the Compromise Agreement dated November 28, 1961 between the AIA and some tenants, on its finding that the signatures of some of the parties were forged.&nbsp; A similar order was issued in Civil Case No. 17364 on January 13, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The attempt of the GAUF to evict the tenants was stymied when the trial court, presided by a new magistrate, Judge Antonia Macandog, issued an order in Civil Case No. C-760 requiring the GAUF to show proof that it had secured the consent of the PHHC (NHA) to the November 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Gregorio Bajamonde died intestate and was survived by his heirs, namely, his widow Saturnina and their children.<br><br>To settle, once and for all, the threshold issue of whether the November 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement and the December 23, 1961 Partial Decision approving the said agreement were valid, tenants Spouses Aniceto Cosca and Evaristo Aquino filed an omnibus motion on January 4, 1984 asking the court — &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><ol> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To nullify and/or rescind and declare of no legal effect the compromise agreement dated November 28, 1961 in so far as it affects the rights and interests of movants over their respective lots in the Jose Leon Gonzales Estate;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To nullify and declare without effect the partial decision dated December 23, 1961 vis-à-vis movants’ rights and interest over said lots;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to render a new judgment in accordance with the undisputed partial compromise agreement entered into between the defunct PHHC, now NHA, and twenty-eight (28) of plaintiffs-tenants, especially in relation to the rights and interests movants acquired over their respective lots by virtue of said partial compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></ol>The GAUF, for its part, filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition with the then Intermediate Appellate Court (IAC), docketed as IAC-G.R. SP No. 04047, praying as follows:<br><ol> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pending hearing, a restraining order be issued against respondents, enjoining them from proceeding further with the consideration of the Omnibus Motion in question; or, in the event that the same has already been resolved, adversely against petitioner, that the resolution thereof be declared null and void;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing, judgment be rendered granting the writs of mandamus and prohibition prayed for, and such other reliefs as are just and equitable in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></ol>The IAC, thereafter, rendered a decision, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered on the petition under consideration, denying the prayer for a writ of prohibition, but granting the writ of mandamus sought for, only to compel the respondent court to hear and pass upon without undue delay all unresolved incidents in subject Civil Case No. C-760, entitled MARCIANO BAYLON, ET AL. versus PHHC, ET AL.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>Thus, the trial court was ordered to hear and pass upon all unresolved incidents in Civil Case No. C-760, including the GAUF’s compliance of the terms and conditions of the November 28, 1961 Compromise Agreement and the trial court’s December 23, 1961 Partial Decision.<br><br>On December 20, 1985, the trial court issued an Order in Civil Case No. C-760 granting the omnibus motion of the plaintiffs Aniceto Cosca and Evaristo Aquino and against the AIA (GAUF), thus:<br><blockquote>A.

SP No. 14839.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The petitioners therein alleged that they were not parties in Civil Case No. C-760; hence, they were not bound by any of the orders issued by the trial court in the said case.&nbsp; They further alleged that they were innocent purchasers in good faith of the lots respectively occupied by them.<br><br>On June 29, 1989, the CA dismissed the petition.&nbsp; The CA overruled the petitioners’ contention as follows:<br><blockquote><u>Firstly</u>, as earlier discussed, petitioners are privies to, or derive their rights from, Gregorio Araneta University Foundation (GAUF).&nbsp; Thus, Civil Case No. C-760 binds not only Araneta but also its privies and successors-in-interest, the petitioners herein.<br><br><u>Secondly</u>, and more importantly, TCT No. C-24153 of Araneta contains at the back thereof, Memorandum of Encumbrances, a notice of lis pendens that an action has been commenced and pending in Civil Case No. 6376 (now Civil Case No. C-760) involving the land described in the certificate of title.<br><br>The notice was inscribed on February 18, 1963, and since then, there was an announcement to the whole world that a particular property is in litigation, serving as a warning that one who acquires an interest over said property does so at his own risk, or that he gambles on the result of the litigation over said property.<br><br>Since petitioners herein entered into contracts to sell with Gregorio Araneta University Foundation in 1987 with knowledge of the existing encumbrance in TCT No. C-24153, they cannot have acquired better rights than those of their predecessors-in-interest.&nbsp; (Constantino vs. Espiritu, 45 SCRA 557).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>Dissatisfied, the GAUF Homeowners Association filed a petition for review with prayer for restraining order before this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 89969.&nbsp; On January 15, 1990, the Court denied the petition for lack of merit ratiocinating, thus:<br><blockquote>After a careful review of the Petition and its Annexes, the Court finds that the CA committed no reversible error in upholding the order of the trial court.&nbsp; It is true that a writ of execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court.&nbsp; (Galang v. Uytiepo, 92 Phil. 344 (1953); Lorenzana v. Cayetano, G.R. No. L-37051, August 31, 1977, 78 SCRA 435.)&nbsp; This Court, however, has also held that one who is privy or a successor-in-interest of the judgment debtor can be reached by the order of execution (Vda. de Medina v. Cruz, G.R. No. L-89272, May 4, 1988, 161 SCRA 36).&nbsp; In this case, although petitioners were not parties in Civil Case No. C-760 the decision in that case is binding on petitioners as the successors-in-interest of GAUF.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners cannot claim to be innocent purchasers for value of the subject land.&nbsp; The CA found that notice of <u>lis pendens</u> was annotated at the back of GAUF’s title TCT No. C-24153, as early as February 13, 1963, while the contract of sale of the subject land was entered into between GAUF and petitioners only in 1987.&nbsp; Thus, at the time petitioners entered into the contract of sale of the subject land with GAUF they already had notice of the existing <u>encumbrance</u> in TCT No. C-24153.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>The Court denied with finality the motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioners therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On May 15, 1990, the trial court granted the motion of the heirs of Gregorio Bajamonde in Civil Case No. C-760 for a writ of demolition of the houses and/or structures constructed by the employees of GAUF.&nbsp; On July 5, 1990, Sheriff Cesar Cruz, in coordination with Atty. Rolando Javier, counsel of the plaintiffs-tenants, succeeded in partially enforcing the writ and were set to continue to do so on July 9, 1990.&nbsp; However, the GAUF filed an action for the annulment of TCT Nos. 174672 and 174671, docketed as Civil Case No. 13989.&nbsp; The GAUF also filed a petition with the CA to annul the Joint Order dated August 29, 1986 and the trial court’s Order dated December 23, 1988 in Civil Case No. C-760.&nbsp; The petition was docketed as CA-G.R.
