margin-left: 400px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>(Underscoring supplied).<br></div><br>As reflected in the immediately reproduced tabulation, Judge Literato explains that with respect to Civil <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Case No. 256</span>, he was misled into declaring the defendant twice in default by the verbal manifestation of the plaintiff’s counsel.&nbsp; A judge, however, should pore over the record of a case calendared for hearing before he conducts the same to determine its status failing which he would be, as herein respondent judge was by his own admission, misled by the party or parties, thereby abdicating control of the proceedings to litigants and/or their counsel.&nbsp; It bears emphasis that such control should be as it is lodged with the judge.<br><br>With respect to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Election Case No. 209</span>, the judge extenuates himself from inaction thereon by claiming that “it is the Clerk of Court who is responsible in the calendar[ing] of cases, he being a&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;designated Judge only and has no direct control over the personnel of the MCTC of Dapa and Socorro.”&nbsp; He hastens to add that the case was already dismissed (on July 26, 2002 for being moot and academic).<br><br>Contrary, however, to the judge’s claim, it is he, as the judge, not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> Clerk of Court, which has control and supervision of not only the proceedings in a case but of court personnel.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil Case No. 273</span>, the judge informs that the parties thereto filed a Compromise Agreement on February 15, 2002.&nbsp; The judge submitted the Compromise Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated February 15, 2002 which obligates the therein defendant to pay the plaintiff “the total amount of her monetary obligation” at <s>P</s>2,000.00&nbsp; monthly beginning March 2002.&nbsp; While the Compromise Agreement prays for its approval, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the judge is silent on what action he took thereon</span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Civil Case No. 249</span>, the judge informs that the reception of evidence was scheduled on March 25, 2002 but the case “cannot be submitted for Resolution because Exhibit ‘G,’ [the presentation] of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;which was reserved by the plaintiff, has not been filed . . . despite the Order dated March 25, 2002.”<br><br>Again, it bears repeating that the judge controls the proceedings in a case.&nbsp; Without him imposing a time frame for the compliance by litigants or their counsel with court orders, he thereby abdicates control of the proceedings to them.<br><br>As for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil Case No. 237</span>, the judge informs that a Motion to Dismiss the case was submitted for resolution on September 24, 2002.&nbsp; Given that, he had three months to resolve the motion or up to December 24, 2002.&nbsp; Yet, as of the date he prepared his explanation or on January 13, 2003, he gave no information on what action he took on the motion.&nbsp; It can then be presumed that the motion had remained unresolved.&nbsp; He thus violated the 90-day period fixed by the Constitution in resolving motions and incidents pending before a judge which amounts not only to gross inefficiency but constitutes a violation of Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct mandating disposition of the court’s business promptly within the required period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil Case No. 087</span>, the judge informs that summons not having been served on the defendant, the counsel for the plaintiff, requested for substituted service and undertook to furnish the last known address of the defendant but had failed to honor his undertaking.&nbsp; Given that, the case should not have been allowed to remain pending in the docket of the court, the judge&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;having some options thereon including dismissing or archiving it.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil Case No. 225</span>, the judge informs that by Order of October 24, 2002, the plaintiff was given fifteen (15) days to file formal offer of exhibits but that no such offer had been made.&nbsp; No action having been thereafter taken by the judge, he allowed the litigant to control the course of the case.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, he could have declared the plaintiff to have waived the right to proffer his exhibits and to have rested its case and thereafter set the case for reception of defense evidence.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil Case No. 211</span>, the judge informs that the case was set for hearing on November 13, 2002 during which the plaintiffs showed up without counsel while the defendants and counsel failed to show up, prompting him to reset the hearing to January 9, 2003.<br><br>If a plaintiff’s counsel is duly notified of a particular setting but fails to show up without any reason or justification therefor, the judge should not automatically reset the hearing but should issue a show cause order why the counsel should not be faulted for delaying the administration of justice.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil Case No. 115</span>, the judge informs that the case was dismissed on June 27, 2002 but that the plaintiff filed a Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When</span> the motion was filed, the judge does not inform.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. 313</span>, the judge informs that the accused was arraigned on September 17, 2002 and the case was set for hearing on October 17, 2002. &nbsp;What happened on October 17, 2002, the judge gives no information.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. 279</span>, the judge informs that per the September 27, 2002 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement of the Dapa Police, the warrant for the arrest of the accused could not be served as he is no longer residing at his given address.&nbsp; What action he took, the judge is silent.&nbsp; What he should have done was to issue an alias warrant and to, in the meantime, archive the case pending the successful service thereof.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. 243</span>, the judge informs that per the 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement of October 18, 2002 of the Dapa Police, the warrants for the arrest of the two accused were returned unserved as they were no longer residing at their given addresses, one being already in Mangagoy, Surigao del Sur, and the other being already in Metro Manila.&nbsp; Again the judge could have issued alias warrants of arrest and archived the case pending the successful service thereof.<br><br>This Court thus gathers from the judge’s Explanation that the delay in the disposition of cases pending in his sala at Dapa is attributable to, in the main, his failure to control the proceedings or course of the cases; to issue orders on, or if orders are issued to note therein, what transpired during scheduled hearings; to impose deadlines in the submission of documents or performance of acts incident to the disposition of cases; to acquaint himself with the status of cases; and to resolve pending incidents on time, and take appropriate action on incidents arising in the course of proceedings.<br><br>The judge’s abdication of his functions and duties to court personnel and/or to litigants and/or their counsel betrays his inefficiency — his lack of mastery of basic legal practice and procedure.<br><br>The OCA thus rightfully notes in its Memorandum for the Chief Justice dated October 21, 2003 as follows:<br><blockquote>. . . Judges cannot be allowed to use their staff as shields to evade responsibility for mistakes and mishaps in the course of the performance of their duties (Hilario vs. Concepcion, 327 SCRA 96).&nbsp; He should be the master of his own domain and take responsibility for the mistakes of his subjects (Pantaleon vs. Guadiz Jr. 323 SCRA 147).&nbsp; Judges are bound to dispose of the court’s business promptly and to decide cases within the required period (Dela Cruz vs. Bersamira, 336 SCRA 253).&nbsp; Delay in the disposition of oven one (1) case constitutes gross inefficiency which the Supreme Court will not tolerate. . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The OCA accordingly faults the judge for “gross inefficiency,” which is a less serious charge, “mitigated by the fact (a) that this is his first offense not to mention . . . (b) that he is also an Acting Presiding Judge of three (3) MCTCs including [that of MCTC Dapa-Socorro],” and recommends that he be fined the amount of Five Thousand (<s>P</s>5,000.00) Pesos with a warning that a repetition of the same be dealt with more severely.<br><br>This Court finds that, indeed, respondent judge is guilty of gross inefficiency and even gross negligence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> hence, falling under the classification of less serious charge in Sec. 9 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M.
