				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 17, Davao City finding appellant Reyman Foncardas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the heirs of Napoleon Erno (the victim) P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, appellant comes to this Court on appeal.<br><br>Appellant, together with Ranil Duetes, Basilio Quijada alias “Kokoy” and Ritchie Dequi×¡a, was indicted for murder under an information dated September 1, 1997 which reads:<br><blockquote>The undersigned accuses the above named accused of the crime of Murder, under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R. A. 7659, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about May 14, 1997, in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, conspiring, confederating together and helping one another, with several unidentified companions, with treachery and evident premeditation, armed with a piece of wood, and with intent to kill, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attacked, assaulted and struck with the piece of wood one Napoleon Erno, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal wounds which caused his death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>As Duetes, Quijada and Dequi×¡a remained at large, only appellant, assisted by his counsel, was arraigned. &nbsp;He entered a plea of not guilty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> whereupon trial commenced.<br><br>From the evidence for the prosecution, the following version is established.<br><br>At around 12:00 midnight of May 14, 1997, after having a drinking spree at Romeo’s Videoke located at Trading Boulevard, Duetes, Quijada, Dequi×¡a, Marco Mariaca (Mariaca) and appellant (the group) walked some 50 meters to the corner of Trading Boulevard, fronting Rizal Extension, where it stayed for five minutes. Realizing that it had run out of cigarettes, the group proceeded to Carol’s Store,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> but returned to the corner of Trading Boulevard, fronting Rizal Extension, to sit, smoke and while the time away.<br><br>Soon after, the victim who had just purchased a bottle of Coke from Carol’s Store, repaired to the corner of Trading Boulevard, fronting Rizal Extension where he bought <i>balut</i> from a vendor. About 5 meters away from the group, the victim ate <i>balut</i> and drank the coke. Quijada then approached the victim, and the two started talking while Duetes, Dequi×¡a, Mariaca, and appellant just watched and smoked.<br><br>Minutes later, Duetes approached the victim and Quijada and sat down behind the two. Not long after, Quijada was heard shouting something in the Visayan dialect, allegedly angered by the victim’s not acceding to his demands for money.<br><br>Without any warning, Duetes pulled the victim from behind, causing the latter to fall down on his back. Appellant and Dequi×¡a rushed to join their companions Duetes and Quijada. &nbsp;Apparently, the victim was able to rise. Appellant, Quijada, Duetes and Dequi×¡a, however, pummeled him with their fists while Mariaca looked on in shock and disbelief. &nbsp;The mauling of the victim continued even as Quijada left the scene momentarily. &nbsp;When Quijada returned bearing a piece of wood about two and half feet long, appellant and Duetes who were standing behind the victim, held the latter, rendering him helpless, as Quijada struck the victim’s nape with the piece of wood. &nbsp;The victim fell down after being struck. Duetes then told Mariaca, who was merely looking at his companions, to run. Mariaca did as he was told and immediately ran away from the scene.<br><br>Seeing that a person was struck by a piece of wood, garbage collectors Quirino Cabag (Cabag), Ronil Viilano, Roman Tajo, and the driver of the garbage truck, who were 50 meters away, shouted at the assailants and approached them. &nbsp;Quijada thereupon told his companions to move away from the victim, who was already sprawled helplessly on the ground. Quijada continued to strike at the victim’s head, however. &nbsp;When the garbage collectors were about 7 meters away, appellant, Duetes and Dequi×¡a scampered away even as Quijada continued to assault the victim with the piece of wood. &nbsp;Before the garbage collectors could apprehend him, however, Quijada speedily left the scene of the crime.<br><br>Gathered from the postmortem examination conducted on the victim by Dr. Gene. L. Gulanes, a medico-legal officer at the Davao City Health Office, are the following:<br><blockquote><center style="text-decoration: underline;">POSTMORTEM FINDINGS<br></center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pallor, marked generalized<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Body in Rigor Mortis<br><br>Lacerated wound located at frontal area midline 2.5 x 1.3 cms; 3.5 x 1.3 cms, located at supraorbital area, left; 3.2 x 0.8 cms, located at left lateral canthus; 2.5 x 1.0 cms, located at right lateral canthus.<br><br>Hematoma, 2.0 x 4.5 cms, periorbital area, right; 6.0 x 5.0 cms, periorbital area, left; 10.0 x 6.0 cms, zygomatic area, left.<br><br>Fracture, comminuted: FACIAL BONE EXCLUDING MANDIBULAR, frontal; parietal; temporal bone; left, occipital; base of the skull.<br><br>Hemorrhage, intracerebral, intracranial, meningeal, generalized.<br><br>Stomach 1/4 filled with partially digested food particles.<br><br>Other visceral organs pale<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH: Severe Hemorrhage Secondary to skull fracture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Hence, appellant and his co-accused’s indictment.</blockquote>Denying the accusation, appellant claimed that although he was seated at a bench outside Carol’s store, smoking, he did not participate in any manner in the mauling of the victim, as he was merely an innocent bystander.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Discrediting appellant’s denial in favor of the positive and categorical testimony of prosecution witnesses Cabag and Mariaca that they saw him as part of the group that mauled the victim and that he held the victim as Quijada struck the victim with the piece of wood, the trial court convicted him of murder by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of May 12, 2000 the dispositive portion of which is quoted verbatim:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of the prosecution more than sufficient to prove the guilt of accused, Reyman Foncardas of the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt, without any aggravating circumstance proved by the prosecution, attendant in the commission of the offense charged of murder, with inherent attending circumstance of treachery and conspiracy among all his co-accused, on the resultant offense, accused, REYMAN FONCARDAS, is sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, together with all accessory penalty as provided for by law.<br><br>Pursuant to Art. 100 in relation to Art. 104 of the Revised Penal Code, governing civil indemnity, accused Reyman Foncardas, is moreover ordered to pay the mother of the deceased, Fedelina Erno-Ignacio, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damages, for all the sorrow and worries she suffered, as a result of the death of her son, Napoleon Erno.<br><br>On account of this judgment, issue warrant for the immediate arrest of the other accused, Ranil Duetes, Basilio Quijada and Ritchie Dequi×¡a, for their prosecution and immediate trial of the offense charged, after their arrest.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal which ascribes the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT “THE ACCUSED REYMAN FONCARDAS WAS TOGETHER IN THE GROUP OF QUEJADA, DUETES AND DEQUI×A.”<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING “THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE ON RECORD TO PROVE MARCO MARIACA WAS MOTIVATED WITH PERSONAL AND MALICIOUS INCLINATION IN TESTIFYING AGAINST ACCUSED REYMAN FONCARDAS.”<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THERE WAS CONSPIRACY AMONG THE ACCUSED WHICH INCLUDES REYMAN FONCARDAS [AND]<br><center><br>IV.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVINCTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>In his brief, appellant argues that the trial court erred in relying on the testimony of Mariaca upon a finding that there was no evidence on record to prove that Mariaca was motivated by malice in testifying against appellant just to avoid being himself implicated in the death of the victim.<br><br>Additionally, appellant argues that the testimony of Cabag should not be believed due to poor visibility in the <i>locus criminis</i> and the improbability that, as claimed by Cabag, the assailant stared at the garbage collectors for such length of time to enable Cabag to remember his face.<br><br>In bolstering his case, appellant highlights the inconsistency between the testimonies of Mariaca and Cabag as to the <u>number of persons</u> during the incident.<br><br>Once again, this Court is confronted with the issue of credibility of witnesses. The rule is well settled that the findings of fact and the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a matter best left to the trial court.<br><blockquote>The rationale for this doctrine as explained in <i>People vs. Cayabyab</i> is that the trial judge is able to detect that sometimes thin line between fact and prevarication that will determine the guilt and innocence of the accused. &nbsp;That line may not be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the reviewing court. &nbsp;The record will not reveal those tell-tale signs that will affirm the truth or expose the contrivance, like the angry flush of an insistent assertion; or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie; or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer; or the forthright tone of a ready reply. The record will not show if the eyes have darted in evasion, or looked down in confession, or gazed steadily with a serenity that has nothing to distort or conceal. &nbsp;The record will not show if tears were shed in anger, or in shame, or in remembered pain, or in feigned innocence. Only the judge trying the case can see all these and on the basis of his observations arrive at an informed and reasoned verdict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (citations omitted)</blockquote>Such settled rule aside, a close scrutiny of the testimonies of both prosecution witnesses reveals that appellant was categorically and positively identified as one of the perpetrators of the crime.

His alleged ill motives against appellant have been correctly assessed and brushed aside by the trial court, which had ample opportunity to observe him. An examination of the transcript of stenographic notes of Mariaca’s testimony shows that even under rigorous cross-examination, he remained steadfast in his testimony. And such testimony was corroborated on material points by Cabag, who was also an eyewitness.<br><br>Appellant calls attention to the delay in Mariaca’s volunteering to testify which, so he contends, betrays Mariaca’s ulterior motives. Appellant’s contention is untenable. This Court has repeatedly noted that witnessing a crime is an unusual experience that elicits different reactions from witnesses for which no clear-cut standard of behavior can be drawn. Different people react differently to a given situation, for there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The reluctance of eyewitnesses to testify on a crime and to get involved in a criminal investigation is but normal and does not by itself affect the witnesses’ credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>That Cabag saw appellant only once before he testified in court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> should not detract from his ability to recall appellant’s face. Experience dictates that precisely because of the unusual acts of violence committed right before witnesses’ eyes that they remember with a high degree of reliability the identity of criminals at any given time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Appellant goes on to assail Cabag’s testimonial claim of having had a good look at appellant’s face since, so he explained, appellant stared at the garbage collectors. Appellant contends that such is contrary to human experience since it is not the normal reaction of a person who had just committed a crime to stare at the witnesses, the normal reaction being to hide or conceal his identity. Appellant’s contention fails to impress. As priorly stated, this Court has long recognized that different people react differently to a given situation. &nbsp;The reaction of a malefactor who is caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> may be aggression, flight or even indifference. In this case, appellant was with three other young men, one of whom was armed with a piece of wood, while the garbage collectors including Cabag were unarmed. &nbsp;It is possible that appellant and the other accused were staring at the garbage collectors as the latter were approaching them in order to assess their chances in engaging them in a fight.<br><br>While the incident took place at around 2:00 a.m., it is not disputed that there was a lighted electric post nearby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Light from the stars<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> or the moon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> it has been held, can give ample illumination to enable a person to identify or recognize another. <i>A fortiori</i>, this Court is convinced that the illumination from the electric post sufficed for Cabag, who was near the <i>locus criminis</i>, to enable him to recognize appellant.<br><br>Appellant further draws attention to alleged inconsistencies, conflicting and contradictory testimonies of prosecution witnesses, he highlighting that of Cabag that he saw four people (appellant, Quijada, Duetes, and Dequi×¡a), and that Mariaca testified that there were five (himself, appellant, Quijada, Duetes, Dequi×¡a) in the vicinity. Such inconsistency does not affect the credibility of either witness. &nbsp;Minor contradictions among several witnesses of a particular incident which do not relate to the gravamen of the offense charged are to be expected in view of their differences in impressions, memory, vantage points and other related factors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In fact, minor inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses bolster rather than weaken their credibility as they erase any suspicion that they have been rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, any inconsistency refers to minor and collateral matters which do not affect the substance, veracity or weight of the witnesses’ testimony as it does not refer to an essential element of the crime<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and does not have any bearing on the essential fact testified to, that is, the killing of the victim. What is important is that both Cabag and Mariaca were consistent in positively identifying appellant as one of the persons who participated in the mauling of the victim.<br><br>As for appellant’s reliance on defense witness Roman Tajo’s testimony that he (appellant) was not part of the group which mauled the victim, the same is misplaced, for Tajo admitted that he did not see the faces of the assailants:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td scope="row" width="11%">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td width="89%"><strong>You said, you cannot remember really the persons?</strong></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td><strong>As far as their faces are concerned, we cannot identify them but as to their height, we can estimate.</strong></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>The mother and the wife of accused, tell you that the accused is taller and so he was not among those whom you saw?</td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>The wife of the accused and his mother told me, that I should tell the truth, as I was really there at the time of the incident.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>And the truth that you would like to convey because the accused whom you saw is taller and not among those whom you saw.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>I did not really see him during that time of the incident.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td><strong>You did not see him because you cannot really see the faces of those?</strong></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><strong> I saw the heights and because he is tall, he is not among those three.</strong></td></tr><tr><td scope="row">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td><strong>You said, that you did not see the faces of those three?</strong></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td><p><strong>Yes, your Honor.</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>At all events, appellant submits that there is no evidence of conspiracy between him and his co-accused.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement to commit an unlawful act. There is, however, no need to prove a previous agreement to commit the crime if by their overt acts, it is clear that all the accused acted in concert in the pursuit of their unlawful design. &nbsp;It may even be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In conspiracy, it is not necessary to show that all the conspirators actually hit and killed the victim. What is important is that the participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as unmistakably to indicate a common purpose or design in bringing about the death of the victim.<br><br>From the testimonies of Mariaca and Cabag, it is clear that the trial court did not err in appreciating the presence of conspiracy. &nbsp;Mariaca’s and Cabag’s testimonies disclose that appellant was one of those who restrained the victim while Quijada struck him on the nape with a piece of wood, resulting in the latter’s falling to the ground.<br><br>That appellant conspired in the commission of the crime charged was sufficiently and convincingly shown by his active participation in holding the victim to render him immobile, thus enabling Quijada to consummate the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Regardless of the extent and character of his participation then, conspiracy renders appellant liable as a co-principal because in contemplation of law, the act of one conspirator is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Having joined in the criminal conspiracy, appellant in effect adopted as his own the criminal design of his co-conspirators. &nbsp;Appellant is, therefore, liable for the killing of the victim.<br><br>As for treachery in the killing, the trial court correctly appreciated its presence. &nbsp;The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected manner of execution, affording the hapless and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> From Mariaca’s and Cabag’s testimony that appellant and Duetes held the victim while Quijada struck the nape of the victim, the victim was rendered defenseless. &nbsp;There can be no mistaking then that the manner by which the victim was restrained and assaulted was deliberately and consciously adopted by his assailants to ensure his demise.<br><br>The attendance of evident premeditation in the commission of the crime, though alleged in the information, is not supported by evidence, as there is no showing as to when appellant and his co-accused determined to kill the victim.<br><br>Although Mariaca testified that appellant and his co-accused had been drinking before the mauling of the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that does not suffice to aggravate or mitigate appellant’s criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The trial court could not have appreciated intoxication&nbsp; — appellant’s drinking beer — as an aggravating circumstance, therefore, as the same was not alleged in the information.<br><br>Section 9 of Rule 110 of the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that qualifying and aggravating circumstances be alleged in the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Although the crime was committed before the effectivity of the said Rule, the same should be applied retroactively as it would be favorable to appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> But, even assuming that the aggravating circumstance of intoxication was alleged, appellant’s degree of intoxication was not proven with certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Moreover, in the absence of clear and positive proof that appellant’s intoxication was habitual or subsequent to the plan to commit the crime, it is improper to consider the same as an aggravating circumstance. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Neither could appellant’s alleged intoxication be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance. To be mitigating, it is necessary that appellant present proof of having taken a quantity of alcoholic beverage prior to the commission of the crime sufficient to produce the effect of obfuscating reason. &nbsp;At the same time, he must prove that he is not a habitual drinker and that he did not take the alcoholic drink purposely to reinforce his resolve to commit the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the absence then of clear and positive proof as to appellant’s state of intoxication, this Court cannot consider appellant’s drinking beer as a mitigating circumstance.<br><br>In fine, appellant is indeed guilty of murder, penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7569. There being neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> was correctly imposed by the trial court, pursuant to Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As to the civil aspect of the case, in line with prevailing jurisprudence, the award of indemnity to the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 is affirmed, it being awarded without need of proof other than the fact that a crime was committed resulting in the death of the victim and that the accused was responsible therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>As for the award by the trial court of moral damages to the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00, the same must be deleted, there being no evidence, testimonial or otherwise, presented to support it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Exemplary damages must, however, be awarded in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code, at least one aggravating circumstance -treachery - which, in this case, <b>qualifies</b> the offense, being present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Under Article 2206 of the Civil Code, the heirs of the victim are entitled to indemnity for loss of earning capacity.
