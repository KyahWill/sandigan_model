				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of June 9, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court of Sorsogon, Sorsogon, Branch 65 in Criminal Case No. 241, finding appellant Salvador Golimlim alias “Badong” guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, imposing on him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and holding him civilly liable in the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>The Information dated April 16, 1997 filed against appellant reads as follows:<br><blockquote>That sometime in the month of August, 1996, at Barangay Bical, Municipality of Bulan, Province of Sorsogon, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above-named accused, armed with a bladed weapon, by means of violence and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge of one Evelyn Canchela against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment on December 15, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> appellant, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.<br><br>The facts established by the prosecution are as follows:<br><br>Private complainant Evelyn G. Canchela (Evelyn), is a mental retardate. When her mother, Amparo Hachero, left for Singapore on May 2, 1996 to work as a domestic helper, she entrusted Evelyn to the care and custody of her (Amparo’s) sister Jovita Guban and her husband Salvador Golimlim, herein appellant, at Barangay Bical, Bulan, Sorsogon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Sometime in August 1996, Jovita left the conjugal residence to meet a certain Rosing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> leaving Evelyn with appellant. Taking advantage of the situation, appellant instructed private complainant to sleep,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and soon after she had laid down, he kissed her and took off her clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As he poked at her an object which to Evelyn felt like a knife,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> he proceeded to insert his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> His lust satisfied, appellant fell asleep.<br><br>When Jovita arrived, Evelyn told her about what appellant did to her. Jovita, however, did not believe her and in fact she scolded her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Sometime in December of the same year, Lorna Hachero, Evelyn’s half-sister, received a letter from their mother Amparo instructing her to fetch Evelyn from Sorsogon and allow her to stay in Novaliches, Quezon City where she (Lorna) resided. Dutifully, Lorna immediately repaired to appellant’s home in Bical, and brought Evelyn with her to Manila.<br><br>A week after she brought Evelyn to stay with her, Lorna suspected that her sister was pregnant as she noticed her growing belly. She thereupon brought her to a doctor at the Pascual General Hospital at Baeza, Novaliches, Quezon City for check-up and ultrasound examination.<br><br>Lorna’s suspicions were confirmed as the examinations revealed that Evelyn was indeed pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> She thus asked her sister how she became pregnant, to which Evelyn replied that appellant had sexual intercourse with her while holding a knife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In February of 1997, the sisters left for Bulan, Sorsogon for the purpose of filing a criminal complaint against appellant. The police in Bulan, however, advised them to first have Evelyn examined. Obliging, the two repaired on February 24, 1997 to the Municipal Health Office of Bulan, Sorsogon where Evelyn was examined by Dr. Estrella Payoyo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The Medico-legal Report revealed the following findings, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td width="20%">FINDINGS:</td><td width="80%">LMP [last menstrual period]: Aug. 96 ?

The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Salvador Golimlim having been found guilty of the crime of RAPE (Art. 335 R.P.C. as amended by RA 7659) beyond reasonable doubt is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, and to indemnify the offended party Evelyn Canchela in the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damage[s], and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal, appellant assigning to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE CONTRADICTORY AND IMPLAUSIBLE TESTIMONY OF EVELYN CANCHELA, A MENTAL RETARDATE, [AND]<br><br></li><li> THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Appellant argues that Evelyn’s testimony is not categorical and is replete with contradictions, thus engendering grave doubts as to his criminal culpability.<br><br>In giving credence to Evelyn’s testimony and finding against appellant, the trial court made the following observations, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote>1) Despite her weak and dull mental state the victim was consistent in her claim that her Papay Badong (accused Salvador Golimlim) had carnal knowledge of her and was the author of her pregnancy, and nobody else (See: For comparison her Sworn Statement on p. 3/Record; her narration in the Psychiatric Report on pp. 47 &amp; 48/Record; the TSNs of her testimony in open court);<br><br>2) She remains consistent that her Papay Badong raped her only once;<br><br>3) That the contradictory statements she made in open court relative to the details of how she was raped, although would seem derogatory to her credibility and reliability as a witness under normal    conditions, were amply explained by the psychiatrist who examined her and supported by her findings (See: Exhibits F to F-2);<br><br>4) Despite her claim that several persons laid on top of her (which is still subject to question considering that the victim could not elaborate on its meaning), the lucid fact remains that she never pointed to anybody else as the author of her pregnancy, but her Papay Badong. Which only shows that the trauma that was created in her mind by the incident has remained printed in her memory despite her weak mental state. Furthermore, granting for the sake of argument that other men also laid on top of her, this does not deviate from the fact that her Papay Badong (the accused) had sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses’ testimonies is, as has repeatedly been held by this Court, accorded great respect on appeal in the absence of grave abuse of discretion on its part, it having had the advantage of actually examining both real and testimonial evidence including the demeanor of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the present case, no cogent reason can be appreciated to warrant a departure from the findings of the trial court with respect to the assessment of Evelyn’s testimony.<br><br>That Evelyn is a mental retardate does not disqualify her as a witness nor render her testimony bereft of truth.<br><br>Sections 20 and 21 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court provide:<br><blockquote>SEC. 20. <i>Witnesses; their qualifications</i>. – Except as provided in the next succeeding section, all persons who can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others, may be witnesses.<br><center>x x x<br></center><br>SEC. 21. <i>Disqualification by reason of mental incapacity or immaturity</i>. – The following persons cannot be witnesses:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) Those whose mental condition, at the time of their production for examination, is such that they are incapable of intelligently making known their perception to others;<br><br>(b) Children whose mental maturity is such as to render them incapable of perceiving the facts respecting which they are examined and of relating them truthfully.<br></div></blockquote>In <i>People v. Trelles</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> where the trial court relied heavily on the therein mentally retarded private complainant’s testimony irregardless of her “monosyllabic responses and vacillations between lucidity and ambiguity,” this Court held:<br><blockquote>A mental retardate or a feebleminded person is not, <i>per se</i>, disqualified from being a witness, her mental condition not being a vitiation of her credibility. It is now universally accepted that intellectual weakness, no matter what form it assumes, is not a valid objection to the competency of a witness so long as the latter can still give a fairly intelligent and reasonable narrative of the matter testified to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>It can not then be gainsaid that a mental retardate can be a witness, depending on his or her ability to relate what he or she knows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> If his or her testimony is coherent, the same is admissible in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>To be sure, modern rules on evidence have downgraded mental incapacity as a ground to disqualify a witness. As observed by McCormick, the remedy of excluding such a witness who may be the only person available who knows the facts, seems inept and primitive. Our rules follow the modern trend of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, in a long line of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court has upheld the conviction of the accused based mainly on statements given in court by the victim who was a mental retardate.<br><br>From a meticulous scrutiny of the records of this case, there is no reason to doubt Evelyn’s credibility. To be sure, her testimony is not without discrepancies, given of course her feeblemindedness.<br><br>By the account of Dr. Chona Cuyos-Belmonte, Medical Specialist II at the Psychiatric Department of the Bicol Medical Center, who examined Evelyn, although Evelyn was suffering from moderate mental retardation with an IQ of 46,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> she is capable of perceiving and relating events which happened to her.

It is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. It cannot thus prevail over the positive declaration of Evelyn who convincingly identified him as her rapist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In convicting appellant under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659 (the law in force when the crime was committed in 1996), the trial court did not specify under which mode the crime was committed. Under the said article, rape is committed thus:<br><blockquote>ART. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed</i>. – Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><ol type="1"><li> By using force or intimidation;<br></li><li> When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br></li><li> When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br></li></ol>The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or death.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center></blockquote>It is settled that sexual intercourse with a woman who is a mental retardate constitutes statutory rape which does not require proof that the accused used force or intimidation in having carnal knowledge of the victim for conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The fact of Evelyn’s mental retardation was not, however, alleged in the Information and, therefore, cannot be the basis for conviction. Such notwithstanding, that force and intimidation attended the commission of the crime, the mode of commission alleged in the Information, was adequately proven. It bears stating herein that the mental faculties of a retardate being different from those of a normal person, the degree of force needed to overwhelm him or her is less. Hence, a quantum of force which may not suffice when the victim is a normal person, may be more than enough when employed against an imbecile.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Still under the above-quoted provision of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, when the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. In the case at bar, however, although there is adequate evidence showing that appellant indeed used force and intimidation, that is not the case with respect to the use of a deadly weapon.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Sorsogon, Sorsogon, Branch 65 in Criminal Case No. 241 finding appellant, Salvador Golimlim alias “Badong,” <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of rape, which this Court finds to have been committed under paragraph 1, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and holding him civilly liable therefor, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br>Costs against appellant.<br><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, (Acting Chairman)</i>, and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Vitug, J., (Chairman)</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 31-45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Records at 29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, August 12, 1998 at 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, October 14, 1998 at 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, January 27, 1999 at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 10 and 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> TSN, June 2, 1998 at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TSN, August 12, 1998 at 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Exhibit “E”, Records at 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Exhibit “B”, Records at 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Records at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Exhibit “D”, Records at 127.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> TSN, September 20, 1999 at 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 80.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 38-39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>People v.
