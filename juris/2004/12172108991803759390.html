They stated that there was an ongoing protest filed with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the cancellation of and/or recommendation of the DENR to cancel petitioner’s title.&nbsp; (Respondents filed the protest within one year after the issuance of the patent to petitioner.)<br><br>Respondents also alleged that the ejectment case filed by petitioner against them was decided in their favor, and the criminal charges filed before the Fiscal’s Office attacking the genuineness of their Deeds of Sale were dismissed.<br><br>Respondents prayed for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of pendency of an action and/or lack of cause of action and, in the alternative, for the declaration of petitioner’s title as null and void and that petitioner’s title be cancelled.<br><br>On January 16, 1995, the trial court ordered the suspension of the hearing of the case, as prayed for by the parties’ counsels, until the termination of the proceedings before the DENR.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated January 23, 1994 [should be 1995], the Regional Executive Director of the DENR, Region III, San Fernando, Pampanga, dismissed respondents’ protest, thus:<blockquote>From the allegations of the protestants, it is crystal clear that the lot in dispute has already been patented and corresponding certificate of title was already issued in favor of the herein respondent, hence, in the eyes of the law, the same became private land from the time the subject patent was issued.<br><br>Worthy of note at this juncture, is that the Office of the Solicitor General is presently suspending actions for either cancellation of free patent and reversion or cancellation of title involving private lands.&nbsp; Thus, even assuming arguendo that the protestants’ allegation of fraud and misrepresentation in the acquisition of patent is true, this Office could not recommend the institution of reversion proceedings to the Office of the Solicitor General in view of the latter’s suspension of all actions for reversion and/or cancellation of title.&nbsp; It bears stressing that the Office of the Solicitor General is the sole government agency vested by law with authority to institute reversion proceedings and/or cancellation of title.&nbsp; This Office believes that the protestants’ rights and interest will be adequately protected and their grievances properly ventilated if they, themselves, are the ones who will initiate appropriate action for cancellation before the ordinary court of justice.</blockquote>On February 20, 1995, the trial court scheduled the case for hearing after the termination of the proceedings before the DENR.<br><br>On August 22, 1995, a pre-trial conference was held where the parties entered into a pre-trial agreement, thus:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><ol start="2"><li>Plaintiff and defendants admit that OCT No. P-11962 was issued in July 1993 over a parcel of land situated at Locloc, Palauig, Zambales with an area of 55,860 square meters and which is identified as Lot No. 1083, Cadastral No. 364-D, a xerox copy of which is attached as Annex “A” of the complaint which the defendants admit to be a faithful reproduction of the original.</li><br><li>Plaintiff and defendants admit that defendants are presently occupying the premises without prejudice to the submission of any survey plan to be submitted by the defendants during the trial;<br><br></li><li>Plaintiff and defendants admit that a protest was filed by the defendants at DENR, San Fernando, Pampanga asking for the cancellation of the title issued to the plaintiff but it was dismissed by the DENR by Order dated 23 January 1994 x x x;</li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">x x x</div><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FACTUAL ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED</span><br><ol><li>Whether or not the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No. P-11962 was through fraud;</li><br><li>Whether or not the defendants are the owners of the corresponding portions of the land occupied by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>During the hearing held on November 21, 1995, petitioner manifested&nbsp;

It is to the public interest that one who succeeds in fraudulently acquiring title to a public land should not be allowed to benefit therefrom, and the State should, therefore, have an ever existing authority, thru its duly authorized officers, to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the issuance of any such title, to the end that the Republic, thru the Solicitor General or any other officer who may be authorized by law, may file the corresponding action for the reversion of the land involved to the public domain, subject thereafter to disposal to other qualified persons in accordance with law.&nbsp; In other words, the indefeasibility of a title over land previously public is not a bar to an investigation by the Director of lands as to how such title has been acquired, if the purpose of such investigation is to determine whether or not fraud had been committed in securing such title in order that the appropriate action for reversion may be filed by the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>It is, therefore, clear that a certificate of title, issued on the basis of a free patent, that is procured through fraud or in violation of the law may be cancelled, and indefeasibility of the title is no defense.<br><br>It is true that under the law, it is the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead who is authorized under Section 101<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, to institute an action for reversion in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br>A private person is, as a rule, not the proper party to bring such a suit.&nbsp; However, this Court, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, may directly resolve the issue of alleged fraud in the acquisition of a public land patent although the action is instituted by a private person, to the end that substantial justice may be dispended to the party litigants, rather than leaving the present controversy unresolved and subject to a circuitous and tedious process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODIFIED</span> so as to sustain petitioner’s timely appeal but the decision of the trial court in Civil Case No. RTC-1055-I is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, Vol. I, p.1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 77.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 79-80.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> RTC Decision, Rollo, p. 57.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 1 at 82.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 1 at 99.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Pre-Trial Order, Rollo, pp. 58-59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 1 at 170.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 4 at 59-64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 71-72.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 72.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rollo, p. 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 76.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 77.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 78.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Records, Vol. II, p. 566.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 13 at 80.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> CA Decision, Rollo, pp. 47-48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 54-A.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 52.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid</span>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 53.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 13 at 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 18 at 587.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 601.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, note 13 at 81.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 82.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 183-184.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> New Trial or Reconsideration.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Appeal from the Regional Trial Courts.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> 322 SCRA 81, 91 (2000).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> G.R.
