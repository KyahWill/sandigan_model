				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review before this Court is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Negros Occidental (Branch 50 stationed in Bacolod City) in Criminal Case No. 00-20595, dated February 26, 2001, finding Randy Belonio y Landas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and sentencing him to death.<br><br>The Amended Information dated April 27, 2000, charged appellant with Murder as follows:<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 6th day of January, 2000, in the City of Talisay, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with an improvised knife, with intent to kill, and with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one RAMY TAMAYO, thus causing injuries in the vital parts of the body of the latter which caused his instantaneous death.<br><br>“That accused RANDY BELONIO y LANDAS is a recidivist for having been convicted by final judgment of 4 years, two (2) months, one day to six years in Crim. Case 94-16609 entitled: People of the Philippines vs. Randy Belonio y Landas for Homicide.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [2]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon his arraignment on May 24, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> appellant, assisted by his counsel de oficio, pleaded not guilty.<br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Solicitor General narrates the factual antecedents of the case, as summarized by the trial court, as follows:<br><blockquote>“Jennifer Carampatana testified that on January 6, 2000, her grandmother was buried and there was a wake in their house at Brgy. Zone 14 in the evening.  Her first cousin, the late Ramy Tamayo, also called Ramon Tamayo, arrived in their house at about 10:00 P.M. together with his wife.<br><br>“Jennifer invited Ramy to talk outside of their house.  Before they could sit on a nearby bench, Ramy decided to buy cigarettes from a store only a few meters away.  The store was furnished with a small opening    for the store- keeper to attend to the customers and Ramy was occupying that space in front of the opening to pay when the accused Randy Belonio arrived.  Randy tried to force his way in front of the opening and as a consequence, he bumped on Ramy.  Jennifer saw that Randy gave Ramy a long and hard look.<br><br>“Jennifer said that he and Ramy sat and talked on the bench.  The accused came over and sat on the other end of the bench.  Then the accused asked Ramy for the latter’s cigarette lighter.  The accused asked Ramy from what place did he come from and why was he there.  Ramy answered the accused in a normal manner.<br><br>“The accused left but after a few minutes he returned, Jennifer, who was facing the direction of the approaching accused, saw him and noticed that he was wearing long sleeves.  Ramy Tamayo could not see the accused as he was facing sideways to Jennifer.  Without saying a word and without warning, the accused delivered a stabbing blow with a dagger which was concealed in his hand.  Ramy was hit on the right chest, Jennifer stood up and ran towards her house shouting for help.  There at the gate of the fence of her house, she heard another thudding sound of a stabbing blow.  When Jennifer entered her house, she announced that Ramy was stabbed.<br><br>“Jennifer and her relatives rushed out of the house.  Jennifer saw the accused running away    towards the back of the barangay hall.  The Tanods who came over failed to find the accused.  Then when the Barangay Captain and the policemen arrived, Jennifer informed them of the direction towards which the accused fled.  The accused was arrested from one (1) of the houses near the barangay hall where he took refuge.<br><br>“Dr. Raul V. Pama, Jr. was the acting City Health Officer of Talisay City on January 6, 2000.  He conducted an autopsy on the remains of Ramy Tamayo and listed his findings in a necropsy report which he prepared.  These findings are as follows:<br><ol> <li>‘Stabbed wound, 1.7 cm. in length, sutured sharp on one (1) and (inferior portion) and blunt on the other end (superior portion) located at the 4th intercostal space;<br><br>‘Dr. Pama explained that the wound is just above the left nipple and it penetrated downward hitting the left side on the heart;<br><br></li><li>‘Stabbed wound at the sternal.  The wound is situated just above the site of the first wound.’<br><br>‘The first wound was fatal as it damaged the heart.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Randy Belonio adopted the above findings of the trial court and the prosecution. However, he raises the defense of insanity, an exempting circumstance, and for such purpose, depends on the expert assessment of his witness, Dr. Antonio Gauzon, who certified thus:<br><blockquote>“This is an individual who is suffering from (Schizophrenia), Chronic Undifferentiated and probably triggered by (s)ubstance abuse of Shabu and Marijuana.<br><br>“Recommending treatment and rehabilitation in a mental institution like the National Center for Mental (H)ealth in Mandaluyong City or treatment in the psychiatric unit of the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Regional Hospital in Bacolod City and later rehabilitation in the Negros (O)ccidental Mental Health Center at Paglaum Village, Bacolod City.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of Murder and that he had full control of his mental faculties.  It held that the testimony of Dr. Ester Regina Servando was more weighty and credible than that of Dr. Gauzon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The trial court convicted appellant, thus:<br><blockquote>“FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Randy Belonio y Landas GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as charged in the Information, as Principal by Direct (Participation) with the qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery and the special aggravating circumstance of recidivism.  There are no other aggravating circumstances nor is there any mitigating circumstance.  Accordingly, the accused is sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH.<br><br>“The accused is held civilly liable to pay the heirs of Randy Tamayo the following amounts:<br><blockquote>“1.     The sum of P50,000.00 as death indemnity;<br><br>“2.     The sum of P3,629.70 as reimbursement for hospital expenses;<br><br>“3.     The sum of P940,716.00 as compensatory damages; and<br><br>“4.     The sum of P100,000.00 in favor of Mrs. Jinky Tamayo as moral damages.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Hence this automatic review.<br><br>In his brief, appellant assigns this lone alleged error of the court a quo for our consideration:<br><blockquote>“The trial court seriously erred in not appreciating the exempting circumstance of insanity pursuant to Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended favoring the accused-appellant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>In support of his appeal, appellant argues that he was not in his right and normal frame of mind when the killing took place.  He avers that no normal person would ever bump another person, give the latter a hard look and eventually stab him to death.  He adds that he and the victim did not know each other at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup><br><br>Appellant also asseverates that Dr. Gauzon is a reliable expert witness and is more knowledgeable and experienced than Dr. Servando.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He explains that Dr. Servando was once under the tutelage of Dr. Gauzon and that at the time of their respective testimonies, the former was only 37 years old, while the latter was 57 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Appellant also cites portions of the trial court’s Decision where Dr. Gauzon referred him to the Bacolod City Health Office for psychiatric examination. The trial court also branded the accused as a homicidal maniac, which appellant says, is judicial    notice of his mental sickness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In sum, he concludes that all of these circumstances show that he was insane at the time of the killing.<br><br>We find these arguments without merit.<br><br>The moral and legal presumption is that one acts with free will and intelligence, and that a felonious or criminal act has been done with deliberate intent, that is, with freedom and intelligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Whoever, therefore, invokes insanity as a defense has the burden of proving its existence.<br><br>Insanity is a defense in the nature of confession and avoidance, and as such must be adequately proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup> The law presumes that all persons are of sound mind, and that acts are done consciously.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17] </sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the defense utterly failed to discharge its burden of proving that appellant was insane.  The testimony or proof of appellant’s insanity must relate to the time preceding or the very moment of the commission of the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> We find the evidence adduced by the defense sorely insufficient to establish his claim that he was insane at the time he killed Tamayo.<br><br>The main circumstances presented by the defense that remotely evinces that appellant was insane at that time was his act of bumping the victim, without any apparent reason, giving him a long hard look, and then eventually stabbing him.  However, this sequence of events cannot overcome the legal presumption of sanity, let alone prove appellant’s insanity.<br><br>In the eyes of the law, insanity exists when there is a complete deprivation of intelligence in committing the act.  Proof of the existence of some abnormality of the mental faculties will not exclude imputability, if it can be shown that the offender    was not completely deprived of freedom and intelligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> As culled from the trial court’s findings, Belonio, after giving the victim a hard and resentful look, sat near the latter, lighted his cigarette and conversed with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Afterwards, he left and came back armed with a dagger with which he stabbed Tamayo.  Immediately thereafter, he escaped and went into hiding.  Contrary to a finding of the existence of insanity, these acts tend to establish that Belonio was well aware of what he had just committed, and was capable of distinguishing right from wrong.  Otherwise, he would not have attempted to escape and go into hiding.<br><br>Aside from the “bumping” incident earlier discussed, the only other evidence of insanity that appellant could relevantly point to is the medical certificate prepared by Dr. Antonio Gauzon stating that Belonio was suffering from schizophrenia.  This witness was presented to refute the findings of the prosecution’s expert witness Dr. Ester Regina Servando which negated the existence of this mental condition.<br><br>A run-through of Dr. Gauzon’s testimony strengthens this Court’s resolve to affirm the lower court’s findings.

And the (s)treet (u)rchins, you know for a fact, that they are influenced  by drugs.&nbsp; So, by that time, with that dysfunctional family, and without any  family to take care of himself, he was not doing what the society expects him  to do.&nbsp; So that they have dysfunctional family and with dysfunctional  relatives.&nbsp; So, the value system was really poor.&nbsp; So that the thinking process  of this individual was not developed to what the society expects him to be.  So, it started at that time.&nbsp; So, when he was taking shabu, it triggered  every tissue that the symptoms came out.&nbsp; That’s why, he became suspicious,  (he) became irritable and anybody who would try to not befriend him and  tried to be angry with him, he would immediately suspect that something  would happen to him in which he would react by defending himself, and  probably by killing.&nbsp; This individual had, actually, committed, say, killing.&nbsp; I  would not say murder because that’s your term, but he had killed already  three (3) persons in different years.&nbsp; So, he does not already know what he  was doing because he was psychotic, which in your parlance is insane. </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>Now, Doctor, on January 6, 2000, and even prior to this date, what  you are trying to say is that, this subject, Randy Belonio, was already  suffering from schizophrenia?</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>Yes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Dr. Gauzon testified that based on his interview with Belonio on October 25, 2000 (around nine months after the stabbing incident) the latter was suffering from schizophrenia.  However, the evidence of insanity after the fact of commission of the offense may be accorded weight only if there is also proof of alleged abnormal behavior immediately before or simultaneous to the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22] </sup><br><br>The first set of facts narrated by the doctor relates to Belonio’s condition during the interview, months after the incident.  His report was silent as regards the incidents occurring prior to or during the circumstance for which Belonio stands trial.  The second part of his testimony dwelt on Belonio’s life history, which was offered to prove that he had been suffering from his alleged condition since childhood.<br><br>However, perusing the story as narrated by the doctor, the same was a mere statement of Belonio’s life and family history, explaining what brought about his supposed mental condition.  There was no showing that he was actually suffering from schizophrenia during his juvenile years.  To demonstrate that he had been suffering from this condition, the doctor pointed to the fact that he has already killed three (3) persons, including the present incident. However, such conclusion is non sequitur and, at best, a circuitous argument. Further, the veracity of these findings is belied by the fact that the accused did not raise this defense during his prosecutions for the other killings. No other circumstances evincing its existence were presented during trial.<br><br>Furthermore, Dr. Gauzon’s examination cannot surmount Dr. Servando’s punctilious and overwhelming analysis, which took two days to narrate.  She explained the history of the accused, including his family and medical background, conducted a mental status examination, which was based on her direct interviews with him, and gave a series of other written psychological examinations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The portion of Dr. Servando’s testimony pertinent to her findings regarding Belonio’s mental condition is quoted as follows:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">“FISCAL AGRAVIADOR:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Can you please read for the record this (r)esult which consist only of one (1) sentence?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Psychiatric Evaluation Result.&nbsp;

The time-honored doctrine is that the question of which witness to believe is one best addressed by the trial court.  The findings of fact of the judges who heard the evidence are accorded great respect and are seldom disturbed on appeal for they had the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses, and to determine by their demeanor on the stand the probative value of their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the ruling of the trial court which found Dr. Servando’s testimony more credible for the following reasons:<br><blockquote>“1.     It could not be gainsaid that Dr. Servando is a disinterested and unbiased witness.  She does not know the accused and she is not known to the accused.  She will not be benefited if the Court upholds her findings and she had no reason to testify falsely.  On the other hand, Dr. Gauzon was admittedly paid for his services, hence, it could not be truly said that he is an impartial and disinterested witness.  If his findings (are) upheld, the benefit to the practice of his profession is enormous;<br><br>“2.     As a government official, Dr. Servando has the presumption of regularity in the performance of her duty.  No such presumption arises in favor of Dr. Gauzon;<br><br>“3.     The findings of Dr. Servando that the accused is evasive and manipulative is supported by the Court’s own observation. x x x.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                          x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                             x x x</center><br>“4.     The conclusion of Dr. Gauzon is principally based on his interview with the accused and the members of the accused’s family.  It was the members of the accused’s family, the sister of the accused who informed Dr. Gauzon that at the age of 13, the accused began to use drugs.  The information that the family of the accused was impoverished; that the accused spent his adolescence in Metro-Manila; that the accused was a neglected child were all supplied by the kins of the accused who were not presented as witnesses. There was no showing that Dr. Gauzon took precautionary steps to validate the information.  On the other hand, Dr. Servando also conducted interview of the accused and his accompanying relatives including the BJMP guard who escorted him.  In addition, Dr. Servando conducted a series of written tests which are tailored to determine the mental capacity of a person.  The result of the written tests confirms the observation of Dr. Servando in the interview that the accused is evasive and manipulative.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Unlike in other jurisdictions, Philippine courts have established a more stringent criterion for the acceptance of insanity as an exempting circumstance.  In our jurisdiction, mere abnormality of the mental faculties is not enough; there must be a complete deprivation of intelligence in committing the act.<br><br>Every individual is presumed to have acted with complete grasp of one’s mental faculties.  Appellant’s past does not discredit the facts that (1) he did not act with complete absence of the power to discern;  (2) he was not deprived of reason; and (3) he was not totally deprived of his will.<br><br>As held in People vs. Madarang,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [27]</sup><br><blockquote>“An accused invoking the insanity defense pleads not guilty by reason thereof.  He admits committing the crime but claims that he is not guilty because he was insane at the time of its commission.  Hence, <i>the accused is tried on the issue of sanity alone and if found to be sane, a judgment of conviction is rendered without any trial on the issue of guilt as he had already admitted committing the crime.</i> x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Inasmuch as Belonio failed to present convincing evidence to establish his alleged insanity at the time he stabbed Tamayo, we are constrained to affirm his conviction.<br><br>We must add that we have meticulously reviewed the records of this case, especially the evidence of the prosecution.

However instead of awarding actual damages, we grant temperate damages in accordance with People vs. Andres,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> where the Court said:<br><blockquote>“[W]e declared in the case of People vs. Villanueva that:<br><blockquote>‘… when actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000, as in this case, the award of temperate damages for P25,000 is justified in lieu of actual damages of a lesser amount. Conversely, if the amount of actual damages proven exceeds P25,000, then temperate damages may no longer be awarded; actual damages based on the receipts presented during trial should instead be granted.’<br></blockquote>“The victim’s heirs should, thus, be awarded temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>Three Justices of the Court maintain their position that R.A.
