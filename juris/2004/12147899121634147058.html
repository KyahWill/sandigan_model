CV No. 43439.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of 8 July 1993 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Metro Manila, Branch 148, in Civil Case No. 89-3898.&nbsp; The trial court rendered judgment against Lito Gallego (“Gallego”) and declared Romeo and Vivien Galang (“Spouses Galang”), the owners of the parcel of land subject of this case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Antecedent Facts</span></div><br>Vive Realty Corporation (“VRC”) acquired several properties at a public auction held by the Municipal Treasurer of Parañaque (“Treasurer”) on 29 October 1982.&nbsp; Among these properties was a parcel of land (“Property”) with an area of 330 square meters located in Barrio Kaybiga, Parañaque, Metro Manila, and covered by TCT No. 435402.&nbsp; The Treasurer executed a Final Bill of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> over the Property in favor of VRC on 25 November 1983.&nbsp; VRC then filed a petition, docketed as Civil Case No. 5801, to cancel the titles of the properties VRC had purchased during the public auction.&nbsp; In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated 19 December 1983, the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 138 (“RTC-Branch 138”), ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel 11 transfer certificates of title, including TCT No. 435402, and to issue new titles in the name of VRC.<br><br>On 22 June 1984, the Spouses Galang purchased the Property from VRC through a Deed of Absolute Sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Register of Deeds later issued TCT No. (86872) 22786 over the Property in the name of the Spouses Galang.&nbsp; The Spouses Galang took possession of the Property and had it declared in their name for taxation purposes.&nbsp; They diligently paid the corresponding real property taxes.<br><br>In April 1989, Romeo Galang came home from Saudi Arabia and discovered a hollow block fence along the perimeter of the Property.&nbsp; Gallego built the fence in March 1989.&nbsp; Although the Spouses Galang brought the matter to the Barangay Lupon for possible settlement, Gallego failed to appear at the barangay hall and instead sent his lawyer.&nbsp; On 16 May 1989, the Spouses Galang filed a complaint for Quieting of Title with Damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against Gallego.&nbsp; The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 146<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (“RTC-Branch 146”).<br><br>In his Answer with Counterclaim, Gallego alleged that his brother, Bernabe Foster-Gallego, owned the Property.&nbsp; Gallego denied that his brother was delinquent in the payment of real property taxes.&nbsp; Gallego asserted that his brother had never received a notice of delinquency or a notice of the public auction of the Property, much less a copy of RTC-Branch 138’s decision cancelling TCT No. 435402.&nbsp; Gallego pointed out that TCT No. 435402 and Tax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaration No. A-022-00019 clearly indicated his brother’s address as No. 15 Tiller Green S.W. Washington D.C., USA. Since his brother is the true and lawful owner of the Property, Gallego argued that the Spouses Galang should not disturb his possession as caretaker of the Property.<br><br>As Gallego subsequently failed to appear at the pre-trial conference and to submit his pre-trial brief, RTC-Branch 146 issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> on 16 February 1990 declaring Gallego in default and allowing the Spouses Galang to present their evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>.&nbsp; On 10 March 1990, Gallego filed a motion to lift the order of default and to admit his pre-trial brief.&nbsp; On the same day, Bernabe Foster-Gallego (“petitioner”) filed a motion for intervention with an attached answer-in-intervention.&nbsp; RTC-Branch 146 denied Gallego’s motion but granted petitioner’s motion and admitted the answer-in-intervention.<br><br>RTC-Branch 146 set a pre-trial conference between the Spouses Galang and petitioner.&nbsp; However, the pre-trial did not push through because petitioner filed on 2 August 1990 a motion to admit third-party complaint, which RTC-Branch 146 granted.&nbsp; Summonses were issued on third-party defendant VRC, as well on the Municipality (now City), Treasurer, and Register of Deeds of Parañaque.&nbsp;&nbsp; VRC failed to file an answer to the third-party complaint.<br><br>The case was subsequently re-raffled to the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 65<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (“RTC-Branch 65”).&nbsp; On 4 March 1991, the Spouses Galang started presenting their evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> against Gallego.&nbsp; Petitioner filed a motion to strike out these proceedings and to hold in abeyance the hearing scheduled on 8 April 1991 on the ground that not all the third-party defendants had filed their answers and pre-trial briefs.&nbsp; RTC-Branch 65 denied the motion in an Order dated 6 May 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Gallego and petitioner jointly filed a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> with the Court of Appeals praying to annul the order.&nbsp; The appellate court dismissed the petition for lack of merit.&nbsp; Gallego and petitioner then elevated the matter to this Court, which denied their petition and subsequent motion for reconsideration for lack of reversible error.<br><br>The Spouses Galang continued to present their evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> against Gallego on 17 August 1992.&nbsp; On 24 August 1992, they submitted their written offer of evidence and RTC-Branch 65 deemed the case involving the Gallego and the Spouses Galang submitted for decision.&nbsp; RTC-Branch 65 also ordered the Spouses Galang and petitioner to submit their position papers on the procedure to receive further evidence in the case.&nbsp; Both parties complied in September 1992.<br><br>In October 1992, petitioner filed a motion to inhibit Judge Abad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Santos who granted the motion and inhibited himself.&nbsp; The case was re-raffled to the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 148 (“trial court”).&nbsp; The trial court eventually decided the original case in favor of the Spouses Galang, and denied petitioner’s intervention and third-party complaint.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Trial Court</span></div><br>The dispositive portion of the Decision of 8 July 1993 of the trial court reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against defendant Lito Gallego removing any cloud or quieting of title and ownership over the parcel of land covered by TCT No. (86872) 22786 of the Register of Deeds of Pasay City with an area of 330 square meters more or less situated in Barrio Kaybiga, Parañaque, Metro Manila, declaring them at this point in time as exclusive owner of said land and that said defendant Lito Gallego is hereby ordered to pay plaintiffs moral damages in the amount of <s>P</s>10,000.00;&nbsp; attorney’s fees in the amount of <s>P</s>25,000.00 including the appearance fees and <s>P</s>3,000.00 as litigation expenses.<br><br>With costs against the defendant Lito Gallego.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Dissatisfied with the trial court’s decision, Gallego and the Spouses Galang appealed to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The trial court also set for hearing the issue of whether trial on the merits should proceed on petitioner’s intervention and third-party complaint.&nbsp; After hearing the arguments of the parties concerned and receiving their respective memoranda, the trial court issued on 12 October 1993 the following Order:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered,<br><br>(1) the order admitting the Answer in Intervention by Bernabe Gallego is hereby reconsidered, and the Motion to Admit the same is hereby DENIED, and the Answer in Intervention is hereby stricken off the record.<br><br>(2) the third party complaint filed by Bernabe Gallego is hereby denied admission, and if it was already admitted, the admission is hereby reconsidered and said third party complaint is hereby stricken off the records.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner received the trial court’s order on 21 October 1993.&nbsp; Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on 5 November 1993, which the trial court denied.&nbsp; Petitioner received a copy of the trial court’s denial on 23 January 1995.&nbsp; Petitioner then filed on 26 January 1995 a notice that he was appealing the Order to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Instead of filing his own brief, however, petitioner joined in Gallego’s appeal.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span></div><br>The Court of Appeals held that petitioner had no legal personality to join Gallego’s appeal, thus:<blockquote>In fact, with the denial of his motion for intervention, intervenor-appellant never became a party to the case.&nbsp; Thus, he had no legal personality to join defendant-appellant in this appeal to impugn the decision of 8 July 1993, much less to use this appeal as a mode to question the orders denying his intervention.&nbsp; Under Section 2, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court, the Rule then prevailing at the time the intervention of intervenor-appellant was denied, any person desiring to intervene shall file a motion for leave of court and that allowance or disallowance of the motion is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; xxx once the court exercises its discretion, the same cannot be reviewed save in instances where such discretion has been so exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner in which case a petition for certiorari may be pursued.&nbsp; In other words, if intervenor-appellant believes that the lower court gravely abused its discretion in denying his motion for intervention, his proper forum is elsewhere and not in this appeal.<br><br>xxx<br><br>But even assuming that the questioned orders are final such that they can be the proper subject of appeal, an examination of the records will show that intervenor-appellant’s appeal was interposed out of time.&nbsp; The order of 12 October 1993 denying the motion for intervention of intervenor-appellant was received by him on 21 October 1993; hence, pursuant to Section 39 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, he only had a period of fifteen (15) days, or until 5 November 1993, within which to perfect an appeal.&nbsp; Intervenor-appellant instead filed a motion for reconsideration on 5 November 1993 but this was denied by the lower court on 26 December 1994, a copy of the order of which was served on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him on 23 January 1995.&nbsp; This means that intervenor-appellant had until the next day, 24 January 1995, within which to perfect his appeal considering that he filed his motion for reconsideration on the very last day to appeal.&nbsp; It will be noted, however, that intervenor-appellant failed to beat his deadline as he filed his notice of appeal only on 26 January 1995.&nbsp; This Court therefore has no jurisdiction to review the assailed orders as they already lapsed into finality. xxx<br><br>xxx<br><br>One last note.&nbsp; Intervenor-appellant is not without any remedy with the denial of his motion for intervention.&nbsp; Whatever right or interest he may have over the subject property will not in any way be affected by the judgment rendered against defendant-appellant.&nbsp; If indeed there were some irregularities in the sale at public auction of the property and in the cancellation of his title, intervenor-appellant may still avail of the proper remedies under the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>The Court of Appeals also affirmed the decision of the trial court but deleted the award of damages to the Spouses Galang for lack of basis, as follows:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the 8 July 1993 decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, with MODIFICATION that the award in favor of plaintiffs-appellants for moral damages, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses is DELETED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>Gallego and the Spouses Galang did not appeal the appellate court’s Decision of 22 July 1997.&nbsp; However, petitioner filed before this Court a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> assailing the Decision.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;

The ruling of this Court thus pertains to petitioner only.&nbsp; We will not delve into the issues between the Spouses Galang and Gallego.<br><br>In sum, the issues of this case are:&nbsp; (1) whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing petitioner’s appeal from the trial court’s orders disallowing petitioner’s intervention; (2) whether RTC-Branch 138’s Decision of 19 December 1983 can be declared void in an action for quieting of title; and (3) whether petitioner is an indispensable party to the action for quieting of title.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Court</span></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Court of Appeals Did Not Err in<br>Dismissing Petitioner’s Appeal</span></div><br>True, this Court has on occasion held that an order denying a motion for intervention is appealable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Where the lower court’s denial of a motion for intervention amounts to a final order, an appeal is the proper remedy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> as when the denial leaves the intervenor without further remedy or resort to judicial relief.<br><br>However, the issue of whether petitioner correctly appealed the assailed orders of the trial court to the Court of Appeals is beside the point since <span style="font-weight: bold;">petitioner did not interpose his own appeal</span>.&nbsp; Petitioner merely joined Gallego’s appeal from the trial court’s decision.<br><br>A prospective intervenor’s right to appeal applies only to the denial of his intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Not being a party to the case, a person whose intervention the court denied has no standing to question the decision of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Petitioner thus had no legal personality to join Gallego in assailing the decision of the trial court.&nbsp; Petitioner could question only the trial court’s orders denying his intervention and striking off from the records his answer-in-intervention, not the decision itself.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner filed his notice of appeal out of time.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ruled that:<blockquote>xxx The order of 12 October 1993 denying the motion for intervention of intervenor-appellant was received by him on 21 October 1993;&nbsp; hence, pursuant to Section 39 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, he only had a period of fifteen (15) days, or until 5 November 1993, within which to perfect an appeal.&nbsp; Intervenor-appellant instead filed a motion for reconsideration on 5 November 1993 but this was denied by the lower court on 26 December 1994, a copy of the order of which was served on him on 23 January 1995.&nbsp; This means that intervenor-appellant had until the next day, 24 January 1995, within which to perfect his appeal considering that he filed his motion for reconsideration on the very last day to appeal.&nbsp; It will be noted, however, that intervenor-appellant failed to beat his deadline as he filed his notice of appeal only on 26 January 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner disputes the appellate court’s findings.&nbsp; Petitioner claims that he filed his motion for reconsideration on 3 November 1993, and not on 5 November.&nbsp; The deadline for his appeal was on 25 January 1995 and not on 24 January 1995. &nbsp;Petitioner concedes that he filed his appeal a day late on 26 January 1993, but argues that this brief delay is strictly technical.<br><br>The records show that petitioner filed with the trial court his motion for reconsideration by registered mail on 3 November 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and not on 5 November.&nbsp; However, as petitioner himself admits, he still filed his appeal a day beyond the 25 January 1993 deadline.<br><br>An appeal from a court’s judgment or final order is a statutory right, subject to the law and the rules of procedure.&nbsp; The perfection of an appeal within the statutory or reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Failure to interpose a timely appeal renders the assailed decision final and executory, and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment or to entertain the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner lost his right to appeal when he exceeded the fifteen-day period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> granted by law.&nbsp; Petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration on the thirteenth day of his fifteen-day period to appeal.&nbsp; The filing of a motion for reconsideration merely suspends the running of the period to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Once the court denies the motion, the aggrieved party has only the remaining period from receipt of the order of denial to file his appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Petitioner thus had only two days from his receipt on 23 January 1995 of the trial court’s order denying the reconsideration, or up to 25 January 1995, to perfect his appeal to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Petitioner’s failure to interpose his appeal on time rendered the assailed orders of the trial court final.<br><br>Petitioner argues that his tardiness of one day is excusable, and cannot defeat his property rights.&nbsp; Petitioner does not, however, offer any valid justification for the late filing of his appeal.&nbsp; Petitioner merely cites the lame excuse that his counsel’s assistant attorney must have mistaken the handwritten received date of “1/23/95” on counsel’s copy of the trial court’s order denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration as “1/25/95”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Although the Court, under exceptional circumstances, has allowed late appeals in the interest of justice and equity, this only applies to highly meritorious cases to prevent a grave injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> That is not the case here.<br><br>The allowance or disallowance of a motion to intervene is addressed to the sound discretion of the court hearing the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This discretion, once exercised, is not reviewable by <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">mandamus</span> save in instances where such discretion is exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Petitioner has not shown that the trial court acted capriciously or arbitrarily. That the trial court initially allowed petitioner to intervene but subsequently reconsidered and withdrew its permission does not prove, by itself, that the trial court acted in a manner warranting review.&nbsp; This is certainly not the first time a trial court initially allowed a motion for intervention and later reconsidered and denied it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The trial court had a valid reason to deny petitioner’s intervention.&nbsp; An intervention is ordinarily not permitted if the prospective intervenor’s rights can be fully protected in a separate proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In this case, even if the trial court allowed it, petitioner’s intervention in the action for quieting of title would have been futile.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Reliefs Sought by Petitioner are Not Available<br>in an Action to Quiet Title</span></div><br>It is evident from most of the issues raised and the reliefs prayed for that petitioner’s principal aim is to overturn the 19 December 1983 Decision of RTC-Branch 138 (“RTC-Branch 138 Decision”) cancelling his title.&nbsp; Petitioner seeks to set aside the RTC-Branch 138 Decision, to uphold the validity of his title, and to annul the title held by the Spouses Galang.&nbsp; To this end, petitioner impleaded VRC, and the Municipality (now City), Treasurer and Register of Deeds of Parañaque in a third-party complaint, alleging that these parties committed fraud and deprived petitioner of due process.<br><br>However, these issues – whether fraud tainted the proceedings before RTC-Branch 138, whether the Treasurer of Parañaque notified petitioner of the public auction of the Property, and whether there was denial of petitioner’s right to due process – cannot be resolved in a proceeding for quieting of title.&nbsp; The only issue in an action to quiet title is whether there is a cloud on a title to real property because of any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding that has a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> appearance of validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The issues petitioner raised would also necessarily require the trial court to review the decision of another regional trial court.&nbsp; This is plainly beyond the powers of the trial court.&nbsp; Under the doctrine of non-interference, a trial court has no authority to interfere with the proceedings of a court of equal jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> much less to annul the final judgment of a co-equal court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The Court held in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

When a judgment of a lower court becomes final and executory, it is no longer reviewable, directly or indirectly, by a higher court, not even by the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, a certificate of title is not subject to collateral attack.&nbsp; An attack is collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the judgment is nevertheless made as an incident in the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Under the Property Registration Decree, titles issued under the Torrens system can only be altered, modified or cancelled in direct proceedings in accordance with the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner raised the alleged nullity of TCT No. (86872) 22786 in his answer-in-intervention to the suit the Spouses Galang filed to quiet title.&nbsp; The petitioners in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Villanueva v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> also raised the supposed invalidity of respondents’ titles in their answer to respondents’ complaint for recovery of ownership.&nbsp; The Court disallowed the defense on the ground that it was a collateral attack on respondents’ title, that is, an indirect challenge to the final judgment and decree of registration that resulted in the issuance of the assailed title.&nbsp;&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Villanueva</span>, the Court declared that Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree required no less than a direct action for reconveyance filed within the period provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that these rules do not apply to him.&nbsp; Citing <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ferrer v.

The void title referred to in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ferrer</span> was based on a free patent issued by the Director of Lands over alluvial property.&nbsp; The patent nullity of the assailed title in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ferrer</span> arose, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not from fraud or deceit</span>, but from the fact that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bureau of Lands had no jurisdiction</span> over land that had passed to private ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In this case, the trial court ordered the cancellation of petitioner’s title and the issuance of a new title to VRC. The trial court’s decision has long attained finality. Regional trial courts exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all civil actions involving title to real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The law authorizes regional trial courts, acting as land registration courts, to order the cancellation and issuance of certificates of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Unlike in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ferrer</span>, there is also insufficient evidence in the records to verify at this time petitioner’s allegations that RTC-Branch 138, the City Treasurer and Register of Deeds of Parañaque failed to observe the legal requirements of notice and due process on tax sales of real property.&nbsp; Worse, petitioner anchors many of his arguments assailing the public auction of the Property on the outmoded Assessment Law of 1939.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Presidential Decree No. 464 had long superseded the Assessment Law, which was no longer the applicable law when the tax sale of the Property took place in 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Petitioner’s allegations are better ventilated in a full-blown trial, and not in an action for quieting of title, which operates under the rules on declaratory relief.&nbsp; Petitioner’s charge that the proceedings and decision of RTC-Branch 138 were void because of alleged due process violations cannot be resolved in a suit to quiet title.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of whether a title was procured by falsification or fraud should be raised in an action expressly instituted for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Petitioner is Not an Indispensable Party<br>to the Action for Quieting of Title</span></div><br>An indispensable party is a party who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> A person is not an indispensable party if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is separable from the interest of the other parties, so that he will not necessarily be injuriously affected by a decree that does complete justice between the other parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> He is also not indispensable if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action or will simply avoid multiple litigations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, whose title RTC-Branch 138 cancelled, is not an indispensable party to the action for quieting of title.
