Agsalog heard loud noise coming from the Jessica Mae Videoke. When he went out of his stall, he saw Nola Matsumoto [owner of the videoke-bar] in-between Siblas and [the victim] trying to prevent further troubles from erupting. After that incident, Tony Opiña stood up and told [the victim] “<i><b>Vulva of your mother, you just slapped people, let us go home</b></i>.” After the lapse of 10 minutes, [the victim] with his brother, Jun Marzan returned to the Jessica Mae Videoke. Jun Marzan asked Nola who was at fault and she replied, “<i><b>your&nbsp; brother is at fault</b></i>”. Then the two (2) brothers left the place. But before leaving, [the victim] told Siblas that he would return, which he did after about 3 minutes.        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[The victim], on his return, shook hishands with Siblas, to settle their differences, and as a gesture of reconciliation, [the victim]invited both Siblas and Agsalog to their house for drinks as he is butchering a goat.Agsalog and Siblas accepted the invitation to go there after school hours. Then Agsalogand Siblas, after a few minutes, proceeded to the San Quintin National High School toresume their duties as teachers. At about 4:30 in the afternoon of the same day, Agsalogand Siblas riding in a tricycle driven by one Aquino arrived at the house of Ex-Brgy.Chairman Juan Opiña</span> [father of Edwin Opiña] at Brgy. Calonboyan, San Quintin, Pangasinan. Agsalog saw [the victim] sitting alone at the terrace of the house of Opiña. Agsalog, then asked [the victim] “<i><b>Bok where is the pulutan? I will get the drinks.</b></i>” [The victim] stood up and retorted “<b><i>Vulva of your mother, you could easily be baited.</i></b>” Agsalog thought that [the victim] is only joking, so he said to [the victim], “<i><b>Bring the pulutan out and we will get the drinks.</b></i>” [The victim] instead replied, “<b><i>Vulva of you mother, you look like pulutan.</i></b>” Agsalog said, “<i><b>Bok, you do not even respect us</b></i>”.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then [the victim] came down from the terrace and tried to grabAgsalogwhich the latter warded off. Both Agsalog and Siblas went out of the yardtowards thetricycle to leave but ‘[the victim] followed them. Then, [the victim] pushedSiblas andAgsalog, saying, </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>“Vulva of your mother, are you going to fight me?”</i></b>     <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Atthis stage,[the victim] was drawing a balisong from his waist and when he was about tothrust hisbalisong into Agsalog’s body, Agsalog also drew a knife and swung his arm,hitting [thevictim’s] body once. But still [the victim] grabbed Agsalog by the shoulder butAgsalogpushed him with his left arm. [The victim], then turned and went into the yard ofOpiña</span>       . Agsalog saw Edwin Opiña came out of the house and picked some stones, going near them, Agsalog told Edwin, “<b><i>Don’t go near-Don’t go near</i></b> (warning to us).&nbsp; x x x (Emphasis and italics in the original; underscoring supplied) </blockquote> Brushing aside appellants’ version, the trial court, by Decision of October 7, 1999, found them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, the dispositive portion of which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quoted verbatim</span>: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT of CONVICTION beyond reasonable doubt is hereby rendered against Abraham Agsalog and Jovito Siblas of the crime of <u style="text-decoration: underline;">aggravated</u><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Murder</u> and the Court sentences AGSALOG and SIBLAS to suffer the <u>penalty</u> of <u>DEATH</u> to be implemented in the manner as provided for by law; to pay the heirs of the victim, jointly and solidarily, the amount of P200,000.00 as actual damages; P75,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages and attorney’s fees in the amount of P10,000.00 and all accessory penalties of the law.<br><br>The Branch Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to prepare the mittimus and to transmit the entire records of this case to the Hon.

the prosecution claimed it was appellant Siblas’ right shoulder which the victim held, that could not have constituted actual or imminent peril to appellant Agsalog’s life, limb or right, especially in light of appellant Siblas testimony that after that stage of the incident, the victim and appellant Agsalog pushed each other.&nbsp; It is unthinkable for appellant Siblas to have missed witnessing the alleged attempt of the victim to stab appellant Agsalog if indeed there was such an attempt.<br><br>Absent thus any corroboration by independent and competent evidence of appellant Agsalog’s claim of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, it is extremely doubtful, hence, it cannot prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>There being no unlawful aggression, there is no self-defense, complete or incomplete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>That the stabbing could not have been carried out in self-defense draws reinforcement from the failure of

</div></blockquote></blockquote> With respect to the autopsy report, appellants contend that the fatal (second) stab wound which hit the right auricle of the victim’s heart was not inflicted by appellant Agsalog.&nbsp; Thus they explain: <blockquote>    The Autopsy Report (Exh. “G”, “G-1” and “G-2”) indicated that there were two (2) stab wounds, one which was inflicted medially on the upper middle portion of the abdomen, just above the navel that pierced the upper lobe of the lung,&nbsp; The other was directed downwards at the upper portion of the chest penetrating the right auricle of the heart and is the cause of death.&nbsp; The thrust through the abdomen, which is medially inflicted, is assumed that the knife is held level with the hand.&nbsp; On the other hand, the knife thrust through the chest, as it is on the downward stroke is assumed that the knife is held perpendicular to the hand.&nbsp; At the heat of the moment, it is not conceivable that the wielder of the knife changed the stance and grasp of the knife of the second thrust.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The knife thrust inflicted on the abdomen is admitted by the accused Agsalog, but he claimed only one thrust.&nbsp; As for the knife thrust through the chest, Agsalog denied ever inflictingit.</span> &nbsp; The deceased is taller by 4 – 5 inches than Agsalog, the knife thrust medially on the abdomen with the knife held level to the hand is expected for a smaller person.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But a knife thrust on a downward stroke on the upper portion of a taller person is impossible</span> to be inflicted by a smaller assailant.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fatal stab is not done by Agsalog</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> The claim that appellant Agsalog inflicted only the wound on the victim’s abdomen does not persuade, given Edwin’s and Soto’s positive claims in their respective sworn statements and at the witness stand that said appellant <b>twice</b> stabbed the victim.&nbsp; That the wound of the victim on his chest was “on a downward stroke” need not rule out its infliction by a smaller person facing him.&nbsp; It is possible that that wound on the chest was inflicted while the victim stooped in pain after being stabbed in the abdomen, or that appellant Agsalog raised his hand to insure that he would reach and stab the chest of the already wounded taller victim.&nbsp; Whatever it was, the fact remains that Edwin and Soto categorically declared that appellant Agsalog twice stabbed the victim.<br><br>With respect to the sworn statement of Aquino,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> appellants contend that the same shows that the “incident [which] was preceded by a fight” and culminated in a spur of the moment stabbing was an act of self-defense and “negates and likewise belies the testimony of Edwin Opiña [that he (Edwin) was with the deceased at the terrace when appellants arrived] and provides a doubtful ground to convict accused-appellants of murder.”<br><br>There is nothing in Aquino’s statement, however, from which to infer that there was unlawful aggression on the victim’s part such that self defense may be considered.&nbsp; Neither is there a declaration that the victim was alone at the terrace when appellants arrived.<br><br>At all events, appellants bewail the non-presentation by the prosecution of the doctor (who prepared the Autopsy Report) and of Aquino, thus denying them, so they claim, the opportunity to propound questions upon them.<br><br>The non-presentation by the prosecution of the doctor and Aquino as witnesses during the trial was the prerogative of the prosecution.&nbsp; If appellants wanted to question the two, nothing prevented them from presenting them as their own witnesses, but they did not.<br><br>In denying that conspiracy existed and that treachery and evident premeditation attended the stabbing, appellants proffer as follows, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quoted </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> <blockquote> Assuming <i>sans</i>  admitting that Edwin Opiña’s testimony is credible, Siblas, while holding Marzan’s hands, could not have expected Agsalog to stab Marzan.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It bears to stress thatbarely three (3) hours before the incident, at the </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Jessica Mae</i> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">  Karaoke Bar, Marzanslapped Siblas in the face.&nbsp; Siblas could only have thought that Marzan would do thesame thing again to him when without warning, Marzan put his right hand on his shoulder.</span> &nbsp;Marzan was very much taller and stouter than either of the two (2) accused-appellants.&nbsp; As such, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under the circumstances, it was but natural for Siblas react and to hold Marzan’;s right hand to prevent impending harm</span>.&nbsp; When Agsalog saw them, he could have perceived that Marzan <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intended to harm his friend</span> such that he went on his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">way to stab Marzan.</span>&nbsp; But on all indications, Siblas never knew nor acquiesced to Agsalog’s design.<br><br>It can thus be said that accused-appellants never consciously adopted the ‘means,’ ‘methods’ or ‘forms’ by which Agsalog killed the victim.&nbsp; The stabbing of the victim cannot be considered as sudden and unexpected to the point of incapacitating him to repel or escape it.&nbsp; In fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the victim sustained only two (2) stab wounds</span>.&nbsp; Had accused-appellants indeed have a preconceived plan to kill Marzan, the latter would have suffered more stab wounds.&nbsp; The crime was impulsively done at the spur of the moment.&nbsp; It should be borne in mind that the prosecution miserably failed to prove that accused-appellants hatched a conspiracy beforehand to kill Marzan.&nbsp; Their meeting was only casual and at the very least, the attack was done impulsively.&nbsp; Such being the case, the killing of the victim is not at all treacherous . . . <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </blockquote> On the assailed finding that there was conspiracy between appellants, anchored on appellant Siblas’ holding, at the time appellant Agsalog attacked the victim, of the right elbow and wrist of the victim who admittedly was very much bigger than them:&nbsp; As the prosecution claims that the victim placed his right hand on the left shoulder of appellant <u>Siblas</u> (the defense claims it was the shoulder of appellant <u>Agsalog</u> which the victim held), and the stabbing was sudden and swift, appellant Siblas’ holding of the victim’s elbow and wrist may not necessarily have meant to restrain the victim in order to insure that he would not put up a fight or defense. The holding of the victim’s right wrist and elbow by appellant Siblas could have been done in the course of the removal thereof from Siblas’ shoulder.&nbsp; At any rate, there is no showing that had not appellant Siblas held the victim’s wrist and elbow, appellant Agsalog would not have succeeded in stabbing the victim.<br><br>Conspiracy, which requires the same quantum of proof to prove the guilt of an accused, was thus not clearly established.<br><br>That conspiracy was not proven to have existed does not of course necessarily free appellant Siblas from liability.&nbsp; If appellant Siblas’ holding of the victim’s elbow and wrist constituted a crime in and by itself, then he should be held criminally liable.&nbsp; Appellant Siblas’ aforesaid act, under the proven circumstance, did not, however, amount to criminal offense giving rise to his individual culpability therefor.<br><br>As for the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, for it to be appreciated, the following requisites should be proven: (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime, (2) an overt act manifestly indicating that the culprit had clung to his determination, and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution, to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br> While the victim slapped appellant Siblas hours before the stabbing and it is thus not improbable for appellants to have hatched a plan to avenge the same, still, the circumstances <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as presented by the prosecution</span> fail to show <u>evident</u> premeditation, which must be based upon external acts and not presumed from mere lapse of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>People v.

and second, the applicability of the <b>doctrine of implied conspiracy</b> to implicate co-appellant Jovito Sablas to the killing of Eduardo Marzan.<br><br>The essence of treachery is that the attack comes without warning, done in a swift, deliberate and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The test of treachery may thus be expressed as follows:&nbsp; Did the assailant consciously or deliberately employ means, methods or forms in the execution of the criminal act which tended directly and especially to ensure the execution thereof without risk to the assailant himself arising from the defense which the victim might make?&nbsp; If in the affirmative, treachery can be appreciated to qualify the crime to <i>murder</i>.<br><br>Two conditions must concur in order for <i>alevosia</i> to be appreciated (a) the assailant employed means, methods or forms in the execution of the criminal act which gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate;

It may be gleaned from the records that at or about 4:30 p.m. on October 4, 1997, appellant Agsalog, while walking on the left side of the victim, Eduardo Marzan, towards the front gate of the victim’s house, suddenly moved one step forward, raised his shirt and drew a <i>beinte nueve</i> knife, executed a turn around and stabbed the victim twice, hitting the latter in the abdomen and chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Co-appellant Jovito Siblas was walking on the right side of the victim.&nbsp; It should be noted that the previous altercation which accurred at or around 2:00 p.m. in <i>Jessica Videoke</i> at San Quintin Public Market, San Quintin, Pangasinan was between the victim and co-appellant Siblas, <b>and not involving appellant Agsalog</b>.&nbsp; While walking towards his front gate, the victim, Eduardo Marzan, even apologized for the incident <b>to co-appellant Siblas</b> when he said, “<i>Pasensiya ka na Pare</i>” to manifest his desire to reconcile differences.&nbsp; From this fact alone, it may be observed that the victim did not possess a retaliatory disposition, but rather a conciliatory mood.&nbsp; Not even the slightest provocation on the part of the victim may be manifested, moments before his untimely death.<br><br>The victim was not in a position to defend himself against the swift, sudden and unexpected aggression of appellant Agsalog, who took out his knife and stabbed the victim to death.&nbsp; The unsuspecting victim was unarmed and defenseless against two persons.&nbsp; He had no idea whatsoever of the impending assault on his person as shown by his casual and conciliatory behavior while talking to appellants.&nbsp; More importantly, the victim did not foresee the fatal stabbing.<br><br>Appellant Agsalog’s surprise attack did not afford the opportunity for the unarmed victim to defend himself.&nbsp; He consciously or deliberately adopted the means of attack to accomplish the execution of the criminal act, thus establishing moral certainty that <i>alevosia</i> was present to qualify&nbsp; the killing of Eduardo Marzan to <i>murder</i>.<br><br>Granting <i>arguendo</i>, that a previous altercation involved assailant and victim, treachery can still be appreciated, provided there is a lapse of time between the altercation and the attack.&nbsp; In <i>People v.

Callejo, Sr., held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <blockquote> There may be still treachery even if before the assault, the assailant and the victim had an altercation and a fisticuff where, after the lapse of some time from the said altercation, the assailant attacked the unsuspecting victim without affording him of any real chance to defend himself.&nbsp; In this case, the appellant , armed with a gun, shot the victim as the latter was conversing with his wife and Beverly’s other guests in front of the gate of the latter’s house.&nbsp; The victim was unarmed.&nbsp; The attack of the appellant was sudden.&nbsp; The victim had no inkling that the appellant had returned, armed with a gun. </blockquote> The altercation between the victim and co-appellant Siblas at <i>Jessica Videoke</i> transpired at 2:00 p.m. while the fatal stabbing involving appellants occurred at about 4:30 p.m. at the foot of the gate of the victim’s house.&nbsp; There was a lapse of time between the altercation and the assault of approximately two and a half hours.&nbsp; In other words, the time interval between the altercation and the assault was sufficient to lower the victim’s defenses and set the stage for the unexpected attack by appellant Agsalog.<br><br><i>Alevosia</i> was present in this case as the assailant launched a surprise attack, suddently taking his knife from under his shirt.&nbsp; The unprovoked and unsuspecting victim was afforded no real chance to defend himself.<br><br>Even if the assailant frontally attacked the victim, treachery can be appreciated.&nbsp; The case of <i>People v. Prieto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> is illustrative: <blockquote> Treachery was attendant because the appellant suddenly and without provocation, stabbed Geraldo twice on the chest and abdomen when the unarmed victim opened the door to his house.&nbsp; The bare fact that the appellant was facing the victim when the latter was stabbed does not preclude treachery. </blockquote> In <i>People v. Perez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the Court held: <blockquote> That the victim was shot facing the appellant, as contended by the latter, does not negate treachery.&nbsp; The settled rule that treachery can exist even if the attack is frontal, as long as the attack is sudden and unexpected, giving the victim no opportunity to repel it or to defend himself.&nbsp; What is decisive is that the execution of the attack, without the slightest provocation from an unarmed victim, made it impossible for the latter to defend himself or to retaliate. </blockquote> In resolving whether there was a conspiracy between the two appellants, a brief discussion on the principle is appropriate at this point.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It arises on the very instant the plotters agree, <b>expressly or impliedly</b>, to commit the felony and forthwith decide to pursue it.&nbsp; Once this assent is established, each and every one of the conspirators is made criminally liable for the crime actually committed by any one of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Conspiracy may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Direct proof of conspiracy is rarely found; circumstantial evidence is often resorted to in order to prove its existence.&nbsp; In the absence of direct proof, the agreement to commit a crime may be deduced from the mode and manner of the commission of the offense or inferred from acts that point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action, and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It need not matter who inflicted the mortal wound, as the act of one is the act of all, and each of the actors incurs the same criminal liability.&nbsp; There is collective criminal responsibility in conspiratorial acts.<br><br>Conspiracy is <b>implied</b> when the accused had a common purpose and were united in its execution.&nbsp; Spontaneous agreement or active cooperation by all perpetrators at the moment of the commission of the crime is sufficient to create joint criminal responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It is manifested in the coordinated acts of the assailants, of one of them holding the hand of the victim while another was stabbing him and a third delivering fist blows on different parts of the body of the victim, and, when the victim was able to escape, of giving chase and the first accused shooting the deceased five (5) times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the <b>doctrine of implied conspiracy</b> should be applied against co-appellant Jovito Siblas.&nbsp; The records reflect that co-appellant Siblas, while nearing the gate of the victim’s house, and <u><b>simultaneously</b> with the forward, lunging movement of appellant Agsalog, <b>unexpectedly held the right hand of the victim with his two hands; one hand on the wrist, and the other hand holding the left hand just above the elbow of the victim.</b></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The act of suddenly holding the victim’s hand, simultaneously or contemporaneously to the stabbing of the victim by appellant Agsalog, rendered the victim immobile, vulnerable and prone to attack.&nbsp; This act of Siblas <b><u>evinces a common design, concerted action and unity of purpose with Agsalog’s thrusting of the knife</u>.</b>&nbsp; It exhibited a closeness and coordination in the manner of execution of Agsalog’s criminal act against the victim who was utterly defenseless.<br><br>In conspiracy, it is immaterial who inflicted the fatal wounds.&nbsp; Conspirators have collective criminal responsibility.&nbsp; In this case, both appellants are collectively liable for the crime as they <u><b>acted in unison</b></u>; by their very actions, appellants conspired with each other to kill the victim.&nbsp; <b>The acts of both appellant Agsalog and his co-appellant, Siblas, show a closeness and coordination in the manner of execution as to undoubtedly indicate a commonality of design and unity of purpose in killing the victim, Eduardo Marzan.</b>&nbsp; The acts of appellants show <b>unanimity in design, intent and execution</b> of the attack on the victim, making Siblas criminally liable as co-conspirator and co-principal of the fatal stabbing of Eduardo Marzan.&nbsp; Verily, the act of Agsalog by legal contemplation is the act of siblas.<br><br>In <i>People v. Ramil Gutierrez, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> we ruled that in conspiracy, it is not necessary to show that all the conspirators actually hit and killed the victim, since the act of each conspirators in furtherance of the common objective is the act of all: <blockquote> What is important is that all participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to unmistakably indicate a common purpose or design to bring about the death of the victim.&nbsp; The act of each conspirator in furtherance of the common purpose in contemplation of law is the act of all. </blockquote> The act of co-appellant in holding the victim’s right hand and elbow showed that he concurred in the criminal design of the actual assailant, Abraham Agsalog.&nbsp; Having joined in the criminal conspiracy, co-appellant Jovito Siblas in effect adopted as his own the criminal design of co-conspirator, appellant Agsalog.&nbsp; Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., writing for the Court in <i>People v. Manalo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> made this succinct observation: <blockquote> Indeed, the act of the appellant of holding the victim’s right hand while the victim was being stabbed by Dennis shows that he concurred in the criminal design of the actual killer.&nbsp; If such act were separate from the stabbing, appellant’s natural reaction should have been to immediately let go of the victim and flee as soon as the first stab was inflicted.&nbsp; But appellant continued to restrain the deceased until Dennis completed his attack.<br><br>Conspiracy was evident from the acts of the four accused, with two of them seizing the victim’s arms and holding him immobile, one holding his back, and another thrusting a knife on the victim.&nbsp; These acts indubitably point to a joint purpose, concerted action and community of interest.&nbsp; Having joined in the criminal conspiracy, appellant in effect adopted as his own the criminal design of his co-conspirators.&nbsp; Hence, as a co-conspirator whose participation emboldened the actual killer and contributed to the success of the common design, appellant is liable as a co-principal in the killing of Rodrigo. </blockquote> When there is conspiracy, treachery attends against all conspirators, although only one did the actual stabbing of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Lastly, it is a well-settled principle that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are accorded great weight and respect, even finality, on appeal unless the trial court has failed to appreciate certain facts and circumstances which, if taken into account, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Since no reversible error was committed by the court <i>a quo</i> in its evidentiary findings on treachery and conspiracy, the lower court’s appreciation of the foregoing in sustaining a murder conviction for both appellants must be upheld.<br><br>The penalty for <i>murder</i> is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to <i>death</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In view of the fact that no mitigating or aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the crime, the proper penalty to be meted under the <i>Revised Penal Code</i> is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Appellants should pay the heirs of the victim Eduardo Marzan civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> in the amount of P50,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and P50,000.00 as moral damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> all in conformity with prevailing case law.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>AFFIRM</b> the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Branch 46, finding appellants Abraham Agsalog @ Panto and Jovito Siblas y Obaña @ Bitong guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <i>murder</i> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that their sentence be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and order them to pay the heirs of Eduardo Marzan P50,000.00 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> People v.
