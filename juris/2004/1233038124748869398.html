Marcos Foundation (FEMF) came forward and agreed to fund the acquisition of the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;laboratory furniture, including the fabrication thereof.<br><br>Renato E. Lirio, the Executive Assistant of the FEMF, gave the go-signal to BIOTECH to contact a corporation to accomplish the project.&nbsp; On July 23, 1982, Dr. William Padolina, the Executive Deputy Director of BIOTECH, arranged for Philippine Laboratory Industries, Inc. (PHILAB), to fabricate the laboratory furniture and deliver the same to BIOTECH&nbsp; for the BIOTECH Building Project, for the account of the FEMF.&nbsp; Lirio directed Padolina to give the go-signal to PHILAB to proceed with the fabrication of the laboratory furniture, and requested Padolina to forward the contract of the project to FEMF for its approval.<br><br>On July 13, 1982, Padolina wrote Lirio and requested for the issuance of the purchase order and downpayment for the office and laboratory furniture for the project, thus: <blockquote> <ol><li>Supply and Installation of Laboratory furniture for the BIOTECH Building Project<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Amount</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><s>P</s>2,934,068.90</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>Supplier</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Philippine Laboratory Furniture Co.,<br> College, Laguna<br> Attention: Mr. Hector C.

WILLIAM PADOLINA, Director, asked plaintiff to supply and install several laboratory furnitures and equipment at BIOTECH, a research laboratory of herein defendant located at its campus in College, Laguna, for a total contract price of PESOS: TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE THOUSAND FIFTY-EIGHT &amp; 90/100 (<s>P</s>2,939,058.90);<br></li><br><li>After the completion of the delivery and installation of said laboratory furnitures and equipment at defendant’s BIOTECH Laboratory, defendant paid three (3) times on installment basis:<br></li><blockquote>a)&nbsp; <s>P</s>600,000.00 as per Official Receipt No. 253 dated August 24, 1982;<br><br>b)&nbsp; <s>P</s>800,000.00 as per Official Receipt No. 256 dated October 22, 1982;<br><br>c)&nbsp; <s>P</s>836,119.52 as per Official Receipt No. 202 dated August 11, 1983;<br><br>thus leaving a balance of PESOS: SEVEN HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE &amp; 40/100 (<s>P</s>702,939.40). </blockquote> <li>That notwithstanding repeated demands for the past eight years, defendant arrogantly and maliciously made plaintiff believe that it was going to pay the balance aforestated, that was why plaintiff’s President and General Manager himself, HECTOR C. NAVASERO, personally went to and from UP Los Baños to talk with defendant’s responsible officers in the hope of expecting payment, when, in truth and in fact, defendant had no intention to pay whatsoever right from the start on a misplaced ground of technicalities.&nbsp; Some of plaintiff’s demand letters since year 1983 up to the present are hereto attached as Annexes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H hereof;<br></li><br><li>That by reason of defendant’s malicious, evil and unnecessary misrepresentations that it was going to pay its obligation and asking plaintiff so many red tapes and requirements to submit, compliance of all of which took plaintiff almost eight (8) years to finish, when, in truth and in fact, defendant had no intention to pay, defendant should be ordered to pay plaintiff no less than PESOS: ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (<s>P</s>100,000.00) exemplary damages, so that other government institutions may be warned that they must not unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of the people they serve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></li> </ol></blockquote> In its answer, UP denied liability and alleged that PHILAB had no cause of action against it because it was merely the donee/beneficiary of the&nbsp; laboratory furniture in the BIOTECH; and that the FEMF, which funded the project, was liable to the PHILAB for the purchase price of the laboratory furniture.&nbsp; UP specifically denied obliging itself to pay for the laboratory furniture supplied by PHILAB.<br><br>After due proceedings, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice to PHILAB’s recourse against the FEMF.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">fallo</span> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, this case is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit without prejudice to plaintiff's recourse to the assets of the Marcos Foundation for the unpaid balance of <s>P</s>792,939.49.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </blockquote> Undaunted, PHILAB appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) alleging that the trial court erred in finding that:<br><blockquote><ol><li>the contract for the supply and installation of subject laboratory furniture and equipment was between PHILAB and the Marcos Foundation; and,<br></li><br><li>the Marcos&nbsp; Foundation,&nbsp; not the University of the Philippines, is liable to pay the respondent the balance of the purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></li> </ol></blockquote> The CA reversed and set aside the decision of the RTC and held that there was never a contract between FEMF and PHILAB.&nbsp; Consequently, PHILAB could not be bound by the MOA between the FEMF and UP since it was never a party thereto.&nbsp; The appellate court ruled that, although UP did not bind itself to pay for the laboratory furniture; nevertheless, it is liable to PHILAB under the maxim: “No one should unjustly enrich himself at the expense of another.”<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Present Petition</span><br></div><br>Upon the denial of its motion for reconsideration of the appellate court’s decision, UP, now the petitioner, filed its petition for review contending that:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO APPLY THE LAW ON CONTRACTS BETWEEN PHILAB AND THE MARCOS FOUNDATION.<br></li><br><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN APPLYING THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE OF UNJUST ENRICHMENT WHEN IT HELD THAT THE UNIVERSITY, AND NOT THE MARCOS FOUNDATION, IS LIABLE TO PHILAB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></li></ol> </blockquote>Prefatorily, the doctrinal rule is that pure questions of facts may not be the subject of appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as this mode of appeal is generally restricted to questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, this rule is not absolute.&nbsp; The Court may review the factual findings of the CA should they be contrary to those of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Correspondingly, this Court may review findings of facts when the judgment of the CA is premised on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On the first assigned error, the petitioner argues that the CA overlooked the evidentiary effect and substance of the corresponding letters and communications which support the statements of the witnesses showing affirmatively that an implied contract of sale existed between PHILAB and the FEMF.&nbsp; The petitioner furthermore asserts that no contract existed between it and the respondent as it could not have entered into any agreement without the requisite public bidding and a formal written contract.<br><br>The respondent, on the other hand, submits that the CA did not err in not applying the law on contracts between the respondent and the FEMF.&nbsp; It, likewise, attests that it was never privy to the MOA entered into between the petitioner and the FEMF.&nbsp; The respondent adds that what the FEMF donated was a sum of money equivalent to <s>P</s>29,000,000, and not the laboratory equipment supplied by it to the petitioner.&nbsp; The respondent submits that the petitioner, being the recipient of the laboratory furniture, should not enrich itself at the expense of the respondent.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>It bears stressing that the respondent’s cause of action is one for sum of money predicated on the alleged promise of the petitioner to pay for the purchase price of the furniture, which, despite demands, the petitioner failed to do.&nbsp; However, the respondent failed to prove that the petitioner ever obliged itself to pay for the laboratory furniture supplied by it.&nbsp; Hence, the respondent is not entitled to its claim against the petitioner.<br><br>There is no dispute that the respondent is not privy to the MOA executed by the petitioner and FEMF; hence, it is not bound by the said agreement.&nbsp; Contracts take effect only between the parties and their assigns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> A contract cannot be binding upon and cannot be enforced against one who is not a party to it, even if he is aware of such contract and has acted with knowledge thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Likewise admitted by the parties, is the fact that there was no written contract executed by the petitioner, the respondent and FEMF relating to the fabrication and delivery of office and laboratory furniture to the BIOTECH.&nbsp; Even the CA failed to specifically declare that the petitioner and the respondent entered into a contract of sale over the said laboratory furniture.&nbsp; The parties are in accord that the FEMF had remitted to the respondent partial payments <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> checks drawn and issued by the FEMF to the respondent, through Padolina, in the total amount of <s>P</s>2,288,573.74 out of the total cost of the project of <s>P</s>2,934,068.90 and that the respondent received the said checks and issued receipts therefor to the FEMF.&nbsp; There is also no controversy that the petitioner did not pay a single centavo for the said furniture delivered by the respondent that the petitioner had been using ever since.<br><br>We agree with the petitioner that, based on the records, an implied-in-fact contract of sale was entered into between the respondent and FEMF.&nbsp; A contract implied in fact is one implied from facts and circumstances showing a mutual intention to contract.&nbsp; It arises where the intention of the parties is not expressed, but an agreement in fact creating an obligation.&nbsp; It is a contract, the existence and terms of which are manifested by conduct and not by direct or explicit words between parties but is to be deduced from conduct of the parties, language used, or things done by them, or other pertinent circumstances attending the transaction.&nbsp; To create contracts implied in fact, circumstances must warrant inference that one expected compensation and the other to pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> An implied-in-fact contract requires the parties’ intent to enter into a contract; it is a true contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The conduct of the parties is to be viewed as a reasonable man would view it, to determine the existence or not of an implied-in-fact contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The totality of the acts/conducts of the parties must be considered to determine their intention.&nbsp; An implied-in-fact contract will not arise unless the meeting of minds is indicated by some intelligent conduct, act or sign.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In this case, the respondent was aware, from the time Padolina contacted it for the fabrication and supply of the laboratory furniture until the go-signal was given to it to fabricate and deliver the furniture to BIOTECH as beneficiary, that the FEMF was to pay for the same.&nbsp; Indeed, Padolina asked the respondent to prepare the draft of the contract to be received by the FEMF prior to the execution of the parties (the respondent and FEMF), but somehow, the respondent failed to prepare one.&nbsp; The respondent knew that the petitioner was merely the donee-beneficiary of the laboratory furniture and not the buyer; nor was it liable for the payment of the purchase price thereof.&nbsp; From the inception, the FEMF paid for the bills and statement of accounts of the respondent, for which the latter unconditionally issued receipts to and under the name of the FEMF.&nbsp; Indeed, witness Lirio testified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Now, did you know, Mr. Witness, if PHILAB Industries was aware that it was the Marcos Foundation who would be paying for this particular transaction for the completion of this particular transaction?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">I think they are fully aware.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td><div align="justify">What is your basis for saying so?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify">First, I think they were appraised by Dr. Padolina.&nbsp;

Marcos:<br><blockquote>YOUR EXCELLENCY:<br><br>At the instance of the national government, subject laboratory furnitures were supplied by our company to the National Institute of Biotechnology &amp; Applied Microbiology (BIOTECH), University of the Philippines, Los Baños, Laguna, in 1984.<br><br>Out of the total contract price of PESOS: TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE THOUSAND FIFTY-EIGHT &amp; 90/100 (<s>P</s>2,939,058.90), the previous administration had so far paid us the sum of <s>P</s>2,236,119.52 thus leaving a balance of PESOS: ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT &amp; 61/100 (<s>P</s>1,412.748.61) inclusive of interest of 24% per annum and 30% exchange rate adjustment.<br><br>On several occasions, we have tried to collect this amount from your predecessor, the latest of which was subject invoice (01643) we submitted to DR.

However, the FEMF failed to pay the last statement of account of the respondent because of the onset of the EDSA upheaval.&nbsp; It was only when the respondent lost all hope of collecting its claim from the government and/or the PCGG did it file the complaint against the petitioner for the collection of the payment of its last delivery of laboratory furniture.<br><br>We reject the ruling of the CA holding the petitioner liable for the claim of the respondent based on the maxim that no one should enrich itself at the expense of another.<br><br>Unjust enrichment claims do not lie simply because one party benefits from the efforts or obligations of others, but instead it must be shown that a party was unjustly enriched in the sense that the term unjustly could mean illegally or unlawfully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Moreover, to substantiate a claim for unjust enrichment, the claimant must unequivocally prove that another party knowingly received something of value to which he was <span style="font-weight: bold;">not entitled</span> and that the state of affairs are such that it would be unjust for the person to keep the benefit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Unjust enrichment is a term used to depict result or effect of failure to make remuneration of or for property or benefits received under circumstances that give rise to legal or equitable obligation to account for them; to be entitled to remuneration, one must confer benefit by mistake, fraud, coercion, or request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Unjust enrichment is not itself a theory of reconvey.&nbsp; Rather, it is a prerequisite for the enforcement of the doctrine of restitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Article 22 of the New Civil Code reads:<br><blockquote>Every person who, through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter <span style="font-weight: bold;">without just or legal ground</span>, shall return the same to him.&nbsp; (Boldface supplied)<br></blockquote>In order that <span style="font-style: italic;">accion in rem verso</span> may prosper, the essential elements must be present: (1) that the defendant has been enriched, (2) that the plaintiff has suffered a loss, (3) that the enrichment of the defendant is without just or legal ground, and (4) <span style="font-weight: bold;">that the plaintiff has no other action based on contract, quasi-contract, crime or quasi-delict</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>An <span style="font-style: italic;">accion in rem verso</span> is considered merely an auxiliary action, available only when there is no other remedy on contract, quasi-contract, crime, and quasi-delict.&nbsp; If there is an obtainable action under any other institution of positive law, that action must be resorted to, and the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">accion in rem verso</span> will not lie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The essential requisites for the application of Article 22 of the New Civil Code do not obtain in this case.&nbsp; The respondent had a remedy against the FEMF <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> an action based on an implied-in-fact contract with the FEMF for the payment of its claim.&nbsp; The petitioner legally acquired the laboratory furniture under the MOA with FEMF; hence, it is entitled to keep the laboratory furniture.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp;
