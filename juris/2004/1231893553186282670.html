How</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The OSG asserts that the rulings of this Court apply whether the motion filed by the public prosecutor was for the withdrawal of the Informations due to lack of probable cause or insufficiency of evidence.&nbsp; The OSG avers that the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the persons of all the accused, either by their respective arrests or by the filing of pleadings before the court praying for affirmative reliefs.<br><br>In her reply to the comment of the OSG, the petitioner insisted that she did not submit herself to the jurisdiction of the trial court by filing her motion to quash the Informations for lack of probable cause and to examine the witnesses before the issuance of the warrant of arrest against&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;her.&nbsp; As the trial court itself held, it had not yet acquired jurisdiction over her person.<br><br>In nullifying the assailed orders of the trial court, the appellate court ratiocinated as follows:<br><blockquote>To support these assigned errors, petitioner contends that the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion when he granted the Motion to Withdraw Informations filed by his trial prosecutor based on the Joint Resolution of the Department of Justice and in denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>We resolve to grant this petition considering that this contention is impressed with merit.<br><br>The rule, therefore, in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court, any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court.&nbsp; Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court, he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court.&nbsp; The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it.&nbsp; The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence.&nbsp; A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court which has the option to grant or deny the same.&nbsp; It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation (<span style="font-style: italic;">Crespo v. Mogul</span>, 151 SCRA 462).<br><br>However, if the trial court has failed to make an independent&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;finding of the merits of the case or make an independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case, but merely anchored the dismissal of the case on the revised position of the prosecution, the trial court has relinquished the discretion he was duty-bound to exercise because, in effect, it is the prosecution through the Department of Justice which decides what to do and that the trial court was reduced into a mere rubber stamp, in violation of the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Crespo vs. Mogul</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez vs. Court of Appeals</span>, 237 SCRA 576, 577), which is the situation obtaining in this case considering that the dismissal of the criminal cases against private respondents was based solely on [the] recommendation of the Secretary of Justice because the reliance of public respondent Judge was based solely on the prosecutor’s averment that the Secretary of Justice had recommended the dismissal of the case against private respondent which is an abdication of the trial court’s duty and jurisdiction to determine a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case, in blatant violation of the court’s pronouncement in <span style="font-style: italic;">Crespo vs. Mogul</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Perez vs. Hagonoy Rural Bank</span>, 327 SCRA 588).<br><br>Moreover, public respondent having already issued the warrants of arrest on private respondents which, in effect, means that a probable cause exists in those criminal cases, it was an error to dismiss those cases without making an independent evaluation especially that the bases of the probable cause are the same evidence which mere made the bases of the Joint Resolution dated June 11, 2002 of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br>Consequently, the dismissal order dated July 5, 2002 having been issued upon an erroneous exercise of judicial discretion, the same must have to be set aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </blockquote> We agree with the appellate court.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Crespo v. Mogul</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court held that once a criminal complaint or information is filed in court, any disposition of the case or dismissal or acquittal or conviction of the accused rests within the exclusive jurisdiction, competence, and discretion of the trial court.&nbsp; The trial court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it.&nbsp; A motion to dismiss the case filed by the public prosecutor should be addressed to the court who has the option to grant or deny the same.&nbsp; Contrary to the contention of the petitioner, the rule applies to a motion to withdraw the Information or to dismiss the case even before or after arraignment of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The only qualification is that the action of the court must not impair the substantial rights of the accused or the right of the People or the private complainant to due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> When the trial court grants a motion of the public prosecutor to dismiss the case, or to quash the Information, or to withdraw the Information in compliance with the directive of the Secretary of Justice, or to deny the said motion, it does so not out of subservience to or defiance of the directive of the Secretary of Justice but in sound exercise of its judicial prerogative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In resolving a motion to dismiss the case or to withdraw the Information filed by the public prosecutor on his own initiative or pursuant to the directive of the Secretary of Justice, either for insufficiency of evidence in the possession of the prosecutor or for lack of probable cause, the trial court should not rely solely and merely on the findings of the public prosecutor or the Secretary of Justice that no crime was committed or that the evidence in the possession of the public prosecutor is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction of the accused.&nbsp; As the Court emphasized in <span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the trial court must make an independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case and the evidence on record of the prosecution:<br><blockquote>Secondly, the dismissal was based merely on the findings of the Acting Secretary of Justice that no libel was committed.&nbsp; The trial judge did not make an independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case.&nbsp; Reliance was placed solely on the conclusion of the prosecution that “there is no sufficient evidence against the said accused to ascertain the allegation in the information” and on the supposed lack of objection to the motion to dismiss, this last premise being, however, questionable, the prosecution having failed, as observed, to give private complainant a copy of the motion to dismiss.<br><br>In other words, the grant of the motion to dismiss was based upon considerations other than the judge’s own personal individual conviction that there was no case against the accused.&nbsp; Whether to approve or disapprove the stand taken by the prosecution is not the exercise of discretion required in cases like this.&nbsp; The trial judge must himself be convinced that there was, indeed, no sufficient evidence against the accused, and this conclusion can be arrived at only after an assessment of the evidence in the possession of the prosecution.&nbsp; What was imperatively required was the trial judge’s own assessment of such evidence, it not being sufficient for the valid and proper exercise of judicial discretion merely to accept the prosecution’s word for its supposed insufficiency.<br><br>As aptly observed by the Office of the Solicitor General, in failing to make an independent finding of the merits of the case and merely anchoring the dismissal on the revised position of the prosecution, the trial judge relinquished the discretion he was duty bound to exercise.&nbsp; In effect, it was the prosecution, through the Department of Justice which decided what to do and not the court which was reduced to a mere rubber stamp in violation of the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Crespo v. Mogul</span>.<br><br>The dismissal order having been issued in violation of private complainant’s right to due process as well as upon an erroneous exercise of judicial discretion, the Court of Appeals did not err in setting aside said dismissal order and remanding the case to the trial court for arraignment of petitioner as accused therein and for further proceedings. </blockquote> Indeed, it bears stressing that the trial court is not bound to adopt the resolution of the Secretary of Justice since it is mandated to independently evaluate or assess the merits of the case and it may either agree or disagree with the recommendation of the Secretary of Justice.&nbsp; Reliance alone on the resolution of the Secretary of Justice would be an abdication of the trial court’s duty and jurisdiction to determine a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The trial court may make an independent assessment of the merits of the case based on the affidavits and counter-affidavits, documents, or evidence appended to the Information; the records of the public prosecutor which the court may order the latter to produce before the court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> or any evidence already adduced before the court by the accused at the time the motion is filed by the public prosecutor.<br><br>In this case, the trial court failed to make an independent assessment of the merits of the cases and the evidence on record or in the possession of the public prosecutor.&nbsp; In granting the motion of the public prosecutor to withdraw the Informations, the trial court relied solely on the joint resolution of the Secretary of Justice, as gleaned from its assailed order:<br><blockquote>For resolution is the Motion to Withdraw Criminal Informations filed on June 21, 2002 by the Office of the City Prosecutor, this jurisdiction, to which a Comment/Opposition thereto was filed by private complainant Domingo I. Orda, Jr. on July 2, 2002.<br><br>It appears that the motion is in compliance with the Joint Resolution of the Department of Justice (DOJ) promulgated on June 11, 2002 directing said Office to cause the withdrawal of the criminal informations for murder against the accused, Ligaya V. Santos, Edna Cortez, and Ronnie Ybañez, in Crim. Case No. 01-0921 (I.S. No. 01-F-2052) and against Christopher Castillo, Girlie Castillo, and Robert Bunda in Crim. Case No. 01-0425 (I.S. No. 01-H-3410), copy of which was received by this Court on June 19, 2002.<br><br>The Court, after going over the Comment/Opposition filed by the private complainant, vis-à-vis the Joint Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution of the DOJ, is of the firm belief and honest opinion and so holds that meanwhile that the Motion for Reconsideration of the private complainant is pending before the DOJ, justice and equity dictates that this Court has to give due course to the Motion to Withdraw the Criminal Informations, specially so that warrants for the arrest of all the accused have been issued.&nbsp; No injustice, prejudice, or damage will be suffered by the private complainant considering that if ever his Motion for Reconsideration will be granted by the DOJ, said criminal informations may be refiled and the principle of double jeopardy cannot be invoked by all the accused as the Court has not yet acquired jurisdiction over the persons.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, the warrants of arrest will serve as swords of damocles hanging over the heads of the accused if the Court will rule otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </blockquote> In granting the public prosecutor’s motion, the trial court abdicated its judicial power and acted as a mere surrogate of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br>Worse, as gleaned from the above order, the trial court knew that the Joint Resolution of the Secretary of Justice had not yet become final and executory because the respondent, the private complainant, had filed a timely motion for the reconsideration thereof which had not yet been resolved by the Secretary of Justice.&nbsp; It behooved the trial court to wait for the resolution of the Secretary of Justice on the motion for reconsideration of the respondent before resolving the motion of the public prosecutor to withdraw the Informations.&nbsp; In fine, the trial court acted with inordinate haste.<br><br>Had the trial court bothered to review its records before issuing its assailed order, it would have recalled that aside from the affidavits of Azarcon, Ernesto and Dennis, there was also the affidavit of Frias implicating the petitioner and the other accused to the killing of Francis and that it even gave credence to the testimony and affidavit of Azarcon when it denied Tonion and Soriano’s petition for bail.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial court found probable cause against the petitioner and issued a warrant for her arrest despite the pendency of her petition for review in the Department of Justice, only to make a complete <span style="font-style: italic;">volte face</span> because of the Joint Resolution of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br>The bare fact that the trial court had issued warrants of arrest against Santos, Cortez, the Castillo brothers, and Bunda, who were the petitioners in the Department of Justice, did not warrant an outright grant of the public prosecutor’s motion to withdraw the Informations.&nbsp; The court had already acquired jurisdiction over the cases when the Informations were filed; hence, it had jurisdiction to resolve the motion of the public prosecutor, one way or the other, on its merits.&nbsp; While it may be true that the accused could be incarcerated, as warrants of arrest had already been issued against them pending the resolution of the respondent’s motion for reconsideration, the same does not justify ignoring the rules and running roughshod over the rights of the respondent.&nbsp; Justice and equity is not for the accused alone; the State and the private complainant are entitled thereto, as well.&nbsp; Moreover, the petitioner had submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the court when she filed her motion to examine the witnesses, and suspend the proceedings and the issuance of a warrant for her arrest.<br><br>The trial court committed another travesty when it denied the motion for reconsideration of its July 5, 2002 Order, on its ratiocination that –<br><blockquote>In today’s hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration, considering that the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that their office will no longer file any opposition thereto, the said Motion for Reconsideration is denied considering that the filing and the withdrawal of an Information is purely an executive function and the Court cannot order the refiling if the Department of Justice or the Public Prosecutor’s Office refuses to do so. …<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>This is so because the July 5, 2002 Order of the court had not yet become final and executory when the private complainant filed her motion for reconsideration of the said order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Until and unless the July 5, 2002 Order shall have become final and executory, the Informations filed with the court were not yet considered withdrawn.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the trial court had granted the motion for reconsideration of the respondent and set aside its July 5, 2002 Order, there would no longer be a need to refile the Informations.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is DENIED DUE COURSE.&nbsp;
