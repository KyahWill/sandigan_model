				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a sworn complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Robert M. Visbal charged Judge Marino S. Buban, MTCC,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Branch 1, Tacloban City with Violation of Rule 3.05,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct and/or Failure to Decide a Case Within the Reglementary Period, Gross Inefficiency, Misconduct, Bias and Partiality&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;relative to Criminal Cases Nos. 98-07-19 and 98-07-20.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Complainant avers that respondent Judge failed to decide Criminal Cases Nos. 98-07-19 and 98-07-20 within the 90-day period from submission of the parties’s memoranda. &nbsp;Hence, complainant prays that respondent Judge be held administratively liable as well as criminally liable for Violation of Article 174<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code for his failure to disclose in his Certificates of Service from June 1999 that the subject cases were pending decision.<br><br>Complainant further alleges that respondent Judge displayed bias in favor of the accused in the above-mentioned criminal cases by his tolerance of the defense’s late filing of pleadings and failure to appear in court despite due notice. &nbsp;He claims that respondent Judge harbored a grudge against him because his wife filed an administrative complaint against the latter.<br><br>In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> respondent Judge denied the allegations in the complaint.&nbsp; He alleged that the subject cases were originally pending before the sala of Judge Paulino A. Cabello but were subsequently transferred to him after Judge Cabello inhibited himself from hearing the cases.&nbsp; He explains that his inability to dispose of the cases within the prescribed period was due to the failure of his staff to bring the cases to him for proper action. &nbsp;It was only on December 1, 1999 that his attention was called regarding these two cases which had been submitted for decision. &nbsp;However, after going over the memoranda of the parties and other pleadings, he found that the only way to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused is through a full-blown trial.&nbsp; Thus, he scheduled the cases for trial. &nbsp;He admits that he was unable to report the pendency of these two cases in his Certificate of Service because he was unaware that the period to decide them had already lapsed.<br><br>Respondent further averred that the administrative case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> filed by complainant’s wife against him was already dismissed by this Court in a Resolution dated August 11, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> &nbsp;He notes that complainant has the propensity of filing administrative cases against judges and fellow prosecutors, and he even filed an administrative complaint against Judge Cabello for inhibiting himself from hearing Criminal Cases Nos. 98-07-19 and 98-07-20.<br><br>On May 8, 2002, the complaint was docketed as a regular administrative matter and referred to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Tacloban City for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>Executive Judge Leonardo B. Apita inhibited himself in a letter dated June 13, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> stating that he was related to respondent Judge within the 6th degree of affinity.&nbsp; Thus, the case was referred to Vice Executive Judge Salvador Y. Apurillo.<br><br>In his Report dated March 24, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Judge Apurillo concluded that respondent Judge indeed failed to resolve the cases within the reglementary period, but found that part of the blame was attributable to his staff.&nbsp; Since respondent has a caseload of more than 1,000 cases, it could really happen that some important matters may be overlooked.&nbsp; While many lawyers try to help out judges by filing motions for early resolution, this did not happen in the subject cases. &nbsp;If respondent Judge was to be faulted at all, it would be for his failure to devise a system to keep track of the cases pending before him and to efficiently manage his personnel. For his transgression, Judge Apurillo recommended that respondent Judge be “sternly reprimanded.”<br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) agreed with the factual findings of Judge Apurillo but recommended that respondent Judge be fined in the amount of Three Thousand Pesos (P3,000.00).<br><br>As per Resolution of the Court dated February 11, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> both complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and respondent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; manifested their willingness to submit the case for resolution on the basis of the pleadings filed.<br><br>The reasons adduced by respondent for his delay in rendering judgment in Criminal Cases Nos. 98-07-19 and 98-07-20 are not novel. &nbsp;&nbsp;A judge cannot take refuge behind the mistakes and inefficiency of his court personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> &nbsp;He is charged with the administrative responsibility of organizing and supervising them to secure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, requiring at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, he is ultimately responsible for ensuring that court personnel perform their tasks and that the parties are promptly notified of his orders and decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> &nbsp;It is his duty to devise an efficient recording and filing system in his court to enable him to monitor the flow of cases and to manage their speedy and timely disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>If respondent Judge could not decide the case within the reglementary period, all he had to do was to ask from this Court a reasonable extension of time to dispose of the case, which may have been granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Rules 1.02 of Canon 1 and 3.05 of Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct state:<br><blockquote>Rule 1.02. – A judge should administer justice impartially and <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">without delay.</span></span><br><br>Rule 3.05. – A judge shall dispose of the court’s business <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">promptly</span></span> and decide cases <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">within the required periods</span></span>. (Emphasis and italics supplied)<br></blockquote>In this connection, SC Administrative Circular No. 13-87 states, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that:<br><blockquote>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Judges shall observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts</span></span>. Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts while all other lower courts are given a period of three months to do so. . . (Emphasis and italics supplied)<br></blockquote>We find the penalty recommended by the OCA not commensurate to the misconduct committed by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Section 7, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> classifies administrative charges as serious, less serious or light. Undue delay in rendering a decision or order is subsumed under less serious charges under Section 9. &nbsp;Pursuant to Section 11 (B) of the same Rule, such offense is punishable by suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month nor more than three (3) months or a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00. &nbsp;Therefore, the imposable penalty warranted in this case is a fine of P11,000.00.<br><br>The resolution of this case will not, however, be complete without passing upon complainant’s unusual proclivity of filing several administrative cases against respondent. &nbsp;A verification with the Docket and Clearance Division of the OCA discloses that complainant prosecutor had so far filed the following administrative complaints against respondent Judge: <br><blockquote><table style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: justify;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td>1)</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>A.M.

Complainant thereafter filed his Compliance stating that although some of those administrative complaints may not have merited the judicious evaluation of this Court, it is his honest belief that the administrative complaints he filed were well-founded. &nbsp;Furthermore, he had noble intentions of particularly bringing to the attention of this Court the abuses and irregularities in the lower court for appropriate action.<br><br>We find complainant’s explanation unsatisfactory.&nbsp; His propensity to litigate raises doubts as to how he could find the time to perform his duties at all. &nbsp;Such an excessive tendency to complain even the slightest of administrative infractions in some of the cases constitutes an oppressive and gross abuse of legal processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;This imposes on the precious time of the Court and impedes the speedy and efficient dispensation of justice. &nbsp;Complainant should be reminded that it is the duty of a lawyer as an officer of the court not to foment suits among individuals.<br><br>A lawyer owes to society and to the court the duty not to stir up litigation. &nbsp;The Code of Professional Responsibility states that “a lawyer shall not, for any corrupt motive or interest encourage any suit or proceeding.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> &nbsp;Thus, a lawyer is ordered “not to become an instigator of controversy and a predator of conflict instead of a mediator of concord and a conciliator for compromise, a virtuoso of technicality in the conduct of litigation instead of a true exponent of the primacy of truth and justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> &nbsp;In fact, lawyers are called upon to resist the whims and caprices of their clients and to temper the latter’s propensity to litigate because the Lawyer’s Oath to uphold the cause of justice is superior to his duty to his clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The foregoing dictum which is embodied in the Canons of Professional Responsibility applies with equal vigor to lawyers in the government service like complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Indeed, Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility explicitly states that –<br><blockquote>Rule 7.03. – A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, <span style="font-style: italic;">whether in public or private life</span>, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Government lawyers who are public servants owe utmost fidelity to the public service because public service is a public trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> &nbsp;A lawyer does not shed his professional obligations upon assuming public office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> &nbsp;In fact, his professional obligations should make him more sensitive to his official obligations because a lawyer’s disreputable conduct is more likely to be magnified in the public eye.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It is worthy to note that complainant has already been cited by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Visbal v.

Indeed, a person who accuses a judge of this very serious offense must be sure of the grounds for the accusation, or else be found ignorant of the law, as in this case</span></span>. Judges, while expected to be a cut above the rest in the legal profession, are not inured to the strain concomitant with baseless and unfair aspersions on their competence. They certainly deserve a better treatment, especially from a prosecutor who should know, at the very least, the basic provisions of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.
