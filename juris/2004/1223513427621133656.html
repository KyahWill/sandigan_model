Aspe, posing as the buyer, agreed to buy 250 grams of <i>shabu</i> from the appellant.&nbsp; The transaction was arranged to take place at dawn of September 11, 1997 in front of the house rented by Yong at No. 58 France St., Better Living Subdivision, Parañaque City, for the price of P1,000 per gram of shabu, or a total of P250,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Yong and Aspe also agreed over the phone that Yong would call the civilian informant at 4:00 a.m. on September 11, 1997 to confirm the transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Campos formed a team to conduct buy-bust operations to entrap Yong.&nbsp; Campos, the team leader, designated Aspe as the poseur-buyer, SPO1 Danilo Castro as the arresting officer and Chief Inspector Teofilo M.

Z124028 and J865397 which he placed on top of a bundle of newspapers cut in the same size and shape.&nbsp; He also placed a genuine P500 bill bearing Serial No. V164455<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on top of another bundle, making it appear that each bundle contained genuine P1,000 and P500 bills amounting to P250,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Aquino placed his initials on the said bills<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and placed the bundles in a white plastic bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>At about 10:00 p.m. of September 10, 1997, Campos conducted a closed-door briefing on how the entrapment would be effected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He gave the members of the team a description of Yong, the plate number of the car he was using and the arrangements on the particulars of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He explained that the civilian informant would introduce Aspe to Yong as the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; After completion of the “sale,” Aspe would give the signal by scratching his nape or raising his hand.&nbsp; Castro and the security unit, deployed in strategic places nearby, would then rush to the scene.&nbsp; Castro would be the one to place Yong under arrest.&nbsp; For his part, Campos would be driving within the vicinity of the house in his car.<br><br>At about 4:00 a.m. of September 11, 1997, the civilian informant told Campos that Yong had called and confirmed that the sale would proceed at about 5:00 a.m.&nbsp;

The police officers were in place before 5:00 a.m. and waited for Yong to arrive.<br><br>At about 5:30 a.m., a 1990 gray Toyota Corolla car bearing Plate No. PMM 306 stopped in front of the steel gate at No. 58 France St.&nbsp; Yong was at the wheel.&nbsp; Per record of the Land Transportation Office, the car was registered in the name of Marites Amto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The passenger side of the car beside the driver’s seat was facing the gate of the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> When a man alighted from the car, the civilian informant confirmed to Aspe that he was Yong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Aspe and the informant were carrying two semi-transparent plastic bags containing the “money.” The two of them walked towards Yong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The informant then introduced Aspe to Yong as the buyer of shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp;

Castro, Abogado, Andrada and the other police officers forthwith rushed to the scene and identified themselves as members of the PNP Narcotics Group.&nbsp; Castro arrested and handcuffed Yong.&nbsp; When informed of the situation, Aquino contacted Campos and told the latter that the buy-bust operation had been concluded.&nbsp; The two rushed to the scene.<br><br>To avoid alerting his neighbors and the consequent embarrassment, Yong suggested to the group that they go inside the house to talk.&nbsp; Aspe balked at first, thinking that they could be killed inside the house.&nbsp; He relented when he realized that there were several police officers with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Yong, Aspe, Castro, Campos, Andrada and Abogado went inside with the handcuffed Yong in tow.&nbsp; They found Carla Bernabe, a 29-year-old native of Sto. Tomas, Pangasinan; Marites Amto, Yong’s 22-year-old common-law wife, and their young child inside the house.<br><br>Yong and Campos went up to the second floor where Yong gave about 40 grams of <i>shabu</i> to Campos in an effort to dissuade the latter from charging him for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.&nbsp; Campos took the drug and later turned it over to Aspe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Campos and the other police operatives searched the rooms of the house without Yong’s permission and found 1.5 kilos more of the prohibited drug.&nbsp; Campos also turned this over to Aspe.&nbsp; Yong, Amto and Bernabe were brought to Camp Crame where they were detained.<br><br>Aspe turned over the 40 grams of <i>shabu</i> as well as the six sachets which also contained the drug to Aquino.&nbsp; The substance was placed in a brown envelope,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which, all in all, contained seven plastic bags, marked therein as Exhibits “A” to “G,” with a total weight of 286.31 grams.&nbsp; Campos wrote the Director of the PNP Crime Laboratory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> requesting that an examination of the substance be conducted.&nbsp; SPO1 Paranal delivered the specimen to the Crime Laboratory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> to Officer-on-Duty SPO2 Villanueva, who then turned it over to Forensic Chemist Leslie Maalad.&nbsp; Maalad placed his initials on the specimen, and conducted a qualitative examination using the Simon and Marquiz tests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; He also conducted another confirmatory test, the Thin Layer Chromatograph Test.&nbsp; Maalad signed Report No. D-2402-97 stating that the tests confirmed that the substance contained in the envelope was methamphetamine hydrochloride, more popularly known as <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Castro executed an affidavit on the arrest of Yong, Bernabe and Amto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Campos filed a letter-complaint against the three with the Department of Justice for violation of Rep.

The armed men searched the room without asking her permission.&nbsp; They did not show her any search warrant.&nbsp; They then searched the rest of the house.&nbsp; After one hour, they took Yong and Añoso with them.&nbsp; Añoso returned at about 11:00 a.m. and told her that they were taken to Camp Crame and Yong was still there.&nbsp; At 6:00 a.m. the next day, the three armed men returned with three or six more companions.&nbsp; The intruders ordered her to answer the telephone if it rang and to use the speakerphone.&nbsp; When the intruders left at 11:00 a.m., they took Bernabe and Amto with them.&nbsp; She did not report the incidents to the barangay and police authorities.<br><br>Emilio Balisa, a <i>balut</i> vendor, corroborated the testimonies of Añoso and Ciruelas.&nbsp;

Suddenly, an armed man barged into her room, introduced himself as a police officer and forced her to go to the sala.&nbsp; About five to eight more armed men forced the other members of the household into the sala.&nbsp; They searched the entire house but found nothing.&nbsp; Yong was handcuffed and was brought inside the house and on to the second floor.&nbsp; After an hour or so, the group came down.&nbsp; At around 11:00 a.m., the armed men left, bringing with them Yong and Añoso.<br><br>The next day, at around 6:00 a.m., Bernabe was asleep.&nbsp; She suddenly heard someone knocking.&nbsp; Añoso answered the door and inquired who it was.&nbsp; It was Campos, who shouted and threatened to kill Añoso if he did not open the door.&nbsp; When Añoso did as he was told, Campos and four to five other men, likewise armed, entered the house.&nbsp; They searched the premises without any search warrant.&nbsp; At around 11:00 a.m., the armed men left, and brought Yong’s wife, Amto, with them.<br><br>Alfredo Uy, Jr. testified that Yong was his godfather.&nbsp; At 8:00 a.m. of September 12, 1997, he went to the house at No. 58 France St. to pay his obligation with Yong in the amount of P18,000.&nbsp; He had P100,000 in a plastic bag which he planned to deposit at the PCI Bank, Parañaque branch.&nbsp; The housemaid let him into the house.&nbsp; He was surprised when armed men accosted him by the door and asked why he was there.&nbsp; He replied that he was going to pay his account with Yong.&nbsp; When they learned that he had money, the armed men divested him of the same, totaling P118,000, and ordered him to remain in the sala.<br><br>Before noon, the armed men left the house, and brought Uy with them to Camp Crame.&nbsp; Uy was allowed to leave only at about 7:00 p.m.&nbsp; He was shocked at the incident and proceeded to the San Juan de Dios Hospital for medical examination.&nbsp; The next day, he went to the Parañaque police station and had the incident placed in the police blotter.<br><br>Marites Amto corroborated Bernabe’s testimony.&nbsp; She testified that she had been the common-law wife of Yong since 1996.&nbsp; The latter had investments in the Hongkong stock market.&nbsp; He also bought RTW clothes in Hongkong and had the same sold in Baclaran.<br><br>Yong testified that he was a Chinese citizen from Hongkong and was a freelance tourist guide.&nbsp; He came to the Philippines in 1982 as a tourist and he was given a resident visa in 1983.&nbsp; He met then Major Campos for the first time towards the end of August 1997.&nbsp; Yong met him again during the first week of September 1997.&nbsp; Andy Chan, a stockbroker and a Chinese resident of Hongkong, was his good friend.&nbsp; He saw Chan in the Philippines three or four times. &nbsp;He gave Donna’s beeper number to help him collect the P1,700,000 which she owed to Chan.&nbsp; Donna (the informant) was Major Campos’ girlfriend.&nbsp; At 12:30 p.m. of September 10, 1997, he and Donna went to the Holiday Inn Hotel along Roxas Boulevard, Manila, where Donna paid Chan P1,200,000.&nbsp; She promised to remit the rest of the money at 5:00 p.m. that day, but failed to do so.&nbsp; In the meantime, he went back to No. 28 J. Francisco St., BF Resort, Las Piñas City.&nbsp; He intended to deposit the money at the Tim Hang Jewelry Shop in Ongpin St.<br><br>At about 2:00 a.m. of September 11, 1997, Yong, along with Ciruelas and Añoso, went to the Shell station along the CAA Road to inflate the tires of the car.&nbsp; Ciruelas proceeded to the Select store.&nbsp; They had just come from his house at BF Resort and were on their way to Yong’s house at No. 58 France St.&nbsp; Momentarily, a car arrived.&nbsp; Campos and Andrada alighted.&nbsp; Yong was brought to the car, blindfolded and handcuffed.&nbsp; Both cars drove off to a rest house.&nbsp; Campos demanded to know where the P1,700,000 was and replied that the money was in his house.&nbsp; After about three hours, Yong’s blindfold was removed.&nbsp; He and Añoso were then brought to No. 58 France St.&nbsp; Campos, Andrada and other police officers searched the house and found two bags containing P1,700,000.&nbsp; The men took the money.&nbsp; At about 10:00 a.m., Campos and the police officers brought Yong and Añoso to Camp Crame, Quezon City, where they were detained.&nbsp; The P1,700,000 taken by Campos and the police officers was later returned to Chan.<br><br>The prosecution presented Campos anew on rebuttal to controvert some portions of Yong’s testimony.&nbsp; Campos denied that Donna was his girlfriend, and asserted that she was one of the civilian informants in connection with the buy-bust operation against Yong.&nbsp; He clarified that he had come to know her a month before the operation.&nbsp; Campos also testified that the police officers effected the buy-bust operation against Yong past midnight, at about 1:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. of September 11, 1997.&nbsp; He also said that the first time he saw Yong was when the latter was arrested.<br><br>The trial court thereafter rendered judgment convicting Yong of both crimes.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, finding accused Yong Fung Yuen GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in both cases, he is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of six months of <i>arresto mayor</i> as minimum to 4 years and two months of <i>prision correccional</i> as maximum in Criminal Case No. 97-840 and the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 in Crim.

THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE PROSECUTION MUST RELY ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS OWN EVIDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote>The threshold issue raised by the appellant may be synthesized, thus: whether or not the trial court erred in giving credence and probative weight to the collective testimonies of the police officers who testified for the prosecution that the appellant was arrested, detained and charged as an aftermath of a buy-bust operation, over the appellant’s testimony and those of his witnesses that he was a victim of a vicious frame-up and <i>huli-dap</i>.<br><br>The appellant asserts that the credibility of Campos, Castro, Aquino and Aspe and the probative weight of their testimonies were debilitated by substantial self-contradictions and inconsistencies, leaving no other conclusion that he was a victim of a vicious frame-up and <i>huli-dap</i> staged and managed by Campos.&nbsp; He contends that he was arrested and detained without a warrant of arrest; that his house was searched without any search warrant therefor, solely to compel him to return the P1,700,000 that Donna, Campos’ girlfriend, had paid to Chan through him.&nbsp; According to the appellant, Aspe, Castro and Aquino and even Campos himself were one in saying that the buy-bust operation was effected at about 5:30 a.m. in September 1997.&nbsp; However, on rebuttal, Campos testified that the operation was effected by the police officers past 1:00 a.m. on to 2:00 a.m.&nbsp; Campos also testified that he met the appellant for the first time only when the latter was arrested on September 11, 1997, but contradicted himself when he testified on rebuttal that he had already met the appellant at the casino of the Heritage Hotel even two weeks before.&nbsp; Aquino, Castro and Aspe, likewise, testified that the civilian informant was a male, only to be later contradicted by no less than Campos himself, who testified on rebuttal that the civilian informant was Donna.&nbsp; According to the appellant, while Aquino and Castro testified that the civilian informant was in attendance during the pre-operation briefing, Aspe testified that the civilian informant arrived only after the conference.&nbsp; Aspe’s testimony that he met the appellant for the first time only during the buy-bust operation was belied by Campos when the latter stated that a day or two before September 11, 1997, Aspe was already introduced to the appellant.&nbsp; Furthermore, Castro’s testimony on the quantity of <i>shabu</i> confiscated from the appellant during the operation was discordant.&nbsp; He at first claimed that the appellant sold 250 grams of <i>shabu</i> to Aspe, only to contradict himself later when he testified on cross-examination that the <i>shabu</i> weighed only 40 grams.&nbsp; Considering Campos’ self-contradicting account, the inconsistencies in his testimony as well as those of Aspe, Castro and Aquino on the evidence-in-chief of the prosecution, the appellant contends that the evidence of the prosecution falls short of the quantum of proof required for his conviction.<br><br>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) brushed aside, as minor and peripheral, the inconsistencies catalogued by the appellant. &nbsp;According to the OSG, such inconsistencies did not affect the substance of the testimony of the witnesses of the prosecution, and even served to strengthen their credibility.<br><br>The appeal is dismissed.<br><br>The appellant’s reliance on Campos’ answers to questions propounded by his counsel on cross-examination to support a plea for acquittal is unacceptable.&nbsp; It is hornbook doctrine that a witness’ testimony must be considered in its entirety and not by truncated portions or isolated passages thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In <i>People v. Ortega</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we held that it is sound policy that self-contradictions in testimonies should be reconciled, if possible; contradictory statements should be considered in light of explanations and attending circumstances and whether inconsistencies result from misconceptions of an innocent witness or are a result of mere willful and corrupt misrepresentation.&nbsp; This Court has held that even the most candid of witnesses commit mistakes and may even make confused and inconsistent statements.&nbsp; Evidently, the testimony of Campos on rebuttal, that the buy-bust operation against the appellant on September 11, 1997 was launched past 1:00 a.m. on to 2:00 a.m., is inconsistent with the testimonies of Aspe, Castro, Aquino and even Campos himself on the prosecution’s evidence-in-chief that the buy-bust operation against the appellant on the said date took place at 5:30 a.m.&nbsp; But after calibrating the testimonies of the witnesses of the prosecution on its evidence-in-chief, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the testimony of Campos on rebuttal, we find the testimony of Campos on rebuttal unreliable and cannot prevail over his previous testimony and those of Aspe, Castro and Aquino on the evidence-in-chief of the prosecution.<br><br>Aspe, Castro, Aquino and Campos testified on the evidence-in-chief of the prosecution, from January to May 1998, that the buy-bust operation took place at 5:30 a.m.&nbsp; Campos testified on June 24 and July 8, 1998 for the prosecution on its evidence-in-chief and corroborated the testimony of Aspe, Castro and Aquino.&nbsp; It was only on June 15, 2000, or two years after his testimony on the evidence-in-chief of the prosecution, that Campos testified on rebuttal and claimed that the buy-bust operation took place at about 1:00 a.m. and on to 2:00 a.m.&nbsp; In <i>United States v. Chandler</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the appellate court ruled that the testimony of a person relating the circumstances of an incident at a time comparatively nearer to its occurrence, when his memory may be presumed to have been fresh will go far towards impeaching the accuracy of a different or contradictory account delivered by him or a witness at a much later time.&nbsp; As between the collective testimonies of Aspe, Castro, Aquino and Campos in 1998 when the circumstances of the buy-bust operation were still fresh in their minds, and Campos’ unexplained testimony on rebuttal only on June 15, 2000, two years after the buy-bust operation, we find the testimonies of Aspe, Aquino, Castro and Campos in 1998 more reliable.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that Campos testified falsely on rebuttal is no reason why the testimonies of Aspe, Aquino and Castro should be disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>There is no inconsistency between the testimony of Aspe and Campos on the prosecution’s evidence-in-chief that the civilian informant who accompanied the police officers from Camp Crame to France St. was a male, and Campos’ testimony on rebuttal evidence that Donna was a civilian informant in the buy-bust operation against the appellant.&nbsp; Campos testified on rebuttal that Donna was <i>only one</i> of the civilian informants in connection with the buy-bust operation.&nbsp; Campos did not testify that Donna was the only civilian informant involved in the buy-bust operation against the appellant:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td scope="row" width="13%">Q. <br></td><td width="87%">By the way, what do you mean by confidential informant?</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>She is providing us intelligent informations of illegal activities of such persons, sir. </td></tr><tr><td scope="row">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>And what was the participation of this Donna in the buy-bust operation against Yong Fung Yuen on September 11, 1997?</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>She was one of the informants used by Capt.

Act No. 6425, as amended.&nbsp; There was no need for them to still return to the appellant’s house in the morning of September 12, 1997 to conduct another intensive search of the premises.&nbsp; After all, if the appellant were to be believed, Campos had already taken the P1,700,000 which Donna had earlier paid to the appellant and the P50,000 from his shoulder bag.<br><br>The testimonies of Ciruelas and Abenoja, that the appellant was engaged in the business of importing RTW clothes and VCDs, is belied by the appellant’s own testimony that he was a freelance tourist guide.&nbsp; He failed to adduce any documentary evidence from the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Parañaque City government to prove that he was engaged in business in Parañaque City, or elsewhere in the Philippines for that matter.&nbsp; Thus, the appellant failed to prove that he had a legitimate source of income.&nbsp; He maintained two families and rented two houses: one at No. 28 J. Francisco St., BF Resort, Las Piñas City, and the other at No. 58 France St., Better Living Subdivision, Parañaque City.&nbsp; He also maintained a girlfriend, Harriet “Mayette” Ciruelas, who was residing with his wife, Marites Amto.&nbsp; Certainly, supporting two families, two households, and a girlfriend required much more than the earnings of a mere freelance tourist guide.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque City, Branch 259, subject of the appeal is <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>.&nbsp; Costs against the appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairman), Quisumbing, Austria-Martinez</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tinga, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Also known as Johnny Yong or Robert Yong.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, 24 June 1998, pp. 7-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit “S.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exhibit “R.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, 8 July 1998, p. 22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, 24 June 1998, pp. 14-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 10-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, 20 May 1998, pp. 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, pp. 24-26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Exhibit “P.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Exhibits “C-1” to “C-2.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Exhibit “P.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Exhibit “C-3.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, p. 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> TSN, 24 June 1998, p. 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 18-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, p. 61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Records, p. 72.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, p. 57.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 48; TSN, 13 January 1998, pp. 40-41.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> TSN, 13 January 1998, p. 41.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, p. 50.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> TSN, 13 January 1998, p. 42.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Exhibit “E.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> TSN, 18 March 1998, p. 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, pp. 54-55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Exhibits “F,” “G,” “I,” “J,” “K” and “L.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> TSN, 18 March 1998, p. 20; TSN, 13 January 1998, p. 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> TSN, 13 January 1998, p. 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> TSN, 29 April 1998, p. 91.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Exhibit “H.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Exhibits “B” and “D.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Exhibit “E.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Exhibit “B-2.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> TSN, 2 April 1998, pp. 39-40.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Exhibits “M” and “N” and submarkings.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Exhibit “A.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Exhibit “O.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 134.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 82.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <i>People v.
