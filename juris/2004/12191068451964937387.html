				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 25, in Criminal Cases Nos. 92-2054, 92-2085, 92-2086 and 92-2087 convicting the appellant Emiliano Capareda of four (4) counts of rape under Article 335, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The appellant was charged of rape under four (4) separate Informations, the accusatory portions of which except for the date of the offense charged are similarly worded, <i>viz:</i><br><blockquote><u>Criminal Case No. 92-2054</u><br><br>That sometime in the month of June 1992, at 8:00 o’clock, P.M., more or less, at Zone 4, Pasil, Kauswagan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge with complainant-victim, RIZALYN LUFERA, accused forcing himself sexually on the latter, a 13-year-old minor, against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><u>Criminal Case No. 92-2085</u><br><br>That sometime in the month of July 1992, at 8:00 o’clock in the evening, more or less, at Zone 4, Pasil, Kauswagan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge with complainant-victim,    RIZALYN T.

She grew up under the joint care of her mother and her grandparents, as well as her aunts and uncles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The ground floor of the house had two bedrooms, one occupied by Rizalyn’s grandparents and the other occupied by her three unnamed uncles who were then still studying.  Rizalyn, her mother and her younger brother Ricardo, occupied one of the three rooms in the second floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The appellant Emiliano Capareda was the brother-in-law of Cariño Torres, being the second husband of Anita Torres Vda. de Dagsang, Cariño Torres’ sister.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The couple resided in Banlag, Valencia, Bukidnon.  Sometime in the last week of May 1992, a relative of Anita and Cariño died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The appellant, together with his wife Anita and her son by her previous husband, Almor Dagsang, attended the interment  and, thereafter, stayed for some time in the house of Cariño Torres.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The couple occupied the living room in the second floor, as the two other rooms were respectively occupied by Rizalyn’s uncle and her two single aunts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Nevertheless, Emiliano and Anita had their clothes placed in Rizalyn’s room and had access therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In June 1992, Rizalyn was thirteen years old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and a first year high school student at the Misamis Oriental General Comprehensive High School.  She was a bright student and belonged to the first section of the science class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> To maintain her academic status, every night, after taking dinner and doing her part of the household chores, Rizalyn would go up to their room and study her lessons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>At around 8:00 p.m. on June 10, 1992, while Rizalyn was studying her lessons, the appellant entered the room to get some things and to change his clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Ricardo, Rizalyn’s brother, and the other occupants of the house were on the ground floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Rizalyn was shocked when suddenly, the appellant held her by her shirt collar and poked his right clenched fist at her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He gave Rizalyn dagger looks and warned her, saying, “<i>Hoy, ‘Zalyn bantay lang kon mutug-an ka sa imong Mama”</i> (“<i>Hoy,</i> ‘Zalyn beware if you will report to your mother”).  He then pushed her to the floor and laid on top of her.  The appellant removed his short pants and briefs and pulled down Rizalyn’s shorts and underwear.  He spread her thighs, inserted his penis into her vagina and made push and pull movements.  Rizalyn felt severe pain in her vagina and cried.  Satiated, the appellant stood up and wiped his penis.  He put on his briefs and short pants and left the room, leaving the sobbing Rizalyn alone.  She kept the shocking experience to herself because of the appellant’s warning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>At around 8:00 p.m. on June 12, 1992, Rizalyn was in her room studying.  She was reading a book while lying prostrate on the floor, face down.  The appellant collared her anew.  She was more terrified this time because the appellant was armed with an eighteen-inch bolo.  The appellant warned her that if she reported the matter to her mother, he would kill all of them.  Fearing for her life, as well as those of her mother and brother, Rizalyn complied when the appellant ordered her to lie flat on the floor.  The appellant undressed himself, then Rizalyn, and again inserted his private organ into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The appellant raped Rizalyn anew two more times in July 1992.  The appellant sneaked upon Rizalyn while the latter was studying in her room and, while holding a bolo, threatened to kill her and her family if she reported the matter to her mother.  The appellant then proceeded to rape her.  Petrified, Rizalyn did nothing but to submit herself to the appellant’s bestial desires.  Since the appellant was still living with them and kept close watch on her actions, Rizalyn kept her harrowing ordeal to herself. She noticed the appellant giving her menacing looks whenever she conversed with a relative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Jocelyn noticed that Rizalyn had not had her monthly menstruation.  She also noticed Rizalyn vomiting every now and then and had frequent fevers and colds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Jocelyn confronted Rizalyn, who then confessed that the appellant had raped her on four separate occasions, in June and July 1992, while she was alone in her room.  Jocelyn was shocked at her daughter’s revelation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 1992, Jocelyn brought Rizalyn to the Northern Mindanao Regional Training Hospital at Cagayan de Oro City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where Dr. Olivia Sumampan of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department conducted an examination on her.  The examination disclosed that Rizalyn was already six (6) weeks pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Because of her pregnancy, Rizalyn was forced to discontinue her schooling    effective the first week of September 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Rizalyn signed a criminal complaint charging the appellant for the crime of rape.  Earlier, or on September 4, 1992, she had given a sworn statement to the Criminal Investigation Section of the    Integrated National Police.  On December 4, 1992, a warrant was issued for the appellant’s arrest.<br><br>On March 26, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Rizalyn Torres Lufera gave birth to a baby girl.  Sometime in February 1994, SPO2 Exudio Vidal of the PNP-CIS Regional Office apprehended the appellant at Barangay Tipolo, Quezon, a locality in Bukidnon bordering Davao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><center><u>The Case for the Appellant</u></center><br>The appellant admitted to having had sexual intercourse with Rizalyn.  However, he claimed that she consented to have sexual intercourse with him since they were sweethearts.  Prior to June 1992, when he and his family frequented the house of Cariño Torres, he and Rizalyn would go swimming at sea.  On those occasions, he and Rizalyn developed feelings of mutual understanding (<i>“Nagkasabot ang among kasingkasing”</i>).  Since the second week of June 1992 until August 1992, he and Rizalyn had sexual intercourse almost every night and at dawn in the ground floor, and in the second floor of the house of the Torreses.     The only times that he and Rizalyn did not have sexual intercourse was when he went to Bukidnon or to Scions, Calaanan, Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The appellant’s testimony was corroborated by his stepson, Almor Dagsang, who was then barely twelve years old.  He testified that he saw the appellant and Rizalyn having sexual intercourse on two occasions.  He belied Rizalyn’s asseveration that his stepfather raped her because it was Rizalyn who made advances on the appellant.  He recounted that one early morning, while his mother and the other occupants of the house were away, Rizalyn went upstairs and seduced the appellant into having sexual intercourse with her.  Almor was about three meters away from Rizalyn and the appellant.  Even as the appellant tried to persuade Rizalyn to stop for fear that someone might see them, Rizalyn refused because she was enjoying the sexual intercourse.  Almor, ashamed at what he saw, just closed his eyes.<br><br>On another occasion, while they were watching the television one evening, Almor told the appellant that he was already going upstairs to sleep. Rizalyn stopped him and told him to continue viewing the television and that she would just be the one to lie down with her step-grandfather.  Later that night, he saw Rizalyn and the appellant hugging each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On April 3, 1996, the trial court promulgated its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> convicting the appellant of the crimes charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the accused Emiliano Capareda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the consummated crime of Rape as charged in the four (4) separate complaints, and sentences the accused Emiliano Capareda for the four (4) separate crimes, Criminal Case No. 92-2054; Criminal Case No. 92-2085; Criminal Case No. 92-2086; and Criminal Case No. 92-2087, to suffer an imprisonment of Reclusion Perpetua for each crime committed on Rizalyn Torres Lufera and to indemnify the offended party the sum of P50,000.00 and to acknowledge the offspring Marjorie Torres Lufera as his child and accused is ordered to provide a monthly support of P2,000.00 per month which shall be correspondingly increased as the need of the child arise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellant assails the decision of the trial court contending that:<br><blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellant contends that the prosecution failed to prove beyond cavil that he coerced, intimidated or forced Rizalyn into having sexual intercourse with him.  He avers that Rizalyn consented to have sexual intercourse with him, as shown by her failure to resist when he undressed her and inserted his private organ into her vagina.<br><br>According to the appellant, Rizalyn did not even shout while she was being undressed, and even when he lay on top of her.  Her mouth was not covered, but she did not even shout despite the extreme pain she experienced as the appellant inserted his penis into her vagina.  The appellant asserts that Rizalyn could have ran while the appellant was undressing her, or stomped her feet to call the attention of her relatives who were on the ground floor of the house.  Rizalyn did not seek anyone’s help.  As it was, Rizalyn lay motionless, without exerting any degree of resistance.  All the foregoing circumstances, the appellant concludes, are proof of her consent to the sexual    congress with him.<br><br>We are not convinced.  Case law has it that the failure of the victim to shout or offer tenacious resistance does not make voluntary the victim’s submission to the criminal acts of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Resistance is not an element of rape and the absence thereof is not tantamount to consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The law does not impose upon a rape victim the burden of proving resistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In fact, physical resistance need not be established in rape when intimidation is exercised upon the victim and she submits herself against her will to the rapist’s lust because of fear for life or personal safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Indeed, it has been said that, in rape cases, it is not necessary that the victim should have resisted unto death or sustained injuries in the hands of the rapist.  It suffices that intercourse takes place against her will or that she yields because of a genuine    apprehension of great harm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>We have also held that intimidation must be viewed in the light of the perception of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime, not by any hard and fast rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The test is whether the threat or intimidation produces fear in the mind of a reasonable person – that if one resists or does not yield to the desires of the accused, the threat would be carried out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In the instant case, Rizalyn was cowed into submission because of the appellant’s very real and present threat of physical harm on her person.  The appellant was armed with an eighteen-inch long bolo and threatened Rizalyn when he raped her on June 12, 1992 and in July 1992.  She was barely thirteen years old at the time of the rape incidents and, at such a tender age, must have been overcome with fear of serious physical harm, thus, did not resist the bestial desires of the appellant.<br><br>We note that Rizalyn’s father left his family when she was yet an infant.  Helpless and homeless, Jocelyn    and her children had to live with Rizalyn’s grandparents at Zone 4, Pasil, Kauswagan, Cagayan de Oro City.  Rizalyn grew up without her father and looked up to her uncles and her grandfather as the only tangible and credible male models of moral and spiritual leadership that only a father could have been.  The same could be said of her relationship with and her regard for the appellant, who was the husband of her grandmother, Anita Torres.<br><br>The appellant further argues that Rizalyn’s demeanor in the aftermath of the sexual intercourse was inconsistent with the normal human conduct and behavior of one who had been forcibly sexually assaulted.  He contends that after the alleged sexual molestation, Rizalyn concealed the alleged crime by placing her bloodied panty among her other soiled clothes and underwear.  She even had to change her underwear before going to bed.  Moreover, barely five minutes after the alleged traumatic ordeal, she immediately went to bed and slept as if nothing traumatic had happened.  The appellant insists that the following morning, she underwent with her usual routine as if she was not raped at all.  Rizalyn had every opportunity to confide in her aunt while the appellant was still asleep, but she kept mum about the incident.  She even went to school, apparently unperturbed.  The appellant notes that the following evening, Rizalyn again studied her lessons and did not even undertake the precaution of bolting her door to prevent another untoward incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> All the foregoing circumstances, the appellant asserts, undoubtedly negate rape.<br><br>The contention does not hold water.  We have repeatedly ruled that different people react differently to the same situation, and not every victim of a crime can be expected to act reasonably and conformably to the expectations of everyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> For this reason, that Rizalyn was calm and composed after the raping incidents is not a ground for disbelieving her testimony as unusual for a rape victim.  There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a frightful experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The victim’s mien, rather than composure, could mean resignation, considering her continuing suffering, or apoplexy and numbness as aftermaths of her ordeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Rizalyn’s initial reluctance to reveal to her mother, grandparents and relatives the sexual assault upon her person does not detract from her credibility, her hesitation being attributable to her age, and the appellant’s  threats of physical harm and death against her and the other members of her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This Court has ruled that it is not proper to judge the actions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences by the norms of behavior expected under the circumstances from mature persons.  The range of emotion shown by rape victims is yet to be captured even by calculus.  It is, thus, unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from rape victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The workings of the human mind, placed under a great deal of emotional and psychological stress (such as during rape), are unpredictable, and different people react differently.  There is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling, frightful or traumatic experience – some may shout, some may faint, and some may be shocked into insensibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The natural reluctance of a young lass like Rizalyn to report immediately to the mother and relatives that the appellant had raped her is understandable, especially considering that it was her granduncle who sexually assaulted her.  Often, a victim involving a thirteen-year-old girl would rather suffer in silence the onslaught on her honor rather than reveal her story.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, her delay in reporting the rape ought not to be taken against her, nor used to weaken her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The Court takes judicial notice of a young woman’s inbred modesty and shyness and her antipathy in publicly airing acts which blemish her honor and virtue.  Rape stigmatizes the victim, not the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Rape is a harrowing experience and the shock concomitant to it may linger for a while.  Oftentimes, victims would rather bear the ignominy and the pain in private than reveal their shame to the world or risk the rapist’s making good the threat to do them harm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Still and all, it should be observed that the private complainant was subsequently able to narrate the harrowing details of her ordeal, thus:<br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">You said you were raped by your stepgrandfather.

We find that her testimony bears the hallmarks of truth.  It is consistent on material points.  When a rape victim’s testimony is straightforward and candid, unshaken by rigid cross-examination and unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points, the same must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Established is the rule that the testimonies of rape victims, especially child victims, are given full weight and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It bears emphasis that the victim was barely thirteen when she was raped.  In a litany of cases, this Court has applied the well-settled rule that when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says, in effect, all that is necessary to prove that rape was committed, for as long as her testimony meets the test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> No young girl, indeed, would concoct a sordid tale of so serious a crime as rape at the hands of a close kin, undergo medical examination, then subject herself to the stigma and embarrassment of a public trial, if her motive were other than an earnest desire to seek justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This holds true especially where the complainant is a minor, whose testimony deserves full credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Certainly, Rizalyn’s testimony is entitled to great weight especially when she accuses a close relative of having ravished her.  For there can be ascribed no greater motivation for a woman abused by her own kin than that innate yearning of the human spirit to declare the truth to obtain justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In the review of rape cases, we are almost invariably guided by the following principles:  (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In a prosecution for rape, therefore, the victim’s credibility becomes the single most important issue, and when her testimony satisfies the test of credibility, an accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In the instant case, we find no reason to doubt that Rizalyn was telling the truth when she declared that the appellant had sexually ravished her on four separate occasions in the months of June and July 1992.  Rizalyn’s credibility was not successfully assailed by the appellant.<br><br>The essence of rape as defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> is carnal knowledge of a woman against her will.  The appellant failed to show that Rizalyn consented to have sexual intercourse with him.  On the contrary, the evidence showed that the carnal acts were done against her will.<br><br>Finally, the “sweetheart defense” proffered by the appellant is barren of factual consideration.  The alleged “illicit love affair” angle appears to be a mere fabrication of the appellant’s, to exculpate himself from the rape charges filed against him.  Having admitted to having had carnal knowledge of the complainant on the dates and times in question, the appellant bears the burden of proving his affirmative defense by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The appellant, however, failed to discharge his burden.  A “sweetheart defense” should be substantiated by some documentary and/or other evidence of the relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Other than his self-serving assertions and those of his biased stepson, there is no support to appellant’s claim that he and complainant were lovers.  The appellant failed to adduce in evidence any mementos, love letters, notes, pictures, or any concrete proof of a romantic nature.  Moreover, even if we were to assume that the appellant and the private complainant were indeed lovers, this fact would not have precluded rape, as it did not necessarily mean there was consent.  A love affair could not have justified what the appellant did – subjecting Rizalyn to his carnal desires against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The Court has previously taken judicial cognizance of the fact that in rural areas in this country, young ladies by custom and tradition act with circumspection and prudence, and that great caution is observed so that their reputation remains untainted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> It is unbelievable that Rizalyn would have participated in, much less initiated, these alleged romantic trysts.<br><br>The appellant’s reliance on the testimony of his stepson Almor is desperation personified with the finding of the trial court and this Court that Rizalyn’s testimony as to when and how the appellant despoiled her is the truth.  The testimony of Almor in defense of the appellant cannot prevail over that of Rizalyn.<br><br>It is basic that where there is no showing that the complainant was impelled by an improper motive in making the accusation against the accused, her complaint is entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Considering her young age, it would have been highly improbable for Rizalyn to fabricate a charge so humiliating to her and her family, had she not been truly subjected to the painful experience of sexual abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> We additionally consider the fact that it is hard to believe that a mother would sacrifice her own daughter and present her to be the subject of a public trial if she, in fact, has not been motivated by an honest desire to have the culprit punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It is quite unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as an engine of malice, especially if it will subject a daughter to embarrassment and even stigma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>More telling of the appellant’s culpability is his flight after the charges against him had been filed.  The appellant himself on cross-examination admitted that although he had known that charges had already been filed against him, he did not file a counter-affidavit in all the four complaints upon his wife’s instructions.  His wife promised to talk to her brother Cariño Torres to convince them to withdraw the complaints.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The appellant also testified that he knew that a subpoena was served at their address at Banlag, Valencia, Bukidnon on October 5, 1992 which was received by his wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The appellant, however, ignored the subpoena and continued to stay in Kipulot, Bukidnon, under the pretext of preaching for the Seventh Day Adventist Church.  He managed to elude arrest for more than a year until he was finally arrested in February 1994.  The appellant cannot feign ignorance of the warrant for his arrest which was issued as early as November 1992.  The policemen tried to serve the warrant of arrest on the appellant but the latter was nowhere to be found.  The appellant himself testified that while he was in Kipulot, his wife Anita Torres frequented the residence of her brother Cariño Torres to persuade them that she and the appellant would be the one to shoulder the expenses of Rizalyn’s delivery, and to give support for the child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The appellant was, therefore, constantly communicating with his wife, Anita Torres, and as such, the issuance of the warrant for her husband’s arrest could not have escaped her attention.  The appellant was fully aware of the pending charges against him.  In fact, in the first week of September, he and his wife went to Rizalyn’s residence for the purpose of pleading for forgiveness, in the hope that the latter would withdraw her complaint against the appellant.  But Rizalyn and her family were resolute in prosecuting the case against the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>While we affirm the appellant’s conviction, the trial court’s decision must be modified with respect to the award of damages.  We note that the trial court failed to specify and particularize the damages given to Rizalyn.<br><br>Evidently, as the text of the decision indicates, the amount of P50,000 was intended as indemnification to the private complainant.  In accordance with current case law, we award Rizalyn civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000 for each count of rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> or a total of P200,000 for all four counts.  Civil indemnity is automatically granted once the fact of rape had been established. We also deem it proper to award the complainant moral damages in the amount of P50,000 for each count of rape.  Moral damages are automatically granted to the victim in rape cases without need for further proof other than the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> The fact that the victim suffered the trauma of mental, physical and psychological sufferings which constitute the bases for moral damages is too obvious to still require the recital thereof at the trial by the victim, since the Court itself even assumes and acknowledges such agony on her part as a gauge of her credibility.  Accordingly, for the appellant’s conviction in the four criminal cases filed against him by the complainant, the latter is entitled to moral damages in the amount of P200,000.<br><br>The alternative aggravating circumstance of relationship under Article 15 of the Revised Penal Code cannot be considered in the instant case considering that the relationship between a step-grandniece and her step-grandfather is not one of the relatives specifically enumerated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><i>Apropos</i> the penalty imposed by the trial court, Article 335, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code provides that whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>In rape cases, “use of a deadly weapon” or “by two or more persons” are special aggravating circumstances.  During the trial, the prosecution was able to prove that the appellant used a bolo to intimidate the victim into having sexual intercourse with him, once on June 12, 1992 and twice in July 1992.  This circumstance was not, however, alleged in the information.  Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and Section 9<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</span></sup> provides that aggravating as well as qualifying circumstances must be alleged in the information; otherwise, they cannot be considered in imposing the appropriate penalty against the accused even if proven during the trial.  Being favorable to the accused, the said rule may be applied retroactively in this case.  In any event, the death penalty, even if appropriate, may not be imposed, considering that its imposition was yet suspended at the time of the commission of the crimes under consideration.<br><br>Nonetheless, the circumstance of use of a bolo may be appreciated as basis for an award of exemplary damages in line with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83] </sup>Consequently, the victim is entitled to P25,000 as exemplary damages for each of the three counts of rape as she was intimidated by the appellant into sexual congress with the use of a bolo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the September 23, 1999 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 25, in Criminal Cases Nos. 92-2054, 92-2085, 92-2086 and 92-2087 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION.</b>  The appellant Emiliano Capareda is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay the complainant Rizalyn Torres Lufera  for <b>EACH</b> count of rape the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity; P50,000 as moral damages; and, P25,000 as exemplary damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Quisumbing, (Acting Chairman), Austria-Martinez,</i> and Tinga, JJ., concur. <br><i>Puno, (Chairman), J.,</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Noli T.
