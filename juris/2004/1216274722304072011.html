Reyes for the latter, as attorney-in-fact, to secure a loan from the Commonwealth Insurance Company.&nbsp; An application for mortgage loan was filed by Rodolfo Reyes with the Commonwealth Insurance Company and a Real Estate Mortgage Contract was executed as collateral to the mortgage loan.&nbsp; The loan was payable in ten (10) years with a monthly amortization of <s>P</s>1,166.67.&nbsp; The monthly amortizations were paid by Rodolfo Reyes and after his death, the balance of <s>P</s>109,797.64 was paid in full to the Commonwealth Insurance by the Philam Life Insurance Co. as insurer of the deceased Rodolfo A. Reyes.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>On appeal to the CA, petitioner questioned the following findings of the trial court: 1) that the house and lot had been paid in full from the proceeds of the loan that Rodolfo Reyes obtained from the Commonwealth Insurance Company; 2) that his salaries and earnings, which were his and Lourdes’ conjugal funds, paid for the loan and, hence, the disputed property was conjugal; and 3) that petitioner’s illegitimate children, not having been recognized or acknowledged by him in any of the ways provided by law, acquired no successional rights to his estate.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span></div><br>Affirming the RTC, the CA held that the property had been paid out of the conjugal funds of Rodolfo and Lourdes because the monthly amortizations for the loan, as well as the premiums for the life insurance policy that paid for the balance thereof, came from his salaries and earnings.&nbsp; Like the trial court, it found no sufficient proof that petitioner was financially capable of buying the disputed property, or that she had actually contributed her own exclusive funds to pay for it.&nbsp; Hence, it ordered her to surrender possession of the property to the respective estates of the spouses.<br><br>The appellate court, however, held that the trial court should not have resolved the issue of the filiation and the successional rights of petitioner’s children.&nbsp; Such issues, it said, were not properly cognizable in an ordinary civil action for reconveyance and damages and were better ventilated in a probate or special proceeding instituted for the purpose.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Issues</span></div><br>Petitioner submits the following issues for the Court’s consideration:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">“I.</span></div><br>Whether or not it has been indubitably established in a court of law and trier of facts, the Regional Trial Court, that petitioner’s three <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> illegitimate children are x x x indeed the children of the late Rodolfo Reyes.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">“II.</span></div><br>Whether or not it is legally permissible for [respondents] to make a mockery of the law by denying [the] filiations of their [two] 2 illegitimate sisters and one <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> illegitimate brother when in fact the very complaint filed by their mother, the lawful wife, Lourdes[,] shows that her husband Rodolfo had illicit relations with the petitioner Milagros and had lived with her in a house and lot at Baghdad Street.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">“III.</span></div><br>Whether or not the fact that the Court of Appeals made a finding that the house and lot at Baghdad Street are conjugal property of lawfully wedded Rodolfo and Lourdes including the insurance proceeds which was used to pay the final bill for the house and lot, this will prevail over Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">“IV.</span></div><br>Whether or not the Supreme Court should enforce the rule that the parties to a lawsuit should only tell the truth at the trial and in [their] pleadings x x x.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">“V.</span></div><br>Whether or not the legitimate children of the late Rodolfo Reyes should respect their father’s desire that his illegitimate children should have a home or a roof over their heads in consonance with his duty to love, care and provide for his children even after his death.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>The issues boil down to the following: 1) the nature of the house and lot on Baghdad Street (BF Homes Parañaque, Metro Manila); and 2) the propriety of ruling on the filiation and the successional rights of petitioner’s children.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling</span></div><br>The Petition is devoid of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Conjugal Nature of the Disputed Property</span></span></div><br>Before tackling the merits, we must first point out some undisputed facts and guiding principles.<br><br>As to the facts, it is undisputed that the deceased Rodolfo Reyes was legally married to Respondent Lourdes Reyes on January 3, 1947.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It is also admitted that for 19 years or so, and while their marriage was subsisting, he was actually living with petitioner.&nbsp; It was during this time, in 1979, that the disputed house and lot was purchased and registered in petitioner’s name.<br><br>Plainly, therefore, the applicable law is the Civil Code of the Philippines.&nbsp; Under Article 145 thereof, a conjugal partnership of gains (CPG) is created upon marriage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and lasts until the legal union is dissolved by death, annulment, legal separation or judicial separation of property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Conjugal properties are by law owned in common by the husband and wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> As to what constitutes such properties are laid out in Article 153 of the Code, which we quote:<blockquote>“(1) That which is acquired by onerous title during the marriage at the expense of the common fund, whether the acquisition be for the partnership, or for only one of the spouses;<br><br>(2) That which is obtained by the industry, or work, or as salary of the spouses, or of either of them;<br><br>(3) The fruits, rents or interests received or due during the marriage, coming from the common property or from the exclusive property of each spouse.”</blockquote>Moreover, under Article 160 of the Code, all properties of the marriage, unless proven to pertain to the husband or the wife exclusively, are presumed to belong to the CPG.&nbsp; For the rebuttable presumption to arise, however, the properties must first be proven to have been acquired during the existence of the marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The law places the burden of proof<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on the plaintiffs (respondents herein) to establish their claim by a preponderance of evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> -- evidence that has greater weight or is more convincing than that which is offered to oppose it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Article 144<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Civil Code mandates a co-ownership between a man and a woman who are living together but are not legally married.&nbsp; Prevailing jurisprudence holds, though, that for Article 144 to apply,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the couple must not be incapacitated to contract marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It has been held that the Article is inapplicable to common-law relations amounting to adultery or concubinage, as in this case.&nbsp; The reason therefor is the absurdity of creating a co-ownership in cases in which there exists a prior conjugal partnership between the man and his lawful wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In default of Article 144 of the Civil Code, Article 148 of the Family Code has been applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; The latter Article provides:<blockquote>“Art. 148.&nbsp; In cases of cohabitation not falling under the preceding Article, only the properties acquired by both of the parties through their actual joint contribution of money, property, or industry shall be owned by them in common in proportion to their respective contributions.&nbsp; In the absence of proof to the contrary, their contributions and corresponding shares are presumed to be equal.&nbsp; The same rule and presumption shall apply to joint deposits of money and evidence of credit.<br><br>“If one of the parties is validly married to another, his or her share in the co-ownership shall accrue to the absolute community or conjugal partnership existing in such valid marriage.&nbsp; If the party which acted in bad faith is not validly married to another, his or her share shall be forfeited in the manner provided in the last paragraph of the preceding Article.<br><br>“The foregoing rules on forfeiture shall likewise apply even if both parties are in bad faith.”</blockquote>Thus, when a common-law couple have a legal impediment to marriage, only the property acquired by them -- through their <span style="font-style: italic;">actual joint contribution</span> of money, property or industry -- shall be owned by them in common and <span style="font-style: italic;">in proportion to their respective contributions</span>.<br><br>With these facts and principles firmly settled, we now proceed to the merits of the first issue.<br><br>The present controversy hinges on the source of the funds paid for the house and lot in question.&nbsp; Upon the resolution of this issue depends the determination of whether the property is conjugal (owned by Rodolfo and Lourdes) or exclusive (owned by Milagros) or co-owned by Rodolfo and Milagros.<br><br>The above issue, which is clearly factual, has been passed upon by both the trial and the appellate courts, with similar results in favor of respondents.&nbsp; Such finding is generally conclusive; it is not the function of this Court to review questions of fact. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is well-settled that only errors of law and not of facts are reviewable by this Court in cases brought to it from the Court of Appeals or under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This principle applies with greater force herein, because the CA came up with the same factual findings as those of the RTC.<br><br>Even then, heeding petitioner’s plea, we have gone through the pleadings and the evidence presented by the parties to find out if there is any circumstance that might warrant a reversal of the factual findings.&nbsp; Unfortunately for petitioner, we have found none.<br><br>Indeed, a preponderance of evidence has duly established that the disputed house and lot was paid by Rodolfo Reyes, using his salaries and earnings.&nbsp; By substantial evidence, respondents showed the following facts: 1) that Rodolfo was gainfully employed as comptroller at Warner, Barnes and Co., Inc. until his retirement on September 30, 1980, upon which he received a sizeable retirement package;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 2) that at exactly the same time the property was allegedly purchased,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> he applied for a mortgage loan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> -- intended for “housing”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> -- from the Commonwealth Insurance Company;&nbsp; 3) that he secured the loan with a real estate mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> over the same property;&nbsp; 4) that he paid the monthly amortizations for the loan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> as well as the semi-annual premiums<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> for a Philam Life insurance policy, which he was required to take as additional security; and 5) that with the proceeds of his life insurance policy, the balance of the loan was paid to Commonwealth by Philam Life Insurance Company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>All told, respondents have shown that the property was bought during the marriage of Rodolfo and Lourdes, a fact that gives rise to the presumption that it is conjugal.&nbsp; More important, they have established that the proceeds of the loan obtained by Rodolfo were used to pay for the property; and that the loan was, in turn, paid from his salaries and earnings, which were conjugal funds under the Civil Code.<br><br>In contrast, petitioner has failed to substantiate either of her claims -- that she was financially capable of buying the house and lot, or that she actually contributed to the payments therefor.<br><br>Indeed, it does not appear that she was gainfully employed at any time after 1961<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> when the property was purchased.&nbsp; Hearsay are the Affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and the undated Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> she had presented to prove that she borrowed money from her siblings and had earnings from a jewelry business.&nbsp; Respondents had not been given any opportunity to cross-examine the affiants, who had not testified on these matters.&nbsp; Based on the rules of evidence, the Affidavits and the Certification have to be rejected.&nbsp; In fact, they have no probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The CA was also correct in disregarding petitioner’s allegation that part of the purchase money had come from the sale of a drugstore<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> four years earlier.<br><br>Under the circumstances, therefore, the purchase and the subsequent registration of the realty in petitioner’s name was tantamount to a donation by Rodolfo to Milagros.&nbsp; By express provision of Article 739(1) of the Civil Code, such donation was void, because it was “made between persons who were guilty of adultery or concubinage at the time of the donation.”<br><br>The prohibition against donations between spouses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> must likewise apply to donations between persons living together in illicit relations; otherwise, the latter would be better situated than the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Article 87 of the Family Code now expressly provides thus:<blockquote>“Art. 87.&nbsp; Every donation or grant of gratuitous advantage, direct or indirect, between the spouses during the marriage shall be void, except moderate gifts which the spouses may give each other on the occasion of any family rejoicing.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The prohibition shall also apply to persons living together as husband and wife without a valid marriage</span>.” (Italics supplied)</blockquote>Regarding the registration of the property in petitioner’s name, it is enough to stress that a certificate of title under the Torrens system aims to protect dominion;
