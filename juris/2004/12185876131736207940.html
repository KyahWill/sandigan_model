				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of the <i>Decision</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 38269  dated  06 March 1996, and  its <i>Resolution</i> dated 30 July 1996 denying petitioner’s <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>   affirming  the Order of the Social Security Commission (SSC) dated 1 February 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  which held that private respondents were regular employees of the petitioner    and ordered petitioner to pay  the Social Security System (SSS) for its unpaid contributions, as well as penalty for the delayed remittance thereof.<br><br>On 20 August 1985, private respondents Andres Paguio, Pablo Canale, Ruel Pangan, Aurelio Paguio, Rolando Trinidad, Romeo Tapang and Carlos Maliwat (hereinafter referred to as respondents) filed a <i>Petition</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  with the SSC for SSS coverage and contributions against petitioner Reynaldo Chua, owner of Prime Mover Construction Development, claiming that they were all regular employees of the petitioner in his construction business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>Private respondents claimed that they were assigned by petitioner in his various construction projects continuously   in   the   following  capacity, since the period<br><br>indicated, and with the corresponding basic salaries,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  to wit:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="36%">Andres Paguio</td> <td width="28%">Carpenter</td> <td width="18%">1977</td> <td style="text-align: right;" width="18%">P 42/day</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pablo Canale </td> <td>Mason</td> <td>1977</td> <td style="text-align: right;">42/day</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ruel Pangan</td> <td>Mason</td> <td>1979</td> <td style="text-align: right;">39/day</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aurelio Paguio</td> <td>Fine grading</td> <td>1979</td> <td style="text-align: right;">42/day</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Romeo Tapang </td> <td> Fine grading</td> <td>1979</td> <td style="text-align: right;">42/day</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rolando Trinidad</td> <td>Carpenter</td> <td>1983 (Jan.)</td> <td style="text-align: right;">39/day</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Carlos Maliwat</td> <td>Mason</td> <td>1977</td> <td style="text-align: right;">42/day</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Private respondents alleged that petitioner dismissed all of them without justifiable grounds and without notice to them and to the then Ministry of Labor and Employment.  They further alleged that petitioner did not report them to the SSS for compulsory coverage in flagrant violation of the Social Security Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>In his <i>Answer</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  petitioner claimed that private respondents had no cause of action against him, and assuming there was any, the same was barred by prescription and laches.  In addition, he claimed that private respondents were not regular employees, but project employees whose work had been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion of which was determined at the time of their engagement.  This being the case, he concluded that said employees were not entitled to coverage under the Social Security Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>Meanwhile, the SSS filed a <i>Petition in Intervention</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>   alleging that it has an interest in the petition filed by private respondents as it is charged with the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of the Social Security Act. The SSS stated that it is the mandatory obligation of every employer to report its employees to the SSS for coverage and to remit the required contribution, including the penalty imposed for late premium remittances.<br><br>On 01 February 1995, the SSC issued its <i>Order</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  which ruled in favor of private respondents. The SSC, relying on NLRC Case No. RAB-III-8-2373-85,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  declared private respondents to be petitioner’s regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>   It ordered petitioner to pay the SSS the unpaid SS/EC    and  Medicare  contributions  plus  penalty  for                the  delayed   remittance   thereof,   without   prejudice    to any other penalties which may have accrued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>   The SSC denied the <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  of petitioner for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <br><br>Petitioner elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals via a <i>Petition for Review</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>   He claimed that private respondents were project employees, whose periods of employment were terminated upon completion of the project.  Thus, he claimed, no employer-employee relation existed between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>   There being no employer-employee relationship, private respondents are not entitled to coverage under the Social Security Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>   In addition, petitioner claimed that private respondents’ length of service did not change their status from project to regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <br><br>Moreover, granting that private respondents were entitled to coverage under the Act, petitioner claimed that the SSC erred in imposing penalties since his failure to include private respondents under SSS coverage was neither willful nor deliberate, but due to the honest belief that project employees are not regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>   Likewise, he claimed that the SSC erred in ordering payment of contributions and penalties even for long periods between projects when private respondents were not working.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <br><br>Petitioner also questioned the failure to apply the rules on prescription of actions and of laches,  claiming that the case, being one for the injury to the rights of the private respondents, should have been filed within four (4) years from the time their cause of action accrued, or     from the time they were hired as project employees. He added that private respondents “went into a long swoon, folded   their   arms  and  closed their eyes”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  and filed their claim only in 1985, or six (6) years or eight (8) years after they were taken in by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <br><br>In resolving the petition, the Court of Appeals synthesized the issues in the petition, to wit: (1) whether private respondents were regular employees of petitioner, and whether their causes of action as such are barred by prescription or laches; (2) if so, whether petitioner is now liable to pay the SSS contributions and penalties during the period of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <br><br>The Court of Appeals, citing Article 280 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  declared that private respondents were all regular employees of the petitioner in relation to certain activities since they all worked either as masons, carpenters and fine graders in petitioner’s various construction projects for at least one year, and that their work was necessary and desirable to petitioner’s business which involved the construction of roads and bridges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>   It cited the case of <i>Mehitabel Furniture Company, Inc. v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  particularly the ruling therein which states:<br><blockquote>By petitioner’s own admission, the private respondents have been hired to work on certain special orders that as a matter of business policy it cannot decline.  These projects are necessary or desirable in its usual business or trade, otherwise they would not have accepted …. Significantly, such special orders are not really seasonal but more or less regular, requiring the virtually continuous services of the “temporary workers.”<u> The NLRC also correctly observed that “if we were to accept respondent’s theory, it would have no regular workers because all of its orders would be special undertakings or projects.”</u> The petitioner could then hire all its workers on a contract basis only and prevent them from attaining permanent status….<br><br><u>Furthermore, the NLRC has determined that the private respondents have worked for more than one year in the so-called “special projects” of the petitioner and so fall under the second condition specified in the above-quoted provision (Article 280, Labor Code).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></u><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals rejected the claim of prescription, stating that the filing of private  respondents’  claims   was   well  within  the  twenty (20)-year period provided by the Social Security Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>   It found that the principle of laches could not also apply to the instant case since delay could not be attributed to private respondents, having filed the case within the prescriptive period, and that there was no evidence that petitioner lacked knowledge that private respondents would assert their rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <br><br>Petitioner filed a <i>Motion for Reconsideratio</i>n,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  claiming that the Court of Appeals overlooked (1) the doctrine that length of service of a project employee is not the controlling test of employment tenure, and (2) petitioner’s failure to place private respondents under SSS coverage was in good faith.  The motion was denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <br><br>In the present <i>Petition for Review</i>, petitioner again insists that private respondents were not regular, but project, employees and thus not subject to SSS coverage.  In addition, petitioner claims that assuming private respondents were subject to SSS coverage, their petition was barred by prescription and laches.  Moreover, petitioner invokes the defense of good faith, or his honest belief that project employees are not regular employees  under Article 280 of the Labor Code.<br><br>Petitioner’s arguments are mere reiterations of his arguments submitted before the SSC and the Court of Appeals.  More importantly, petitioner wants this Court to review factual questions already passed upon by the SSC and the Court of Appeals which are not cognizable by a petition for review under Rule 45.   Well-entrenched is the rule that the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction in a petition for review is limited to reviewing or revising errors of law allegedly committed by the appellate court, the findings of fact being generally conclusive on the Court and it is not for the Court to weigh  evidence all over again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <br><br>Stripped of the lengthy, if not repetitive, disquisition of the private parties in the case, and also of the public respondents, on the nature of private respondents’ employment, the controversy boils down to one issue:  the entitlement of private respondents to compulsory SSS coverage.<br><br>The Social Security Act was enacted pursuant to the policy of the government “to develop, establish gradually and perfect a social security system which shall be suitable to the needs of the laborers throughout the Philippines, and shall provide protection against the hazards of disability, sickness, old age and death.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>    It provides for compulsory coverage of all employees not over sixty years of age and their employers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br>Well-settled is the rule that the mandatory coverage of Republic Act No. 1161, as amended, is premised on the existence of an employer-employee relationship, the essential elements of which are: (a) selection and engagement of the employee; (b) payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the power of control with regard to the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished, with the power of control being the most determinative factor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <br><br>There is no dispute that private respondents were employees of petitioner.   Petitioner himself admitted that they worked in his construction projects,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  although the period of their employment was allegedly co-terminus with their phase of work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>   Even without such admission from petitioner, the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the parties can easily be determined by the application of the “control test,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  the elements of which are enumerated above. It is clear that private respondents are employees of petitioner, the latter having control over the results of the work done, as well as the means and methods by which the same were accomplished. Suffice it to say that regardless of the nature of their employment, whether it is regular or project, private respondents are subject of the compulsory coverage under the SSS Law, their employment not falling under the exceptions provided by the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>   This rule is in accord with the Court’s ruling in <i>Luzon Stevedoring Corp. v. SSS</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  to the effect that all employees, regardless of tenure, would qualify for compulsory membership in the SSS, except those classes of employees contemplated in Section 8(j) of the Social Security Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <br><br>This Court also finds no reason to deviate from the finding of the Court of Appeals regarding the nature of employment of private respondents.  Despite the insistence of petitioner that they were project employees, the facts show that as masons, carpenters and fine graders in petitioner’s various construction projects, they performed work which was usually necessary and desirable to petitioner’s business which involves construction of roads and bridges.  In <i>Violeta v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>   this Court ruled that to be exempted from the presumption of regularity of employment, the agreement between a project employee and his employer must strictly conform to the requirements and conditions under Article 280 of the Labor Code.  It is not enough that an employee is hired for a specific project or phase of work.  There must also be a determination of, or a clear agreement on, the completion or termination of the project at the time the employee was engaged if the objectives of Article 280 are to be achieved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  This second requirement was not met in this case.<br><br>Moreover, while it may be true that  private respondents were initially hired for specific projects or undertakings, the repeated re-hiring and continuing need for their services over a long  span of time—the shortest being  two years and the longest being eight—have undeniably made them regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>    This Court has held that an employment ceases to be co-terminus with specific projects when the employee is continuously rehired due to the demands of   the employer’s business and re-engaged for many more projects without interruption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>   The Court likewise takes note of the fact that, as cited by the SSC, even the National Labor Relations Commission in a labor case involving the same parties, found that private respondents were regular employees of the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <br><br>Another cogent factor militates against the allegations of the petitioner.  In the proceedings before the SSC and the Court of Appeals, petitioner was unable to show that private respondents were appraised of the project nature of their employment, the specific projects themselves or any phase thereof undertaken by petitioner and for which private respondents were hired.  He failed to show any document such as private respondents’ employment contracts and employment records that would indicate the dates of hiring and termination in relation to the particular construction project or phases in which they were employed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>   Moreover, it is peculiar that petitioner did not show proof that he submitted reports of termination after the completion of his construction projects, considering that he alleges that private respondents were hired and rehired for various projects or phases of work therein.<br><br>Anent the issue of prescription, this Court rules that  private respondents’  right to file their claim had not yet prescribed at the time of the filing of their petition, considering that a mere eight (8) years had passed from the time delinquency was discovered or the proper assessment was made. Republic Act No. 1161, as amended,  prescribes a period of twenty (20) years, from the time the delinquency is known or assessment is made by the SSS, within which to file a claim for non-remittance against employers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <br><br>Likewise, this Court is in full accord with the findings of the Court of Appeals that private respondents are not guilty of laches.  The principle of laches or “stale demands” ordains that the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which by exercising due diligence could or should have been done earlier, or the negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warrants a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>   In the instant case, this Court finds no proof that private respondents had failed or neglected to assert their right, considering that they filed their claim within the period prescribed by law.<br><br>This Court finds no merit in petitioner’s protestations of good faith. In <i>United Christian Missionary Society v. Social Security Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  this Court ruled that good faith or bad faith is irrelevant for purposes of assessment and collection of the penalty for delayed remittance of premiums, since the law makes no distinction between an employer who professes good reasons for delaying the remittance of premiums and another who deliberately disregards the legal duty imposed upon him to make such remittance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>   For the same reasons, petitioner cannot now invoke the defense of good faith.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the <i>Petition</i> is DENIED.  The <i>Decision</i> and <i>Resolution</i> of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 6 March 1996 and 30 July 1996 respectively, are AFFIRMED.
