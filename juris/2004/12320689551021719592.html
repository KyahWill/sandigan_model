No. 00-1-10-RTC</span><br><br>On October 26, 1999, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) directed a team to conduct an on-the-spot audit and physical inventory of cases pending in the <span style="font-style: italic;">sala </span>of the respondent judge.&nbsp; The members of the judicial audit team conducted the audit from October 27, 1999 to November 4, 1999, having had difficulty reconciling the records of the court. When confronted about the unsystematic record-keeping and improper management of court records, Branch Clerk of Court Atty. Felix Veridiano, Jr. explained that he himself could not reconcile the records of the cases and complete the reports.&nbsp; According to Atty. Veridiano, the respondent judge brought home the cases submitted for decision or locked them in his drawers, and that no staff member was allowed to touch these cases without his permission.&nbsp; The judicial audit team arrived at its findings through examining unofficial reports, which were verified with the list of raffled cases from the Office of the Clerk of Court and the actual cases presented for audit.&nbsp; The judicial audit team noticed that almost all of the case records, whether criminal or civil, did not contain any page numbers, and that many such records had loose copies of notices, orders or draft decisions. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to the judicial audit team’s report and the Memorandum of then Court Administrator Alfredo Benipayo dated December 16, 1999, the Court issued the following Resolution on February 23, 2000:<br><blockquote>(a) Presiding Judge Marino dela Cruz, Jr., Regional Trial Court, Manila, Branch 22, to <span style="font-style: italic;">EXPLAIN</span> in writing within ten (10) days from notice hereof why no administrative sanction should be imposed on him for:<br><blockquote> (1) failure to decide the following 78 criminal cases and 32 civil cases, within the ninety (90)-day reglementary period:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Criminal Cases</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Civil Cases</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>91-90046</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>99-92972</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-135548</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>99-93417</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>91-97265</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>86-34398</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>97-156420</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>98-88197</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>95-144007-11</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>R-81-86911</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>92-105443</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>98-86911</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-134270</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>93-63477</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-138257</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>97-82718</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>93-126422</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>91-59202</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>97-155030-31</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>93-68174</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>92-103538-60</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>97-86293</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>84-32464</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>98-90875</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-139172</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>98-88357</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>88-62579</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>97-84527</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>93-130096-114</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>93-66711</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-136816</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>95-73055</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-133785</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>90-53942</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>89-74843-46</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>95-73413</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>87-54666</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>90-53444</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>92-107757</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>93-65034</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>92-108634</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>96-77102</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>95-146443-48</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>95-73016</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-139627</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>92-63720</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>95-144693</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>95-75404</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td>94-131598 </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>91-57931</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>95-75449</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>93-67720</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>86-35031</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>95-72792</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>93-64390</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>92-60127</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>88-45762</td></tr> </tbody></table><br>(2) his actions on the following to wit:<br><blockquote> 1) promulgation of judgment without written decision in the case of CR No. 97-156420 – People vs. Jariol y Pedo and Crim.

This is anathema to those who seek a career in the judiciary because obedience to the dictates of the law and justice is demanded of every judge.&nbsp; When the judge himself becomes the transgressor of the law which he is sworn to apply, he places his office in disrepute, encourages disrespect for the law, and impairs public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary itself. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As a judge, the respondent ought to have known that the resolution of the Court requiring comment on an administrative complaint against officials and employees of the judiciary should not be construed as a mere request.&nbsp;

No. MTJ-03-1515, Feb. 3, 2004). Failure to comply with the Court’s directives, constitutes gross misconduct and insubordination (Martinez vs. Zoleta 315 SCRA 438). His failure to comply with the directives of the Court as noted in our memorandum dated January 27, 2003 is deemed to constitute a clear manifestation of his willful disobedience of the lawful order of this Court which he had violated several times.<br><br>It should also be noted that Judge dela Cruz did not comply with the directive in the resolution dated February 23, 2000. What he did was only to ask for extension of time and never complied with his undertaking. It was only during the second audit that he committed to dispose of the cases subject of the audit. However, still he did not submit any explanation on his failure to decide the 78 criminal cases and 32 civil cases and his actions on the cases enumerated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </blockquote> By his actuations, the respondent violated the following Canons of Judicial Conduct:<br><blockquote>CANON I – A JUDGE SHOULD UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY.<br><br>Rule 1.01. – A judge should be the embodiment of competence, integrity and independence.<br><br>CANON 2 – A JUDGE SHOULD AVOID IMPROPRIETY AND APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY IN ALL ACTIVITIES.<br><br>Rule 2.01. – A judge should so behave at all times as to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. </blockquote> The respondent also violated Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which requires a member of the bar to observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and insist on similar conduct by others.<br><br>Thus, for repeatedly failing to heed the Court’s show-cause orders, as well as the lawful directives of the OCA, the respondent showed disrespect to the Court, displaying conduct unbecoming a member of the bench.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, for gross inefficiency<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and gross misconduct,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> respondent Judge Marino M. dela Cruz, Jr. is hereby <b>FINED</b> an amount of Forty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>40,000).&nbsp; He is <b>STERNLY WARNED</b> that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br>The complaint in A.M.
