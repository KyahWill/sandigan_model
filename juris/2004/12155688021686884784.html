The same was docketed as <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I.S.

The complaint was docketed as <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I.S.

No. 119322</span>.<br><br>In a Decision dated June 4, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> this Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> pronounced:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x</div><br>The trial court and the Court of Appeals maintained that at that stage of the preliminary investigation, where the complaint and the accompanying affidavits and supporting documents did not show any violation of the Tax Code providing penal sanctions, the prosecutors should have dismissed the complaint outright because of total lack of evidence, instead of requiring&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;private respondents to submit their counter affidavits under Section 3(b) of Rule 112.<br><br>We believe that the trial court in issuing its questioned orders, which are interlocutory in nature, committed no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; There are factual and legal bases for the assailed orders.&nbsp; On the other hand, the burden is upon the petitioners to demonstrate that the questioned orders constitute a whimsical and capricious exercise of judgment, which they have not.&nbsp; For certiorari will not be issued to cure errors in proceedings or correct erroneous conclusions of law or fact.&nbsp; As long as a court acts within its jurisdiction, any alleged errors committed in the exercise of its jurisdiction will amount to nothing more than errors of judgment which are reviewable by timely appeal and not by a special civil action of certiorari.&nbsp; Consequently, the Regional Trial Court acted correctly and judiciously, and as demanded by the facts and the law, in issuing the orders granting the writs of preliminary injunction, in denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss and in admitting the supplemental petitions.&nbsp; What petitioners should have done was to file an answer to the petition filed in the trial court, proceed to the hearing and appeal the decision of the court if adverse to them.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>On a subsequent motion for reconsideration, however, this Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated February 6, 1997, thus:<blockquote>The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion for reconsideration of the decision dated 4 June 1996, the basic issues raised therein having already been passed upon in said decision and there being no substantial arguments to support said motion.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">However, in order to avoid undue delay in the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-94-18790 and the preliminary investigation of the complaints against private respondents, the Court Resolved to:</span><blockquote><ol><li>REMAND Civil Case No. Q-94-18790 to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 88, Quezon City;</li><br><li>SET ASIDE the orders of the panel of prosecutors declaring private respondents’ “Motion to Dismiss, Alternatively, Motion to Suspend” as private respondents’ counter-affidavits, and denying their motions to require petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue to submit documents and to inhibit the members of the panel of prosecutors;</li><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><li>DIRECT the Secretary of Justice to designate as early as possible, a new panel of prosecutors to investigate the complaints against private respondents;</li><br><li>ORDER the new panel of prosecutors designated by the Secretary of Justice to grant private respondents’ motion for the submission by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue to private respondents, thru their counsel of record, of the documents supporting the complaints, and to give private respondents reasonable time to examine the documents and to submit their counter-affidavits;</li><br><li>ORDER the preliminary investigation to proceed with all reasonable dispatch; and</li><br></span><li>DIRECT respondent Judge Tirso Velasco to dismiss Civil Case No. Q-94-18790 on the ground that it has become moot in light of the foregoing dispositions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">FACTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE G.R. NO. 119322 RESOLUTION</span></div><br>In compliance with this Court’s resolution, a New Panel (New DOJ Panel) of prosecutors was created.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The BIR was directed to furnish respondents the documents supporting the complaints and to give respondents time to examine the same and, thereafter, for respondents to submit their counter-affidavits.<br><br>On March 20, 1998, the BIR submitted a Manifestation/ Compliance, submitting the required documents with the explanation that it did not produce the other documents (i.e. the Daily Manufacturer’s Sworn Statements of other cigarette companies) because to do so would be “inappropriate” as the same “do not, in any manner, bear any relevance” to the preliminary investigation proceedings against Fortune.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On April 13, 1998, respondents filed a Counter-Manifestation With Motion to produce allegedly lacking or missing documents.<br><br>The BIR filed a Comment/Manifestation, reiterating its stand.<br><br>Respondents then filed a Motion to Resolve its Motion to Dismiss previously filed with the Old DOJ Panel, prior to the Decision and Resolution in G.R. No. 119322.<br><br>Subsequently, on July 24, 1998, the New DOJ Panel ruled that: 1) There was substantial compliance by the BIR with the order to produce documents; 2) on the basis of the evidence submitted by the BIR, the panel finds sufficient ground to proceed with the preliminary investigation of the cases; and 3) in view of the foregoing findings, the respondents were directed to file their counter-affidavits within 15 days from receipt of the order.<br><br>Instead of filing counter-affidavits, the respondents filed a Supplement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to its previous Verified Motion to Dismiss; Alternatively Motion to Suspend. Thus, the 15-day period to file counter-affidavits was deemed by the New DOJ Panel to have lapsed, hence, the case was submitted for resolution.<br><br>Respondents, thereafter, filed, with the New DOJ Panel, motions to suspend the ongoing preliminary investigation, on the ground that the BIR Legal Service Appellate Division has given due course to Fortune’s request for reconsideration/protest of the deficiency tax assessment on Fortune’s 1992 tax liabilities.<br><br>On November 19, 1998, the New DOJ Panel issued its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> stating that as to the Urgent Motion to Suspend, the same is denied since the preliminary investigation was not on the issue of the correctness of the computation of Fortune’s tax liabilities and assessment but the determination of whether the acts complained of violate certain provisions of the Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The New DOJ Panel resolved the main complaints in favor of the BIR. It found reasonable ground to believe that respondents were probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE MeTC</span></div><br>On December 1, 1998, Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> for nine (9) counts of tax evasion (Taxable Years 1990, 1991 and 1992) were filed by the New DOJ Panel with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Marikina City, Branch 75, docketed as <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Criminal Cases Nos. 98-38181 to 98-38189</span>.

Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.</blockquote>In another case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court affirmed the power conferred upon trial courts, reiterating:<blockquote>This argument is untenable. The court could have denied the public prosecutor's motion for the withdrawal of the information against petitioner, and there would have been no question of its power to do so. If it could do that, so could it reconsider what it had ordered.&nbsp; Every court has the power and indeed the duty to review and amend or reverse its findings and conclusions when its attention is timely called to any error or defect therein.</blockquote>Jurisprudence mandates that the grant of a motion to dismiss must be based upon the judge’s own personal conviction that there was no case against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The trial judge must himself be convinced that there was indeed no sufficient evidence against the accused, and this conclusion can be arrived at only after an assessment of the evidence in the possession of the prosecution. What was imperatively required was the trial judge's own assessment of such evidence, it not being sufficient for the valid and proper exercise of judicial discretion merely to accept the prosecution's word for its supposed insufficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the record clearly shows that the MeTC failed to discharge its duty to judiciously and independently rule upon the motion to withdraw.<br><br>In the Order dated March 22, 1999, the trial court stated:<blockquote>The Court <span style="font-style: italic;">agrees</span> with the Bureau of Internal Revenue that in view of the aforecited Section of the Tax Reform Act of 1997, a substantive law, and the fact that it is evident that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has not approved the filing of the instant cases, <span style="font-style: italic;">this Court, thus, has no other recourse but to obey the law and dismiss the cases at bar</span>.<br><br>Moreover, pursuant to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue et al. vs. The Honorable Court of Appeals, et al., G.R.
