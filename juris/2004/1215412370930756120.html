But instead, it had filed a Motion for Reconsideration on March 19, 1999, consuming eight (8) days and on August 6, 1999 through her counsel petitioner had received the subject Order dated July 27, 1999 denying her motion for reconsideration. She therefore, ha[d] fifty eight (58) remaining days or until September 27, 1999 within which to file her petition for certiorari or any appropriate pleading, contrary to her allegation that the last day was on October 26, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>Section 3 of Rule 46 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Contents and filing of petition; effect of non-compliance with requirements</i>.- The petition shall contain the full names and actual addresses of all the petitioners and respondents, a concise statement of the matters involved, the factual background of the case, and the grounds relied upon for the relief prayed for.<br><br>In actions filed under Rule 65, the petition shall further indicate the material dates showing when notice of the judgment or (final) order or resolution subject thereof was received, when a motion for new trial or reconsideration, if any, was filed and when notice of the denial thereof was received.<br><br>It shall be filed in seven (7) clearly legible copies together with proof of service thereof on the respondent with the original copy intended for the court indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order, resolution, or ruling subject thereof, such material portions of the record as are referred to therein, and other documents relevant or pertinent thereto. The certification shall be accomplished by the proper clerk of court or by his duly authorized representative, or by the proper officer of the court, tribunal, agency or office involved or by his duly authorized representative. The other requisite number of copies of the petition shall be accompanied by clearly legible plain copies of all documents attached to the original.<br><br>The petitioner shall also submit together with the petition a sworn certification that he has not theretofore commenced any other action involving the same issues in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals or different divisions thereof, or any other tribunal or agency; if there is such other action or proceeding, he must state the status of the same; and if he should thereafter learn that a similar action or proceeding has been filed or is pending before the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or different divisions thereof, or any other tribunal or agency, he undertakes to promptly inform the aforesaid courts and other tribunal or agency thereof within five (5) days therefrom.<br><br>The petitioner shall pay the corresponding docket and other lawful fees to the clerk of court and deposit the amount of P500.00 for costs at the time of the filing of the petition.<br><br>The failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition.<br></blockquote>There are three material dates that must be stated in a petition for certiorari brought under Rule 65. First, <u>the date when notice of the judgment or final order or resolution was received</u>; second, <u>the date when a motion for new trial or for reconsideration when one such was filed; and third, the date when notice of the denial thereof was received</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In the petition filed before the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> petitioner indicated therein that she received a copy of the January 26, 1999 DOLE Order on March 11, 1999, after which she filed a Motion for Reconsideration thereof on March 19, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that she received the July 27, 1999 DOLE Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration on August <b>6</b>, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is noted, however, that petitioner erred with respect to the date of her receipt of the DOLE Order of July 27, 1999, for the records show that she actually received it on August <b>20</b>, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>While this Court has held that there is substantial compliance with the rule mandating statement of material dates if the same is executed by an attorney, it being presumed that facts alleged by him are true to his knowledge and belief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the same does not apply as regards the rule requiring the filing of a certification against forum shopping. Such certification must be signed by the plaintiff or any of the principal parties and not by the attorney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> For such certification is a peculiar personal representation on the part of the principal party, an assurance given to the court or other tribunal that there are no other pending cases involving basically the same parties, issues and causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x Obviously it is the petitioner, and not always the counsel whose professional services have been retained for a particular case, who is in the best position to know whether he or it actually filed or caused the filing of a petition in that case. Hence, a certification against forum shopping by counsel is a defective certification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>To merit the Court’s consideration, however, a petitioner must show reasonable cause for failure to personally sign the certification and manifest that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to the petition filed before the CA was signed not by petitioner but by her counsel, Atty. Salvador Hipolito.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Atty. Hipolito therein reasoned that he was unable to have petitioner affix her signature as her father died and was buried on the date the petition was filed before the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In her Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration filed before the CA, however, petitioner attached a certification of non-forum shopping duly executed by her. This is may be considered as substantial compliance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>With respect to the non-attachment of the affidavit of service, the records bear that the petition filed before the CA was accompanied by the original registry receipts (Registry Receipt Nos. 1129-1132)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> issued by the San Fernando, Pampanga Post Office, indicating that the petition and its annexes were served upon the parties. The Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> was accompanied too by an affidavit of service. This Court thus finds that there was substantial compliance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Respecting the requirement of the Rules that the petition for certiorari be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order, resolution, or ruling subject thereof:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The terms “certified true copy” and “duplicate original” were clarified in Administrative Circular 3-96, the pertinent portions of which read:<br><ol type="1"><li> The “duplicate original copy” shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgment, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The “certified true copy” thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives of the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.<br><br></li><li> The duplicate original copy must be duly signed or initialed by the authorities or the corresponding officer or representative of the issuing entity, or shall at least bear the dry seal thereof or any other official indication of the authenticity and completeness of such copy. xxx<br><br></li><li> The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefore of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.<br></li></ol>Petitioner avers that she attached duplicate original copies of the assailed DOLE Orders to her petition for certiorari before the CA. A scrutiny of the records, however, shows that what she submitted were mere photocopies. Still, this Court finds that there was substantial compliance with the Rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> since petitioner attached to her Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration certified true copies of the questioned DOLE Orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><blockquote>There is ample jurisprudence holding that the subsequent and substantial compliance of an appellant may call for the relaxation of the rules of procedure. In <i>Cusi-Hernandez vs. Diaz</i> and <i>Piglas-Kamao vs. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, we ruled that the subsequent submission of the missing documents with the motion for reconsideration amounts to substantial compliance. The reasons behind the failure of the petitioners in these two cases to comply with the required attachments were no longer scrutinized. What we found noteworthy in each case was the fact that the petitioners therein substantially complied with the formal requirements. We ordered the remand of the petitions in these cases to the Court of Appeals, stressing the ruling that by precipitately dismissing the petitions “the appellate court clearly put a premium on technicalities at the expense of a just resolution of the case.”<br><center><br>xxx<br></center><br>If we were to apply the rules of procedure in a very rigid and technical sense, as what the Court of Appeals would have it in this case, the ends of justice would be defeated. In <i>Cusi-Hernandez vs. Diaz</i>, where the formal requirements were liberally construed and substantial compliance was recognized, we explained that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to expedite the decision or resolution of cases and other matters pending in court. Hence, a strict and rigid application of technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice must be avoided. We further declared that:<br><br>“Cases should be determined on the merits, after full opportunity to all parties for ventilation of their causes and defenses, rather than on technicality or some procedural imperfections. In that way, the ends of justice would be served better.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>One final point. Contrary to SIDDCOR’s averments, this Court finds that the petition for certiorari before the CA, which was filed on October 26, 1990, was on time. As priorly discussed, petitioner received the January 26, 1999 DOLE Order on March 11, 1999, filed a Motion for Reconsideration thereof on March 19, 1999, and received the July 26, 1999 DOLE Order denying such Motion on August 20, 1999.<br><br>In view of the retroactive application of procedural laws,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Section 4, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Procedure, as amended by A.M. No. 00-2-03 which took effect on September 1, 2000, is the governing provision. It states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. When and where petition filed. – The petition may be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion.<br><br>The petition shall be filed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court, exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omission of a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided by law or these rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>No extension of time to file the petition shall be granted except for compelling reason and in no case exceeding fifteen (15) days.<br></blockquote>Petitioner then had until October 19, 1999 to file a petition for certiorari before the CA. On October 11, 1999, however, as earlier stated, she filed a Special Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Certiorari praying that she be allowed an additional fifteen day period or until October 26, 1999 within which to file the petition which was granted by the CA. She did file one such on October 26, 1999.<br><br><i>En passant</i>, the petition would still have been considered timely filed under Section 4 of Rule 65<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> before its amendment by A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The emerging trend in the rulings of this Court is to afford every party-litigant the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This is in line with the time-honored principle that cases should be decided only after giving all parties the chance to argue their causes and defenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> For, it is far better to dispose of a case on the merits which is a primordial end rather than on a technicality, if it be the case, that may result in injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated December 17, 1999 and February 21, 2000 are <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
