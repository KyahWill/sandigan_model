They also corroborated Delfin and Agustin's allegation that the real owners of the property are the heirs of Joaquin Smith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In order to debunk petitioners' claim that the Smiths owned the subject property, Margarita presented a certified copy of a Resolution from the Land Management Office denying the Smiths' application for recognition of the subject property as part of their ancestral land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The resolution explains that the application had to be denied because the Smiths did not "possess, occupy or utilize all or a portion of the property x x x.&nbsp; The actual occupants (who were not named in the resolution) whose improvements are visible are not in any way related to the applicant or his co-heirs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>To bolster her claim of ownership and possession, Margarita introduced as evidence an unnumbered resolution of the Community Special Task Force on Ancestral Lands (CSTFAL) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), acting favorably on her and her siblings' ancestral land claim over a portion of the 186,090-square meter property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The said resolution states:<br><br><blockquote>The land subject of the instant application is the ancestral land of the herein applicants.&nbsp; Well-established is the fact that the land treated herein was first declared for taxation purposes in 1922 under Tax Declaration No. 363&nbsp; by the applicant's grandfather Ap-Ap (one name). Said application was reconstructed in 1965 after the original got lost during the war. These tax declarations were issued and recorded in the Municipality of Tuba, Benguet, considering that the land was then within the territorial jurisdiction of the said municipality. That upon the death of declarant Ap-Ap his heirs x x x transferred the tax declaration in their name, [which tax declaration is] now with the City assessor's office of Baguio.<br><br>The land consisting of four (4) lots with a total area of ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NINETY (186,090) SQUARE METERS, is covered by Psu-198317 duly approved by the Director of Lands on October 4, 1963 in the name of Ap-Ap (one name).&nbsp; In 1964, the same land was the subject of a petition filed by Gilbert Semon, as petitioner, before the Court of First Instance of the City of Baguio in the reopening of Judicial Proceedings under Civil Case No. 1, GLRO Record No. 211 for the registration and the issuance of Certificate of Title of said land.&nbsp; The land registration case was however overtaken by the decision of the Supreme Court declaring such judicial proceedings null and void because the courts of law have no jurisdiction.<br><br>It has been sufficiently substantiated by the applicants that prior to and at the time of the pendency of the land registration case and henceforth up to and including the present, the herein applicants by themselves and through their predecessor-in-interest have been in exclusive, continuous, and material possession and occupation of the said parcel of land mentioned above under claim of ownership, devoting the same for residential and agricultural purposes.&nbsp; Found are the residential houses of the applicants as well as those of their close relatives, while the other areas planted to fruit trees, coffee and banana, and seasonal crops.&nbsp; Also noticeable therein are permanent stone and earthen fences, terraces, clearings, including irrigation gadgets.<br><br>On the matter of the applicant[s'] indiguinity [sic] and qualifications, there is no doubt that they are members of the National Cultural Communities, particularly the Ibaloi tribe.&nbsp; They are the legitimate grandchildren of Ap-Ap (one name) who lived along the Asin Road area.&nbsp; His legal heirs are:&nbsp; Orani Ap-Ap, married to Calado Salda; Rita Ap-Ap, married to Jose Bacacan; Sucdad Ap-Ap, married to Oragon Wakit; and Gilbert Semon, a former vice-mayor of Tuba, Benguet, [who] adopted the common name of their father Semon, as it is the customary practice among the early Ibalois.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>On the matter regarding the inheritance of the heirs of Ap-Ap, it is important to state [that] Gilbert Semon consolidated ownership thereof and became the sole heir in 1964, by way of a "Deed of Quitclaim" executed by the heirs in his favor.&nbsp; As to the respective share of the applicants['] co-heirs, the same was properly adjudicated in 1989 with the execution of an "Extrajudicial Settlement/ Partition of Estate with Waiver of Rights."<br><br>With regard to the overlapping issue, it is pertinent to state that application No. Bg-L-066 of Thomas Smith has already been denied by us in our Resolution dated November 1997.&nbsp; As to the other adverse claims therein by reason of previous conveyances in favor of third parties, the same were likewise excluded resulting in the reduction of the area originally applied from ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NINETY (186,090) SQUARE METERS, more or less to ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO (110,342) SQUARE METERS, more or less.&nbsp; Considering the foregoing developments, we find no legal and procedural obstacle in giving due course to the instant application.<br><br>Now therefore, we hereby [resolve] that the application for Recognition of Ancestral Land Claim filed by the Heirs of Gilbert Semon, represented by Juanito Semon, be granted [and]&nbsp; a Certificate of Ancestral Land Claim (CALC) be issued to the herein applicants by the Secretary, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Visayas Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City, through the Regional Executive Director, DENR-CAR, Diego Silang Street, Baguio City.

The series of transfers of the property were indications of the respondent's and her predecessors' interest over the property.&nbsp; The court opined that while these pieces of documentary evidence were not conclusive proof of actual possession, they lend credence to respondent's claim because, "in the ordinary course of things, persons will not execute legal documents dealing with real property, unless they believe, and have the basis to believe, that they have an interest in the property subject of the legal documents x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In contrast, the trial court found nothing on record to substantiate the allegations of the petititioners that they and their parents were the long-time possessors of the subject property.

The issue before the NCIP is whether the Government, as grantor, will recognize the ancestral land claim of respondent over a public alienable land; while the issue in the reivindicatory case before the trial court is ownership, possession, and right to recover the real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Given that the elements of lis pendens are absent in case at bar, the allegation of forum-shopping is also bereft of merit.&nbsp;

Petitioners now argue that the two courts erred in their appreciation of the evidence.&nbsp; They ask the Court to review the evidence of both parties, despite the CA's finding that the trial court committed no error in appreciating the evidence presented during trial.&nbsp; Hence, petitioners seek a review of questions of fact, which is beyond the province of a Rule 45 petition.&nbsp; A question of fact exists if the uncertainty centers on the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; "Such questions as whether certain items of evidence should be accorded probative value or weight, or rejected as feeble or spurious, or whether the proofs on one side or the other are clear and convincing and adequate to establish a proposition in issue, are without doubt questions of fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Since it raises essentially questions of fact, this assignment of error must be dismissed for&nbsp; it is settled that only questions of law may be reviewed in an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; There is a question of law when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts.&nbsp; Questions of law can be resolved without having to re-examine the probative value of evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of facts being admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; The instant case does not present a compelling reason to deviate from the foregoing rule, especially since both trial and appellate courts agree that respondent had proven her claim of ownership as against petitioners' claims.&nbsp; Their factual findings, supported as they are by the evidence, should be accorded great respect.<br><br>In any case, even if petitioners' arguments attacking the authenticity and admissibility of the Deed of Quitclaim executed in favor of respondent's father are well-taken, it will not suffice to defeat respondent's claim over the subject property.&nbsp; Even without the Deed of Quitclaim, respondent's claims of prior possession and ownership were adequately supported and corroborated by her other documentary and testimonial evidence.&nbsp; We agree with the trial court's observation that, in the ordinary course of things, people will not go to great lengths to execute legal documents and pay realty taxes over a real property, unless they have reason to believe that they have an interest over the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The fact that respondent's documents traverse several decades, from the 1960s to the 1990s, is an indication that she and her family never abandoned their right to the property and have continuously exercised rights of ownership over the same.<br><br>Moreover, respondent's version of how the petitioners came to occupy the property coincides with the same timeline given by the petitioners themselves. The only difference is that petitioners maintain they came into possession by tolerance of the Smith family, while respondent maintains that it was her parents who gave permission to petitioners.&nbsp; Given the context under which the parties' respective statements were made, the Court is inclined to believe the respondent's version, as both the trial and appellate courts have concluded, since her version is corroborated by the documentary evidence.<br><br><i>Whether petitioners have acquired the subject property by prescription</i><br><br>Assuming that the subject land may be acquired by prescription, we cannot accept petitioners' claim of acquisition by prescription.&nbsp; Petitioners admitted that they had occupied the property by tolerance of the owner thereof.&nbsp; Having made this admission, they cannot claim that they have acquired the property by prescription unless they can prove acts of repudiation.&nbsp; It is settled that possession, in order to ripen into ownership, must be in the concept of an owner, public, peaceful and uninterrupted. Possession not in the concept of owner, such as the one claimed by petitioners, cannot ripen into ownership by acquisitive prescription, <i>unless</i> the juridical relation is first <i>expressly</i> <i>repudiated</i> and such repudiation has been communicated to the other party. Acts of possessory character executed due to license or by mere tolerance of the owner are inadequate for purposes of acquisitive prescription.
