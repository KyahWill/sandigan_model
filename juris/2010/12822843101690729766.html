The constitutional mandate concerning citizenship must be adhered to strictly.&nbsp; Philippine citizenship can never be treated like a commodity that can be claimed when needed and suppressed when convenient. One who is privileged to elect Philippine citizenship has only an inchoate right to such citizenship. As such, he should avail of the right with fervor, enthusiasm and promptitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </blockquote><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>The 1935 Constitution declares as citizens of the Philippines those whose mothers are citizens of the Philippines and elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.

The said party shall accompany the aforesaid statement with the oath of allegiance to the Constitution and the Government of the Philippines.<br></blockquote><br>The statutory formalities of electing Philippine citizenship are: (1) a statement of election under oath; (2) an oath of allegiance to the Constitution and Government of the Philippines; and (3) registration of the statement of election and of the oath with the nearest civil registry.<br><br>In <i>Re:Application for Admission to the Philippine Bar, Vicente D. Ching</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we determined the meaning of the period of election described by phrase "upon reaching the age of majority."&nbsp; Our references were the Civil Code of the Philippines, the opinions of the Secretary of Justice, and the case of <i>Cueco v.

No. 625 did not prescribe a time period within which the election of Philippine citizenship should be made. The 1935 Charter only provides that the election should be made "upon reaching the age of majority."&nbsp; The age of majority then commenced upon reaching twenty-one (21) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; In the opinions of the Secretary of Justice on cases involving the validity of election of Philippine citizenship, this dilemma was resolved by basing the time period on the decisions of this Court prior to the effectivity of the 1935 Constitution.&nbsp; In these decisions, the proper period for electing Philippine citizenship was, in turn, based on the pronouncements of the Department of State of the United States Government to the effect that the election should be made within a reasonable time after attaining the age of majority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; The phrase "reasonable time" has been interpreted to mean that the elections should be made within three (3) years from reaching the age of majority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, we held in <i>Cue<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[n]</span>co vs. Secretary of Justice,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that the three (3) year period is not an inflexible rule.&nbsp; We said:<br><br><blockquote>It is true that this clause has been construed to mean a reasonable time after reaching the age of majority, and that the Secretary of Justice has ruled that three (3) years is the reasonable time to elect Philippine citizenship under the constitutional provision adverted to above, which period may be extended under certain circumstances, as when the person concerned has always considered himself a Filipino.<br></blockquote>However, we cautioned in <i>Cue<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[n]</span>co </i>that the extension of the option to elect Philippine citizenship is not indefinite.<br><blockquote><br>Regardless of the foregoing, petitioner was born on February 16, 1923.&nbsp; He became of age on February 16, 1944.&nbsp; His election of citizenship was made on May 15, 1951, when he was over twenty-eight (28) years of age, or over seven (7) years after he had reached the age of majority.&nbsp; It is clear that said election has not been made "upon reaching the age of majority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>We reiterated the above ruling in <i>Go, Sr. v. Ramos,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> a case in which we adopted the findings of the appellate court that the father of the petitioner, whose citizenship was in question, failed to elect Philippine citizenship within the reasonable period of three (3) years upon reaching the age of majority; and that "the belated submission to the local civil registry of the affidavit of election and oath of allegiance x x x was defective because the affidavit of election was executed after the oath of allegiance, and the delay of several years before their filing with the proper office was not satisfactorily explained."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In both cases, we ruled against the petitioners because they belatedly complied with all the requirements. The acts of election and their registration with the nearest civil registry were all done beyond the reasonable period of three years upon reaching the age of majority.<br><br>The instant case presents a different factual setting.&nbsp; Petitioners complied with the first and second requirements upon reaching the age of majority.&nbsp; It was only the registration of the documents of election with the civil registry that was belatedly done.<br><br>We rule that under the facts peculiar to the petitioners, the right to elect Philippine citizenship has not been lost and they should be allowed to complete the statutory requirements for such election.<br><br>Such conclusion, contrary to the finding of the Court of Appeals, is in line with our decisions in <i>In Re:Florencio Mallare</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><i> Co v.

Ching</i>, <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[which was decided on 1 October 1999]</span>, is obviously flawed.&nbsp; It bears emphasis that the Supreme Court, in said case, did not adopt the doctrine laid down in <i>In Re: Florencio Mallare.&nbsp; </i>On the contrary, the Supreme Court was emphatic in pronouncing that "the special circumstances invoked by Ching, i.e., his continuous and uninterrupted stay in the Philippines and his being a certified public accountant, a registered voter and a former elected public official, cannot vest in him Philippine citizenship as the law specifically lays down the requirements for acquisition of Philippine citizenship by election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We are not prepared to state that the mere exercise of suffrage, being elected public official, continuous and uninterrupted stay in the Philippines, and other similar acts showing exercise of Philippine citizenship can take the place of election of citizenship.&nbsp; What we now say is that where, as in petitioners' case, the election of citizenship has in fact been done and documented within the constitutional and statutory timeframe, the registration of the documents of election beyond the frame should be allowed if in the meanwhile positive acts of citizenship have publicly, consistently, and continuously been done.&nbsp; The actual exercise of Philippine citizenship, for over half a century by the herein petitioners, is actual notice to the Philippine public which is equivalent to formal registration of the election of Philippine citizenship.<br><br>For what purpose is registration?<br><br>In <i>Pascua v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> we elucidated the principles of civil law on registration:<br><br><blockquote>To register is to record or annotate. American and Spanish authorities are unanimous on the meaning of the term "to register" as "to enter in a register; to record formally and distinctly; to enroll; to enter in a list."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; In general, registration refers to any entry made in the books of the registry, including both registration in its ordinary and strict sense, and cancellation, annotation, and even the marginal notes.&nbsp; In strict acceptation, it pertains to the entry made in the registry which records solemnly and permanently the right of ownership and other real rights<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Simply stated, registration is made for the purpose of <b>notification</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br>Actual knowledge may even have the effect of registration as to the person who has knowledge thereof.&nbsp; Thus, "<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[i]</span>ts purpose is to give notice thereof to all persons (and it) operates as a notice of the deed, contract, or instrument to others."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; As pertinent is the holding that registration "neither adds to its validity nor converts an invalid instrument into a valid one between the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; It lays emphasis on the validity of an unregistered document.<br><br>Comparable jurisprudence may be consulted.<br><br>In a contract of partnership, we said that the purpose of registration is to give notice to third parties; that failure to register the contract does not affect the liability of the partnership and of the partners to third persons; and that neither does such failure affect the partnership's juridical personality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> An unregistered contract of partnership is valid as among the partners, so long as it has the essential requisites, because the main purpose of registration is to give notice to third parties, and it can be assumed that the members themselves knew of the contents of their contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The non-registration of a deed of donation does not also affect its validity. Registration is not a requirement for the validity of the contract as between the parties, for the effect of registration serves chiefly to bind third persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Likewise relevant is the pronouncement that registration is not a mode of acquiring a right.&nbsp; In an analogous case involving an unrecorded deed of sale, we reiterated the settled rule that registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership.<br><blockquote>Registration does not confer ownership.&nbsp; It is not a mode of acquiring dominion, but only a means of confirming the fact of its existence with notice to the world at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>Registration, then, is the confirmation of the existence of a fact. In the instant case, registration is the confirmation of election as such election.&nbsp; It is not the registration of the act of election, although a valid requirement under Commonwealth Act No. 625, that will confer Philippine citizenship on the petitioners.&nbsp; It is only a means of confirming the fact that citizenship has been claimed.<br><br>Indeed, we even allow the late registration of the fact of birth and of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, has it been admitted through existing rules that the late registration of the fact of birth of a child does not erase the fact of birth.&nbsp; Also, the fact of marriage cannot be declared void solely because of the failure to have the marriage certificate registered with the designated government agency.<br><br>Notably, the petitioners timely took their oath of allegiance to the Philippines.&nbsp; This was a serious undertaking.&nbsp; It was commitment and fidelity to the state coupled with a pledge "to renounce absolutely and forever all allegiance" to any other state.&nbsp; This was unqualified acceptance of their identity as a Filipino and the complete disavowal of any other nationality.<br><br>Petitioners have passed decades of their lives in the Philippines as Filipinos.&nbsp; Their present status having been formed by their past, petitioners can no longer have any national identity except that which they chose upon reaching the age of reason.<br><br>Corollary to this fact, we cannot agree with the view of the Court of Appeals that since the ACR presented by the petitioners are no longer valid on account of the new requirement to present an E-series ACR, they are deemed not properly documented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> On the contrary, petitioners should not be expected to secure E-series ACR because it would be inconsistent with the election of citizenship and its constructive registration through their acts made public, among others, their exercise of suffrage, election as public official, and continued and uninterrupted stay in the Philippines since birth.&nbsp; The failure to register as aliens is, obviously, consistent with petitioners' election of Philippine citizenship.<br><br>The leanings towards recognition of the citizenship of children of Filipino mothers have been indicated not alone by the jurisprudence that liberalized the requirement on time of election, and recognized positive acts of Philippine citizenship.<br><br>The favor that is given to such children is likewise evident in the evolution of the constitutional provision on Philippine citizenship.<br><br>Thus, while the 1935 Constitution requires that children of Filipino mothers elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching their age of majority,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> upon the effectivity of the 1973 Constitution, they automatically become Filipinos<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and need not elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.&nbsp; The 1973 provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.&nbsp; The following are citizens of the Philippines:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) xxx.<br>(2) Those whose fathers and mothers are citizens of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></div></blockquote><br>Better than the relaxation of the requirement, the 1987 Constitution now classifies them as natural-born citizens upon election of Philippine citizenship. Thus, Sec. 2, Article IV thereof provides:<br><br><blockquote><i>Section 2. </i>Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens of the Philippines from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect their Philippine citizenship.&nbsp; <b>Those who elect Philippine citizenship in accordance with paragraph (3), Section 1 hereof</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><b> shall be deemed natural-born citizens. </b><i>(Emphasis supplied.)</i><br><br></blockquote>The constitutional <i>bias</i> is reflected in the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">MR.

BERNAS.&nbsp; x x x Precisely, the reason behind the modification of the 1935 rule on citizenship was a recognition of the fact that it reflected a certain male chauvinism, and it was for the purpose of remedying that this proposed provision was put in. The idea was that we should not penalize the mother of a child simply because she fell in love with a foreigner. Now, the question on what citizenship the child would prefer arises.&nbsp; We really have no way of guessing the preference of the infant. But if we recognize the right of the child to choose, then let him choose when he reaches the age of majority.&nbsp; I think dual citizenship is just a reality imposed on us because we have no control of the laws on citizenship of other countries.&nbsp; We recognize a child of a Filipino mother.&nbsp; But whether or not she is considered a citizen of another country is something completely beyond our control.&nbsp; But certainly it is within the jurisdiction of the Philippine government to require that <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[at]</sup> a certain point, a child be made to choose.&nbsp; But I do not think we should penalize the child before he is even able to choose.&nbsp; I would, therefore, support the retention of the modification made in 1973 of the male chauvinistic rule of the 1935 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. REGALADO.&nbsp; With respect to a child who became a Filipino citizen by election, which the Committee is now planning to consider a natural-born citizen, he will be so the moment he opts for Philippine citizenship.&nbsp; Did the Committee take into account the fact that at the time of birth, all he had was just an inchoate right to choose Philippine citizenship, and yet, by subsequently choosing Philippine citizenship, it would appear that his choice retroacted to the date of his birth so much so that under the Gentleman's proposed amendment, he would be a natural-born citizen?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>FR. BERNAS.&nbsp; But the difference between him and the natural-born who lost his status is that the natural-born who lost his status, lost it voluntarily; whereas, this individual in the situation contemplated in Section 1, paragraph 3 never had the chance to choose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>[on the period within which to elect Philippine citizenship]<br><br>MR.
