				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which seeks to annul and set aside the Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 3, 2006 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 71017.<br><br>The facts, as shown in the records, are the following:<br><br>On January 29, 2002, Cebu Printing and Packaging Corporation (CEPRI) filed a Petition for Rehabilitation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu City, Branch 11.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Finding the petition sufficient in form and substance, the RTC issued a Stay Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated February 11, 2002: staying enforcement of all claims against CEPRI, its guarantors and sureties; appointing Mr. Sergio D. Lim, Jr. as rehabilitation receiver and fixing his bond at P100,000.00; directing CEPRI to publish said Order in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks; fixing the initial hearing on the petition on March 21, 2002; and directing all creditors and all interested parties (including the Securities and Exchange Commission) to file and serve on CEPRI a verified comment on or opposition to the petition, with supporting affidavits and documents, not later than ten (10) days before March 21, 2002, and putting them on notice that their failure to do so will bar them from participating in the proceedings, among others.<br><br>After due publication of the Stay Order, only China Banking Corporation (Chinabank) filed a Comment/Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated March 8, 2002.<br><br>After the initial hearing, the RTC issued the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated April 30, 2002 denying due course to the petition for rehabilitation. The Order reads in part:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, this Court hereby does not give due course to the petition for rehabilitation filed in this case.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court lifts the stay order issued in this case on February 11, 2002 and recalls the appointment of Mr. Carlos G.

MAN-4372, PRESENTLY PURSUED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THE RESPONDENT, EACH ASKING FOR RELIEF INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated October 23, 2006, CEPRI argued that the CA did not commit any reversible error when it ruled that even a petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is embraced under A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC promulgated on September 14, 2004 and took effect on October 15, 2004, governing appeals in corporate rehabilitation cases.&nbsp; It further claimed that the CA did not err in disregarding the factual findings of the RTC. It also pointed out that the issue on forum shopping should not have been raised in this Court, because the said issue had already been addressed by the CA.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>Petitioner contends that a special civil action under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is not a remedy for the failure to timely file a petition for review under Rule 45.&nbsp; It adds that Rule 65 is an independent action that cannot be availed of as a substitute for the lost remedy of an ordinary appeal, especially if such loss or lapse was occasioned by one's own negligence or error in the choice of remedies.&nbsp; It also claims that CEPRI was prompted to file the petition for <i>certiorari</i> not because of its firm conviction that grave abuse of discretion attended the issuance of the commercial court's Order dated April 30, 2002, denying due course on the petition for rehabilitation, but in a bid to make up for the lost remedy of appeal.<br><br>Nevertheless, the CA, in its Amended Decision dated March 3, 2006, treated the petition for <i>certiorari </i>as a petition for review citing several decisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of this Court.&nbsp; The CA went on to state that the petition for <i>certiorari </i>filed by CEPRI was pursuant to A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC which treats the said petition as a petition for review under Rule 43. This is an error on the part of the CA.<br><br>The foremost issue to be resolved is whether or not CEPRI availed of the proper remedy.&nbsp; This Court rules in the negative.<br><br>Section 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Rule 3 of the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. <i>Executory Nature of Orders</i>. - Any order issued by the court under these Rules is immediately executory.&nbsp; <b>A petition for review or an appeal therefrom shall not stay the execution of the order unless restrained or enjoined by the appellate court. The review of any order or decision of the court or an appeal therefrom shall be in accordance with the Rules of Court</b>: <i>Provided, however</i>, that the reliefs ordered by the trial or appellate courts shall take into account the need for resolution of proceedings in a just, equitable, and speedy manner.<br></blockquote><br>As correctly argued by petitioner, the proceedings for corporate rehabilitation is categorized as a special proceeding; hence, as supplied in A.M. 00-8-10-SC:<br><br><blockquote>Following the discussion above, the period of appeal provided in section 3, Rule 41<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure for ordinary civil actions shall apply to cases involving intra-corporate disputes. Corollarily, the period of appeal provided in paragraph 19 (b) of the Interim Rules Relative to the Implementation of B.P. Blg. 129 for special proceedings shall apply to petitions for rehabilitation.</blockquote><br>However, this Court issued A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> as a clarification on the proper mode of appeal of cases which were formerly under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as those cases involving corporate rehabilitation. Now, there is no more need to file a notice of appeal and record on appeal.&nbsp; An appeal may now be perfected by filing a petition for review within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision or final order of the trial court, directly to the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; As stated:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court Resolves:<br><br>1. All decisions and final orders in cases falling under the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act No. 8799 shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals through a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>2.&nbsp; The petition for review shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision or final order of the Regional Commercial Court.&nbsp; Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the legal fee prescribed in Rule 141, as amended before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an&nbsp; additional period of fifteen (15) days within which to file the petition for review.&nbsp; No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reasons and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.<br><br>3. This Resolution shall apply to all pending appeals filed within the reglementary period from decisions and final orders in cases falling under the Interim Corporate Rehabilitation and the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act No. 8799, regardless of the mode of appeal or petition resorted to by the appellant.<br><br>4. These pending appeals or petitions shall be treated in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>a. In case a notice of appeal and/or record on appeal was filed with the Regional Commercial Court within the period provided in A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC, and the original record or the approved record on appeal has not been transmitted to the Court of Appeals, the appealing party shall have fifteen (15) days from the effectivity of this Resolution to file a petition for review under Rule 43 with the Court of Appeals, without prejudice to filing a motion for extension in accordance with 1 hereof.<br><br>The notice of appeal and/or record on appeal shall remain in the original record but the Regional Commercial Court and/or its clerk shall not transmit the original record or the approved record on appeal to the Court of Appeals anymore.<br><br>An appealing party who fails to file a petition for review with the Court of Appeals within the prescribed period shall not be deemed to have abandoned his appeal, in which case the appeal shall run its due course.<br><br>b. In case a notice of appeal and/or record on appeal was filed with the Regional Commercial Court within the period provided in A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC, and the original record or the approved record on appeal has been transmitted to the Court of Appeals, the case shall continue as an appeal.<br><br><b>c. In case a petition appealing or assailing the decision and/or final order is filed directly with the Court of Appeals within the reglementary period, such petition shall be considered a petition for review under Rule 43.</b><br><br>d. In case a notice of appeal and/or record on appeal is filed with the Regional Commercial Court and a petition appealing or assailing the decision and/or final order is likewise filed with the Court of Appeals, the cases shall be consolidated and treated as a petition for review under Rule 43. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>The above resolution emphasizes the need to perfect an appeal within the given period which is fifteen (15) days by specifically stating that Rule 43 of the Rules of Court is the mode of appeal that is applicable for those appealing or assailing the decisions and/or final orders of the RTC.&nbsp; Thus, when it is mentioned in paragraph 4 (c) of A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC that <i>in case a petition appealing or assailing the decision and/or final order is filed directly with the Court of Appeals within the reglementary period, such petition shall be considered a petition for review under Rule 43</i>, it is presumed that the mode of appeal resorted to was an ordinary appeal and not a special civil action. Otherwise, the Resolution should have categorically included <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 as among those that should be considered as a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Again, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court pertains to an ordinary mode of appeal, whereas CEPRI availed of Rule 65, a special civil action.<br><br>In <i>New Frontier Sugar Corporation v. RTC, Branch 39, Iloilo City,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><i> </i>this Court already ruled that the proper mode of appeal in cases of corporate rehabilitation is&nbsp; through a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court to be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision or final order of the RTC. As ruled:<br><br><blockquote>However, it should be noted that the Court issued A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC on September 14, 2004, clarifying the proper mode of appeal in cases involving corporate rehabilitation and intra-corporate controversies. It is provided therein that all decisions and final orders in cases falling under the Interim Rules of Corporate Rehabilitation and the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act No. 8799 shall be appealed to the CA through a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court to be filed <b>within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision or final order of the RTC</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Through the above decision of this Court, it can be gleaned that the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision or final order of the RTC within which to file an appeal is of utmost importance.<br><br>In reversing its original ruling that CEPRI availed of wrong mode of appeal, the CA in its Amended Decision reasoned out that although the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was an incorrect remedy, it allowed the treatment of such petition as a petition for review based on earlier rulings of this Court.&nbsp; While it may be true that this Court, in various cases, has treated a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 as a petition for review, it does not follow that the appellate courts should subscribe to those rulings as a general rule.&nbsp; In those decisions, certain exceptional circumstances were present which necessitated the relaxing of the rule.&nbsp; Highly instructive is this Court's ruling in <i>Tagle v. Equitable PCI Bank</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The remedies of appeal in the ordinary course of law and that of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court are mutually exclusive and not alternative or cumulative. Time and again, this Court has reminded members of the bench and bar that the special civil action of <i>Certiorari</i> cannot be used as a substitute for a lost appeal where the latter remedy is available; especially if such loss or lapse was occasioned by one's own negligence or error in the choice of remedies.<br><br>To be sure, once again, we take this opportunity to distinguish between a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> (an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>) and a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> (a special civil action/an original action for <i>Certiorari</i>), under Rules 45 and 65, respectively, of the Revised Rules of Court. <i>Madrigal Transport Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation</i> summarizes the distinctions between these two remedies, to wit:<br><br><i> As to the Purpose</i>. <i>Certiorari </i>is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction, not errors of judgment. In <i>Pure Foods Corporation v. NLRC</i>, we explained the simple reason for the rule in this light:<br><br>When a court exercises its jurisdiction, an error committed while so engaged does not deprive it of the jurisdiction being exercised when the error is committed. If it did, every error committed by a court would deprive it of its jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment would be a void judgment. This cannot be allowed. The administration of justice would not survive such a rule. Consequently, an error of judgment that the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction is not correct[a]ble through the original civil action of <i>certiorari.</i><br><br>The supervisory jurisdiction of a court over the issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> cannot be exercised for the purpose of reviewing the intrinsic correctness of a judgment of the lower court -- on the basis either of the law or the facts of the case, or of the wisdom or legal soundness of the decision. Even if the findings of the court are incorrect, as long as it has jurisdiction over the case, such correction is normally beyond the province of <i>certiorari</i>. Where the error is not one of jurisdiction, but of an error of law or fact î&nbsp;º a mistake of judgment î&nbsp;º appeal is the remedy.<br><br><i>As to the Manner of Filing</i>. Over an appeal, the CA exercises its appellate jurisdiction and power of review. Over a <i>certiorari,</i> the higher court uses its original jurisdiction in accordance with its power of control and supervision over the proceedings of lower courts. An appeal is thus a continuation of the original suit, while a petition for <i>certiorari </i>is an original and independent action that was not part of the trial that had resulted in the rendition of the judgment or order complained of. The parties to an appeal are the original parties to the action. In contrast, the parties to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> are the aggrieved party (who thereby becomes the petitioner) against the lower court or quasi-judicial agency, and the prevailing parties (the public and the private respondents, respectively).<br><br><i>As to the Subject Matter</i>. Only judgments or final orders and those that the Rules of Court so declared are appealable. Since the issue is jurisdiction, an original action for <i>certiorari </i>may be directed against an interlocutory order of the lower court prior to an appeal from the judgment; or where there is no appeal or any plain, speedy or adequate remedy.<br><br><i>As to the Period of Filing</i>. Ordinary appeals should be filed within fifteen days from the notice of judgment or final order appealed from. Where a record on appeal is required, the appellant must file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within thirty days from the said notice of judgment or final order. A petition for review should be filed and served within fifteen days from the notice of denial of the decision, or of the petitioner's timely filed motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration. In an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, the petition should be filed also within fifteen days from the notice of judgment or final order, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On the other hand, a petition for <i>certiorari </i>should be filed not later than sixty days from the notice of judgment, order, or resolution. If a motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration was timely filed, the period shall be counted from the denial of the motion.<br><br><i>As to the Need for a Motion for Reconsideration</i>. A motion for reconsideration is generally required prior to the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari,</i> in order to afford the tribunal an opportunity to correct the alleged errors. Note also that this motion is a plain and adequate remedy expressly available under the law. Such motion is not required before appealing a judgment or final order.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is true that in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of substantial justice, this Court has, before, treated a petition for <i>certiorari</i> as a petition for review on <i>certiorari,</i> particularly <b>(1) if the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was filed within the reglementary period within which to file a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; (2) when errors of judgment are averred; and (3) when there is sufficient reason to justify the relaxation of the rules.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>This Court was also liberal in its treatment of a wrong mode of appeal in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. CA,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> wherein it was ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x However, there are cases where the cert writ may still issue even if the aggrieved party has a remedy of appeal in the ordinary course of law. Thus, <b>where the exigencies of the case are such that the ordinary methods of appeal may not prove adequate either in point of promptness or completeness so that a partial or total failure of justice may result, a cert writ may issue.</b></blockquote><br>The same was also applied in <i>Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. LEYECO IV Employees Union-ALU</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> thus:<br><br><blockquote>In addition, while the settled rule is that an independent action for <i>certiorari</i> may be availed of only when there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and certiorari is not a substitute for the lapsed remedy of appeal, there are a few significant exceptions when the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari </i>may be resorted to despite the availability of an appeal, namely: <b>(a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictate; (b) when the broader interests of justice so require; (c) when the writs issued are null; and (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>With the above-cited rulings of this Court in mind, the Amended Decision, as well as the records and the antecedent circumstances of the present case are devoid of any justification that would merit the deviation from the strict rule of procedure.&nbsp; The fact still remains that CEPRI had chosen to file an inappropriate mode of appeal and regardless of the reason behind it, whether it was to substitute a lost appeal or merely through plain negligence, such can no longer be corrected.&nbsp; It is elementary that the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> is not and cannot be a substitute for an appeal, where the latter remedy is available, as it was in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> A special civil action under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court will not be a cure for failure to timely file an appeal under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Rule 65 is an independent action that cannot be availed of as a substitute for the lost remedy of an ordinary appeal, especially if such loss or lapse was occasioned by one's own neglect or error in the choice of remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding the error committed by the CA in disregarding the proper mode of appeal or even under the presumption that it committed no mistake in treating the petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 as a petition for review, the CA was still amiss in disregarding the factual findings of the RTC.<br><br>The RTC found CEPRI to be in the state of insolvency which precludes it from being entitled to rehabilitation.&nbsp; The findings of fact of the RTC must be given respect as it is clear and categorical in ruling that CEPRI is not merely in the state of illiquidity, but in an apparent state of insolvency.&nbsp; There is nothing more detailed than the contents of the said Order, which reads, in part:<br><br><blockquote>After the aforesaid initial hearing, this Court made a careful and judicious scrutiny and evaluation as to whether the petition for rehabilitation filed by the petitioner is impressed with merit or not.&nbsp; Up to this time, this Court is not satisfied that there is merit in the said petition.<br><br>Foremost of all, it appears that the petitioner does not really have enough assets, net worth and earning to meet and settle its outstanding liabilities.&nbsp; As stated by it in paragraph 7.8 of the petition, it has outstanding liabilities in the aggregate sum of P69,539,903.57 to the Bank of Philippine Islands and China Banking Corporation.&nbsp; These major liabilities are broken down as follows:&nbsp; P20,230,000.00 to BPI and P49,309,903.57 to China Banking Corporation as of December 31, 2001. There is a strong probability that these may still increase substantially after December 31, 2001. However, the petitioner has relatively less assets to answer for these liabilities.&nbsp; As historically shown by its audited financial statements, the petitioner's assets from 1990 to 2000 were only worth as follows: P352,222.40 in 1990 (Exhibit K), P452,723.33 in 1991 (Exhibit K), P569,948.19 in 1992 (Exhibit L), P787,300.65 in 1993 (Exhibit M), P761,310.69 in 1994 (Exhibit N), P3,042,411.81 in 1995 (Exhibit O), P5,608,866.70 in 1996 (Exhibit P), P8,100,022.81 in 1997 (Exhibit Q), P10,007,490.26 in 1998 (Exhibit R), P10,905,649.83 in 1999 (Exhibit S) and P11,615,251.75 in 2000 (Exhibit T).&nbsp; Of course, there is a sudden and tremendous supposed increase or leap of the worth of petitioner's assets as of December 31, 2001, as shown by Annex A of the petition, from P11,615,251.75 as of December 31, 2000 to P65,766,094.28 as of December 31, 2001.&nbsp; But this is actually of no moment.&nbsp; The fact is that the petitioner booked as its assets certain properties not actually belonging to it, like the parcels of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 34039, 34040, 34041 and 30696 in the name of Rolando S. Go.&nbsp; The petitioner, through its counsel, admitted this fact during the hearing on its petition. And so, the balance sheet of the petitioner as of December 31, 2001 is not really a faithful one.&nbsp; The revaluation&nbsp; increments stated or indicated therein are questionable.&nbsp; For all intents and purposes, it can thus be said that the petitioner was not actually better off&nbsp; in terms of its assets and equity in 2001 than in 2000.&nbsp; <b>In view thereof, this Court concurs with the oppositor, China Banking Corporation, that the petitioner is actually now in a state of insolvency, not illiquidity.&nbsp; </b>In other words, it cannot be the proper subject of rehabilitation.<br><br><b>&nbsp; </b>Secondly, this Court is not really prepared to give full faith to the financial projections of the petitioner (Annex H-1 of the petition).&nbsp; The assumption that petitioner's gross sales will increase by 25% to 30% within the next five years is without adequate basis.&nbsp; It is too speculative and unrealistic.&nbsp; It is not borne by petitioner's historical operations. Neither is it borne by an objective industry forecast.&nbsp; It is even belied by the Packaging Industry Profile prepared by the DTI Cebu Provincial Office which the petitioner submitted to this Court (Exhibit U).&nbsp; In said Packaging Industry Profile, it is categorically and explicitly stated that "packaging demand is projected by the Strategic Industry Research and Analysis (SIRA) to increase only by around 4.7% compound per annum over the period 1997-2003."&nbsp; And so, there is actually no faithful and adequate showing by the petitioner that it has ample capacity to pay its outstanding and overdue loans to its major creditors such as the BPI and China Banking Corporation, even if it be given a breathing spell.<br><br>In the third place, the petitioner has not&nbsp; met all the conditions&nbsp; which are required or necessary to place it under rehabilitation. It has not been shown categorically and specifically by the petitioner that its stockholders had irrevocably approved and/or consented to all actions or matters necessary and desirable to rehabilitate it, such as amending its articles of incorporation and by-laws, increasing or decreasing its authorized capital stock, its issuing bonded indebtedness, alienating or encumbering its assets and modifying the rights of its shareholders.&nbsp; Such is not specifically shown in Annex L of the petition and Exhibits J and J-1 for the petitioner.&nbsp; In the absence of it, this Court cannot be in a position to approve the petitioner's proposed rehabilitation plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>Based on the above Order of the RTC, this Court finds no reason to disturb the RTC's findings of fact, and neither should the CA. It must be remembered that the trial court has the authority to dismiss a petition for rehabilitation after hearing, or even after due consideration of the pleadings filed before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; This is in accord with the trial court's authority to give due course to the petition or not under Rule 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Section 9 of the Interim Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The trial court, acting in its capacity as a commercial court, has the expertise and knowledge over matters under its jurisdiction and is in a better position to pass judgment thereon.&nbsp; It is no different than that of administrative&nbsp; departments and, as such, its findings of fact are generally accorded respect, if not finality.<br><br>Anent the issue of forum shopping, the resolution of the first two issues renders it inconsequential.<br><br>In summary, had the CA not reversed its original decision, which was more in tune with the law and the prevailing jurisprudence, the simple issues presented before this Court would have been settled expeditiously.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review dated July 18, 2006 of China Banking Corporation is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b>&nbsp; The Amended Decision dated March 3, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
