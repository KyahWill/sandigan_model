(2) the taxpayer is VAT-registered; (3) the claim must be filed within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made; and (4) the creditable input tax due or paid must be attributable to such sales, except the transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against the output tax.<br><br>The Court finds that the first three requirements have been complied [with] by petitioner.<br><br>With regard to the first requisite, the evidence presented by petitioner, such as the Sales Invoices (Exhibits "II" to "II-262," "JJ" to "JJ-431," "KK" to "KK-394" and "LL") shows that it is engaged in sales which are zero-rated.<br><br>The second requisite has likewise been complied with. The Certificate of Registration with OCN 1RC0000148499 (Exhibit "C") with the BIR proves that petitioner is a registered VAT taxpayer.<br><br>In compliance with the third requisite, petitioner filed its administrative claim for refund on September 30, 2004 (Exhibit "N") and the present Petition for Review on September 30, 2004, both within the two (2) year prescriptive period from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, which is from September 30, 2002.<br><br>As regards, the fourth requirement, the Court finds that there are some documents and claims of petitioner that are baseless and have not been satisfactorily substantiated.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In sum, petitioner has sufficiently proved that it is entitled to a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate representing unutilized excess input VAT payments for the period July 1, 2002 to September 30, 2002,&nbsp; which are attributable to its zero-rated sales for the same period,&nbsp; but in the reduced amount of P3,239,119.25, computed as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <table width="80%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Amount of Claimed Input VAT</div></td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">P 3,891,123.82 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Less:</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td></tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><div>Exceptions as found by the ICPA</div> </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 41,020.37</span> </div></td></tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Net Creditable Input VAT</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P 3,850,103.45 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Less: </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td></tr>  <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Excess Creditable Input VAT</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P 3,239,119.25</span> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present Petition for Review is PARTIALLY GRANTED.

In addition, petitioner further contends that respondent's filing of the administrative and judicial [claims] effectively eliminates the authority of the honorable Court to exercise jurisdiction over the judicial claim.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Section 114 of the 1997 NIRC, and We quote, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 114.&nbsp; Return and Payment of Value-added Tax. -<br><br>(A)&nbsp; In General. - Every person liable to pay the value-added tax imposed under this Title shall file a quarterly return of the amount of his gross sales or receipts within twenty-five (25) days following the close of each taxable quarter prescribed for each taxpayer: Provided, however, That VAT-registered persons shall pay the value-added tax on a monthly basis.<br><br>[x x x x ]<br></blockquote>Based on the above-stated provision, a taxpayer has twenty five (25) days from the close of each taxable quarter within which to file a quarterly return of the amount of his gross sales or receipts. In the case at bar, the taxable quarter involved was for the period of July 1, 2002 to September 30, 2002. Applying Section 114 of the 1997 NIRC, respondent has until October 25, 2002 within which to file its quarterly return for its gross sales or receipts [with] which it complied when it filed its VAT Quarterly Return on October 20, 2002.<br><br>In relation to this, the reckoning of the two-year period provided under Section 229 of the 1997 NIRC should start from the payment of tax subject claim for refund. As stated above, respondent filed its VAT Return for the taxable third quarter of 2002 on October 20, 2002. Thus, respondent's administrative and judicial claims for refund filed on September 30, 2004 were filed on time because AICHI has until October 20, 2004 within which to file its claim for refund.<br><br>In addition, We do not agree with the petitioner's contention that the 1997 NIRC requires the previous filing of an administrative claim for refund prior to the judicial claim. This should not be the case as the law does not prohibit the simultaneous filing of the administrative and judicial claims for refund. What is controlling is that both claims for refund must be filed within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>In sum, the Court En Banc finds no cogent justification to disturb the findings and conclusion spelled out in the assailed January 4, 2008 Decision and March 13, 2008 Resolution of the CTA Second Division. What the instant petition seeks is for the Court En Banc to view and appreciate the evidence in their own perspective of things, which unfortunately had already been considered and passed upon.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the instant Petition for Review is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and DISMISSED for lack of merit.

Return and Payment of Value-Added Tax. -<br><br>(A) In General. - Every person liable to pay the value-added tax imposed under this Title shall <b>file a quarterly return of the amount of his gross sales or receipts within twenty-five (25) days following the close of each taxable quarter prescribed for each taxpayer</b>: Provided, however, That VAT-registered persons shall pay the value-added tax on a monthly basis.<br><br>Any person, whose registration has been cancelled in accordance with Section 236, shall file a return and pay the tax due thereon within twenty-five (25) days from the date of cancellation of registration: Provided, That only one consolidated return shall be filed by the taxpayer for his principal place of business or head office and all branches.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 229.

Mirant Pagbilao Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> where we ruled that Section 112(A) of the NIRC is the applicable provision in determining the start of the two-year period for claiming a refund/credit of unutilized input VAT, and that Sections 204(C) and 229 of the NIRC are inapplicable as "both provisions apply only to instances of erroneous payment or illegal collection of internal revenue taxes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> We explained that:<br><br><blockquote>The above proviso [Section 112 (A) of the NIRC] clearly provides in no uncertain terms that <b>unutilized input VAT payments not otherwise used for any internal revenue tax due the taxpayer must be claimed within two years reckoned from the close of the taxable quarter when the relevant sales were made pertaining to the input VAT regardless of whether said tax was paid or not.</b> As the CA aptly puts it, albeit it erroneously applied the aforequoted Sec. 112 (A), "[P]rescriptive period commences from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made and not from the time the input VAT was paid nor from the time the official receipt was issued."&nbsp; Thus, when a zero-rated VAT taxpayer pays its input VAT a year after the pertinent transaction, said taxpayer only has a year to file a claim for refund or tax credit of the unutilized creditable input VAT. The reckoning frame would always be the end of the quarter when the pertinent sales or transaction was made, regardless when the input VAT was paid. Be that as it may, and given that the last creditable input VAT due for the period covering the progress billing of September 6, 1996 is the third quarter of 1996 ending on September 30, 1996, any claim for unutilized creditable input VAT refund or tax credit for said quarter prescribed two years after September 30, 1996 or, to be precise, on September 30, 1998. Consequently, MPC's claim for refund or tax credit filed on December 10, 1999 had already prescribed.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Reckoning for prescriptive period under</i></b><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i> Secs. 204(C) and 229 of the NIRC inapplicable</i></b><br></div><br>To be sure, MPC cannot avail itself of the provisions of either Sec. 204(C) or 229 of the NIRC which, for the purpose of refund, prescribes a different starting point for the two-year prescriptive limit for the filing of a claim therefor. Secs. 204(C) and 229 respectively provide:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 204.&nbsp; <i>Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate and Refund or Credit Taxes</i>. - The Commissioner may -<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c)&nbsp; Credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally received or penalties imposed without authority, refund the value of internal revenue stamps when they are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and, in his discretion, redeem or change unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for use and refund their value upon proof of destruction. No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner a claim for credit or refund within two (2) years after the payment of the tax or penalty: Provided, however, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 229.&nbsp; Recovery of Tax Erroneously or Illegally Collected. - No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, of any sum alleged to have been excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner; but such suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.<br><br>In any case, no such suit or proceeding shall be filed after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty regardless of any supervening cause that may arise after payment: Provided, however, That the Commissioner may, even without a written claim therefor, refund or credit any tax, where on the face of the return upon which payment was made, such payment appears clearly to have been erroneously paid.</blockquote><br>Notably, the above provisions also set a two-year prescriptive period, reckoned from date of payment of the tax or penalty, for the filing of a claim of refund or tax credit. Notably too, <b>both provisions apply only to instances of erroneous payment or illegal collection of internal revenue taxes.</b><br><br><center><b><i>MPC's creditable input VAT not erroneously paid</i></b><br></center><br>For perspective, under Sec. 105 of the NIRC, creditable input VAT is an indirect tax which can be shifted or passed on to the buyer, transferee, or lessee of the goods, properties, or services of the taxpayer. The fact that the subsequent sale or transaction involves a wholly-tax exempt client, resulting in a zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transaction, does not, standing alone, deprive the taxpayer of its right to a refund for any unutilized creditable input VAT, albeit the erroneous, illegal, or wrongful payment angle does not enter the equation.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Considering the foregoing discussion, <b>it is clear that Sec. 112 (A) of the NIRC, providing a two-year prescriptive period reckoned from the close of the taxable quarter when the relevant sales or transactions were made pertaining to the creditable input VAT, applies to the instant case, and not to the other actions which refer to erroneous payment of taxes.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing, we find that the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erroneously applied Sections 114(A) and 229 of the NIRC in computing the two-year prescriptive period for claiming refund/credit of unutilized input VAT.&nbsp; To be clear, Section 112 of the NIRC is the pertinent provision for the refund/credit of input VAT.&nbsp; Thus, the two-year period should be reckoned from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made.<br><br><b><i>The administrative claim was timely filed</i></b><br><br>Bearing this in mind, we shall now proceed to determine whether the administrative claim was timely filed.<br><br>Relying on Article 13 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> which provides that a year is equivalent to 365 days, and taking into account the fact that the year 2004 was a leap year, petitioner submits that the two-year period to file a claim for tax refund/ credit for the period July 1, 2002 to September 30, 2002 expired on September 29, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

Under the Civil Code, a year is equivalent to 365 days whether it be a regular year or a leap year. Under the Administrative Code of 1987, however, a year is composed of 12 calendar months. Needless to state, under the Administrative Code of 1987, the number of days is irrelevant.<br><br>There&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously&nbsp; exists&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; manifest&nbsp; incompatibility&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; manner&nbsp; of computing legal periods under the Civil Code and the Administrative Code of 1987.&nbsp; For this reason, we hold that Section 31, Chapter VIII, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987, being the more recent law, governs the computation of legal periods.<i> Lex posteriori derogat priori.</i><br><br>Applying Section 31, Chapter VIII, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987 to this case, the two-year prescriptive period (reckoned from the time respondent filed its final adjusted return on April 14, 1998) consisted of 24 calendar months, computed as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;

In case of full or partial denial by the CIR, the taxpayer's recourse is to file an appeal before the CTA within 30 days from receipt of the decision of the CIR.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if after the 120-day period the CIR fails to act on the application for tax refund/credit, the remedy of the taxpayer is to appeal the inaction of the CIR to CTA within 30 days.<br><br>In this case, the administrative and the judicial claims were simultaneously&nbsp; filed on September 30, 2004.&nbsp; Obviously, respondent did not wait for the decision of the CIR or the lapse of the 120-day period. For this reason, we find the filing of the judicial claim with the CTA premature.<br><br>Respondent's assertion that the non-observance of the 120-day period is not fatal to the filing of a judicial claim as long as both the administrative and the judicial claims are filed within the two-year prescriptive period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> has no legal basis.<br><br>There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC to support respondent's view.&nbsp; Subsection (A) of the said provision states that "any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, <b>within two years</b> after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, <b>apply</b> <b>for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund</b> of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales."&nbsp; The phrase "within two (2) years x x x apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund" refers to applications for refund/credit filed with the CIR and not to appeals made to the CTA.&nbsp; This is apparent in the first paragraph of subsection (D) of the same provision, which states that the CIR has "120 days from the submission of complete documents in support of the <b>application</b> filed in accordance with <b>Subsections (A)</b> and (B)" within which to decide on the claim.<br><br>In fact, applying the two-year period to judicial claims would render nugatory Section 112(D) of the NIRC, which already provides for a specific period within which a taxpayer should appeal the decision or inaction of the CIR. The second paragraph of Section 112(D) of the NIRC envisions two scenarios: (1) when a decision is issued by the CIR before the lapse of the 120-day period; and (2) when no decision is made after the 120-day period. In both instances, the taxpayer has 30 days within which to file an appeal with the CTA.&nbsp; As we see it then, the 120-day period is crucial in filing an appeal with the CTA.<br><br>With regard to <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
