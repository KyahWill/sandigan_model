				<BR><BR><div align="justify">As a general rule, the issuance of a writ of possession after the foreclosure sale and during the period of redemption is ministerial.  As an exception, it ceases to be ministerial if there is a third party holding the property adversely to the judgment debtor.<br><br>In this case, we find that petitioners' right over the foreclosed property is not adverse to that of the judgment debtor or mortgagor.  As such, they cannot seek the quashal or prevent the implementation of the writ of possession.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>The facts of this case as summarized by the Court of Appeals (CA) in its assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated November 29, 2006 are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sometime in 2001, the spouses Denivin Ilagan and Josefina Ilagan (spouses Ilagan) applied for and were granted a loan by the [Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co.] in the amount of x x x (P4,790,000.00) [secured by] x x x a Real Estate Mortgage over the parcels of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title with Nos. 300203, 285299, 278042, 300181, 300184, 300191, 300194, and 300202, respectively.<br><br>Upon default, an extrajudicial foreclosure was conducted with [Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co.] being the highest bidder x x x and for which a Certificate of Sale was issued in its favor.<br><br>During the period of redemption, the respondent Bank filed an Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession docketed as LRC Case No. 6438 by posting x x x the required bond which was subsequently approved. x x x<br><br>[On June 30, 2005], the St. Mathew Christian Academy of Tarlac, Inc. filed a Petition for Injunction with Prayer for Restraining Order docketed as Special Civil Action No. 9793 against the respondent Bank and the Provincial Sheriff of Tarlac.<br><br>On August 16, 2005, the x x x Judge issued a Joint Decision in LRC Case No. 6438 and Special Civil Action No. 9793, the contents of which are x x x as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>JOINT DECISION<br></center><br>Metropolitan Bank x x x is now entitled to a writ of possession, it being mandatory even during the period of redemption.<br><br>The school, St. Mathew Christian [Academy] filed the petition for injunction on the ground that it cannot be ejected being a third party.<br><br>x x x St. Mathew Christian Academy is practically owned by the mortgagors, spouses Denivin and Josefina Ilagan.  Firstly, the lease to St. Mathew by the Ilagans, as lessor, was for a period of one year from the execution of the lease contract in 1998. Therefore, the lease should have expired in 1999.  However, since the lease continued after 1999, the lease is now with a definite period, or monthly, since the payment of lease rental is monthly. (Articles 1670 and 1687, Civil Code).  Therefore, the lease expires at the end of each month.<br><br>Secondly, the lease was not registered and annotated at the back of the title, and therefore, not binding on third persons.  (Article 1648, Civil Code)<br><br>Thirdly, the spouses are the owners or practically the owners of St. Mathew. Even if it has a separate personality, nevertheless, "piercing the veil of corporate entity" is resorted to for the spouses should not be allowed to commit fraud under the separate entity/personality of St. Mathew.<br><br>In connection with the allegation of the spouses Ilagans that the mortgage contract contains provision which is pactum commisorium, the Court does not agree. What is prohibited is the automatic appropriation without the public sale of the mortgaged properties.<br><br>The interest charges may be exorbitant, but it does not of itself cause the nullity of the entire contract of mortgage.<br><br>There is also no violation on the proscription on forum shopping.  What is important is that, there is really no other case between the parties involving the same subject matter.<br><br>In fine, St. Mathew is not really a third person.  It is bound by the writ of possession issued by this Court.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the writ of possession issued by this Court dated April 22, 2005 is hereby affirmed, Civil Case No. 9793 is dismissed.  No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Pending resolution of the motion for reconsideration of the said Joint Decision, herein petitioners Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) of St. Mathew Christian Academy (SMCA) and Gregorio Inalvez, Jr., Rowena Layug, Malou Malvar, Marilou Baraquio, Gary Sinlao, Luzviminda Ocampo, Marife Fernandez, Fernando Victorio, Ernesto Aganon, and Rizalino Manglicmot who are teachers and students of SMCA, filed a Motion for Leave to file Petition in Intervention<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in Special Civil Action No. 9793, which was granted by the trial court in an Order dated November 10, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  However, in a subsequent Order dated December 7, 2005, the trial court reversed its earlier Order by ruling that petitioners' intervention would have no bearing on the issuance and implementation of the writ of possession.  Thus, it directed that the writ be implemented by placing respondent Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (MBTC) in physical possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Without filing a motion for reconsideration, petitioners assailed the trial court's Order through a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition before the CA.  However, said petition was dismissed by the CA for lack of merit in its assailed Decision dated November 29, 2006. It held thus:<br><br><blockquote>Considering that in this case the writ of possession had already been issued x x x petitioners' remedy was to file x x x a petition that the sale be set aside and the writ of possession cancelled.  Instead, petitioners filed the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br>Moreover, no motion for reconsideration of the said Order directing the issuance of a writ of possession was filed neither was there any motion for reconsideration of the assailed Order of 7 December 2005 prior to the institution of the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> to afford the respondent Court an opportunity to correct its alleged error.  The rule is that <i>certiorari</i> as a special civil action will not lie unless a motion for reconsideration is filed before the respondent tribunal to allow it to correct its imputed error.  While there are exceptions to the rule, none has been invoked by petitioners.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the motion was denied in a Resolution dated January 29, 2007.<br><br>Hence, petitioners filed this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Issues</b><br></div><br><ol><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A CLEAR AND REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT FAILED AND REFUSED TO CONSIDER THE GROUNDS RELIED UPON IN THE PETITION BEFORE IT WHEN THE SAME ARE CLEARLY MERITORIOUS AND ARE BASED ON THE LAW AND JUSTICE;<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A CLEAR AND REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT FAILED AND REFUSED TO CONSIDER THAT THE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO HEREIN PETITIONERS IS THE SPECIAL CIVIL ACTION OF CERTIORARI AND NOT A PETITION TO SET ASIDE THE FORECLOSURE SALE IN LRC CASE No. 6438;<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A CLEAR AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN RULING THAT A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION IS STILL NEEDED BEFORE THE PETITIONERS COULD FILE A SPECIAL CIVIL ACTION OF CERTIORARI; and<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A CLEAR AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN NOT HOLDING THAT CONSIDERATIONS OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY, AND NOT TECHNICALITY, SHOULD BE THE BASES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE PETITION BEFORE IT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Petitioners are not "Third Parties"<br> against whom the writ of possession <br>cannot be issued and implemented.</span><br><br>As a rule, it is ministerial upon the court to issue a writ of possession after the foreclosure sale and during the period of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Section 7 of Act No. 3135 explicitly authorizes the purchaser in a foreclosure sale to apply for a writ of possession during the redemption period by filing an <i>ex parte </i>motion under oath for that purpose "in the registration or cadastral proceedings if the property is registered, or in special proceedings in the case of property registered under the Mortgage Law" with the Regional Trial Court of the province or place where the real property or any part thereof is situated, in the case of mortgages duly registered with the Registry of Deeds.  Upon filing of such motion and the approval of the corresponding bond, the law also directs in express terms the said court to issue the order for a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>However,  this rule is not without  exception. In  <i>Barican  v.  Intermediate </i><br><br><i>Appellate Court</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> we held that the obligation of a court to issue an <i>ex parte</i> writ of possession in favor of the purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale ceases to be ministerial once it appears that there is a third party in possession of the property who is claiming a right adverse to that of the debtor/mortgagor.  This ruling was reiterated in <i>Policarpio v. Active Bank</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> where we held that:<br><br><blockquote>Ordinarily, a purchaser of property in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale is entitled to possession of the property. Thus, whenever the purchaser prays for a writ of possession, the trial court has to issue it as a matter of course. <i>However, the obligation of the trial court to issue a writ of possession ceases to be ministerial once it appears that there is a third party in possession of the property <b>claiming a right adverse to that of the debtor/mortgagor</b>. </i>Where such third party exists, the trial court should conduct a hearing to determine the nature of his adverse possession.  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In this case, we find that petitioners cannot be considered as third parties because they are not claiming a right adverse to the judgment debtor.  Petitioner-teachers and students did not claim ownership of the properties, but merely averred actual "physical possession of the subject school premises".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Petitioner-teachers' possession of the said premises was based on the employment contracts they have with the school.  As regards the petitioner-students, <i>Alcuaz v. Philippine School of Business Administration</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><i> </i>and <i>Non v. Dames II</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> characterized the school-student relationship as contractual in nature.  As such, it would be specious to conclude that the teachers and students hold the subject premises <i>independent</i> of or adverse to SMCA. In fact, their interest over the school premises is necessarily inferior to that of the school.  Besides, their contracts are with the school and do not attach to the school premises.  Moreover, the foreclosure of the current school premises does not prevent the SMCA from continuing its operations elsewhere.<br><br>At this point, it is relevant to note that in the Joint Decision dated August 16, 2005, the trial court found that SMCA was not a third party and was therefore bound by the said writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Consequently, it affirmed the issuance of the writ of possession.<br><br>MBTC thus correctly argued that petitioners did not have superior rights to that of SMCA over the subject property because their supposed possession of the same emanated only from the latter.  Since petitioners' possession of the subject school premises stemmed from their employment or enrollment contracts with the school, as the case may be, necessarily, their right to possess the subject school premises cannot be adverse to that of the school and of its owners.  As such, the petitioners cannot be deemed "third parties" as contemplated in Act No. 3135, as amended.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The lack of authority to sign the <br>certificate of non-forum shopping <br>attached to the Petition for Issuance<br> of Writ of Possession was an insignificant <br>lapse.</span><br><br>Petitioners further claim that the lack of authority to sign the certificate on non-forum shopping attached to the Petition for the Issuance of the Writ of Possession rendered the same worthless and should be deemed as non-existent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  MBTC asserts otherwise, citing <i>Spouses Arquiza v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><i> </i>where we held that an application for a writ of possession is a mere incident in the registration proceeding which is in substance merely a motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and therefore does not require such a certification.<br><br>Petitioners' contention lacks basis.  In <i>Green Asia Construction and Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> where the issue of validity of the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping was questioned in an application for the issuance of a Writ of Possession, we held that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x it bears stressing that <b>a certification on non-forum shopping is required only in a complaint or a petition which is an initiatory pleading.</b> In this case, the subject petition for the issuance of a writ of possession filed by private respondent is not an initiatory pleading. <b>Although private respondent denominated its pleading as a petition, it is more properly a motion.</b> What distinguishes a motion from a petition or other pleading is not its form or the title given by the party executing it, but its purpose. The purpose of a motion is not to initiate litigation, but to bring up a matter arising in the progress of the case where the motion is filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>It is not necessary to initiate an original action in order for the purchaser at an extrajudicial foreclosure of real property to acquire possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Even if the application for the writ of possession was denominated as a "petition", it was in substance merely a motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Indeed, any insignificant lapse in the certification on non-forum shopping filed by the MBTC did not render the writ irregular.  After all, no verification and certification on non-forum shopping need be attached to the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Hence, it is immaterial that the certification on non-forum shopping in the MBTC's petition was signed by its branch head. Such inconsequential oversight did not render the said petition defective in form.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The trial court's Order did not violate <br>the petitioner-students' right to quality<br> education and academic freedom.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>We disagree with petitioners' assertion that the students' right to quality education and academic freedom was violated.  The constitutional mandate to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> is directed to the State and not to the school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  On this basis, the petitioner-students cannot prevent the MBTC from acquiring possession of the school premises by virtue of a validly issued writ of possession.<br><br>There is likewise no violation of the so-called academic freedom. Article XIV, Section 5(2) of the Constitution mandates "that academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning."  Academic freedom did not go beyond the concept of freedom of intellectual inquiry,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which includes the freedom of professionally qualified persons to inquire, discover, publish and teach the truth as they see it in the field of their competence subject to no control or authority except of rational methods by which truths and conclusions are sought and established in these disciplines.  It also pertains to the right of the school or college to decide for itself, its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them - the grant being given to institutions of higher learning - free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In <i>Garcia v. The Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> we held that:<br><br><blockquote>[I]t is to be noted that the reference is to the 'institutions of higher learning' as the recipients of this boon. It would follow then that the school or college itself is possessed of such a right. It decides for itself its aims and objectives and how best to attain them. It is free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. It has a wide sphere of autonomy certainly extending to the choice of students. This constitutional provision is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a grudging fashion. That would be to frustrate its purpose, nullify its intent. x x x  It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail the 'four essential freedoms' of a university - to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.</blockquote><br>In this case, except for their bare allegation that "if the school will be ejected because of the writ of possession, the students will necessarily be ejected also"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and "thereby their learning process and other educational activities shall have been disrupted",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> petitioners miserably failed to show the relevance of the right to quality education and academic freedom to their case or how they were violated by the Order granting the writ of possession to the winning bidder in the extrajudicial foreclosure sale.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The petitioners were accorded due process.</span><br><br>The petitioners argue that the court below did not conduct trial for the presentation of evidence to support its conclusion that the intervention would have no bearing on the issuance and implementation of the writ of possession,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> thereby depriving them of due process.<br><br>Petitioners' contention is without merit.  It is settled that the issuance of a writ of possession is a ministerial duty of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  The purchaser of the foreclosed property, upon<i> ex parte </i>application and the posting of the required bond, has the right to acquire possession of the foreclosed property during the 12-month redemption period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>This <i>ex parte </i>petition for the issuance of a writ of possession under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 is not, strictly speaking, a "judicial process" as contemplated in Article 433<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> As a judicial proceeding for the enforcement of one's right of possession as purchaser in a foreclosure sale, it is not an ordinary suit by which one party "sues another for the enforcement of a wrong or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In <i>Idolor v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> we described the nature of the <i>ex parte</i> petition for issuance of possessory writ under Act No. 3135 to be a non-litigious proceeding and summary in nature.  As an <i>ex parte</i> proceeding, it is brought for the benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or consent by any person adversely interested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It is a proceeding where the relief is granted without requiring an opportunity for the person against whom the relief is sought to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  It does not matter even if the herein petitioners were not specifically named in the writ of possession nor notified of such proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  In <i>Sagarbarria v. Philippine Business Bank,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we rejected therein petitioner's contention that he was denied due process when the trial court issued the writ of possession without notice.<br><br>Here in the present case, we similarly reject petitioners' contention that the trial court should have conducted a trial prior to issuing the Order denying their motion to intervene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  As it is, the law does not require that a petition for a writ of possession may be granted only after documentary and testimonial evidence shall have been offered to and admitted by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As long as a verified petition states the facts sufficient to entitle the petitioner to the relief requested, the court shall issue the writ prayed for.  There is no need for petitioners to offer any documentary or testimonial evidence for the court to grant the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The proper remedy for the petitioners is<br> a separate, distinct and independent suit,<br> provided for under Act No. 3135.</span><br><br>Petitioners assert that Section 8 of Act No. 3135 specifically refers to "the debtor" as the party who is required to file a petition for the cancellation of the writ of possession in the same proceeding in which possession was requested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  As they are not the debtors referred to in the said law, petitioners argue that the filing of a petition for the cancellation of the writ of possession in the same proceeding in which possession was requested, does not apply to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  Hence, they allege that it was improper for the CA to conclude that the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> was the wrong remedy in the case where the writ of possession was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, avers that <i>certiorari</i> is available only when there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  In the instant case, the respondent argues that the court merely granted the Writ of Possession in accordance with settled jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and that the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> does not lie because there is an available remedy which is an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>We hold that the CA correctly held that the proper remedy is a separate, distinct and independent suit provided for in Section 8 of Act No. 3135<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>SEC. 8.

They have to show the urgent and compelling reasons for such recourse.  The afore-cited allegations of the petitioners in their petition before the CA did not dispense with the burden of establishing that their case falls under any of the exceptions to the general rule.  Unlike the case of <i>Ronquillo v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> cited by the petitioners, where not only was a writ of execution issued but petitioner's properties were already scheduled to be sold at public auction on April 2, 1980 at 10:00 a.m., the herein petitioners failed to show the specificity and imminence of the urgency confronting their immediate recourse to the appellate court.<br><br>We therefore hold that the CA correctly found the necessity for a prior resort to a motion for reconsideration prior to the institution of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Considerations of equity do <br>not apply in the instant case.</span><br><br>The petitioners claim that the challenged decision of the CA would show that the petition was decided on the basis of pure technicality and that the appellate court did not pass upon the merits of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  They further assert that considerations of justice and equity and not technicality, should be the bases for the resolution of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> MBTC, on the other hand, argues that equity may not apply if there is applicable law and jurisprudence.<br><br>In <i>San Luis v.
