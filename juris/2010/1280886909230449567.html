Given that there was a pending motion to drop Sison also as party-defendant, the Republic asked the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> to resolve the said motion so that they could proceed with the <i>ex parte</i> presentation of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The said motion was submitted for resolution on September 20, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On February 17, 2003, with the motion to drop Sison as party-defendant still pending, the Republic asked the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> to hold in abeyance the pre-trial until the said motion had been resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; On February 27, 2003, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> clerk of court sent notice of the cancellation of the pre-trial set for March 4, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The records of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> became silent from the year 2003 to 2006, revealing an inaction that would only be broken by a foreign court that imposed a deadline on the freeze orders of the Disini Swiss accounts.&nbsp; This development began when petitioner Disini's wife and children filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> in a Swiss Federal Court to remove a previously issued freeze order on their Swiss accounts.&nbsp; On August 18, 2006, the Swiss Federal Court rendered a partial decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> ordering the counsel for the Republic of the Philippines to submit a forfeiture order from a Philippine court with regard to the assets of Liliana and Herminio Disini not later than December 30, 2006; otherwise, the Swiss Federal Court would revoke the freeze order on the Disini Swiss accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>This deadline apparently spurred the Republic (through the PCGG) to file an Urgent Manifestation and Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> with the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> on November 30, 2006.&nbsp; The Republic prayed for the resolution of its Urgent Motion to Resolve (its motion to drop Rafael Sison as party-defendant).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Should the resolution of this pending motion be favorable to the Republic, it likewise prayed for the setting of the <i>ex parte</i> presentation of evidence at an early date.<br><br>On December 7, 2006, petitioner Disini filed a Motion to Lift Order of Default and for Leave to File and Admit Attached Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> together with an Answer to Amended Complaint with Compulsory Counterclaims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> He maintained that he was unaware of the civil case pending against him because he never received summons or other processes from the court, nor any pleadings from the parties of the case.&nbsp; His only fault, he averred, was that he was ignorant of the proceedings in the case because of the absence of a proper notice. Petitioner asked the respondent court to look at his meritorious defenses.&nbsp; He then invoked the liberality of the courts in lifting default orders to give both parties every opportunity to defend their cases, and pointed out that the proceedings, being in their pre-trial stage, would not be delayed by petitioner's participation therein.<br><br>Petitioner's Answer contained affirmative defenses such as the respondent court's failure to acquire jurisdiction over his person through service by publication and the failure of the Amended Complaint to state a cause of action against him.<br><br>With the two motions pending before it, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> heard the Republic on its Urgent Manifestation and Motion on December 8, 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner Disini's lawyers were present during the hearing but were not allowed to participate therein because of the prevailing default order against Disini.&nbsp; The <i>Sandiganbayan</i> issued the following Order at the end of the said hearing:<br><br><blockquote>This morning, the Court heard the arguments of the counsel for [respondent] regarding the latter's "Urgent Manifestation and Motion" dated November 29, 2006.&nbsp; The Court also gave the [respondent] a non-extendible period of three days counted from today within which to file its comment on the Motion to Lift Order of Default filed by [petitioner] Disini, and the latter is given a non-extendible period of three days from December 11, 2006 or until December 14, 2006, within which to file his reply to the comment of the [respondent], after which the incident shall be considered submitted for resolution without need of oral arguments.

Aquino.<br><br>As for petitioner's allegation that the Republic was aware of Disini's address as shown by the fact that summons were properly served at his correct address<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> in two criminal cases pending before the same First Division of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, the Republic pointed out that these criminal cases were filed on June 30, 2004, while respondent's <i>Ex Parte</i> Motion for Leave to Serve Summons by Publication was filed on April 8, 1998.&nbsp; Hence, at the time the Republic asked for service by publication, it was not yet aware of petitioner's correct address.&nbsp; Since petitioner failed to file his answer to a validly served Amended Complaint, the motion to lift the order of default is utterly lacking merit.<br><br>Petitioner Disini filed his Reply on December 14, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> basically expounding on the arguments he stated in his Motion to Lift.<br><br>On December 15, 2006, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> granted PCGG's motion to drop Sison as party-defendant in Civil Case No. 0013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> leaving only the defaulted defendants (<i>i.e</i>., the Marcos spouses and petitioner Disini) as parties to the case.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Sandiganbayan (Assailed Resolution)</i></b><br><br>On December 18, 2006, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> resolved to deny<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> petitioner's Motion to Lift Default Order.<br><br>The <i>Sandiganbayan</i> held that the Republic exerted diligence in ascertaining petitioner's whereabouts as evidenced by the two motions it filed for the issuance of alias summons.&nbsp; The <i>Sandiganbayan</i> looked favorably at the Republic's efforts to personally serve the summons on petitioner despite the pendency of its <i>Ex Parte</i> Motion for Leave to Serve Summons by Publication. It held that the Republic's determination to serve summons at the places where the petitioner was last heard of to reside belies the petitioner's claim that the Republic had intended to mislead the court into service by publication all along.&nbsp; The <i>Sandiganbayan</i> likewise held that the rules for a valid service of summons by publication were observed.<br><br>The <i>Sandiganbayan</i> did not find any indication that the Republic knew petitioner's actual residence when it sought leave to serve summons by publication in 1998 and 2001.<br><br>As for the argument that publication is not proper because the action is <i>in personam, </i>the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> ruled that Civil Case No. 0013 is an action <i>in rem </i>for which service by publication is proper.&nbsp; The case is <i>in rem </i>because it involves the forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth based on EO No. 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> EO No. 14<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and No. 14-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> promulgated by former President Corazon Aquino by virtue of her legislative authority.&nbsp; It cited the case of <i>Republic v.
