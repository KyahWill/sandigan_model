KUNNAN alleged that it was incorporated in 1972, under the name KENNEX Sports Corporation for the purpose of manufacturing and selling sportswear and sports equipment; it commercially marketed its products in different countries, including the Philippines since 1972.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  It created and first used "PRO KENNEX," derived from its original corporate name, as a distinctive trademark for its products in 1976.

Subsequently, KUNNAN also caused the publication of a Notice and Warning in the Manila Bulletin's January 29, 1993 issue, stating that (1) it is the owner of the disputed trademarks; (2) it terminated its Distributorship Agreement with SUPERIOR; and (3) it appointed SPORTS CONCEPT as its exclusive distributor.  This notice prompted SUPERIOR to file its Complaint for Infringement of Trademark and Unfair Competition with Preliminary Injunction against KUNNAN.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><u><b>The RTC Ruling</b></u><br><br>On March 31, 1998, the RTC issued its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> holding KUNNAN liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition. The RTC also issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining KUNNAN and SPORTS CONCEPT from using the disputed trademarks.<br><br>The RTC found that SUPERIOR sufficiently proved that it was the first user and owner of the disputed trademarks in the Philippines, based on the findings of the Director of Patents in Inter Partes Case No. 1709 and 1734 that SUPERIOR was "rightfully entitled to register the mark `KENNEX' as user and owner thereof."  It also considered the "Whereas clause" of the Distributorship Agreement, which categorically stated that "KUNNAN intends to acquire ownership of [the] KENNEX trademark registered by SUPERIOR in the Philippines."  According to the RTC, this clause amounts to KUNNAN's express recognition of SUPERIOR's ownership of the KENNEX trademarks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>KUNNAN and SPORTS CONCEPT appealed the RTC's decision to the CA where the appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 60777. KUNNAN maintained that SUPERIOR was merely its distributor and could not be the owner of the disputed trademarks. SUPERIOR, for its part, claimed ownership based on its prior use and numerous valid registrations.<br><br><u><b>Intervening Developments:</b><br><b>The IPO and CA Rulings</b></u><br><br>In the course of its appeal to the CA, KUNNAN filed on  December 19, 2003 a Manifestation and Motion praying <b>that the decision of the Bureau of Legal Affairs (<i>BLA</i>) of the Intellectual Property Office (<i>IPO</i>), dated October 30, 2003, in the Consolidated Petitions for Cancellation  be made of record and be considered by the CA in resolving the case</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  The BLA ruled in this decision -<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, Petitioner-Opposer (Kunnan) has overwhelmingly and convincingly established its rights to the mark "PRO KENNEX".  It was proven that actual use by Respondent-Registrant is not in the concept of an owner but as a mere distributor (Exhibits "I", "S" to "S-1", "P" and "P-1" and "Q" and "Q-2") and as enunciated in the case of Crisanta Y. Gabriel vs. Dr. Jose R. Perez, 50 SCRA 406, "a mere distributor of a product bearing a trademark, even if permitted to use said trademark has no right to and cannot register the said trademark."<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>there being sufficient evidence to prove that the Petitioner-Opposer (KUNNAN) is the prior user and owner of the trademark <b>"PRO-KENNEX"</b>, the consolidated Petitions for Cancellation and the Notices of Opposition are hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.  Consequently, the trademark <b>"PRO-KENNEX" </b>bearing Registration Nos. 41032, 40326, 39254, 4730, 49998 for the mark PRO-KENNEX issued in favor of Superior Commercial Enterprises, Inc., herein Respondent-Registrant under the Principal Register and SR No. 6663 are hereby <b>CANCELLED.  </b>Accordingly, trademark application Nos. 84565 and 84566, likewise for the registration of the mark PRO-KENNEX are hereby <b>REJECTED</b>.<br><br>Let the file wrappers of PRO-KENNEX subject matter of these cases be forwarded to the Administrative Finance and Human Resources Development Services Bureau (AFHRDSB) for appropriate action in accordance with this Decision and a copy thereof be furnished the Bureau of Trademarks (BOT) for information and update of its record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>On February 4, 2005, KUNNAN again filed another Manifestation requesting that the <b>IPO Director General's decision on appeal dated December 8, 2004, denying SUPERIOR's appeal</b>, be given weight in the disposition of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, there is no cogent reason to disturb Decision No. 2003-35 dated 30 October 2003 rendered by the Director of the Bureau of Legal Affairs.

SP No. 87928 (<i>Registration Cancellation Case</i>).  On August 30, 2007, the CA rendered its decision dismissing SUPERIOR's petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  On December 3, 2007, <b>the CA decision was declared final and executory</b> and entry of judgment was accordingly made.  Hence, <b>SUPERIOR</b><b>'s registration of the disputed trademarks now stands effectively cancelled</b>.<br><br><u><b>The CA Ruling</b> </u><br><br>On June 22, 2005, the CA issued its decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 60777, reversing and setting aside the RTC's decision of March 31, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  It dismissed SUPERIOR's Complaint for Infringement of Trademark and Unfair Competition with Preliminary Injunction on the ground that <i>SUPERIOR</i><i> failed to establish by preponderance of evidence its claim of ownership over the KENNEX and PRO KENNEX trademarks</i>.  The CA found the Certificates of Principal and Supplemental Registrations and the "whereas clause" of the Distributorship Agreement insufficient to support SUPERIOR's claim of ownership over the disputed trademarks.<br><br>The CA stressed that SUPERIOR's possession of the aforementioned Certificates of Principal Registration does not conclusively establish its ownership of the disputed trademarks as dominion  over trademarks is not acquired by the fact of registration alone;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> at best, registration merely raises a presumption of ownership that can be rebutted by contrary evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The CA further emphasized that the Certificates of Supplemental Registration issued in SUPERIOR's name do not even enjoy the presumption of ownership accorded to registration in the principal register; it does not amount to a <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the validity of registration or of the registrant's exclusive right to use the trademarks in connection with the goods, business, or services specified in the certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In contrast with the failure of SUPERIOR's evidence, the CA found that KUNNAN presented sufficient evidence to rebut SUPERIOR's presumption of ownership over the trademarks.  KUNNAN established that SUPERIOR, far from being the rightful owner of the disputed trademarks, was merely KUNNAN's exclusive distributor.  This conclusion was based on three pieces of evidence that, to the CA, clearly established that SUPERIOR had no proprietary interest over the disputed trademarks.<br><br><i>First</i>, the CA found that the Distributorship Agreement, considered in its entirety, positively confirmed that SUPERIOR sought to be the KUNNAN's exclusive distributor.  The CA based this conclusion on the following provisions of the Distributorship Agreement:<br><br><blockquote>(1) that SUPERIOR was "desirous of [being] appointed as the sole distributor by KUNNAN in the territory of the Philippines;"<br><br>(2) that "KUNNAN will appoint the sole distributorship right to Superior in the Philippines;" and<br><br>(3) that "no third parties will be permitted to supply KENNEX PRODUCTS in the Philippines except only to Superior."</blockquote><br>The CA thus emphasized that the RTC erred in unduly relying on the first whereas clause, which states that "KUNNAN intends to acquire ownership of [the] KENNEX trademark registered by SUPERIOR in the Philippines" without considering the entirety of the Distributorship Agreement indicating that SUPERIOR had been merely appointed by KUNNAN as its distributor.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the CA also noted that SUPERIOR made the express undertaking in the Assignment Agreement to "acknowledge that <i>KUNNAN is still the real and truthful owner of the [PRO KENNEX] trademarks</i>," and that it "shall agree that it will <i>not use the right of the abovementioned trademarks to do anything which is unfavourable or harmful to KUNNAN</i>." To the CA, these provisions are clearly inconsistent with SUPERIOR's claim of ownership of the disputed trademarks. The CA also observed that although the Assignment Agreement was a private document, its authenticity and due execution was proven by the similarity of Mr. Tan Bon Diong's signature in the Distributorship Agreement and the Assignment Agreement.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the CA also took note of SUPERIOR's Letter dated November 12, 1986 addressed to Brig. Gen. Jose Almonte, identifying itself as the "<i>sole and exclusive licensee and distributor</i> in the Philippines of all its KENNEX and PRO-KENNEX products." Attached to the letter was an agreement with KUNNAN, identifying the latter as the "<i>foreign manufacturer</i> of all KENNEX products." The CA concluded that in this letter, SUPERIOR acknowledged its status as a distributor in its dealings with KUNNAN, and even in its transactions with third persons.<br><br>Based on these reasons, the CA ruled that SUPERIOR was a mere distributor and had no right to the registration of the disputed trademarks since the right to register a trademark is based on ownership. Citing Section 4 of Republic Act No. 166<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and established jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the CA held that SUPERIOR - as an exclusive distributor - did not acquire any proprietary interest in the principal's (KUNNAN's) trademark.<br><br>The CA denied SUPERIOR's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit in its Resolution dated October 4, 2005.<br><br><u><center><b>THE PETITION</b><br></center></u><br>In the present petition, SUPERIOR raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER SUPERIOR IS NOT THE TRUE AND RIGHTFUL OWNER OF THE TRADEMARKS "KENNEX" AND "PRO-KENNEX" IN THE PHILIPPINES<br><br><center>II.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER SUPERIOR IS A MERE DISTRIBUTOR OF RESPONDENT KUNNAN IN THE PHILIPPINES<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN REVERSING AND SETTING ASIDE THE DECISION OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY IN CIVIL CASE NO. Q-93-14888, LIFTING THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ISSUED AGAINST RESPONDENTS KUNNAN AND SPORTS CONCEPT AND DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT FOR INFRINGEMENT OF TRADEMARK AND UNFAIR COMPETITION WITH PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</blockquote><br><br><u><center><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b><br></center></u><br><b>We do not find the petition meritorious.  </b><br><br><b><i>On the Issue of Trademark Infringement</i></b><br><br>We first consider the effect of the final and executory decision in the Registration Cancellation Case on the present case.  This decision - rendered <b><i>after </i></b>the CA decision for trademark infringement and unfair competition in CA-G.R. CV No. 60777 (root of the present case) - states:<br><br><blockquote>As to whether respondent Kunnan was able to overcome the presumption of ownership in favor of Superior, the former sufficiently established the fraudulent registration of the questioned trademarks by Superior.  The Certificates of Registration No. SR-4730 (Supplemental Register) and 33487 (Principal Register) for the KENNEX trademark were fraudulently obtained by petitioner Superior.  Even before PROKENNEX products were imported by Superior into the Philippines, the same already enjoyed popularity in various countries and had been distributed worldwide, particularly among the sports and tennis enthusiasts since 1976.  Riding on the said popularity, Superior caused the registration thereof in the Philippines under its name when it knew fully well that it did not own nor did it manufacture the PROKENNEX products.  Superior claimed ownership of the subject marks and failed to disclose in its application with the IPO that it was merely a distributor of KENNEX and PROKENNEX products in the Philippines.<br><br>While Superior accepted the obligation to assign Certificates of Registration Nos. SR-4730 and 33487 to Kunnan in exchange for the appointment by the latter as its exclusive distributor, Superior however breached its obligation and failed to assign the same to Kunnan.  In a letter dated 13 February 1987, Superior, through Mr. Tan Bon Diong, misrepresented to Kunnan that the latter cannot own trademarks in the Philippines.  Thus, Kunnan was misled into assigning to Superior its (Kunnan's) own application for the disputed trademarks. In the same assignment document, however. Superior was bound to ensure that the PROKENNEX trademarks under Registration Nos. 40326, 39254, and 49998 shall be returned to Kunnan clean and without any incumbency when requested by the latter.<br><br>In fine, We see no error in the decision of the Director General of the IPO which affirmed the decision of the Director of the Bureau of Legal Affairs canceling the registration of the questioned marks in the name of petitioner Superior and denying its new application for registration, upon a finding that Superior is not the rightful owner of the subject marks.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the petition is DISMISSED.<br></blockquote><br><b>The CA decided that the registration of the "KENNEX" and "PRO KENNEX" trademarks should be cancelled because SUPERIOR was not the owner of, and could not in the first place have validly registered these trademarks</b>.  Thus, as of the finality of the CA decision on December 3, 2007, these trademark registrations were effectively cancelled and SUPERIOR was no longer the registrant of the disputed trademarks.<br><br>Section 22 of Republic Act No. 166, as amended ("RA 166"),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the law applicable to this case, defines trademark infringement as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 22. <i>Infringement, what constitutes</i>. -- <b><i>Any</i></b><b> person who </b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[1]</span><b> <i>shall</i> use, without the consent of the</b> <b>registran</b>t, <i>any</i> reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation <b>of <i>any</i> registered mark</b> or trade-name <i>in connection with</i> the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of <i>any</i> goods, business or services on or <i>in connection with</i> which such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers or others <i>as to</i> the source or origin of such goods or services, or identity of such business; or<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[2]</span> reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate <i>any</i> such mark or trade-name and apply such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements intended to be used <i>upon</i> or <i>in connection with</i> such goods, business or services, <i>shall</i> be <i>liable to</i> a civil action by the registrant for <i>any</i> or <i>all of</i> the remedies <i>herein</i> provided. [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote><br>Essentially, Section 22 of RA 166 states that only a registrant of a mark can file a case for infringement.  Corollary to this, Section 19 of RA 166 provides that any right conferred upon the registrant under the provisions of RA 166<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> terminates when the judgment or order of cancellation has become final, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 19. <i>Cancellation of registration</i><b>.</b> - If the Director finds that a case for cancellation has been made out he shall order the cancellation of the registration. The order shall not become effective until the period for appeal has elapsed, or if appeal is taken, until the judgment on appeal becomes final. <b>When the order or judgment becomes final, any right conferred by such registration upon the registrant or any person in interest of record shall terminate</b>. Notice of cancellation shall be published in the Official Gazette. [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote><br>Thus, we have previously held that the cancellation of registration of a trademark has the effect of depriving the registrant of protection from infringement from the moment judgment or order of cancellation has become final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the present case, by operation of law, specifically Section 19 of RA 166, the trademark infringement aspect of SUPERIOR's case has been rendered moot and academic in view of the finality of the decision in the Registration Cancellation Case.  In short, SUPERIOR is left without any cause of action for trademark infringement since the cancellation of registration of a trademark deprived it of protection from infringement from the moment judgment or order of cancellation became final. To be sure, in a trademark infringement, title to the trademark is indispensable to a valid cause of action and such title is shown by its certificate of registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  With its certificates of registration over the disputed trademarks effectively cancelled with finality, SUPERIOR's case for trademark infringement lost its legal basis and no longer presented a valid cause of action.<br><br>Even assuming that SUPERIOR's case for trademark infringement had not been rendered moot and academic, there can be no infringement committed by KUNNAN who was adjudged with finality to be the rightful owner of the disputed trademarks in the Registration Cancellation Case.  Even prior to the cancellation of the registration of the disputed trademarks, SUPERIOR - as a mere distributor and not the owner - cannot assert any protection from trademark infringement as it had no right in the first place to the registration of the disputed trademarks. In fact, jurisprudence holds that in the absence of any inequitable conduct on the part of the manufacturer, an exclusive distributor who employs the trademark of the manufacturer does not acquire proprietary rights of the manufacturer, and <b>a registration of the trademark by the distributor as such belongs to the manufacturer</b>, provided the fiduciary relationship does not terminate before application for registration is filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Thus, the CA in the Registration Cancellation Case correctly held:<br><br><blockquote>As a mere distributor, petitioner Superior undoubtedly had no right to register the questioned mark in its name.  Well-entrenched in our jurisdiction is the rule that the right to register a trademark should be based on ownership.  When the applicant is not the owner of the trademark being applied for, he has no right to apply for the registration of the same.  Under the Trademark Law, only the owner of the trademark, trade name or service mark used to distinguish his goods, business or service from the goods, business or service of others is entitled to register the same.  An exclusive distributor does not acquire any proprietary interest in the principal's trademark and cannot register it in his own name unless it is has been validly assigned to him.<br></blockquote><br>In addition, we also note that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> bars SUPERIOR's present case for trademark infringement. The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> embraces two (2) concepts: the first is "bar by prior judgment" under paragraph (b) of Rule 39, Section 47, and the second is "conclusiveness of judgment" under paragraph (c) thereof.<br><br>In the present case, the second concept - conclusiveness of judgment - applies.  Under the concept of <i>res judicata</i> by <b>conclusiveness of judgment</b>, a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies<i> <b>in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit.</b></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Stated differently, facts and issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties, even if the latter suit may involve a different cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  This second branch of the principle of <i>res judicata</i> bars the re-litigation of particular facts or issues in another litigation between the same parties on a different claim or cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Because the Registration Cancellation Case and the present case involve the same parties, litigating with respect to and disputing the same trademarks, we are bound to examine how one case would affect the other. In the present case, even if the causes of action of the Registration Cancellation Case (the cancellation of trademark registration) differs from that of the present case (the improper or unauthorized use of trademarks), the final judgment in the Registration Cancellation Case is nevertheless conclusive on the particular facts and issues that are determinative of the present case.<br><br>To establish trademark infringement, the following elements must be proven: (1) the validity of plaintiff's mark; (2) <b>the plaintiff's ownership of the mark</b>; and (3) the use of the mark or its colorable imitation by the alleged infringer results in "likelihood of confusion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Based on these elements, we find it immediately obvious that the second element - the plaintiff's ownership of the mark - was what the Registration Cancellation Case decided with finality.  On this element depended the validity of the registrations that, on their own, only gave rise to the presumption of, but was not conclusive on, the issue of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In no uncertain terms, <b>the appellate court in the Registration Cancellation Case ruled that SUPERIOR was a mere distributor and could not have been the owner, and was thus an invalid registrant of the disputed trademarks.</b>  Significantly, these are the exact terms of the ruling the CA arrived at in the present petition now under our review.  Thus, whether with one or the other, the ruling on the issue of ownership of the trademarks is the same.  Given, however, the final and executory ruling in the Registration Cancellation Case on the issue of ownership that binds us and the parties, any further discussion and review of the issue of ownership - although the current CA ruling is legally correct and can stand on its own merits - becomes a pointless academic discussion.<br><br><b><i>On the Issue of Unfair Competition</i></b><br><br>Our review of the records shows that the neither the RTC nor the CA made any factual findings with respect to the issue of unfair competition.  In its Complaint, SUPERIOR alleged that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><blockquote>17. In January 1993, the plaintiff learned that the defendant Kunnan Enterprises, Ltd., is intending to appoint the defendant Sports Concept and Distributors, Inc. as its alleged distributor for sportswear and sporting goods bearing the trademark "PRO-KENNEX." For this reason, on January 20, 1993, the plaintiff, through counsel, wrote the defendant Sports Concept and Distributor's Inc. advising said defendant that the trademark "PRO-KENNEX" was registered and owned by the plaintiff herein.<br><br>18. The above information was affirmed by an announcement made by the defendants in The Manila Bulletin issue of January 29, 1993, informing the public that defendant Kunnan Enterprises, Ltd. has appointed the defendant Sports Concept and Distributors, Inc. as its alleged distributor of sportswear and sporting goods and equipment bearing the trademarks "KENNEX and "PRO-KENNEX" which trademarks are owned by and registered in the name of plaintiff herein as alleged hereinabove.<br><br><center>x  x  x  x<br></center><br>27.  The acts of defendants, as previously complained herein, were designed to and are of the nature so as to create confusion with the commercial activities of plaintiff in the Philippines and is liable to mislead the public as to the nature and suitability for their purposes of plaintiff's business and the defendant's acts are likely to discredit the commercial activities and future growth of plaintiff's business.<br></blockquote><br>From jurisprudence, unfair competition has been defined as the passing off (or palming off) or attempting to pass off upon the public of the goods or business of one person as the goods or business of another with the end and probable effect of deceiving the public.  The essential elements of unfair competition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> are (1) confusing similarity in the general appearance of the goods; and (2) intent to deceive the public and defraud a competitor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence also formulated the following "true test" of unfair competition:  whether the acts of the defendant have the intent of deceiving or are calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under the ordinary conditions of the particular trade to which the controversy relates. One of the essential requisites in an action to restrain unfair competition is proof of fraud; the intent to deceive, actual or probable must be shown before the right to recover can exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In the present case, no evidence exists showing that KUNNAN ever attempted to pass off the goods it sold (<i>i.e</i>. sportswear, sporting goods and equipment) as those of SUPERIOR.  In addition, there is no evidence of bad faith or fraud imputable to KUNNAN in using the disputed trademarks. Specifically, SUPERIOR failed to adduce any evidence to show that KUNNAN by the above-cited acts intended to deceive the public as to the identity of the goods sold or of the manufacturer of the goods sold.  In <i>McDonald's Corporation v. L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we held that there can be trademark infringement <b>without unfair competition </b>such as when the infringer <b>discloses on the labels containing the mark that he manufactures the goods, thus preventing the public from being deceived that the goods originate from the trademark owner.</b>  In this case, no issue of confusion arises because the same manufactured products are sold; only the ownership of the trademarks is at issue.  Furthermore, KUNNAN's January 29, 1993 notice by its terms prevents the public from being deceived that the goods originated from SUPERIOR since the notice clearly indicated that KUNNAN is the manufacturer of the goods bearing the trademarks "KENNEX" and "PRO KENNEX."  This notice states in full:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><blockquote><center>NOTICE AND WARNING<br></center><br>Kunnan Enterprises Ltd. is the owner and first user of the internationally-renowned trademarks KENNEX and PRO KENNEX for sportswear and sporting goods and equipment.  Kunnan Enterprises Ltd. has registered the trademarks KENNEX and PRO KENNEX in the industrial property offices of at least 31 countries worldwide where KUNNAN Enterprises Ltd. has been selling its sportswear and sporting goods and equipment bearing the KENNEX and PRO KENNEX trademarks.<br><br>Kunnan Enterprises Ltd. further informs the public that it had terminated its Distributorship Agreement with Superior Commercial Enterprises, Inc. on December 31, 1991.  As a result, <b>Superior Commercial Enterprises, Inc. is no longer authorized to sell sportswear and sporting goods and equipment manufactured by Kunnan Enterprises Ltd. and bearing the trademarks KENNEX and PRO KENNEX</b>.<br><br><center>x  x  x  x<br></center><br>In its place, KUNNAN has appointed SPORTS CONCEPT AND DISTRIBUTORS, INC. as its exclusive Philippine distributor of sportswear and sporting goods and equipment bearing the trademarks KENNEX and PRO KENNEX.  <b>The public is advised to buy sporting goods and equipment bearing these trademarks only from SPORTS CONCEPT AND DISTRIBUTORS, INC. to ensure that the products they are buying are manufactured by Kunnan Enterprises Ltd</b>. [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote><br>Finally, with the established ruling that KUNNAN is the rightful owner of the trademarks of the goods that SUPERIOR asserts are being unfairly sold by KUNNAN under trademarks registered in SUPERIOR's name, the latter is left with no effective right to make a claim.  In other words, with the CA's final ruling in the Registration Cancellation Case, SUPERIOR's case no longer presents a valid cause of action.  For this reason, the unfair competition aspect of the SUPERIOR's case likewise falls.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we <b>DENY </b>Superior Commercial Enterprises, Inc.'s petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>for lack of merit.
