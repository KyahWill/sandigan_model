				<H3>ELIGIO P. MALLARI, PETITIONER, VS.  GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM AND THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF PAMPANGA, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BERSAMIN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, the petitioner appeals the decision promulgated on March 17, 2003, whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed his petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>In 1968, the petitioner obtained two loans totaling P34,000.00 from respondent Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). To secure the performance of his obligations, he mortgaged two parcels of land registered under his and his wife Marcelina Mallari's names. However, he paid GSIS about ten years <i>after</i> contracting the obligations only P10,000.00 on May 22, 1978 and P20,000.00 on August 11, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>What followed thereafter was the series of inordinate moves of the petitioner to delay the efforts of GSIS to recover on the debt, and to have the unhampered possession of the foreclosed property.<br><br>After reminding the petitioner of his unpaid obligation on May 2, 1979, GSIS sent on November 2, 1981 a telegraphic demand to him to update his account.  On November 10, 1981, he requested a final accounting, but did not do anything more. Nearly three years later, on March 21, 1984, GSIS applied for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage by reason of his failure to settle his account. On November 22, 1984, he requested an updated computation of his outstanding account. On November 29, 1984, he persuaded the sheriff to hold the publication of the foreclosure notice in abeyance, to await action on his pending request for final accounting (that is, taking his payments of P30,000.00 made in 1978 into account). On December 13, 1984, GSIS responded to his request and rendered a detailed explanation of the account. On May 30, 1985, it sent another updated statement of account. On July 21, 1986, it finally commenced extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings against him because he had meanwhile made no further payments.<br><br>On August 22, 1986, the petitioner sued GSIS and the Provincial Sheriff of Pampanga in the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 44, in San Fernando, Pampanga, docketed as Civil Case No. 7802,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> ostensibly to enjoin them from proceeding against him for injunction (with an application for preliminary injunction). The RTC ultimately decided Civil Case No. 7802 in his favor, nullifying the extrajudicial foreclosure and auction sale; cancelling Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 284272-R and TCT No. 284273-R already issued in the name of GSIS; and reinstating TCT No. 61171-R and TCT No. 54835-R in his and his wife's names.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>GSIS appealed the adverse decision to the CA, which reversed the RTC on March 27, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The petitioner elevated the CA decision to this Court <i>via</i> petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>(G.R.

It is noted that GSIS acceded to the request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Yet, the petitioner did not voluntarily vacate the properties, but instead filed a <i>motion for reconsideration and/or to quash the writ of execution </i>on March 27, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Also, the petitioner commenced a second case against GSIS and the provincial sheriff in the RTC in San Fernando, Pampanga (Civil Case No. 12053), ostensibly for consignation (coupled with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order). However, the RTC dismissed Civil Case No. 12053 on November 10, 2000 on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>, impelling him to appeal the dismissal to the CA (C.A.-G.R. CV No. 70300).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the meanwhile, the petitioner filed a motion dated April 5, 2000 in Civil Case No. 7802 to hold GSIS, <i>et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in contempt of court for painting the fence of the properties during the pendency of his <i>motion for reconsideration and/or to quash the writ of execution</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He filed another motion in the same case, dated April 17, 2000, to hold GSIS and its local manager Arnulfo B.

This Court is not unaware of the legal tactics and maneuvers employed by the petitioner in delaying the disposition of the subject case (Civil Case No. 7802) which has already become final and executory upon the final resolution by the Supreme Court affirming the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals.  We construe the actuation of the petitioner in resorting to all kinds of avenues accorded by the Rules of Court, through the filing of several pleadings and/or motions in litigating this case, as running counter to the intendment of the Rules to be utilized in promoting the objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding.<br><br>The issues raised in the present controversy have already been settled in our existing jurisprudence on the subject. In the case of <i>De Jesus vs. Obnamia, Jr.,</i> the Supreme Court ruled that "<i>generally, no notice or even prior hearing of a motion for execution is required before a writ of execution is issued when a decision has already become final.</i>"<br><br>The recent accretion to the corpus of our jurisprudence has established the principle of law, as enunciated in <i>Buaya vs. Stronghold Insurance Co., Inc.</i> that "<i>once a judgment becomes final and executory, the prevailing party can have it executed as a matter of right, and the issuance of a Writ of Execution becomes a ministerial duty of the court.</i>"<br><br>The rule is also firmly entrenched in the aforecited <i>Buaya case</i> that "the effective and efficient administration of justice requires that once a judgment has become final, the prevailing party should not be deprived of the fruits of the verdict by subsequent suits on the same issues filed by the same parties.  Courts are duty-bound to put an end to controversies.  Any attempt to prolong, resurrect or juggle them should be firmly struck down.  The system of judicial review should not be misused and abused to evade the operation of final and executory judgments."<br><br>As succinctly put in <i>Tag Fibers, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, the Supreme Court is emphatic in saying that <i>"the finality of a decision is a jurisdictional event that cannot be made to depend on the convenience of a party.</i>"<br><br>We find no cogent reason to discompose the findings of the court below.  Thus, we sustain the assailed Orders of the court a quo since no abuse of discretion has been found to have been committed by the latter in their issuance. Moreover, this Court finds this petition to be part of the dilatory tactics of the petitioner to stall the execution of a final and executory decision in Civil Case No. 7802 which has already been resolved with finality by no less than the highest tribunal of the land.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.

Thus, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed only in March 2002 was already improper and tardy for being made beyond the 60-day limitation defined in Section 4, Rule 65, 1997 <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which requires a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to be filed "not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution," or, in case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, "the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of  the said motion."<br><br>It is worth emphasizing that the 60-day limitation is considered inextendible, because the limitation has been prescribed to avoid any unreasonable delay that violates the constitutional rights of parties to a speedy disposition of their cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br><b>Nature of the Writ of Possession</b><br><b>and its Ministerial Issuance</b><br></center><br>The petitioner claims that he had not been notified of the motion seeking the issuance of the<i> writ of execution cum writ of possession;</i> hence, the writ was invalid.<br><br>As earlier shown, the CA disagreed with him.<br><br>We sustain the CA, and confirm that the petitioner, as defaulting mortgagor, was not entitled under Act 3135, as amended, and its pertinent jurisprudence to any prior notice of the application for the issuance of the writ of possession.<br><br>A writ of possession, which commands the sheriff to place a person in possession of real property, may be issued in:  (1) land registration proceedings under Section 17 of Act No. 496; (2) judicial foreclosure, provided the debtor is in possession of the mortgaged property, and no third person, not a party to the foreclosure suit, had intervened; (3) extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage, pending redemption under Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118; and (4) execution sales, pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 33, Rule 39 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Anent the redemption of property sold in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale made pursuant to the special power referred to in Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of Act No. 3135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> as amended, the debtor, his successor-in-interest, or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the property is sold has the right to redeem the property <i>at anytime</i> <i>within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale</i>, such redemption to be governed  by  the  provisions  of  Section 464  to Section 466 of the <i>Code of Civil Procedure</i>, to the extent that said provisions were not inconsistent with the provisions of Act 3135.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In this regard, we clarify that the redemption period envisioned under Act 3135 is reckoned <i>from the date of the registration of the sale</i>, not from and after the date of the sale, as the text of Act 3135 shows. Although the original <i>Rules of Court </i>(effective on July 1, 1940) incorporated Section 464 to Section 466 of the <i>Code of Civil Procedure</i> as its Section 25 (Section 464); Section 26 (Section 465); and Section 27 (Section 466) of  Rule 39, with Section 27 still expressly reckoning the redemption period to be "at any time within twelve months <i>after the sale</i>;" and although the <i>Revised Rules of</i> <i>Court </i>(effective on January 1, 1964) continued to provide in Section 30 of Rule 39 that the redemption be made from the purchaser "at any  time within twelve (12) months <i>after the sale</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the 12-month period of redemption came to be held as beginning "to run not from the date of the sale but from the time of registration of the sale in the Office of the Register of Deeds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This construction was due to the fact that the sheriff's sale of registered (and unregistered) lands did not take effect as a conveyance, or did not bind the land, until the sale was registered in the Register of Deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Desiring to avoid any confusion arising from the conflict between the texts of the <i>Rules of Court</i> (1940 and 1964) and Act No. 3135, on one hand, and the jurisprudence clarifying the reckoning of the redemption period in judicial sales of real property, on the other hand, the Court has incorporated in Section 28 of Rule 39 of the current <i>Rules of Court</i> (effective on July 1, 1997) the foregoing judicial construction of reckoning the redemption period from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 28. <i>Time and manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions; notice to be given and filed</i>. -- The judgment obligor, or redemptioner, may redeem the property from the purchaser, <b>at any time within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale</b>, by paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with one <i>per centum</i> per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may have paid thereon after purchase, and interest on such last named amount at the same rate; and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under which such purchase was made, the amount of such other lien, with interest.<br><br>Property so redeemed may again be redeemed within sixty (60) days after the last redemption upon payment of the sum paid on the last redemption, with two <i>per centum</i> thereon in addition, and the amount of any assessments or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid thereon after redemption by him, with interest on such last-named amount, and in addition, the amount of any liens held by said last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner within sixty (60) days after the last redemption, on paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption, with two <i>per centum</i> thereon in addition, and the amounts of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after the redemption thereon, with interest thereon, and the amount of any liens held by the last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest.<br><br>Written notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made the sale and a duplicate filed with the registry of deeds of the place, and if any assessments or taxes are paid by the redemptioner or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like manner be given to the officer and filed with the registry of deeds; if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments, taxes, or liens. (30a) (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>Accordingly, the mortgagor or his successor-in-interest must redeem the foreclosed property <i>within one year from the registration of the sale with the Register of Deeds</i> in order to avoid the title from consolidating in the purchaser. By failing to redeem thuswise, the mortgagor loses all interest over the foreclosed property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The purchaser, who has a right to possession that extends <i>beyond</i> the expiration of the redemption period, becomes the <i>absolute owner</i> of the property when no redemption is made,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> that it is no longer necessary for the purchaser to file the bond required under Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended, considering that the possession of the land becomes his absolute right as the land's <i>confirmed</i> owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The consolidation of ownership in the purchaser's name and the issuance to him of a new TCT then entitles him to demand possession of the property <i>at any time</i>, and the issuance of a writ of possession to him becomes a matter of right upon the consolidation of title in his name.<br><br>The court can neither halt nor hesitate to issue the writ of possession. It cannot exercise <i>any</i> discretion to determine whether or not to issue the writ, for the issuance of the writ<i> </i>to the purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale becomes a ministerial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Verily, a marked distinction exists between a discretionary act and a ministerial one. A purely ministerial act or duty is one that an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.  If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary, not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when its discharge requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor the exercise of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The proceeding upon an application for a writ of possession is <i>ex parte</i> and summary in nature, brought for the benefit of one party only and without notice being sent by the court to any person adverse in interest. The relief is granted even without giving an opportunity to be heard to the person against whom the relief is sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>Its nature<i> </i>as an <i>ex parte</i> petition under Act No. 3135, as amended, renders the application for the issuance of a <i>writ of possession</i> a non-litigious proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>It is clear from the foregoing that a <i>non-redeeming</i> mortgagor like the petitioner had no more right to challenge the issuance of the <i>writ of execution cum writ of possession</i> upon the <i>ex parte </i>application<i> </i>of GSIS. He could not also impugn anymore the extrajudicial foreclosure, and could not undo the consolidation in GSIS of the ownership of the properties covered by TCT No. 284272-R and TCT No. 284273-R, which consolidation was already irreversible. Hence, his moves against the <i>writ of execution cum writ of possession</i> were tainted by bad faith, for he was only too aware, being his own lawyer, of the dire consequences of his non-redemption within the period provided by law for that purpose.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br><b>Dismissal of Petitioner's Motion for Indirect Contempt</b><br><b>Was Proper and In Accord with the <i>Rules of Court</i></b><br></center><br>The petitioner insists that the RTC gravely erred in dismissing his charges for indirect contempt against GSIS, <i>et al</i>.;<i> </i>and that the CA should have consequently granted his petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>The petitioner's insistence is plainly unwarranted.<br><br>First of all, Section 4, Rule 71, 1997 <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>How proceedings commenced</i>. -- Proceedings for indirect contempt may be initiated <i>motu proprio</i> by the court against which the contempt was committed by an order or any other formal charge requiring the respondent to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt.<br><br><b>In all other cases, charges for indirect contempt shall be commenced by a verified petition with supporting particulars and certified true copies of documents or papers involved therein, and upon full compliance with the requirements for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the court concerned. If the contempt charges arose out of or are related to a principal action pending in the court, the petition for contempt shall allege that fact but said petition shall be docketed, heard and decided separately, unless the court in its discretion orders the consolidation of the contempt charge and the principal action for joint hearing and decision. (n) </b>(Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote><br>Indeed, a person may be charged with indirect contempt only by either of two alternative ways, namely: (1) by a <i>verified petition</i>, if initiated by a party; or (2) by an <i>order</i> or <i>any other formal charge</i> requiring the respondent to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, if made by a court against which the contempt is committed. In short, a charge of indirect contempt must be initiated through a verified petition, unless the charge is directly made by the court against which the contemptuous act is committed.<br><br>Justice Regalado has explained why the requirement of the filing of a <i>verified petition</i> for contempt is mandatory:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><blockquote>1. This new provision clarifies with a regulatory norm the proper procedure for commencing contempt proceedings.  While such proceeding has been classified as a special civil action under the former Rules, the heterogeneous practice, tolerated by the courts, has been for any party to file a mere motion without paying any docket or lawful fees therefor and without complying with the requirements for initiatory pleadings, which is now required in the second paragraph of this amended section. Worse, and as a consequence of unregulated <i>motions</i> for contempt, said incidents sometimes remain pending for resolution although the main case has already been decided. There are other undesirable aspects but, at any rate, the same may now be eliminated by this amendatory procedure.<br><br><b>Henceforth, except for indirect contempt proceedings initiated <i>motu proprio </i>by order of or a formal charge by the offended court, all charges shall be commenced by a verified petition with full compliance with the requirements therefor and shall be disposed of in accordance with the second paragraph of this section</b>. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>Clearly, the petitioner's charging GSIS, <i>et al</i>. with indirect contempt by mere motions was not permitted by the <i>Rules of Court</i>.<br><br>And, secondly, even assuming that charges for contempt could be initiated by motion, the petitioner should have tendered filing fees. The need to tender filing fees derived from the fact that the procedure for indirect contempt under Rule 71, <i>Rules of Court</i> was an independent special civil action. Yet, the petitioner did not tender and pay filing fees, resulting in the trial court not acquiring jurisdiction over the action. Truly, the omission to tender filing fees would have also warranted the dismissal of the charges.<br><br>It seems to be indubitable from the foregoing that the petitioner initiated the charges for indirect contempt without regard to the requisites of the <i>Rules of Court</i> simply to vex the adverse party. He thereby disrespected the orderly administration of justice and committed, yet again, an abuse of procedures.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br><b>Petitioner Was Guilty of</b><br><b>Misconduct As A Lawyer</b><br></center><br>The CA deemed it unavoidable to observe that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> brought by the petitioner to the CA was "part of the dilatory tactics of the petitioner to stall the execution of a final and executory decision in Civil Case No. 7802 which has already been resolved with finality by no less than the highest tribunal of the land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The observation of the CA deserves our concurrence.<br><br>Verily, the petitioner wittingly adopted his aforedescribed worthless and vexatious legal maneuvers for no other purpose except to delay the full enforcement of the writ of possession, despite knowing, being himself a lawyer, that as a non-redeeming mortgagor he could no longer impugn both the extrajudicial foreclosure and the <i>ex parte</i> issuance of the <i>writ of execution cum writ of possession; </i>and that the enforcement of the duly-issued writ of possession could not be delayed. He thus deliberately abused court procedures and processes, in order to enable himself to obstruct and stifle the fair and quick administration of justice in favor of mortgagee and purchaser GSIS.<br><br>His conduct contravened Rule 10.03, Canon 10 of the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility,</i> by which he was enjoined as a lawyer to "observe the rules of procedure and xxx not [to] misuse them to defeat the ends of justice."  By his dilatory moves, he further breached and dishonored his Lawyer's Oath, particularly:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><blockquote>xxx I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid nor consent to the same; I will delay no man for money or malice, and will conduct myself as a lawyer according to the best of my knowledge and discretion with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to my clients xxx</blockquote><br>We stress that the petitioner's being the party litigant himself did not give him the license to resort to dilatory moves. His zeal to defend whatever rights he then believed he had and to promote his perceived remaining interests in the property already lawfully transferred to GSIS should not exceed the bounds of the law, for he remained <i>at all times</i> an officer of the Court burdened to conduct himself "with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to [his] clients."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> His true obligation as a lawyer should not be warped by any misplaced sense of his rights and interests as a litigant, because he was, above all, bound not to unduly delay a case, not to impede the execution of a judgment, and not to misuse Court processes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Consequently, he must be made to account for his <i>mis</i>conduct as a lawyer.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we deny the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> for lack of merit, and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on March 17, 2003, with the costs of suit to be paid by the petitioner.<br><br>The Committee on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines is directed to investigate the petitioner for what appear to be (<i>a</i>) his deliberate disregard of the <i>Rules of Court</i> and jurisprudence pertinent to the issuance and implementation of the writ of possession under Act No. 3135, as amended; and (<i>b</i>) his witting violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the<i> </i><i>Code of Professional Responsibility</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales, Leonardo-De Castro,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 42-43.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 148.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 44.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 169-179.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 45, 180.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 51-54.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 56.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 45-46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 57-62.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The other respondents were designated as Tony Dimatulac, Allan Doe, John Doe, Peter Doe, Richard Doe, Romy Doe, Roland Doe, and Juan Doe.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 64-66.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 75-78.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 107-108.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 120-121.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 139-144.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 47-48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 42-50.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 48-49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 12-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 56.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 120-121.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 139-141.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> A.M.
