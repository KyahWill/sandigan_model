				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>This is an appeal from the October 13, 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00279-MIN entitled <i>People of the Philippines v.

II of R.A. No. 9165)<br><br>Butuan City, Philippines, September 7, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On January 3, 2003, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge.  After the pre-trial conference, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>During the trial, the prosecution presented as their witnesses, SPO2 Antonio Jamila (SPO2 Jamila) and Police Inspector Cramwell Tanquiamco Banogon (P/Insp. Banogon).  On the other hand, the defense presented as its witnesses, Darlene Quigod, the accused-appellant herself, and Manuel Vergara, Jr.<br><br><center><b>Version of the Prosecution</b><br></center><br>The facts, according to the prosecution, are as follows:<br><br>In the morning of September 6, 2002, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Office, Region 13 received confidential information from a police informant that accused-appellant was selling "shabu" at Purok 7, Ong Yiu, Butuan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Acting on the said information, a team, composed of SPO2 Jamila, PO1 Ronnie Morales (PO1 Morales) and the police informant, was formed to conduct a buy-bust operation.  SPO2 Jamila was to act as the poseur-buyer.<br><br>At around 4:30 p.m., the team was dispatched to the designated area, particularly the area near the basketball court of Purok 7, Ong Yiu, Butuan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Thereafter, the police informant contacted accused-appellant upon instruction of SPO2 Jamila, and introduced the latter as a buyer of <i>shabu</i>. After agreeing to the price of <i>shabu</i> at PhP 1,000 per sachet, SPO2 Jamila ordered two (2) sachets.  Accused-appellant left to get the <i>shabu</i> and asked them to wait for her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Shortly thereafter, accused-appellant came back with the two (2) sachets of <i>shabu</i> and demanded immediate payment for them from SPO2 Jamila who, in turn, carefully examined the articles. When he already had the two (2) sachets of <i>shabu</i>, SPO2 Jamila gave the pre-arranged signal to PO1 Morales, who was only about 10 to 15 meters away.  The latter, along with other police officers, rushed towards accused-appellant, identified themselves as PDEA agents, and arrested her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The team, together with accused-appellant, immediately proceeded to their office for booking, documentation and filing of the case against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  The 2 articles seized, respectively marked as RPM1 and RPM2, were under the initial custody of SPO2 Jamila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>At about 6:35 p.m., SPO2 Jamila, together with PO1 Morales and accused-appellant, submitted the seized articles to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory, Camp Rafael Rodriguez, Libertad, Butuan City, for qualitative examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>P/Insp. Banogon, a forensic chemist, conducted a qualitative examination on the specimen weighing 0.1821 gram (RPM1) and 0.2849 gram (RPM2), respectively.  The specimen gave positive result to the tests for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.  This was indicated in Chemistry Report No. D-126-2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> issued by P/Insp. Banogon after conducting the afore-mentioned qualitative examination. The urine sample taken from accused-appellant also gave a "positive" result for the presence of the same drug,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> as indicated in Chemistry Report No. and DT-070-2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></center><br>On the other hand, accused-appellant interposed the defense of denial.<br><br>She testified that she was a fish vendor who looked after her family's <i>carenderia</i> before she got arrested. She resided at Mangachupoy St., Bayugan, Agusan del Sur, but later moved to Doongan, Butuan City, particularly in the house of a certain Toto Maravilla, a policeman. Accused-appellant identified herself as a police asset whose task is to conduct surveillance on persons suspected of selling illegal drugs in Ong Yiu, Butuan.  According to her, she has worked with Toto Maravilla as a police asset since 2001. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant recounted that on September 6, 2002, she was instructed to conduct surveillance on a certain Jamil Osman Manua, who was suspected of engaging in illegal drug trade activities, at Purok 7, Ong Yiu. In the course of the surveillance, SPO2 Jamila arrested accused-appellant and brought her to the PDEA Office for investigation. When accused-appellant identified herself as a police asset, SPO2 Jamila did not believe her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  Accused-appellant vehemently denied that she was selling <i>shabu</i> and was caught in a buy-bust operation.  Also, she claimed that no marked money was given to her during the alleged buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Manuel Vergara, Jr., the second witness for the defense, testified that accused-appellant was indeed a police asset of a certain Toto Maravilla.  He stated that he knew this because he allegedly was also a police asset and they had worked together in 2000 during buy-bust operations conducted in Bayugan and in RTR, Agusan del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  However, he did not know of the incident that transpired on September 6, 2002, which led to accused-appellant's arrest.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC of Butuan City convicted accused-appellant.  The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Darlene Quigod y Miranda guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 5, Art. II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and hereby imposes upon her the penalty of life imprisonment and fine of Five Hundred Thousand (P500,000.00) Pesos.<br><br>The confiscated shabu is hereby ordered destroyed in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of Republic Act 9165.<br><br>The accused shall serve her sentence at the Correctional Institute for Women at Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. She shall be entitled to the full benefits of her preventive imprisonment which shall be credited in the service of her sentence according to the provision of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On appeal to the CA, accused-appellant questioned the lower court's decision in convicting her despite the failure of the prosecution to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. She raised the issue of whether the chain of custody of the <i>shabu</i> allegedly recovered from her was properly established.  She argued that SPO2 Jamila failed to properly identify the prohibited drug and that the prosecution was unable to prove that the drugs presented in court were the same drugs seized from her.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On October 13, 2008, the CA affirmed the judgment of the lower court.  It ruled that all the elements necessary to establish the fact of sale or delivery of illegal drugs were aptly established by the prosecution, including the chain of custody, <i>to wit:</i><br><br><blockquote>During the trial, the prosecution through SPO2 Jamila (as poseur-buyer) was able to establish the consummation of the sale by agreeing to purchase sachets of shabu at P1,000.00 each from appellant, which the latter had voluntarily delivered at the total price of P2,000.00 for two (2) sachets of shabu. SPO2 Jamila personally identified appellant in court as the same person who sold to him the shabu. The two (2) sachets of shabu confiscated from appellant, properly marked as Exhibits "RPM1 and RPM2", were immediately brought to the laboratory for qualitative examination. The result of tests conducted confirmed that the specimen submitted were positive for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride. More so, appellant's urine specimen that was taken by the authorities was found with traces of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, thus indicating that she had recentlty "used" shabu.<br><br>Tested against the elements necessary to establish the fact of sale or delivery of illegal drugs, i.e., (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefore, the prosecution was able to establish that appellant is guilty of the crime with which she was charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA also held that in the face of SPO2 Jamila's positive testimony, accused-appellant's denial is self-serving and has little weight in law.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Decision of the CA reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated August 16, 2004 (sic) of the trial court appealed from is hereby <b>AFFIRMED <i>IN TOTO</i></b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On November 5, 2008, accused-appellant filed her Notice of Appeal of the Decision dated October 13, 2008 rendered by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In Our Resolution dated March 30, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> We notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desire, within thirty (30) days from notice.  On June 16, 2009, the People of the Philippines manifested that it is no longer filing a supplemental brief as it believes that the Brief for the Appellee dated October 16, 2006 has adequately addressed the issues and arguments in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Accused-appellant, on the other hand, filed her Supplemental Brief on July 14, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Accused-appellant contends in both her <i>Brief for Accused-Appellant</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and <i>Supplemental Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>the court of appeals erred in CONVICTING accused-appellant DESPITE THE failure OF THE PROSECUTION to prove HER guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROPER CUSTODY OF SEIZED DANGEROUS DRUGS UNDER R.A.

It has been established that it was the police informant who made the initial contact with accused-appellant when he introduced SPO2 Jamila as a buyer for <i>shabu</i>. SPO2 Jamila then ordered two (2) sachets of <i>shabu</i> which accused-appellant agreed to sell at PhP 1,000 per sachet.  Accused-appellant left for a while and shortly thereafter, she came back with the two (2) sachets containing a white crystalline substance which was later identified as <i>shabu</i> and gave them to SPO2 Jamila.  The latter then paid her with the previously marked money he brought with him. Subsequently, upon giving the pre-arranged signal, the accused-appellant was arrested.  Evidently, the facts themselves demonstrate a valid buy-bust operation that is within the bounds of a fair and reasonable administration of justice.<br><br><b>Chain of Custody was <br>Properly Established</b><br><br>Accused-appellant contends in both her <i>Brief for Accused-Appellant</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and <i>Supplemental Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  that there was failure on the part of the police officers who allegedly conducted the buy-bust operation to properly make an inventory of the <i>shabu</i> allegedly recovered from her.  She further argues that the police officers also failed to photograph and mark the <i>shabu</i> immediately after the alleged buy-bust operation. In other words, she claims that there is clear doubt on the identity of the <i>shabu</i> that was allegedly recovered from the accused-appellant because the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody of the prohibited drug.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>In the prosecution for the illegal sale of prohibited drugs, the Court has reiterated the essential elements in <i>People v. Pendatun</i>, to wit: (1) the accused sold and delivered a prohibited drug to another; and (2) he knew that what he had sold and delivered was a prohibited drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> All these elements were ably proven by the prosecution in the instant case. The accused-appellant sold and delivered the <i>shabu</i> for PhP 2,000 to SPO2 Jamila posing as buyer; the said drug was seized and identified as a prohibited drug and subsequently presented in evidence; there was actual exchange of the marked money and contraband; and finally, the accused-appellant was fully aware that she was selling and delivering a prohibited drug.

It is, therefore, essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt.  Even more than this, what must also be established is the fact that the substance bought during the buy-bust operation is the same substance offered in court as exhibit.
