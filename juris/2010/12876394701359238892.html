There were no divisions in the 6 x 6 meter room.<br><br>Asked to circumstantiate her accusations, private complainant testified that the first rape incident happened at around 6:00 o'clock in the morning sometime in June 2000 in their living cum sleeping room.&nbsp; Private complainant, who was sleeping, was awakened by the act of her father who was then undressing her and who went on top of her, mashed her breast, and inserted his penis inside her vagina. It was disclosed that she was wearing her blouse, shorts, bra and underwear at that time. Accused-appellant, who was only wearing shorts, removed his shorts when he inserted his penis inside her vagina. For two months, AAA complained of pain because her father's penis had penetrated her vagina.&nbsp; The bestial act was committed by her father while her mother was not around.&nbsp; Accused-appellant had threatened her not to report the matter to her mother.<br><br>The second incident happened on 10 December 2000 at around 6:00 o'clock in the morning. At the time, private complainant's mother was at the market to buy fish ball supplies. Except for the date, the first and second incidents were perpetrated in the same manner.&nbsp; On said date and time, private complainant was sleeping with her 6-year-old sister, when she was awakened when she felt something heavy on top of her.&nbsp; Upon awaking, she saw her father was already on top of her. He removed her clothes, kissed her breast and inserted his penis inside her vagina.&nbsp; She cried because her father threatened her while holding held her neck, and warned her not to report the matter to anybody.<br><br>Because of the harrowing incidents, she was ashamed to attend classes because her playmates had seen her father being arrested by the police.<br><br>Upon medico-legal examination conducted by Dr. Ivan Richard Viray on 14 December 2000, it was found that subject is in non-virgin state physically but with no external signs of application of any form of trauma. He testified that based on the examination he conducted, the deep healed laceration could have been sustained more than seven days. According to him, a deep healed laceration may be considered permanent. Once the hymen is lacerated, it is permanently lacerated. When asked what could have caused such a laceration on the hymen, he explained that the probable cause of a laceration is the insertion of a hard object, such as a penis.<br><br>In support of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the following documentary evidence, among others, were offered in court:&nbsp; (a) sworn statement of private complainant; and (b) Medico Legal Report No. MR-219-2000.<br><br>On the other hand, the defense presented accused-appellant Miguelito Malana y Lardisabay as its sole witness.<br><br>Accused-appellant admitted that private complainant is his daughter but denied ever raping her.&nbsp; At the time the incident was supposed to have occurred in June 2000, he was busy selling fish ball, <i>kikiam</i>, cigarettes, and beverages along the Baliuag bus terminal.&nbsp; He would start selling the same before 8:00 o'clock in the morning everyday and would arrive home at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening.&nbsp; Accused-appellant was a good father in that he treated his daughter well.&nbsp; He admitted, however, to physically hurting his children on several instances while he was drunk, allegedly because of their wrongdoings.&nbsp; Accused-appellant said private complainant is not a hard-headed child. When asked if he knows how his daughter AAA lost her virginity, accused-appellant replied in the negative. Neither did his wife say anything to him about it.&nbsp; Private complainant only filed the case against him due to her personal grudge against him, as he hurt his family whenever he was under the influence of alcohol.<br><br>On 4 September 2006, the trial court finally rendered its Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Weighing the evidence adduced by both sides, the trial court accorded more credence to the evidence proffered by the prosecution, thus convicting accused-appellant of two counts of simple rape only, and not qualified rape, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>XXX<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">In Criminal Case No. 452-M-2001, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape punished under the provisions of Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">In Criminal Case No. 453-M-2001, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape punished under the provisions of Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The accused is likewise directed to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P75,000.00 for each count (total amount P150,000.00).<br><br>XXX<br></blockquote><br>The penalty imposed in the two criminal cases being <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the case was immediately brought to the Court of Appeals on automatic review, in view of this Court's ruling in <i>People v.

Viray, the Medico-Legal Report on private complainant contained the following findings:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>MEDICO-LEGAL REPORT NO. MR-219-2000</b><br></center><br><b>HYMEN</b>:<br><br>Elastic fleshy type with the presence of shallow healed lacerations at 2, 6 o'clock positions &amp; deep healed lacerations at 3 &amp; 9 o'clock<br><br><b>CONCLUSION</b>:<br><br>Subject is in non-virgin state physically<br>There are no external signs of application of any form of trauma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Denial and alibi are viewed by this Court with disfavor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> considering these are inherently weak defenses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> especially in light of private complainant's positive and straightforward declarations identifying accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> as the one who committed the bastardly act against her, as well as her straightforward and convincing testimony detailing the circumstances and events leading to the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded by the defense claim that the series of rape incidents could not have happened without the other members of the family being made aware of it.&nbsp; In a long line of cases, this Court has ruled that a small living quarter has not been considered to be a safe refuge from a sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Rape can be committed in the same room with the rapist's spouse or where other members of the family are also sleeping,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in a house where there are other occupants or even in places which to many might appear unlikely and high-risk venues for its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Lust, it has been said before, is apparently no respecter of time and place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Neither is it necessary for the rape to be committed in an isolated place, for rapists bear no respect for locale and time in carrying out their evil deed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Private complainant did not immediately inform her mother about the incident.&nbsp; However, it is not unusual for a victim immediately following the sexual assault to conceal at least momentarily the incident, for it is not uncommon for a victim of rape to be intimidated into silence and conceal for sometime the violation of her honor, even by the mildest threat on her life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; To recall, accused-appellant had threatened her not to tell anybody about the incident.<br><br>Accused-appellant's defense that private complainant and her mother were harboring a personal grudge against him, fails in light of the positive and straightforward testimony of private complainant identifying accused-appellant as the one who had raped and ravished her.&nbsp; This is bolstered by the fact that it is unnatural for a parent to use his offspring as an engine of malice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Verily, the testimony of the rape victim against her father, in this particular case, is entitled to greater weight, since reverence and respect for elders is too deeply ingrained in Filipino children and is even recognized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, a daughter would not accuse her own father of a serious offense like rape had she not really been aggrieved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Simple rape is punished under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code by the single indivisible penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code mandates that the death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br><blockquote>(1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim;</blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals and RTC correctly disregarded the circumstances of minority and relationship.&nbsp; This Court has consistently ruled that the twin circumstances of minority and relationship are in the nature of qualifying circumstances which must be alleged in the information and proved during trial beyond reasonable doubt, otherwise, the accused should only be held liable for the crime of simple rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; These qualifying circumstances cannot be considered in fixing the penalty because minority, though alleged in the information was not proved. As regards relationship, the same was alleged and proved.&nbsp; Pursuant, to Section 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, in order to fall within subparagraph 1 of said provision, both circumstances of minority and relationship must be alleged in the information and proved during trial.<br><br>The twin circumstances of minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender must concur to qualify the crime of rape.&nbsp; In the instant case, only relationship was duly alleged and proved.<br><br>Sections 8 and 9, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure now provide that aggravating as well as qualifying circumstances must be alleged in the information and proven during trial, otherwise they cannot be considered against the accused.&nbsp; Thus, the same cannot be used to impose the higher penalty of capital punishment on accused-appellant.<br><br>Thus, accused-appellant should be convicted of simple rape only and sentenced accordingly to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence dictates that, upon a finding of the fact of rape, the award of civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> is mandatory. The Court of Appeals erroneously awarded civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00, which amount is given in qualified rape cases.&nbsp; This being a case of simple rape only, the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity is proper. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 is automatically granted in addition to civil indemnity without need of further proof inasmuch as it is assumed that a victim of rape has actually suffered moral injuries that entitles her to such an award.&nbsp; From the foregoing, private complainant is entitled to the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, without need of proof, and another P30,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape, to set an example for the public good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
