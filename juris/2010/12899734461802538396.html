"A" and "2".&nbsp; Republic Act No. 2081 entitled "An Act to Amend Republic Act Numbered Eighty-Five and Other Pertinent Laws, to Provide Facilities for Intermediate and Long-Term Credit by Converting the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation into the Development Bank of the Philippines, Authorizing the said Bank to Aid in the Establishment of Provincial and City Private Development Banks, and for Other Purposes" was approved and made effective on June 14, 1958. It was therefore the law the Charter (sic) of DBP, when in 1976 the mortgage here in issue was executed.&nbsp; On the other hand, Executive Order No. 81, with its Section 16 thereof (sic) reading as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 16.&nbsp; Right of Redemption. -- Any mortgagor of the Bank whose real property has been extrajudicially sold at public auction shall, within one (1) year counted from the date of registration of the certificate of sale, have the right to redeem the real property by paying to the Bank all of the latter's claim against him, as determined by the Bank."<br></blockquote><br>is of recent vintage. Executive Order No. 81, issued by then President Corazon C. Aquino, was made effective on December 3, 1986. Clearly, the application of Executive Order No. 81 to the mortgage herein involved would violate the constitutional proscription against the impairment of contracts.&nbsp; Sec. 16 of Executive Order No. 81, which governs the right of redemption in extrajudicial foreclosures, is not found in Rep. Act No. 2081 or even in Rep. Act No. 85.&nbsp; And so, to make the redemption subject to a subsequent law would be obviously prejudicial to the party exercising the right to redeem.&nbsp; Any change in the law governing redemption that would make it more difficult than under the law at the time of the mortgage cannot be given retroactive effect.<br><br>Under the terms of the mortgage contract, "Exh. "2", specifically paragraph 4 thereof:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x the Mortgagee may immediately foreclose this mortgage judicially or extrajudicially under Act No. 3135 as amended, or under Republic Act No. 85, as amended and or under Act No. 1508 as amended.&nbsp; x x x x."</blockquote><br>Going by the literal terms of this quoted provision of the mortgage contract, defendant DBP stand bound by the same.&nbsp; When defendant DBP foreclosed the mortgage at issue, it chose Act 3135.&nbsp; That was an option it freely exercised without the least intervention of plaintiffs.&nbsp; We cannot, therefore, escape the conclusion that what defendant DBP agreed to in respect to (sic) the possible foreclosure of its mortgage was to subject the same to the provisions of Act No. 3135, as amended, should the DBP opt to utilize said law.&nbsp; Section 6 of Act No. 3135 very clearly governs the right of redemption in extrajudicial foreclosures thus:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 6.&nbsp; In all cases in which an extrajudicial sale is made under the special power herein before referred to, the debtor, his successors in interest or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the property is sold, may redeem the same at any time within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale; and such redemption shall be governed by the provisions of sections four hundred and sixty-four to four hundred and sixty-six, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, in so far as these are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act."</blockquote><br>Sections four hundred sixty-four to four hundred sixty-five, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, since the promulgation of the Rules of Court of 1940, became sections 29, 30 and 32 of Rule 39.&nbsp; The same sections were reproduced in the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>Having thus come to the conclusion that Act 3135 and Sections 29 to 32 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court rather than Executive Order No. 81 are the laws applicable to the right of redemption invoke (sic) by plaintiffs in this case, it would appear that all that remains for this Court to do is to apply the said legal precepts.&nbsp; Pursuant to Section 30 of Rule 39, "the judgment debtor -- or his successor-in-interest per Sec. 29, here plaintiff&nbsp;&nbsp; Mario Batute -- may redeem the property from the purchaser, at any time within twelve months after the sale, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with one per centum per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may have paid thereon after the purchase, and interest on such last-named amount at the same rate; x x x".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>DBP appealed to the Court of Appeals.<br><br><u><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b><br></center></u><br>In its 16 January 2006 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the RTC's 7 January 1994 Decision.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals imposed a 16% annual interest on the remaining balance of the loan.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that:<br><br><blockquote>The dearth of merit in appellant bank's position is, however, evident from the fact that, as hereinbefore quoted, paragraph 4 of the September 10, 1976 <b><i>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</i></b> executed in its favor by appellees <b><i>EAI</i></b><i> </i>and<i> <b>LSMEI</b> </i>provided for three options by which the extrajudicial foreclosure thereof may be effected.&nbsp; Thereunder given the choice of resorting to "Act No. 3135 as amended, or Republic Act No. 85 as amended, or Act No. 1508 as amended", appellant bank undoubtedly opted for the first of the aforesaid laws as may be gleaned from the following prayer it interposed in the application for foreclosure of mortgage it filed with the Ex-Officio Sheriff of Quezon City on October 25, 1990, viz:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, we request you to take possession of the properties described in the above-mentioned mortgages xxx xxx xxx and sell the same at public auction in accordance with the provisions of Act 3135, as amended by Act 4118, with respect to the real estate xxx xxx xxx"</blockquote><br>With appellant bank's categorical election of Act No. 3135 as the controlling law for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the subject mortgage, it goes without saying that, insofar as the redemption of the subject realty is concerned, the provisions of said law are deemed written into the parties' agreement and, as such, should be respected as the law between them.<br><br>Anent the redemption of mortgaged properties extrajudicially foreclosed in accordance therewith, Section 6 of Act No. 3135 provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 6.&nbsp; In all cases in which an extrajudicial sale is made under the special power hereinbefore referred to, the debtor, his successors in interests (sic) or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the property is sold, may redeem the same at any time within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale; and such redemption shall be governed by the provisions of sections four hundred and sixty-four to four hundred sixty-six, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, in so far as these are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act."<br></blockquote><br>As appropriately noted by the trial court, Sections 464, 465 and 466 of the <b><i>Code of Civil Procedure</i></b> are now, respectively, Sections 27, 28 and 30 of the <b><i>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</i></b> which, under said second provision, prescribes the following guidelines for redemption, viz:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 28.&nbsp; <i>Time and manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions; notice to be given and filed</i>. -- The judgment obligor, or redemptioner, may redeem the property from the purchaser, at any time within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, by paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase, with one per centum per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which may have been paid thereon after purchase, and interest on such last named amount at the same rate; and if the purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under which such purchase (sic), the amount of such other lien, with interest.<br><br>Written notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made the sale and a duplicate filed with the registry of deeds of the place, and if any assessments or taxes are paid by the redemptioner or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof must in like manner be given to the officer and filed with the registry of deeds; if such notice be not filed, the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments, taxes or liens."<br></blockquote><br>In order to effect the redemption of the foreclosed property, the foregoing provision notably requires the payment to the purchaser of the following sums only: (a) the bid price; (b) the interest on the bid price, computed at one per centum (1%) per month; and (c) the assessments or taxes, if any, paid by the purchaser, with the same rate of interest.<br><br>When the statute is clear and explicit, the basic principle in legal hermeneutics is to the effect that there is no need for an extended court ratiocination on the law -- there is no room for interpretation, vacillation or equivocation, only application.&nbsp; Having been made in accordance with Act No. 3135, we find that appellee Matute's offer to redeem the subject property in the amount of P1,672,770.00 was, therefore, unjustifiably refused by appellant bank. Corollarily, the rule is settled that the person effecting redemption is not mandated to pay the whole debt since, in redemption of properties, the amount payable is no longer the judgment debt but, rather, the purchase price thereby fetched at the auction sale.<br><br>As for the deficiency x x x, the consistent ruling in a cantena of Supreme Court decisions is to the effect that the mortgagee has the right to recover the same from the debtor where, in the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage, the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to pay the debt.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>Considering, however, that the amount offered by appellee by way of redemption consisted merely of the purchase price for the foreclosed property, together with the interests thereon, we find that appellant bank correctly takes exception to the trial court's imposition of legal interest on the balance of the mortgage debt.&nbsp; If the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the contrary, shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon, and in the absence of stipulation, the legal interest which is six per cent per annum.&nbsp; In the case at bench, the interest imposable on the balance of the mortgage debt should, therefore, be the sixteen per cent (16%) per annum provided under the August 31, 1981 Promissory Note appellees <b><i>EAI</i></b> and <b><i>LSMEI</i></b> executed in favor of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>DBP filed a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; In its 16 August 2006 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied the motion.&nbsp; Hence, the present petition.<br><br><center><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></center><br>DBP raises as issues that the lower courts erred in finding that the bank chose Act No. 3135 as the governing law for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the property, including the determination of the redemption price, and in ruling that the redemption price is equivalent to the P1,507,000 purchase price.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 16 of Executive Order (EO) No. 81 states that the redemption price for properties mortgaged to and foreclosed by DBP is equivalent to the remaining balance of the loan.&nbsp; Section 16 states that, "Any mortgagor of the Bank whose property has been extrajudicially sold at public auction shall x x x have the right to redeem the real property <b>by paying to the Bank all of the latter's claims against him</b>, as determined by the Bank."<br><br>In <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. West Negros College, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court held that the redemption price for properties mortgaged to and foreclosed by DBP is equivalent to the remaining balance of the loan, with interest at the agreed rate.&nbsp; The Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>It has long been settled that<b> where the real property is mortgaged to and foreclosed judicially or extrajudicially by the Development Bank of the Philippines, the right of redemption may be exercised only by paying to "<i>the Bank all the amount he owed the latter on the date of the sale, with interest on the total indebtedness at the rate agreed upon in the obligation from said date</i></b><i>, unless the bidder has taken material possession of the property or unless this had been delivered to him, in which case the proceeds of the property shall compensate the interest</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>The foregoing rule is embodied consistently in the charters of petitioner DBP and its predecessor agencies.&nbsp; Section 31 of CA 459 creating the Agricultural and Industrial Bank explicitly set the redemption price at the total indebtedness plus contractual interest as of the date of the auction sale.&nbsp; Under RA 85 the powers vested in and the duties conferred upon the Agricultural and Industrial Bank by CA 459 as well as its capital, assets, accounts, contracts, and choses in action were transferred to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation.&nbsp; It has been held that among the salutary provisions of CA 459 ceded to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation by RA 85 was Sec. 31 defining the manner of redeeming properties mortgaged with the corporation. Subsequently, by virtue of RA 2081 (1958), the powers, assets, liabilities and personnel of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation under RA 85 and CA 459, particularly Sec. 31 thereof, were transferred to petitioner DBP.&nbsp; Significantly, Sec. 31 of CA 459 has been reenacted substantially in Sec. 16 of the present charter of the DBP, <i>i.e.</i>, EO 81 (1986) as amended by RA 8523 (1998).<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The unavoidable conclusion is that<b> in redeeming the foreclosed property respondent West Negros College as assignee of Bacolod Medical Center should pay the balance of the amount owed by the latter to petitioner DBP with interest thereon at the rate agreed upon as of the date of the public auction</b> on 24 August 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v.

Rehabilitation Finance Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court held that RA No. 337, being a special and subsequent law, amended Act No. 3135 insofar as the redemption price is concerned.&nbsp; The Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Rep. Act No. 337, otherwise known as "The General Banking Act," is entitled "An Act Regulating Banks and Banking Institutions and for other purposes."&nbsp; Section 78 thereof limits the amount of the loans that may be given by banks and banking or credit institutions on the basis of the appraised value of the property given as security, as well as provides that, in the event of foreclosure of a real estate mortgage to said banks or institutions, the property sold may be redeemed "by paying the amount fixed by the court in the order of execution," or the amount judicially adjudicated to the creditor bank.&nbsp; <b>This provision had the effect of amending Section 6 of Act No. 3135, insofar as the redemption price is concerned, when the mortgagee is a bank or a banking or credit institution, said Section 6 of Act No. 3135 being, in this respect, inconsistent with the above-quoted portion of Section 78 of Rep. Act No. 337.&nbsp; In short, the Parañaque property was sold pursuant to said Act No. 3135, but the sum for which it is redeemable shall be governed by Rep. Act No. 337, which partakes of the nature of an amendment to Act No. 3135, insofar as mortgages to banks or banking or credit institutions are concerned, to which class the RFC belongs.&nbsp; At any rate, the conflict between the two (2) laws must be resolved in favor of Rep. Act No. 337, both as a special and as the subsequent legislation</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS </b>the petition.&nbsp; The Court <b>PARTIALLY SETS ASIDE</b> the 16 January 2006 Decision and 16 August 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
