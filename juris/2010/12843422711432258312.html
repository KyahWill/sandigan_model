				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner Jesus E. Dycoco, Jr. seeks reconsideration of the August 26, 2009 resolution denying his petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> wherein he assailed the February 16, 2009 decision and May 12, 2009 resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 105126.<br><br>The CA affirmed the decision and resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in <i>Jesus Dycoco, Jr. v. Equitable PCI Bank / Rene Buenaventura, et al.,</i> docketed as LAC No. 01-000390-08. The NLRC, on the other hand, reversed and set aside the July 24, 2007 decision of the labor arbiter of the Regional Arbitration Branch No. V, Legazpi City, in RAB-V Case No. 09-00407-06 which held that petitioner was illegally dismissed by respondents Equitable PCI Bank (now Banco de Oro), Rene Buenaventura and Siles Samalea.<br><br>In reversing the labor arbiter, the NLRC ruled that petitioner's dismissal was for just cause. He was guilty of serious misconduct, willful disobedience and gross negligence for not performing his duty to complete the documentary requirements in the opening of accounts pursuant to the bank's internal procedures. This directly resulted in the unauthorized abstraction of bank funds.<br><br>The pertinent facts are as follows.<br><br>In February 1997, petitioner was hired by respondent bank as Assistant Manager and/or OIC Branch Head of its Legazpi City Branch, Region V (Legazpi branch). In 2000, petitioner became Branch Head and in September 2003, respondent bank underwent an internal reorganization.&nbsp; Pursuant thereto, petitioner became the Personal Banking Manager (PBM) of the Legazpi branch.<br><br>In June 2005, several clients of the Legazpi branch filed complaints for alleged unauthorized abstractions of various trust funds, treasury placements and deposits. Respondent bank promptly commenced an investigation.&nbsp; Consequently, "show cause" letters were issued to the officers of the Legazpi branch, including Branch Center Head Glena Orogo, former Service Officer respondent Siles Samalea, Service Officer Irene Tabuzo, Operations Officers Imelda Espiritu and Maria Fe Gianan, Investment Clerk Carlo Quirong and the petitioner as the PBM.<br><br>The November 14, 2005 "show cause" letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> addressed to petitioner stated the results of the investigation, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>.

Quirong on 06.16.05.<br><br></li><li>You did not report the Cesario Israel/Josephine Bandong (Abstraction of CTF placement for P2,371,620.43 on 12.09.03 by Carlo Quirong) incident to Internal Audit Division (IAD) within two working days from the date of your knowledge of the incident on 06.15.05.<br><br>xxx<br></li></ol><br>As a result, the fraudulent withdrawal was not detected/prevented exposing the Bank to financial loss of P100K.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>In August 2006, respondent bank issued a second "show cause" letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to petitioner charging him with involvement in alleged dollar-trading activities. Petitioner was preventively suspended from September 20, 2006 to October 20, 2006.<br><br>On September 22, 2006, while petitioner was under preventive suspension, he filed a complaint in the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch No. V alleging constructive dismissal and illegal suspension, and demanding reinstatement/separation pay and payment of incentives, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, bonuses, moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>However, on October 10, 2006, respondent bank rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with respect to the first "show cause" letter finding petitioner guilty of violating Articles IV (F) (Class C) (1), IV (D) (Class D) (1) and IV (E) (Class C) (13) of the bank's Code of Conduct, and Article 282 (b) of the Labor Code. The penalty of dismissal was imposed on him. Petitioner was, however, exonerated from the charge of dollar-tradingas specified in the second "show cause" letter.<br><br>On July 24, 2007, the labor arbiter held that petitioner was illegally dismissed. He ordered respondent bank to pay separation pay, backwages, incentives, bonuses, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and attorney's fees in the total amount of P1,147,216.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the NLRC reversed the labor arbiter's decision.&nbsp; The CA subsequently affirmed the NLRC.<br><br>Petitioner insists that he was illegally dismissed.&nbsp; We already rejected his position but petitioner seeks reconsideration.<br><br>The motion for reconsideration is denied.<br><br>Jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> has repeatedly outlined how diligence in the banking industry should be observed:<br><br><blockquote>By its very nature, the business of the petitioner bank is so impressed with public trust; banks are mandated to exercise a higher degree of diligence in the handling of its affairs than that expected of an ordinary business enterprise. Banks handle transactions involving millions of pesos and properties worth considerable sums of money. The banking business will thrive only as long as it maintains the trust and confidence of its customers/clients. Indeed, by the very nature of their work, the degree of responsibility, care and trustworthiness expected of officials and employees of the bank is far greater than those of ordinary officers and employees in the other business firms. Hence, no effort must be spared by banks and their officers and employees to ensure and preserve the trust and confidence of the general public and its customers/clients as well as the integrity of its records and the safety and well-being of its customers/clients while in its premises.<br></blockquote><br>As the banking industry is impressed with public interest, all bank personnel are burdened with a high level of responsibility insofar as care and diligence in the custody and management of funds are concerned.&nbsp; Petitioner miserably failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>Petitioner violated his duties and responsibilities as PBM when he signed and approved the subject transactions without the necessary signatures of the concerned clients. As PBM, it was his obligation to ensure "that all documentary requirements (were) complied with by clients being handled and that the bank's interest (was) at all times protected." It was incumbent on him to enforce "strict compliance with bank policies and internal control procedures while maintaining the highest level of service quality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>It is significant that petitioner did not even deny that it was he who signed, approved and facilitated the subject transactions relating to the various abstractions committed by a bank employee. It was an implied admission that he was the one who opened the door for the commission of the unlawful abstractions by failing to ensure that all requirements for the opening of accounts were complied with. This constituted gross negligence.<br><br>As a PBM, petitioner should have exercised much care in performing his functions. Petitioner's failure on three separate occasions to require clients to sign the requisite documents (a vital and standard procedure in all banking transactions) was a clear manifestation of serial negligence. Because of this gross negligence, Carlo Quirong, respondent bank's Customer Sales Assistant, was able to filch millions of pesos from respondent bank by manipulating clients' accounts.<br><br>Petitioner's assertion that neither Quirong nor any of the bank operations personnel was under his supervision and that the day-to-day operations of his branch were the responsibility of the Banking Center Head does not exonerate him from liability. He was duty-bound to make certain that such documentary requirements were complied with in accordance with respondent bank's rules.<br><br>Gross negligence connotes "want of care in the performance of one's duties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petitioner's failure to observe basic procedure constituted gross negligence. His repeated failure to carefully observe his duties as PBM clearly showed utter want of care.<br><br>After committing gross negligence, petitioner surprisingly still expects respondent bank to retain him.&nbsp; Nothing can compel an employer to continue availing of the services of an employee guilty of acts inimical to its interests as this is a ground for loss of confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Petitioner's breach of respondent bank's policies intended to safeguard the bank and its clients' funds was clearly inimical to the interests of his employer.&nbsp; Loss of confidence and dismissal from employment were therefore justified.<br><br>Loss of confidence applies to situations where the employee is routinely charged with the care and custody of employer's money or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> "If the employees are cashiers, <i>managers</i>, supervisors, salesmen or other personnel occupying positions of responsibility, the employer's loss of trust and confidence in said employees may justify termination of their employment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The CA was thus correct in upholding the dismissal of petitioner.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion for reconsideration is <b>DENIED with FINALITY.</b><br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br>No further pleadings or motions shall be entertained. Let entry of judgment be made in due course.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><i> Rollo</i>,&nbsp; p. 365.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><i> Rollo</i>, p. 392.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><i> Rollo</i>, p. 414.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Equivalent to 10% of the total award as computed above.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><i> United Coconut Planters Bank v.
