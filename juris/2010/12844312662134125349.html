These rights enable stockholders to know how the corporation is being managed.<br><br>The stockholders' right of inspection of the corporation's books and records is based upon their ownership of the assets and property of the corporation.

SP No. 85878,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> while the petitions contesting the judgments in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-092 and Q-04-093 were docketed as CA-G.R.

Petitioners submitted that, other than the aforementioned grounds, a stockholder's right to inspect corporate records may also be denied (1) if the stockholder is not acting in good faith and (2) the inspection is not for a legitimate purpose.&nbsp; Said grounds were allegedly the very defenses relied upon by petitioners in their Answers, but the trial court ignored the same.&nbsp; In so doing, petitioners concluded that the RTC acted capriciously, whimsically, arbitrarily and in a despotic manner, thus committing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners prayed that a preliminary injunction and/or a TRO be issued, enjoining the enforcement or implementation of the Decisions of the RTC dated June 23, 2004, to prevent grave and irreparable damage to petitioners.<br><br>On August 31, 2004, petitioners filed a Motion for Consolidation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the three petitions with CA-G.R. SP No. 85878, in the interest of "judicial economy and coherence and the fact that the three (3) cases involve the same parties and affecting closely related subject matters and thus involving common questions of law or facts."<br><br><u style="font-weight: bold;"><i>CA-G.R.

SP No. 85878, ratiocinating in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>While petitioners admit that appeal was an available remedy, they claim that it is not adequate, speedy and sufficient. However, other than said bare allegation, petitioners have not explained why appeal is not an adequate remedy.<br><br><b>Admittedly, petitioners received a copy of the assailed Decision on July 7, 2004, hence, they had fifteen (15) days therefrom, or until July 22, 2004, within which to appeal the same.&nbsp; However, it was only on August 23, 2004 that petitioners filed the instant petition for certiorari with this Court.</b>&nbsp; The fact that the assailed Decision is immediately executory, pursuant to Section 4 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act No. 8799, does not necessarily mean that appeal is not an adequate remedy.&nbsp; Under Section 10, Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court is required to transmit to this Court the records of the appealed case within thirty (30) days after the perfection of the appeal.&nbsp; Likewise, Section 3, Rule 44 of the same Rules provides that if the original record is not transmitted to this Court within thirty (30) days after the perfection of the appeal, either party may file a motion with the trial court, with notice to the other, for the transmittal of such record or record on appeal. <b>Thus, had petitioners immediately filed a notice of appeal with respondent court, the records of Civil Case No. Q-04-091 could have been transmitted to this Court within thirty (30) days from said filing, <i>i.e.</i>, even before the instant petition was filed on August 23, 2004, and petitioners could have sought a temporary restraining order in the appealed case to stay the enforcement of the assailed Decision</b>.<br><br>As pointed out in <i>Manila Electric Company vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 187 SCRA 200, 205:<br><br><blockquote>"While the special civil action of certiorari may be availed of in the alternative situation where an appeal would not constitute a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, this is on the theoretical assumption that the right to appeal is still available in the case.&nbsp; If, however, the remedy by appeal had already been lost and the loss was occasioned by petitioner's own neglect or error in the choice of remedies, certiorari cannot lie as a substitute or a tool to shield the petitioner from the adverse consequences of such neglect or error.&nbsp; The two remedies are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive."<br></blockquote><br><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, the instant petition is <b><i>DISMISSED</i></b>.&nbsp; (Emphases ours.)</blockquote><br>Subsequently, on September 22, 2004, the Court of Appeals (12<sup>th</sup> Division) issued a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which merely noted the petitioners' Motion for Consolidation, inasmuch as the petition in CA-G.R.

The appellate court explained thus:<br><br><blockquote>As [respondents] failed to allege their motive, purpose or reason for the inspection, the trial court, in its assailed decision, did not make any finding that the inspection sought was for a legitimate purpose.&nbsp; Neither can we discern, on the basis of the records of this case, that indeed the [respondents] were properly motivated in seeking an inspection of the records and books of Marine Resources Development Corporation.<br><br>Consequently, in the absence of any showing of proper motive on the part of the [respondents] in seeking an inspection of the books and records of Marine Resources Development Corporation, in line with the ruling of the Supreme Court in the aforecited case of Gonzales vs. Philippine National Bank, we hold that the trial court patently erred and as a result thereof, gravely abused its discretion when, in its assailed decision, it ruled in favor of the [respondents], allowing them to inspect the records and books of Marine Resources Development Corporation.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition for certiorari is hereby GRANTED.&nbsp; The assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 93, Quezon City, in Civil Case No. Q-04-092 is <b>ANNULLED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; Judgment is hereby rendered dismissing [respondents'] complaint for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondents sought the reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the above decision, but the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) denied the same in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated February 7, 2006.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Decision dated March 11, 2005 in CA-G.R.

Respondents averred that said motion was consistent with Rule 1, Section 4 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4.&nbsp; <i>Executory nature of decisions and orders</i>. - All decisions and orders issued under these Rules shall immediately be executory. No appeal or petition taken therefrom shall stay the enforcement or implementation of the decision or order, unless restrained by an appellate court.&nbsp; Interlocutory orders shall not be subject to appeal.</blockquote><br>As there was no restraining order issued by an appellate court, enjoining the execution of the RTC decisions, respondents argued that the said execution should proceed as a matter of course.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated February 21, 2005, the RTC <b>denied</b> the Motion for Execution of the decisions in Civil Case Nos.

SP No. 85880], which incidents stand to be affected by a precipitate execution of the judgments in these cases.&nbsp; To rule otherwise may render moot the proceedings that are pending with the higher court."<br><br>On the other hand, the RTC <b>granted</b> the Motion for Execution of the decision in Civil Case No. Q-04-091 in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> likewise dated February 21, 2005.&nbsp; The trial court based its ruling on the fact that the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878, which assailed the decision in Civil Case No. Q-04-091, had already been dismissed and the Motion for Reconsideration thereof was also denied.<br><br>On March 9, 2005, the Branch Clerk of Court of the RTC of Quezon City issued the Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> in Civil Case No. Q-04-091.<br><br>On March 22, 2005, petitioners filed an <b>Omnibus Motion (To Quash Writ of Execution and/or Suspend Execution)</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> in Civil Case No. Q-04-091.&nbsp; Petitioners observed that the Motion for Execution was based on the Court of Appeals (12<sup>th</sup> Division) Resolution dated September 2, 2004 in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878, which dismissed the petition assailing the RTC Decision dated June 23, 2004 in Civil Case No. Q-04-091. Petitioners pointed out that they subsequently received a copy of the Decision dated March 11, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880, wherein the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) set aside the ruling of the RTC in Civil Case No. Q-04-092 and thereby disallowed the respondents from inspecting the corporate records of Marine Resources Development Corporation. Petitioners also noted that the dismissal of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878 was merely based on a technicality, <i>i.e.</i>, that petitioners should have instead filed an appeal, and that the Resolution of the Court of Appeals (12<sup>th</sup> Division) did not delve on the merits of the case.&nbsp; Except for the identity of the corporations concerned, petitioners posited that the Decision dated March 11, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 supplemented what was lacking in the Resolution dated September 2, 2004 in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878 by resolving the issue of the propriety of the intended inspection of corporate records.&nbsp; Thus, petitioners asserted that the Decision dated March 11, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 was a supervening event, which warranted the suspension of the execution of the RTC Decision dated June 23, 2004 in Civil Case No. Q-04-091.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated April 21, 2005, the RTC denied the petitioners' Omnibus Motion (To Quash Writ of Execution and/or Suspend Execution), elucidating thus:<br><br><blockquote>On [petitioners'] "Omnibus Motion (to Quash Writ of Execution and/or Suspend Execution)" and subsequent related pleadings, the court resolves to deny the motion as the arguments raised therein do not sufficiently persuade the court that legal basis exists to justify the quashal of the Writ of Execution and/or suspension of its execution.<br><br>It bears to note that the Resolution of the Court of Appeals [in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880], granting [petitioners'] Petition for [Certiorari] with the Court of Appeals in a similar case (Q-04-092) and the setting aside of the order of inspection which was ordered by this court, has no relevance to this case.&nbsp; Worthy of emphasis is that the corporation involved herein is Marcel Trading Corporation which is separate from Marine Resources Development Corporation, the corporation involved in Q-04-092.<br><br>The Omnibus Motion is accordingly denied.</blockquote><br><u><b><i>CA-G.R.

SP No. 90024 and raffled to the First Division.&nbsp; Petitioners imputed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the RTC when the latter denied the petitioners' Omnibus Motion (To Quash Writ of Execution and/or Suspend Execution) and failed to consider as a supervening event the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) Decision dated March 11, 2005 in CA-G.R.

SP No. 85880, which set aside the ruling of the RTC in Civil Case No. Q-04-092 should have been considered as a supervening event that justified the suspension of the execution of the RTC Decision dated June 23, 2004 in Civil Case No. Q-04-091. Notwithstanding the lack of identity of the corporations involved, petitioners aver that Civil Case No. Q-04-091 was factually similar to Civil Case No. Q-04-092.&nbsp; Thus, they claim that the RTC should have taken judicial notice of the Decision dated March 11, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880.&nbsp; Once more, petitioners highlight the fact that the dismissal of the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878 was allegedly based on a mere technicality <i>sans</i> a discussion on the merits of the case.&nbsp; As such, the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 only supplemented what was lacking in the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878.&nbsp; To the mind of petitioners, the RTC should have at least awaited the finality of the judgments in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 85880 and 85879 before it ordered the execution of the Decision dated June 23, 2004 in Civil Case No. Q-04-091.<br><br>The instant petition is devoid of merit.<br><br>After a careful review of the facts and arguments in this case, the Court finds that petitioners have already lost their right to question the RTC Decision dated June 23, 2004 in Civil Case No. Q-04-091, much less to seek the suspension of the execution thereof.<br><br>In <i>Natalia Realty, Inc. v.

Unless a restraining order is so issued, the decision or order rendered under the Interim Rules shall remain to be immediately executory.<br><br>On September 14, 2004, the Court issued a Resolution in A.M.

SP No. 85878, holding that the same was a mere substitute for the lost remedy of appeal.&nbsp; Petitioners then filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the said resolution. Thereafter, during the pendency of the Motion for Reconsideration in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878, as well as the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 85880 and 85879, the Resolution in A.M.

Q-04-091, Q-04-092 and Q-04-093. Corollary to this is whether or not the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> filed by petitioners could have been treated as petitions for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, in accordance with the provisions of the Resolution in A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC, such that petitioners can be considered to have availed themselves of the proper remedy in assailing the rulings of the RTC.<br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>The term "petition" in the third and fourth paragraphs of A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC, cannot be construed as to include a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The rationale for this lies in the essential difference between a petition for review under Rule 43 and a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; In <i>Sebastian v. Morales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court underscored, thus:<br><br><blockquote>That a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 should <i>pro forma</i> satisfy the requirements for the contents of a petition for review under Rule 43 does not necessarily mean that one is the same as the other.&nbsp; Or that one may be treated as the other, for that matter.&nbsp; A petition for review is a mode of appeal, while a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is an extraordinary process for the correction of errors of jurisdiction.&nbsp; It is basic remedial law that the two remedies are distinct, mutually exclusive, and antithetical.&nbsp; The extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> is proper if the tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions acted without or in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law.&nbsp; A petition for review, on the other hand, seeks to correct errors of judgment committed by the court, tribunal, or officer.&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; When a court, tribunal, or officer has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the dispute, the decision on all other questions arising in the case is an exercise of that jurisdiction.&nbsp; Consequently, all errors committed in the exercise of said jurisdiction are merely errors of judgment.&nbsp; Under prevailing procedural rules and jurisprudence, errors of judgment are not proper subjects of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; For if every error committed by the trial court or quasi-judicial agency were to be the proper subject of review by <i>certiorari</i>, then trial would never end and the dockets of appellate courts would be clogged beyond measure. x x x.</blockquote><br>The RTC Decisions in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-091, Q-04-092 and Q-04-093 are final orders that disposed of the whole subject matter or terminated the particular proceedings or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; As the RTC was unquestionably acting within its jurisdiction, all errors that it might have committed in the exercise of such jurisdiction are errors of judgment, which are reviewable by a timely appeal.<br><br>The petitioners' erroneous choice of remedy was further aggravated by the fact that the same was apparently resorted to after they lost the remedy of appeal.&nbsp; In their petitions for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals, petitioners pointedly stated that "while it may be true that appeal was an available remedy, the same is not adequate or equally beneficial, speedy and sufficient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; This is plainly inaccurate.&nbsp; As previously discussed, petitioners received the RTC Decisions in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-091, Q-04-092 and Q-04-093 on July 7, 2004.&nbsp; From then on, petitioners filed the three separate petitions for <i>certiorari</i> with the Court of Appeals on August 23, 2004, or forty-seven (47) days after receipt of the RTC Decisions.&nbsp; In <i>Federation of Free Workers v. Inciong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> we reiterated the basic remedial law principle that:<br><br><blockquote>While the special civil action of certiorari may be availed of in the alternative situation where an appeal would not constitute a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, this is on the theoretical assumption that the right to appeal is still available in the case. If, however, the remedy by appeal had already been lost and the loss was occasioned by petitioner's own neglect or error in the choice of remedies, certiorari cannot lie as a substitute or a tool to shield the petitioner from the adverse consequences of such neglect or error.&nbsp; The two remedies are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive.</blockquote><br>Although the above doctrine admits of certain exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> none of them was sufficiently proven to apply in the instant case.<br><br>The Court of Appeals (12<sup>th</sup> Division) was, therefore, correct in dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878, which assailed the RTC Decision in Civil Case No. Q-04-091. Contrariwise, the Fourth and Eighth Divisions of the Court of Appeals should not have assumed jurisdiction over the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 85880 and 85879, respectively.&nbsp; The Court likewise notes that after taking cognizance of the petitions filed before them on August 23, 2004, the latter two divisions of the Court of Appeals even failed to issue a preliminary injunction and/or a TRO, enjoining the enforcement or implementation of the RTC Decisions in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-092 and Q-04-093.&nbsp; Thus, in view of the foregoing, the RTC Decisions dated June 23, 2004 in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-091, Q-04-092 and Q-04-093 remained to be immediately executory.<br><br>Nevertheless, it did not escape our attention that the RTC granted only the respondents' motion for execution in Civil Case No. Q-04-091 and denied the similar motions in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-092 and Q-04-093. Significantly, respondents no longer questioned the RTC Order denying the motions for execution in the latter two cases.&nbsp; The ultimate issue that petitioners elevated to this Court pertained to the propriety of the issuance of the writ of execution of the RTC Decision in Civil Case No. Q-04-091.&nbsp; Thus, we accordingly limit our discussion thereto.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the supervening event which developed after the finality of the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-04-091 is the Decision dated March 11, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>There is nothing in the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 that affects or changes the substance of the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-04-091 and renders the execution of the same inequitable.<br><br>The petition for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 was filed in order to dispute the judgment in the RTC Decision in Civil Case No. Q-04-092.&nbsp; In the said case, respondents sought to gain access to and inspect the corporate books and records of <b>Marine Resources Development Corporation</b>.&nbsp; On the other hand, in Civil Case No. Q-04-091, respondents entreated that they be allowed to inspect the corporate books and records of <b>Marcel Trading Corporation</b>.&nbsp; Despite the fact that the parties to this case are all stockholders in the said corporations and the respondents invoked the same provisions of law, the cases filed before the RTC were entirely distinct from and independent of each other.&nbsp; The two corporations involved are primarily engaged in different businesses and do not share exactly the same set of stockholders.&nbsp; The records of the case are also silent with respect to the consolidation of the cases before the trial court.&nbsp; Thus, any ruling on Civil Case No. Q-04-092 would not materially alter the substance of the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-04-091, which would render the execution of the latter case inequitable.<br><br>Additionally, the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 adjudged that the RTC patently erred in deciding in favor of respondents since the latter failed to show that they were impelled by proper motives in seeking to inspect the corporate records of Marine Resources Development Corporation.<br><br>However, as correctly held by the Court of Appeals (First Division) in the assailed Resolution dated June 29, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 90024, <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></b></i> has already settled that the burden of proof lies with the corporation who refuses to grant to the stockholder the right to inspect corporate records.&nbsp; In said case, Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. sought the inspection and examination of the corporate records of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB).&nbsp; As the shares of Cojuangco in the aforementioned corporations had previously been sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), the requests for inspection were coursed through the said government agency.&nbsp; The PCGG, thereafter, denied Cojuangco's requests, arguing that the purpose of the latter was merely to satisfy his curiosity regarding the performance of SMC and UCPB.&nbsp; In rejecting PCGG's line of reasoning, the Court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he argument is devoid of merit.&nbsp; Records indicate that [Cojuangco] is the ostensible owner of a substantial number of shares and is a stockholder of record in SMC and UCPB.&nbsp; Being a stockholder beyond doubt, there is therefore no reason why [Cojuangco] may not exercise his statutory right of inspection in accordance with Sec. 74 of the Corporation Code, the only express limitation being that the right of inspection should be exercised at reasonable hours on business days; 2) the person demanding to examine and copy excerpts from the corporation's records and minutes has not improperly used any information secured through any previous examination of the records of such corporation; and 3) the demand is made in good faith or for a legitimate purpose.&nbsp; The latter two limitations, however, must be set up as a defense by the corporation if it is to merit judicial cognizance.&nbsp; As such, and in the absence of evidence, the PCGG cannot unilaterally deny a stockholder from exercising his statutory right of inspection based on an unsupported and naked assertion that private respondent's motive is improper or merely for curiosity or on the ground that the stockholder is not in friendly terms with the corporation's officers.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>In the case at bar, [PCGG] failed to discharge the burden of proof to show that [Cojuangco's] action in seeking examination of the corporate records was moved by unlawful or ill-motivated designs which could appropriately call for a judicial protection against the exercise of such right.&nbsp; Save for its unsubstantiated allegations, [PCGG] could offer no proof, nay, not even a scintilla of evidence that respondent Cojuangco, Jr., was motivated by bad faith; that the demand was for an illegitimate purpose or that the demand was impelled by speculation or idle curiosity. </b>Surely, [Cojuangco's] substantial shareholdings in the SMC and UCPB cannot be an object of mere curiosity.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>The Court is fully aware that the Decision dated March 11, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 85880 and the Decision dated April 28, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (Eighth Division) in CA-G.R. SP No. 85879, which adopted the ruling of the Fourth Division, had already become final and executory for failure of respondents to appeal therefrom.&nbsp; The Court may no longer disturb the same in these proceedings.&nbsp; In any event, the applicability of the said decisions of the Court of Appeals (Fourth and Eighth Divisions) is limited to the letter-demand for the inspection of corporate records of Marine Resources Development Corporation (Civil Case No. Q-04-092) and First Marine Properties, Inc. (Civil Case No. Q-04-093) made by respondents on April 16, 2004.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the Court declares that petitioners cannot rely on the Decision dated March 11, 2005 in CA-G.R.
