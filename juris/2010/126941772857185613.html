They claim that they were recruited by the salesmen of P&amp;G and were engaged to undertake merchandising chores for P&amp;G long before the existence of Promm-Gem and/or SAPS.  They further claim that when the latter had its so-called re-alignment program, petitioners were instructed to fill up application forms and report to the agencies which P&amp;G created.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further claim that P&amp;G instigated their dismissal from work as can be gleaned from its letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to SAPS dated February 24, 1993, informing the latter that their Merchandising Services Contract will no longer be renewed.<br><br>Petitioners further assert that Promm-Gem and SAPS are labor-only contractors providing services of manpower to their client. They claim that the contractors have neither substantial capital nor tools and equipment to undertake independent labor contracting.  Petitioners insist that since they had been engaged to perform activities which are necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of P&amp;G, then they are its regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondents' Arguments</i></b><br><br>On the other hand, P&amp;G points out that the instant petition raises only questions of fact and should thus be thrown out as the Court is not a trier of facts.  It argues that findings of facts of the NLRC, particularly where the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter are in agreement, are deemed binding and conclusive on the Supreme Court.<br><br>P&amp;G further argues that there is no employment relationship between it and petitioners.  It was Promm-Gem or SAPS that (1) selected petitioners and engaged their services; (2) paid their salaries; (3) wielded the power of dismissal; and (4) had the power of control over their conduct of work.<br><br>P&amp;G also contends that the Labor Code neither defines nor limits which services or activities may be validly outsourced. Thus, an employer can farm out any of its activities to an independent contractor, regardless of whether such activity is peripheral or core in nature.  It insists that the determination of whether to engage the services of a job contractor or to engage in direct hiring is within the ambit of management prerogative.<br><br>At this juncture, it is worth mentioning that on January 29, 2007, we deemed as waived the filing of the Comment of Promm-Gem on the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Also, although SAPS was impleaded as a party in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, it was no longer impleaded as a party in the proceedings before the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Hence, our pronouncements with regard to SAPS are only for the purpose of determining the obligations of P&amp;G, if any.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>As a rule, the Court refrains from reviewing factual assessments of lower courts and agencies exercising adjudicative functions, such as the NLRC.  Occasionally, however, the Court is constrained to wade into factual matters when there is insufficient or insubstantial evidence on record to support those factual findings; or when too much is concluded, inferred or deduced from the bare or incomplete facts appearing on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  In the present case, we find the need to review the records to ascertain the facts.<br><br><i>Labor-only contracting and job contracting</i><br><br>In order to resolve the issue of whether P&amp;G is the employer of petitioners, it is necessary to first determine whether Promm-Gem and SAPS are labor-only contractors or legitimate job contractors.<br><br>The pertinent Labor Code provision on the matter states:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 106. Contractor or subcontractor. - Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.<br><br>In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.<br><br><i>The Secretary of Labor may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code. </i><br><br>There is "labor-only" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. <u>In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him</u>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>Rule VIII-A, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, as amended by Department Order No. 18-02,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> distinguishes between legitimate and labor-only contracting:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><i>Section 3. Trilateral Relationship in Contracting Arrangements</i>. In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">legitimate contracting</span>, there exists a trilateral relationship under which there is a contract for a specific job, work or service between the principal and the contractor or subcontractor, and a contract of employment between the contractor or subcontractor and its workers. Hence, there are three parties involved in these arrangements, the principal which decides to farm out a job or service to a contractor or subcontractor, the contractor or subcontractor which has the capacity to independently undertake the performance of the job, work or service, and the contractual workers engaged by the contractor or subcontractor to accomplish the job[,] work or service.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><i>Section 5. Prohibition against labor-only contracting</i>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Labor-only contracting</span> is hereby declared prohibited. For this purpose, labor-only contracting shall refer to an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal, and any of the following elements are present:<br><br>i) The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal; or<br><br>ii) [T]he contractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work of the contractual employee.<br><br>The foregoing provisions shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 248 (c) of the Labor Code, as amended.<br><br>"Substantial capital or investment" refers to capital stocks and subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, tools, equipment, implements, machineries and work premises, actually and directly used by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of the job, work or service contracted out.<br><br>The "right to control" shall refer to the right reserved to the person for whom the services of the contractual workers are performed, to determine not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means to be used in reaching that end.<br><br>x x x x  (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>Clearly, the law and its implementing rules allow contracting arrangements for the performance of specific jobs, works or services.  Indeed, it is management prerogative to farm out any of its activities, regardless of whether such activity is peripheral or core in nature.  However, in order for such outsourcing to be valid, it must be made to an<i> <u>independent contractor</u></i> because the current labor rules expressly prohibit labor-only contracting.<br><br>To emphasize, there is labor-only contracting when the contractor or sub-contractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and <u>any</u> of the following elements are present:<br><br><blockquote>i)   The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span><br><br>ii)  The contractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contractual</span> employee.

Promm-Gem has also proven that it maintained its own warehouse and office space with a floor area of 870 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  It also had under its name three registered vehicles which were used for its promotional/merchandising business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Promm-Gem also has other clients<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> aside from P&amp;G.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Under the circumstances, we find that Promm-Gem has substantial investment which relates to the work to be performed.  These factors negate the existence of the element specified in Section 5(i) of DOLE Department Order No. 18-02.<br><br>The records also show that Promm-Gem supplied its complainant-workers with the relevant materials, such as markers, tapes, liners and cutters, necessary for them to perform their work.  Promm-Gem also issued uniforms to them. It is also relevant to mention that Promm-Gem already considered the complainants working under it as its regular, not merely contractual or project, employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  This circumstance negates the existence of element (ii) as stated in Section 5 of DOLE Department Order No. 18-02, which speaks of <i>contractual</i> employees. This, furthermore, negates - on the part of Promm-Gem - bad faith and intent to circumvent labor laws which factors have often been tipping points that lead the Court to strike down the employment practice or agreement concerned as contrary to public policy, morals, good customs or public order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances, Promm-Gem cannot be considered as a labor-only contractor.  We find that it is a legitimate independent contractor.<br><br>On the other hand, the Articles of Incorporation of SAPS shows that it has a paid-in capital of only P31,250.00.  There is no other evidence presented to show how much its working capital and assets are.  Furthermore, there is no showing of substantial investment in tools, equipment or other assets.<br><br>In <i>Vinoya v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court held that "[w]ith the current economic atmosphere in the country, the paid-in capitalization of PMCI amounting to P75,000.00 cannot be considered as substantial capital and, as such, PMCI cannot qualify as an independent contractor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Applying the same rationale to the present case, it is clear that SAPS - having a paid-in capital of only P31,250 - has no substantial capital.  SAPS' lack of substantial capital is underlined by the records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which show that its payroll for its merchandisers alone for one month would already total P44,561.00.  It had 6-month contracts with  P&amp;G.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  Yet SAPS failed to show that it could complete the 6-month contracts using its own capital and investment.  Its capital is not even sufficient for one month's payroll. SAPS failed to show that its paid-in capital of P31,250.00 is sufficient for the period required for it to generate its needed revenue to sustain its operations independently. Substantial capital refers to capitalization used in the <i>performance or completion</i> of the job, work or service contracted out.  In the present case, SAPS has failed to show substantial capital.<br><br>Furthermore, the petitioners have been charged with the merchandising and promotion of the products of P&amp;G, an activity that has already been considered by the Court as doubtlessly directly related to the manufacturing business,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> which is the principal business of P&amp;G.  Considering that SAPS has no substantial capital or investment and the workers it recruited are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of P&amp;G, we find that the former is engaged in "labor-only contracting".<br><br>"Where `labor-only' contracting exists, the Labor Code itself establishes an employer-employee relationship between the employer and the employees of the `labor-only' contractor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The statute establishes this relationship for a comprehensive purpose: to prevent a circumvention of labor laws. The contractor is considered merely an agent of the principal employer and the latter is responsible to the employees of the labor-only contractor as if such employees had been directly employed by the principal employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the following petitioners, having been recruited and supplied by SAPS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> -- which engaged in labor-only contracting -- are considered as the employees of P&amp;G: Arthur Corpuz, Eric Aliviado, Monchito Ampeloquio, Abraham Basmayor, Jr., Jonathan Mateo, Lorenzo Platon, Estanislao Buenaventura, Lope Salonga, Franz David, Nestor Ignacio, Jr., Rolando Romasanta, Roehl Agoo, Bonifacio Ortega, Arsenio Soriano, Jr., Arnel Endaya, Roberto Enriquez, Edgardo Quiambao, Santos Bacalso, Samson Basco, Alstando Montos, Rainer N.

In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> or authorized<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> cause.<br><br>In the instant case, the termination letters given by Promm-Gem to its employees uniformly specified the cause of dismissal as grave misconduct and breach of trust, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>This informs you that effective May 5, 1992, your employment with our company, Promm-Gem, Inc. has been terminated.  We find your expressed admission, that you considered yourself as an employee of Procter &amp; Gamble Phils., Inc.... and assailing the integrity of the Company as legitimate and independent promotion firm, is deemed as an act of disloyalty prejudicial to the interests of our Company: serious misconduct and breach of trust reposed upon you as employee of our Company which [co]nstitute just cause for the termination of your employment.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Misconduct has been defined as improper or wrong conduct; the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, unlawful in character implying wrongful intent and not mere error of judgment. The misconduct to be serious must be of such grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial and unimportant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  To be a just cause for dismissal, such misconduct (a) must be serious; (b) must relate to the performance of the employee's duties; and (c) must show that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In other words, in order to constitute serious misconduct which will warrant the dismissal of an employee under paragraph (a) of Article 282 of the Labor Code, it is not sufficient that the act or conduct complained of has violated some established rules or policies.  It is equally important and required that the act or conduct must have been performed with wrongful intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In the instant case, petitioners-employees of Promm-Gem may have committed an error of judgment in claiming to be employees of P&amp;G, but it cannot be said that they were motivated by any wrongful intent in doing so.  As such, we find them guilty of only simple misconduct for assailing the integrity of Promm-Gem as a legitimate and independent promotion firm.  A misconduct which is not serious or grave, as that existing in the instant case, cannot be a valid basis for dismissing an employee.<br><br>Meanwhile, loss of trust and confidence, as a ground for dismissal, must be based on the willful breach of the trust reposed in the employee by his employer. Ordinary breach will not suffice. A breach of trust is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Loss of trust and confidence, as a cause for termination of employment, is premised on the fact that the employee concerned holds a position of responsibility or of trust and confidence.  As such, he must be invested with confidence on delicate matters, such as custody, handling or care and protection of the property and assets of the employer.  And, in order to constitute a just cause for dismissal, the act complained of must be work-related and must show that the employee is unfit to continue to work for the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In the instant case, the petitioners-employees of Promm-Gem have not been shown to be occupying positions of responsibility or of trust and confidence. Neither is there any evidence to show that they are unfit to continue to work as merchandisers for Promm-Gem.<br><br>All told, we find no valid cause for the dismissal of petitioners-employees of Promm-Gem.<br><br>While Promm-Gem had complied with the procedural aspect of due process in terminating the employment of petitioners-employees, <i>i.e</i>., giving two notices and in between such notices, an opportunity for the employees to answer and rebut the charges against them, it failed to comply with the substantive aspect of due process as the acts complained of neither constitute serious misconduct nor breach of trust.  Hence, the dismissal is illegal.<br><br>With regard to the petitioners placed with P&amp;G by SAPS, they were given no written notice of dismissal.  The records show that upon receipt by SAPS of  P&amp;G's letter terminating their "Merchandising Services Contact" effective March 11, 1993, they in turn verbally informed the concerned petitioners not to report for work anymore.  The concerned petitioners related their dismissal as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>5.  On March 11, 1993, we were called to a meeting at SAPS office.  We were told by Mr. Saturnino A. Ponce that we should already stop working immediately because that was the order of Procter and Gamble.  According to him he could not do otherwise because Procter and Gamble was the one paying us.  To prove that Procter and Gamble was the one responsible in our dismissal, he showed to us the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> dated February 24, 1993, x x x<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">February 24, 1993<br></div><br>Sales and Promotions Services<br>Armon's Bldg., 142 Kamias Road,<br>Quezon City<br><br>Attention: Mr. Saturnino A.

Parenthetically, unlike Promm-Gem which dismissed its employees for grave misconduct and breach of trust due to disloyalty, SAPS dismissed its employees upon the initiation of P&amp;G.  It is evident that SAPS does not carry on its own business because the termination of its contract with P&amp;G automatically meant for it also the termination of its employees' services.  It is obvious from its act that SAPS had no other clients and had no intention of seeking other clients in order to further its merchandising business.  From all indications SAPS, existed to cater solely to the need of P&amp;G for the supply of employees in the latter's merchandising concerns only.  Under the circumstances prevailing in the instant case, we cannot consider SAPS as an <i>independent</i> contractor.<br><br>Going back to the matter of dismissal, it must be emphasized that the <i>onus probandi</i> to prove the lawfulness of the dismissal rests with the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  In termination cases, the burden of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal is for just and valid cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In the instant case, P&amp;G failed to discharge the burden of proving the legality and validity of the dismissals of those petitioners who are considered its employees.

The sudden and peremptory barring of the concerned petitioners from work, and from admission to the work place, after just a one-day verbal notice, <i>and</i> for no valid cause bellows oppression and utter disregard of the right to due process of the concerned petitioners.  Hence, an award of moral damages is called for.<br><br>Attorney's fees may likewise be awarded to the concerned petitioners who were  illegally  dismissed  in  bad  faith  and  were compelled  to  litigate  or  incur expenses to protect their rights by reason of the oppressive acts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of P&amp;G.<br><br>Lastly, under Article 279 of the Labor Code, an employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits or their monetary equivalent from the time the compensation was withheld up to the time of actual reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Hence, all the petitioners, having been illegally dismissed are entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and with full back wages and other benefits from the time of their illegal dismissal up to the time of their actual reinstatement.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
