				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Jose Antonio C.

SP No. 97761 that affirmed the trial court's Orders of January 24, 31, February 7, 8, all in 2007, and denied the motion for reconsideration, respectively.<br><br>Petitioner was, by Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of January 16, 2007, charged with <i>homicide </i>for the death of Rafael de las Alas on January 12, 2007 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City.&nbsp; Branch 150 to which the case was raffled, presided by Judge Elmo Alameda, forthwith issued a commitment order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against petitioner who was placed under police custody while confined at the Makati Medical Center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After petitioner posted a P40,000 cash bond which the trial court approved,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> he was released from detention, and his arraignment was set on January 24, 2007.<br><br>The private complainants-heirs of De las Alas filed, with the conformity of the public prosecutor, an Urgent Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> praying, <i>inter alia</i>, for the deferment of the proceedings to allow the public prosecutor to re-examine the evidence on record or to conduct a reinvestigation to determine the proper offense.<br><br>The RTC thereafter issued the (1) <u>Order of January 24, 2007</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; deferring petitioner's arraignment and allowing the prosecution to conduct a reinvestigation to determine the proper offense and submit a recommendation within 30 days from its inception, <i>inter alia</i>; and (2) <u>Order of January 31, 2007</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> denying reconsideration of the first order. Petitioner assailed these orders via certiorari and prohibition before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Meantime, petitioner filed an Urgent <i>Ex-Parte</i> Manifestation and Motion before the trial court to defer acting on the public prosecutor's recommendation on the proper offense until after the appellate court resolves his application for injunctive reliefs, or alternatively, to grant him time to comment on the prosecutor's recommendation and thereafter set a hearing for the judicial determination of probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner also separately moved for the inhibition of Judge Alameda with prayer to defer action on the admission of the Amended Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The trial court nonetheless issued the other assailed orders, viz:&nbsp; (1) <u>Order of February 7, 2007</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> that admitted the Amended Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> for <i>murder </i>and directed the issuance of a warrant of arrest; and (2) <u>Order of February 8, 2007</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which set the arraignment on February 13, 2007. Petitioner questioned these two orders via supplemental petition before the appellate court.<br><br>The appellate court dismissed petitioner's petition, hence, his present petition, arguing that:<br><br><blockquote>PRIVATE RESPONDENT DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAUSE THE REINVESTIGATION OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BELOW WHEN THE CRIMINAL INFORMATION HAD ALREADY BEEN FILED WITH THE LOWER COURT.&nbsp; HENCE, THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR IN FINDING THAT RESPONDENT JUDGE DID NOT ACT WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN GRANTING SUCH REINVESTIGATION DESPITE HAVING NO BASIS IN THE RULES OF COURT[;]<br><br>RESPONDENT JUDGE ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN ADMITTING STATE PROSECUTOR VELASCO'S AMENDED INFORMATION, ISSUING A WARRANT OF ARREST, AND SETTING THE CASE BELOW FOR ARRAIGNMENT, CONSIDERING THAT THE VALIDITY AND LEGALITY OF HIS ORDERS DATED 24 AND 31 JANUARY 2007, WHICH LED TO THE QUESTIONABLE REINVESTIGATION AND ILLEGAL AMENDED INFORMATION[,] ARE YET TO BE RESOLVED BY THIS HONORABLE COURT (sic); [AND]<br><br>CONSIDERING THAT PROSECUTOR VELASCO'S FINDINGS IN HIS RESOLUTION DATED 2 FEBRUARY 2007 ARE BLATANTLY BASED ON MERE SPECULATIONS AND CONJECTURES, WITHOUT ANY SUBSTANTIAL OR MATERIAL NEW EVIDENCE BEING ADDUCED DURING THE REINVESTIGATION, RESPONDENT JUDGE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST ALLOWED PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR A HEARING FOR JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (emphasis in the original omitted)</blockquote><br>Records show that the arraignment scheduled on March 21, 2007 pushed through during which petitioner refused to plead, drawing the trial court to enter a plea of "not guilty" for him.<br><br>Prior thereto or on February 23, 2007, petitioner filed an Urgent Application for Admission to Bail <i>Ex Abundanti Cautela</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which the trial court, after hearings thereon, granted by Order of May 21, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> it finding that the evidence of guilt for the crime of <i>murder </i>is not strong. It accordingly allowed petitioner to post bail in the amount of P300,000 for his provisional liberty.<br><br>The trial court, absent any writ of preliminary injunction from the appellate court, went on to try petitioner under the Amended Information.&nbsp; By Decision of January 14, 2009, the trial court found petitioner guilty of homicide, sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum to 12 years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum.&nbsp; From the Decision, petitioner filed an appeal to the appellate court, docketed as CA-G.R. CR No. 32159, during the pendency of which he filed an urgent application for admission to bail pending appeal.&nbsp; The appellate court denied petitioner's application which this Court, in G.R. No. 189122, affirmed by Decision of March 17, 2010.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) later argued that the present petition had been rendered moot since the presentation of evidence, wherein petitioner actively participated, had been concluded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b><u>Waiver on the part of the accused </u></b><b>must be distinguished from <u>mootness of the petition</u></b>, for in the present case, petitioner did not, by his active participation in the trial, waive his stated objections.<br><br>Section 26, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote><i>SEC. 26. <i>Bail not a bar to objections on illegal arrest, lack of or irregular preliminary investigation. </i>- An application for or admission to bail shall not bar the accused from challenging the validity of his arrest or the legality of the warrant issued therefor, or from assailing the regularity or questioning the absence of a preliminary investigation of the charge against him, provided that he raises them before entering his plea. The court shall resolve the matter as early as practicable but not later than the start of the trial of the case. </i></blockquote><br>By applying for bail, petitioner did not waive his right to challenge the regularity of the reinvestigation of the charge against him, the validity of the admission of the Amended Information, and the legality of his arrest under the Amended Information, as he vigorously raised them <i>prior </i>to his arraignment. During the arraignment on March 21, 2007, petitioner refused to enter his plea since the issues he raised were still pending resolution by the appellate court, thus prompting the trial court to enter a plea of "not guilty" for him.<br><br>The principle that the accused is precluded after arraignment from questioning the<i> illegal arrest or the lack of or irregular preliminary investigation</i> applies "<u>only if he <i>voluntarily </i>enters his plea and participates during trial, without previously invoking his objections thereto.</u>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> There must be <u>clear and convincing proof</u> that petitioner had an <u>actual intention to relinquish his right to question the existence of probable cause</u>.&nbsp; When the only proof of intention rests on what a party does, his act should be so manifestly consistent with, and indicative of, an intent to voluntarily and unequivocally relinquish the particular right that no other explanation of his conduct is possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>From the given circumstances, the Court cannot reasonably infer a valid waiver on the part of petitioner to preclude him from obtaining a definite resolution of the objections he so timely invoked.&nbsp; Other than its allegation of active participation, the OSG offered no clear and convincing proof that petitioner's participation in the trial was unconditional with the intent to voluntarily and unequivocally abandon his petition.&nbsp; In fact, on January 26, 2010, petitioner still moved for the early resolution of the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><i>Whatever</i> delay arising from petitioner's availment of remedies against the trial court's Orders cannot be imputed to petitioner to operate as a valid waiver on his part.&nbsp; Neither can the non-issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction be deemed as a voluntary relinquishment of petitioner's principal prayer.&nbsp; The non-issuance of such injunctive relief only means that the appellate court did not preliminarily find any exception<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the long-standing doctrine that injunction will not lie to enjoin a criminal prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the trial of the case took its course.<br><br>The petition is now moot, however, in view of the trial court's rendition of judgment.<br><br>A moot and academic case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The judgment convicting petitioner of homicide under the Amended Information for murder operates as a supervening event that mooted the present petition.&nbsp; Assuming that there is ground<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to annul the finding of probable cause for murder, there is no practical use or value in abrogating the concluded proceedings and retrying the case under the original Information for homicide just to arrive, more likely or even definitely, at the same conviction of homicide.&nbsp; Mootness would have also set in had petitioner been convicted of murder, for proof beyond reasonable doubt, which is much higher than probable cause, would have been established in that instance.<br><br>Instead, however, of denying the petition outright on the ground of mootness, the Court proceeds to resolve the legal issues in order to formulate controlling principles to guide the bench, bar and public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; <u>In the present case, there is compelling reason to clarify the remedies available <i>before </i>and <i>after </i>the filing of an information in cases subject of inquest</u>.<br><br>After going over into the substance of the petition and the assailed issuances, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the appellate court in finding no grave abuse of discretion in the issuance of the four trial court Orders.<br><br>In his first assignment of error, petitioner posits that the prosecution has no right under the Rules to seek from the trial court an investigation or reevaluation of the case except through a petition for review before the Department of Justice (DOJ).&nbsp; In cases when an accused is arrested without a warrant, petitioner contends that the remedy of preliminary investigation belongs only to the accused.<br><br>The contention lacks merit.<br><br>Section 6,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Rule 112 of the Rules of Court reads:<br><br><blockquote>When a person is lawfully arrested without a warrant involving an offense which requires a preliminary investigation, the complaint or information may be filed by a prosecutor <u>without need of such investigation provided an inquest has been conducted in accordance with existing rules.</u>&nbsp; In the absence or unavailability of an inquest prosecutor, the complaint may be filed by the offended party or a peace officer directly with the proper court on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting officer or person.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span> the complaint or information is filed, <u>the person arrested may ask for a preliminary investigation</u> in accordance with this Rule, but he must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in the presence of his counsel.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the waiver, he may apply for bail and the investigation must be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its inception.<br><br><u>After</u> the filing of the complaint or information in court without a preliminary investigation, <u>the accused may</u>, within five (5) days from the time he learns of its filing, <u>ask for a preliminary investigation</u> with the same right to adduce evidence in his defense as provided in this Rule. (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>A preliminary investigation is required before the filing of a complaint or information for an offense where the penalty prescribed by law is at least four years, two months and one day without regard to fine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; As an exception, the rules provide that there is no need for a preliminary investigation in cases of a lawful arrest without a warrant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> involving such type of offense, so long as an inquest, where available, has been conducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Inquest is defined as an informal and summary investigation conducted by a public prosecutor in criminal cases involving persons arrested and detained without the benefit of a warrant of arrest issued by the court for the purpose of determining whether said persons should remain under custody and correspondingly be charged in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>It is imperative to first take a closer look at the predicament of both the arrested person and the private complainant during the brief period of inquest, to grasp the respective remedies available to them before and after the filing of a complaint or information in court.<br><br>BEFORE THE FILING OF COMPLAINT OR INFORMATION IN COURT, the private complainant may proceed in coordinating with the arresting officer and the inquest officer during the latter's conduct of inquest.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the arrested person has the option to avail of a 15-day preliminary investigation, provided he duly signs a waiver of any objection against delay in his delivery to the proper judicial authorities under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, this remedy is not available to the private complainant since he cannot waive what he does not have.&nbsp; The benefit of the provisions of Article 125, which requires the filing of a complaint or information with the proper judicial authorities within the applicable period,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> belongs to the arrested person.<br><br>The accelerated process of inquest, owing to its summary nature and the attendant risk of running against Article 125, ends with either the prompt filing of an information in court or the immediate release of the arrested person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Notably, the rules on inquest do not provide for a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioner's position that private complainant should have appealed to the DOJ Secretary, such remedy is not immediately available in cases subject of inquest.<br><br>Noteworthy is the proviso that the appeal to the DOJ Secretary is by "petition by a <u>proper party under such rules</u> as the Department of Justice may prescribe."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The rule referred to is the 2000 National Prosecution Service Rule on Appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Section 1 of which provides that the Rule shall "apply to appeals from resolutions x x x in <u>cases subject of preliminary investigation/ reinvestigation</u>."&nbsp; In cases subject of inquest, therefore, the private party should first avail of a preliminary investigation or reinvestigation, if any, before elevating the matter to the DOJ Secretary.<br><br>In case the inquest proceedings yield no probable cause, the private complainant may pursue the case through the regular course of a preliminary investigation.<br><br>ONCE A COMPLAINT OR INFORMATION IS FILED IN COURT, the rules yet provide the accused with another opportunity to ask for a preliminary investigation within five days from the time he learns of its filing.&nbsp; The Rules of Court and the New Rules on Inquest are silent, however, on whether the private complainant could invoke, as respondent heirs of the victim did in the present case, a similar right to ask for a reinvestigation.<br><br>The Court holds that the private complainant can move for reinvestigation, subject to and in light of the ensuing disquisition.<br><br>All criminal actions commenced by a complaint or information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; The private complainant in a criminal case is merely a witness and not a party to the case and cannot, <u>by himself</u>, ask for the reinvestigation of the case <i>after </i>the information had been filed in court, the proper party for that being the public prosecutor who has the control of the prosecution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in cases where the private complainant is allowed to intervene by counsel in the criminal action,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and is granted the authority to prosecute,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the private complainant, by counsel and with the conformity of the public prosecutor, can file a motion for reinvestigation.<br><br>In fact, the DOJ instructs that before the arraignment of the accused, trial prosecutors must "examine the Information vis-à-vis the resolution of the investigating prosecutor in order <u>to make the necessary corrections or revisions and to ensure that the information is sufficient in form and substance</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x Since no evidence has been presented at that stage, <u>the error would appear or be discoverable from a review of the records </u>of the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Of course, that fact may be perceived by the trial judge himself but, again, <b>realistically it will be the prosecutor who can initially determine the same</b>. That is why such error need not be manifest or evident, nor is it required that such nuances as offenses includible in the offense charged be taken into account.&nbsp; It necessarily follows, therefore, that <b>the prosecutor can and should institute remedial measures</b>[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The prosecution of crimes appertains to the executive department of the government whose principal power and responsibility is to see that our laws are faithfully executed. A necessary component of this power to execute our laws is the right to prosecute their violators. The right to prosecute vests the prosecutor with a wide range of discretion - the discretion of what and whom to charge, the exercise of which depends on a smorgasbord of factors which are best appreciated by prosecutors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The prosecution's discretion is not boundless or infinite, however.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The standing principle is that once an information is filed in court, any remedial measure such as a reinvestigation must be addressed to the sound discretion of the court. Interestingly, petitioner supports this view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, the Court ruled in one case that:<br><br><blockquote>The rule is now well settled that once a complaint or information is filed in court, any disposition of the case, whether as to its dismissal or the conviction or the acquittal of the accused, rests in the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; Although the prosecutor retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even when the case is already in court, he cannot impose his opinion upon the tribunal.&nbsp; For while it is true that the prosecutor has the quasi-judicial discretion to determine whether or not a criminal case should be filed in court, once the case had already been brought&nbsp; therein&nbsp; any disposition the prosecutor may deem proper thereafter should be addressed to the court for its consideration and approval.<b>&nbsp; </b>The only qualification is that the action of the court must not impair the substantial rights of the accused or the right of the People to due process of law.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In such an instance, <u>before a re-investigation of the case may be conducted by the public prosecutor, the permission or consent of the court must be secured</u>.&nbsp; If after such re-investigation the prosecution finds a cogent basis to withdraw the information or otherwise cause the dismissal of the case, such proposed course of action may be taken but shall likewise be addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>While <i>Abugotal v. Judge Tiro</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> held that to ferret out the truth, a trial is to be preferred to a reinvestigation, the Court therein recognized that a trial court may, <u>where the interest of justice so requires</u>, grant a motion for reinvestigation of a criminal case pending before it.<br><br>Once the trial court grants the prosecution's motion for reinvestigation, the former is deemed to have deferred to the authority of the prosecutorial arm of the Government.Having brought the case back to the drawing board, the prosecution is thus equipped with discretion - wide and far reaching - regarding the disposition thereof,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> subject to the trial court's approval of the resulting proposed course of action.<br><br>Since a reinvestigation may entail a modification of the criminal information as what happened in the present case, the Court's holding is bolstered by the rule on amendment of an information under Section 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court:<br><br><blockquote><b>A complaint or information may be amended, in form or in substance, without leave of court, at any time before the accused enters his plea</b>. After the plea and during the trial, a formal amendment may only be made with leave of court and when it can be done without causing prejudice to the rights of the accused.<br><br>However, any amendment before plea, which downgrades the nature of the offense charged in or excludes any accused from the complaint or information, can be made only upon motion by the prosecutor, with notice to the offended party and with leave of court. The court shall state its reasons in resolving the motion and copies of its order shall be furnished all parties, especially the offended party.<br><br>If it appears at any time before judgment that a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense, the court shall dismiss the original complaint or information upon the filing of a new one charging the proper offense in accordance with section 11, Rule 119, provided the accused would not be placed in double jeopardy.&nbsp; The court may require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the trial. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In fine, before the accused enters a plea, a formal or substantial amendment of the complaint or information may be made without leave of court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; After the entry of a plea, only a formal amendment may be made but with leave of court and only if it does not prejudice the rights of the accused.&nbsp; After arraignment, a substantial amendment is proscribed except if the same is beneficial to the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>It must be clarified though that not all defects in an information are curable by amendment prior to entry of plea.&nbsp; An information which is void <i>ab initio</i> cannot be amended to obviate a ground for quashal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; An amendment which operates to vest jurisdiction upon the trial court is likewise impermissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Considering the general rule that an information may be amended even in substance and even without leave of court at any time before entry of plea, does it mean that the conduct of a reinvestigation at that stage is a mere superfluity?<br><br>It is not.<br><br>Any remedial measure springing from the reinvestigation - be it a complete disposition or an intermediate modification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the charge - is eventually addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, which must make an independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case.&nbsp; Since the trial court would ultimately make the determination on the proposed course of action, it is for the prosecution to consider whether a reinvestigation is necessary to adduce and review the evidence for purposes of buttressing the appropriate motion to be filed in court.<br><br>More importantly, reinvestigation is required in cases involving a substantial amendment of the information.&nbsp; Due process of law demands that no substantial amendment of an information may be admitted without conducting another or a new preliminary investigation.&nbsp; In <i>Matalam v. The 2nd Division of the Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court ruled that a substantial amendment in an information entitles an accused to another preliminary investigation, unless the amended information contains a charge related to or is included in the original Information.<br><br>The question to be resolved is whether the amendment of the Information from homicide to murder is considered a substantial amendment, which would make it not just a right but a duty of the prosecution to ask for a preliminary investigation.<br><br>The Court answers in the affirmative.<br><br><blockquote><b>A substantial amendment consists of the recital of facts constituting the offense charged and determinative of the jurisdiction of the court.&nbsp; </b>All other matters are merely of form. The following have been held to be mere <b>formal amendments</b>: (1) new allegations which <u>relate only to the range of the penalty</u> that the court might impose in the event of conviction; (2) an amendment which <u>does not charge another offense different or distinct</u> from that charged in the original one; (3) additional allegations which <u>do not alter the prosecution's theory of the case so as to cause surprise to the accused and affect the form of defense</u> he has or will assume; (4) an amendment which <u>does not adversely affect any substantial right of the accused</u>; and (5) an amendment that merely <u>adds specifications to eliminate vagueness in the information and not to introduce new and material facts</u>, and merely states with additional precision something which is already contained in the original information and which adds nothing essential for conviction for the crime charged.<br><br>The test as to whether a defendant is prejudiced by the amendment is whether a defense under the information as it originally stood would be available after the amendment is made, and <u>whether any evidence defendant might have would be equally applicable to the information in the one form as in the other</u>.&nbsp; An amendment to an information which does not change the nature of the crime alleged therein does not affect the essence of the offense or cause surprise or deprive the accused of an opportunity to meet the new averment had each been held to be one of form and not of substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><i>Matalam </i>adds that the mere fact that the two charges are related does not necessarily or automatically deprive the accused of his right to another preliminary investigation.&nbsp; <i>Notatu dignum</i> is the fact that both the original Information and the amended Information in <i>Matalam</i> were similarly charging the accused with violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>In one case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> it was squarely held that the amendment of the Information from homicide to murder is "one of substance with very serious consequences."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The amendment involved in the present case consists of additional averments of the circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation, and cruelty, which qualify the offense charged from homicide to murder. It being a new and material element of the offense, petitioner should be given the chance to adduce evidence on the matter.&nbsp; Not being merely clarificatory, the amendment essentially varies the prosecution's original theory of the case and certainly affects not just the form but the weight of defense to be mustered by petitioner.<br><br>The Court distinguishes the factual milieus in <i>Buhat v. CA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and <i>Pacoy v.
