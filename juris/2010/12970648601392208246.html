Moreover, Marina's plant manager, Rebecca Maronilla, testified that the juice compounds could not be taken in their raw form because they are highly concentrated and must be mixed with other additives before they could be marketed as Sunquick juice products.&nbsp; If taken in their unprocessed form, the concentrates without the mixed additives would produce a sour taste.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In other words, the concentrates, to be consumable, must have to lose their original character. To quote the CTA Second Division:<br><br><blockquote>Verily, to fall under the assailed Tariff Harmonized System Headings, petitioner's (herein respondent) articles of importation, as fruit juices/mixtures, should not have lost its original character, in spite of the addition of certain "standardizing agents/constituents."&nbsp; Contrary thereto, We find the subject importations categorized as "non-alcoholic composite concentrates" to have apparently lost their original character due to the addition of ingredients in such quantity that the concentrated fruit juice mixture only comprises a small percentage of the entire compound.<br><br><i>This was clearly explained by the VCRC in its subsequent Resolution/Decision ("1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement") issued on February 17, 2005 pertaining to subsequent similar importations of petitioner, effectively correcting its findings in the assailed Resolution/Decision dated November 13, 2003 concerning the same party-importer, issues and articles of importation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to wit:<br><br>SUB-GROUP OBSERVATIONS/FINDINGS:<br><br><blockquote>The classification issue was divided into two regimes.&nbsp; The era under the old Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, while the other is the latest revised edition, the Asean Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature.<br><br>The previous committee resolution was promulgated technically not on the merit of the case but failure on the part of the importer to submit their position paper/arguments within the prescriptive period given by the committee.<br><br>Importer submitted samples of subject shipment for laboratory analysis to Philippine Customs laboratory to validate the veracity of product information given by the supplier and to determine the correct tariff classification.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Xxx xxx xxx<br></div><br>Based on the report of the Laboratory Analysis, compound is made up to water 57.9%, Invert Sugar 34.34%, Citric Acid 2.94%, Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) 105 mg.<br><br>Since the item is compound which is composed of water, sugar, concentrated juice, flavourings, citric acid, stabilizer, preservatives, vitamins C and colouring to produce beverage ready to drink.&nbsp; <b><i>Consequently the concentrated citrus juice has lost its original character due to the fact that it comprises only 12% of the total compound</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Items (fruit juices) classifiable under HS 2009 are fruit juices generally obtained by pressing fresh, healthy and ripe fruit.&nbsp; Per item 4 of the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System apparently subject article has lost its original character as concentrated fruit juice drink to the compounding ingredients which reduces the fruit juices to 12% of the total compound.<br><br>In view of the foregoing subject article is classifiable under Tariff Heading H.S. 2106.90 10 at 1% for entries filed under the old regime.

Marina, as the manufacturing arm of CO-RO Food A/S of Denmark, transforms said juice compounds, being raw materials, into a substance suitable for human consumption.&nbsp; This is evident from the "Commissioner's Report"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of Executive Clerk of Court II, CTA, Jesus P. Inocando, Jr., who conducted an ocular inspection of Marina's manufacturing plant in Taguig City.&nbsp; Pertinent excerpts of the "Commissioner's Report" are herein reproduced:<br><br><blockquote>On our ocular inspection of the manufacturing plant of petitioner, Ms. Solidum and Mr. Domingo showed us the sample of the imported compounds (raw materials), showed to us the step by step manufacturing process of petitioner and even showed us the bottling and packaging of the finished product.<br><br>Per observation of the undersigned, the imported compounds (raw materials) are very sticky, the plant is clean and that the personnel of petitioner in the plant strictly following the manufacturing process as presented in Annex A and Annex B of this report.<br><br>Upon questioning by the counsel for respondent, Mr. Domingo said that while the imported compounds (raw materials) can be mixed with water and may be drinkable, he is not sure if the same is suitable for human consumption.&nbsp; None of us dared to taste the sample of imported compounds (raw materials) diluted in water.&nbsp; The imported compounds (raw materials) mixed with water produces bubbles on top of the mixture, not like the one that has gone through the manufacturing process.&nbsp; Counsel for respondent requested for the marking of Label of Sunquick Lemon (840 ml.), [Annex C], as Exhibit 1 for the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>Contrary to the Commissioner's assertions, empirical evidence shows that the subject importations would have to undergo a laborious method, as shown by its manufacturing flowchart<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and manufacturing process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> to achieve their marketable juice consistency.
