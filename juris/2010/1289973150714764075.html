Therefore, the CTA First Division did not consider Hitachi's export sales invoices as valid evidence of zero-rated sales of goods for VAT purposes and, consequently, denied Hitachi's claim for a refund or tax credit.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the CTA<i> En Banc</i></b><br></center></u><br>The CTA <i>En Banc</i> affirmed the findings of the CTA First Division that Hitachi failed to comply with the mandatory invoicing requirements under the NIRC and RR 7-95.&nbsp; The CTA <i>En Banc</i> agreed with the CTA First Division that Hitachi failed to substantiate its alleged zero-rated sales because its export sales invoices were not duly registered with the BIR. Neither did the export sales invoices indicate Hitachi's TIN nor did they state that Hitachi was a VAT registered person.&nbsp; Likewise, the word "zero-rated" was not imprinted on Hitachi's export sales invoices.&nbsp; According to the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, the VAT law is clear that only transactions evidenced by VAT official receipts or sales invoices will be considered as VAT transactions for purposes of the input and output tax.<br><br><u><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center></u><br>Hitachi raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> Whether Hitachi's failure to comply with the requirements prescribed under Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95 is sufficient to invalidate Hitachi's claim for VAT refund for taxable year 1999;<br><br></li><li>Whether Hitachi has sufficiently complied with the requirements for its claim for VAT refund for taxable year 1999; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred when it denied Hitachi's claim for VAT refund for taxable year 1999.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center></u><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>Hitachi argues that Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95 cannot expand the invoicing requirements prescribed by Section 113(A) of the NIRC, in relation to Sections 237 and 106(A)(2)(a)(1),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> by imposing the additional requirement of printing the word "zero-rated" on the invoices of a VAT registered taxpayer. Hitachi also submits that the non-observance of the requirements of (1) printing "zero-rated;" (2) BIR authority to print; (3) BIR permit number; and (4) registration of such receipts with the BIR cannot result in the outright invalidation of its claim for refund.<br><br>We already settled the issue of printing the word "zero-rated" on the sales invoices&nbsp; in <i>Panasonic v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; In that case, we denied Panasonic's claim for refund of the VAT it paid as a zero-rated taxpayer on the ground that its sales invoices did not state on their face that its sales were "zero-rated."&nbsp; We said:<br><br><blockquote>But when petitioner Panasonic made the export sales subject of this case, <i>i.e.</i>, from April 1998 to March 1999, the rule that applied was Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95, otherwise known as the Consolidated Value-Added Tax Regulations, which the Secretary of Finance issued on December 9, 1995 and took effect on January 1, 1996.&nbsp; <b>It already required the printing of the word "zero-rated" on invoices covering zero-rated sales.</b>&nbsp; When R.A. 9337 amended the 1997 NIRC on November 1, 2005, it made this particular revenue regulation a part of the tax code.&nbsp; This conversion from regulation to law did not diminish the binding force of such regulation with respect to acts committed prior to the enactment of that law.<br><br>Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95 proceeds from the rule-making authority granted to the Secretary of Finance under Section 245 of the 1997 NIRC (Presidential Decree 1158) for the efficient enforcement of the tax code and of course its amendments.&nbsp; The requirement is reasonable and is in accord with the efficient collection of VAT from the covered sales of goods and services.&nbsp; As aptly explained by the CTA's First Division, the appearance of the word "zero-rated" on the face of the invoices covering zero-rated sales prevents buyers from falsely claiming input VAT from their purchases when no VAT was actually paid.&nbsp; If absent such word, a successful claim for input VAT is made, the government would be refunding money it did not collect. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Likewise, in this case, when Hitachi filed its claim for refund or tax credit, RR 7-95 was already in force.&nbsp; Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95 specifically required the following to be reflected in the invoice:<br><br><blockquote>Sec.4.108-1. Invoicing Requirements. - All VAT-registered persons shall, for every sale or lease of goods or properties or services, <b>issue duly registered receipts or sales or commercial invoices which must show</b>:<br><br><ol><li><b> the</b> name, <b>TIN</b> and address <b>of seller</b>;<br></li><li>date of transaction;<br></li><li>quantity, unit cost and description of merchandise or nature of service;<br></li><li>the name, TIN, business style, if any, and address of the VAT-registered purchaser, customer or client;<br></li><li><b>the word "zero-rated" imprinted on the invoice covering zero-rated sales</b>; and<br></li><li>the invoice value or consideration.</li></ol><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Only VAT-registered persons are required to print their TIN followed by the word "VAT" in their invoices or receipts and this shall be considered as a "VAT invoice."</b>&nbsp; <b>All purchases covered by invoices other than a "VAT invoice" shall not give rise to any input tax</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Both the CTA First Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i> found that Hitachi's export sales invoices did not indicate Hitachi's Tax Identification Number (TIN) followed by the word VAT. The word "zero-rated" was also not imprinted on the invoices.&nbsp; Moreover, both the CTA First Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i> found that the invoices were not duly registered with the BIR.<br><br>Being a specialized court, the CTA has necessarily developed an expertise in the subject of taxation that this Court has recognized time and again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; For this reason, the findings of fact of the CTA are generally conclusive on this Court absent grave abuse of discretion or palpable error, which are not present in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Besides, tax refunds, like tax exemptions, are construed strictly against the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The claimants have the burden of proof to establish the factual basis of their claim for refund or tax credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, Hitachi failed to establish the factual basis of its claim for refund or tax credit.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.&nbsp; We <b>AFFIRM</b> the 22 March 2006 Decision and the 14 August 2006 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals <i>En Banc</i> in CTA EB No. 54.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Leonardo-De Castro,</span><sup style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</span></sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Peralta, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>&nbsp; Designated additional member per Raffle dated 28 June 2010.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> Designated additional member per Special Order No. 905 dated 5 October 2010.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 332-357.&nbsp; Penned by Associate Justice Juanito C.
