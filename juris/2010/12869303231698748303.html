Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, to attend a dance held in connection with the feast day celebration thereat.&nbsp; The dancing place, which was more or less ten (10) meters long and eight (8) meters wide, was enclosed by bamboo fence and properly equipped with long benches.&nbsp; It was well-lighted by the fluorescent lights surrounding it and an oscillating light located at the center thereof.&nbsp; While sitting on the bench inside the dancing place, near the front gate thereof, Elmer saw appellant and Jimmy outside holding flashlights and focusing the same toward the people inside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>At around 11:00 p.m., Jimmy entered the dancing place and approached the person sitting beside Elmer. The latter overheard Jimmy telling the person beside him to go out and look for their companions.&nbsp; Not long after, Jimmy went out of the dancing place and it was the last time Elmer saw him on that particular day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Then, at around 12:00 midnight, which was already 15 April 1999, Elmer spotted appellant, who was wearing <i>maong</i> pants and <i>maong</i> jacket with a belt bag tied around his waist, entered the dancing place and walked towards the people who were dancing. At that time, Jimmy was no longer there. Elmer, who was only more or less three (3) meters away from the appellant, saw the latter get a rounded object from his belt bag, which he believed to be a hand grenade as he has previously seen one from military men when he was in Manila.&nbsp; Later, appellant pulled something from that rounded object, rolled it to the ground towards the center of the dancing place where the people were dancing, and left immediately.&nbsp; Five seconds thereafter, the rounded object exploded.&nbsp; At that moment, appellant was already one-half meter away from the gate of the dancing place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The lights went off, people scampered away, and many died and were seriously injured as a result of the said explosion.&nbsp; Elmer went out of the dancing place, together with the crowd, through the destroyed bamboo fence.&nbsp; Realizing his brothers and sisters might still be inside the dancing place, Elmer went back, together with the people carrying flashlights and torches, to look for his siblings.&nbsp; There he saw the lifeless body of his brother, Nicanor Oloroso (Nicanor).&nbsp; His other brother, Luis Oloroso (Luis), on the other hand, was seriously injured.&nbsp; Elmer's two other siblings, Jenny and Edwin, both surnamed Oloroso, was slightly injured.&nbsp; Elmer immediately brought Luis at Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital (BRTTH), Albay Provincial Hospital, where the latter was confined for almost three months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The second prosecution witness, Antonio Barcelona (Antonio), corroborated Elmer's testimony on material points.&nbsp; Antonio first met appellant on 20 March 1999 as the latter's brother, Rafael Barde (Rafael), invited him to their house to attend a dance in Mancao, Rapu-Rapu, Albay.&nbsp; There they had a little conversation and appellant told Antonio that he would not enter any dancing place without creating any trouble.&nbsp; On 14 April 1999 at around 9:30 p.m., Antonio again met appellant at the dancing place at <i>Sitio</i> Sto. Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay.&nbsp; While Antonio was inside the dancing place, appellant saw him and summoned him to go out. Then, Antonio and appellant, who was then with his brothers, Jimmy and Joel, both surnamed Barde, conversed about their work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Suddenly, appellant uttered, "<i>Diyan lang kamo, dai kamo maghale sa Tokawan na iyan, to kong may ribok man, yaon kami sa likod lang</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant told Antonio that he would just be behind him and his companions because there might be a trouble.&nbsp; Thereafter, Antonio went inside the dancing place. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>At about 11:30 p.m., the dance was declared open to all.&nbsp; At this juncture, appellant and his two brothers went inside the dancing place. Jimmy then approached Antonio. Then, at around 12:30 a.m. of 15 April 1999, Antonio noticed appellant walking slowly towards the crowd inside the dancing place with his hands partly hidden inside his <i>maong</i> jacket with an eagle figure at the back thereof.&nbsp; Suddenly, appellant stopped, looked around, got something from his waist line, rolled it to the ground towards the crowd and hastily left. Antonio confirmed that what was rolled to the ground by appellant was a grenade because after more or less four seconds that thing exploded.&nbsp; Appellant was already in front of the gate of the dancing place when the explosion occurred. Antonio was not injured as he was more or less four (4) meters away from the place where the explosion occurred. Darkness followed after the explosion as the lights went off.&nbsp; People bustled.&nbsp; Many died and were injured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Other prosecution witnesses, Alexander Basallote (Alexander) and Nilda Yasol (Nilda) - the <i>Barangay</i> Captain of Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, also corroborated the testimonies of Elmer and Antonio.<br><br>The prosecution likewise presented Senior Police Officer 2 Hipolito Talagtag (SPO2 Talagtag),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; who was assigned at R-4 Division, Explosive and Ordinance Disposal, Police Regional Office 5 at Camp Simeon Ola, Legazpi City. On 15 April 1999, SPO2 Talagtag received a call from Colonel Delos Santos (Col. Delos Santos), Chief of R-4 Division, Supply of RECOM 5, informing him about the explosion incident happened in a dancing place at <i>Sitio</i> Sto. Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, and asking assistance from them.&nbsp; In response thereto, a team was organized composed of members from the Crime Laboratory, IID Investigators, CIS Investigating Agents and the Explosive Ordinance Team.&nbsp; Thereafter, the team proceeded to the scene of the crime.&nbsp; They reached the place at more or less 11:00 a.m. of 16 April 1999.&nbsp; The team found a crater inside the dancing place that served as their lead in determining the kind of explosive used.&nbsp; In the course of their investigation, they interviewed people living nearby who told them that the explosion was loud.&nbsp; Later, SPO2 Talagtag placed a magnet in the crater inside the dancing place and recovered several shrapnels similar to those that can be found in an M26-A1 fragmentation grenade.&nbsp; By reason thereof, SPO2 Talagtag concluded that the explosion was caused by an M26-A1 fragmentation grenade.&nbsp; Thereafter, the recovered shrapnels were turned over to the crime laboratory at Camp Simeon Ola, Legazpi City, for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Engineer Ma. Julieta Razonable (Engr. Razonable), Police Senior Inspector and Forensic Chemical Officer assigned at Camp Simeon Ola, Legazpi City, received the specimen, <i>i.e.</i>, the shrapnels recovered at the scene of the crime, for physical examination. Her examination yielded positive result, meaning, the specimen submitted to her were part of a hand grenade fragmentation, M26-A1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; This result was subsequently reduced into writing as evidenced by Physical Identification Report No. PI-601-A-99 dated 16 April 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In his defense, appellant vehemently denied the charge against him and offered a different version of the incident.<br><br>Appellant asseverated that at around 7:00 p.m. on 14 April 1999 he was at home in Mancao, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, organizing the plates, spoons, forks and other kitchen utensils that they were about to bring to the house of Teodora Arsenue (Teodora) at <i>Sitio</i> Sto. Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, in connection with the feast day celebration in the said place.&nbsp; Then, at around 7:30 p.m., the appellant, together with his mother Gloria Barde (Gloria) and brothers Jimmy, Joel, Rafael, Jovito, Jr., all surnamed Barde, proceeded to the house of Teodora and reached the same before 9:00 p.m.&nbsp; Teodora offered them food.&nbsp; After eating, they acceded to the suggestion of Jovito, Jr., to go to the dancing place also located at <i>Sitio</i> Sto. Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, only a ten minute-walk away from the house of Teodora.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Upon reaching the dancing place, they stayed outside as they had no tickets. At around 11:30 p.m., through the help of William Gutchal (William),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> appellant and his brothers Joel and Jimmy, both surnamed Barde, were able to enter the dancing place while his mother and other brothers remained outside.&nbsp; They immediately proceeded to the left side of the dancing place near the baffles of the sound system and stood behind the benches as the same were already occupied. The three of them remained in that place until the explosion occurred inside the dancing place, which was more or less twenty-five (25) meters away from them.&nbsp; The people dancing in the area of the explosion died and some were injured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Appellant claimed that he had no idea how the explosion started because at that time he and his brother Jimmy were talking to Roger Springael (Roger), who was standing outside the bamboo fence surrounding the dancing place, as the latter was interested in buying a fighting cock from him.&nbsp; His other brother, Joel, was also with them, but he was sleeping. In the course of their conversation, he suddenly heard an explosion.&nbsp; All lights went off and there was a total blackout inside the dancing place.&nbsp; People were then pushing each other in order to get out.&nbsp; Appellant was able to go out and run towards a lighted place nearby. When the people carrying torches came, appellant went back to the dancing place to look for his mother and brothers.&nbsp; It was already 2:00 a.m. of 15 April 1999, when he saw his mother and brothers.&nbsp; They went home afterwards.&nbsp; When they reached their house, appellant and his father went to the house of his injured cousin to inform the latter's family of what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The following day, or on 16 April 1999, appellant and Jimmy were invited by Police Officer, Efren Cardeño (Cardeño), at Camp Simeon Ola, Legazpi City, to be utilized as witnesses to the explosion incident happened on 15 April 1999. They refused the invitation as they did not actually witness the explosion.&nbsp; But, Cardeño insisted.&nbsp; On 17 April 1999, appellant and Jimmy went with Cardeño at Camp Simeon Ola, Legazpi City.&nbsp; Thereafter, they did not see Cardeño anymore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>While appellant was at Camp Simeon Ola, Legazpi City, he was brought in one of the offices there and was told to be a witness to the explosion incident happened at <i>Sitio</i> Sto. Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the investigator showed him a typewritten document and was ordered to sign the same but, he refused because he did not understand its contents. Appellant maintained that he was even promised money and work should he sign it and testify but, once again, he refused.&nbsp; Due to his incessant refusal, he was ordered to go out.&nbsp; There he saw Jimmy who told him that he was also made to sign a certain document but, he also refused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Between 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. of 17 April 1999, appellant and Jimmy were awakened but the latter continued sleeping.&nbsp; As such, it was only appellant who was brought in another room and was made to drink wine by persons in civilian clothes. When appellant declined, he was then accused as the person responsible for the explosion incident.&nbsp; Appellant, however, strongly denied the accusation. At this instance, appellant was kicked and boxed and was ordered to admit the accusation but he refused to admit it.&nbsp; Appellant was subsequently brought inside a detention cell.&nbsp; When he met Jimmy, the latter told him that he was also tortured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The next day, or on 18 April 1999, appellant and Jimmy were brought at the office of a certain General Navarro and they were ordered to stand up with more than 30 people. Later, Antonio arrived.&nbsp; Appellant avowed that a certain person in civilian clothes instructed Antonio to point at them as the perpetrators of the explosion incident, which Antonio did.&nbsp; When they were pinpointed as the authors of the crime, they neither reacted nor denied the accusations.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellant and Jimmy were brought back inside their detention cell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Appellant similarly denied having met Antonio on 20 March 1999 at a dance in Mancao, Rapu-Rapu, Albay.&nbsp; Appellant likewise denied having told Antonio that whenever he enters a dance hall he would always create trouble.&nbsp; Appellant maintained that he saw Antonio for the first time when the latter pinpointed him and Jimmy at the office of a certain General Navarro. The second time was when Antonio testified in court.&nbsp; Appellant, however, confirmed that Elmer is his first cousin and he did not know any reason why he would accuse him with such a grave offense. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Other defense witnesses, Roger, Jimmy and Gloria corroborated appellant's testimony.<br><br>Wilfredo Echague (Wilfredo), a radio broadcaster at Radio <i>Filipino</i>, <i>DWRL</i>, since 19 February 1991, testified that on 11 August 2001 while conducting series of interviews in relation to the explosion incident that happened on 15 April 1999 at <i>Sitio</i> Sto.

These inconsistent statements of Elmer allegedly created doubts as to what actually transpired and who the real culprit was.&nbsp; Appellant then claims that there is a possibility that Elmer is a rehearsed witness as such inconsistencies relate to material points.<br><br>Appellant's contentions are not well-founded, thus, his conviction must stand.<br><br>Primarily, it has been jurisprudentially acknowledged that when the issues revolve on matters of credibility of witnesses, the findings of fact of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses, and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect.&nbsp; This is because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses and is in the best position to discern whether they are telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, it is notable that the Court of Appeals affirmed the factual findings of the trial court, according credence and great weight to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; Settled is the rule that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> unless the trial court had overlooked, disregarded, misunderstood, or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and significance which if considered would have altered the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; None of these circumstances is attendant in this case. This Court, thus, finds no cogent reason to deviate from the factual findings arrived at by the trial court as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Prosecution witnesses, Elmer and Antonio, actually witnessed the explosion incident.&nbsp; Both of them narrated in detail the events that transpired prior, during and after the explosion.&nbsp; They had a vivid recollection of how appellant entered the dancing place, walked towards the people who were dancing, got a rounded object from the belt bag tied on his waist, pulled something from it, rolled it to the ground towards the people who were dancing and left the place rapidly.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, the explosion occurred.&nbsp; The trial court characterized their testimonies as candid, spontaneous and straightforward that despite rigid cross-examination their testimonies on who and how the crime was committed remained unshaken and undisturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>With certainty, these prosecution witnesses positively identified appellant as the person who rolled a rounded object, which was later confirmed as an M26-A1 fragmentation grenade, towards the people who were dancing, the explosion killing and causing injuries to many.&nbsp; The identity of appellant was clear to the prosecution witnesses because the dancing place where the explosion occurred was well lighted.&nbsp; Besides, Elmer and Antonio knew the appellant well. Elmer is appellant's first cousin.&nbsp; Antonio met appellant prior to the explosion incident at a dance in Mancao, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, where they engaged in some conversations.&nbsp; Given these circumstances, the prosecution witnesses could not have been mistaken as to appellant's identity.<br><br>The records were also wanting in evidence that would show that these witnesses were impelled by improper motive to impute such a grave offense against the appellant.&nbsp; Even appellant himself admitted that he did not know any reason why Elmer would accuse him with such an offense with pernicious consequences on his life and liberty, considering the fact that they are relatives.<br><br>It bears stressing that Elmer's brother, Nicanor, died, his other brother, Luis, was seriously injured and almost died and his two other siblings were also injured because of the explosion.&nbsp; Elmer had more than enough reason to identify the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, his relationship to the victims cannot be taken against him and it does not automatically impair his credibility and render his testimony less worthy of credence since that no improper motive can be ascribed to him for testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; It would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in seeking justice for the victims to testify against an innocent person and allow the guilty one to go unpunished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Rather, his inherent desire to bring to justice those whom he personally knew committed a crime against his close relative makes his identification of the appellant all the more credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In comparison with the clear and straightforward testimony of prosecution witnesses, all that appellant could muster is the defense of denial and <i>alibi</i>.&nbsp; It is well-entrenched that <i>alibi</i> and denial are inherently weak and have always been viewed with disfavor by the courts due to the facility with which they can be concocted.&nbsp; They warrant the least credibility or none at all and cannot prevail over the positive identification of the appellant by the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; For <i>alibi</i> to prosper, it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the crime was committed; he must also demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.&nbsp; Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Denial, like <i>alibi</i>, as an exonerating justification is inherently weak and if uncorroborated regresses to blatant impotence. Like <i>alibi</i>, it also constitutes self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In this case, appellant himself and all his witnesses admitted that appellant was at the scene of the crime until the explosion occurred.&nbsp; With that, the defense ultimately failed to meet the necessary requisites for the proper invocation of <i>alibi</i> as a defense.<br><br>Appellant's defense of denial cannot also be given any considerable weight as it was unsubstantiated.&nbsp; The testimony of Violeta pointing at Eddie as the real culprit is intended to bolster appellant's defense of denial.&nbsp; However, it cannot be given credence.&nbsp; Her testimony was given only after more than two years from the time the incident happened, and she failed to offer any convincing evidence to justify such delay. Records do not show that there was any threat on Violeta's life that might have prevented from coming out to testify.&nbsp; She herself admitted that after the explosion incident she did not see Eddie anymore. Eddie then could not have possibly threatened her.&nbsp; She could freely testify on what she knew about the explosion incident had she wanted to. Her alleged fear is unfounded.&nbsp; It cannot justify her long delay in disclosing it before the court <i>a quo</i>. Moreover, if she was, indeed, afraid, she would not have allowed herself to be interviewed by a radio broadcaster and would not have divulged to him all that she knew about the incident. Instead of directly disclosing it to the proper authorities, she had chosen to tell it first to a radio broadcaster. Further, the only reason she gave the court for her silence of more than two years was that she began to be bothered by her conscience as she recently kept on dreaming of those who died in the explosion incident especially during "All Souls Day."&nbsp; Violeta, in other words, cannot rely on the doctrine that delay of witnesses in revealing what they know about a crime is attributable to their natural reticence against involvement therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>More telling is Violeta's categorical admission that Eddie was outside the dancing place and it was appellant whom she saw inside the dancing place prior to the explosion incident.&nbsp; With this testimony, Violeta made appellant's defense of denial even weaker.<br><br>In light of the categorical and positive identification of the appellant by prosecution witnesses, without any showing of ill-motive on the part of the latter testifying on the matter, appellant's defense of bare denial and <i>alibi</i> cannot prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>As regards the alleged inconsistencies on Elmer's narration of events, this Court considers the same trivial, inconsequential and do not affect the credibility of the statement that it was appellant who rolled the hand grenade towards the people dancing inside the dancing place, the explosion killing and injuring scores of victims.&nbsp; Furthermore, the alleged inconsistencies pointed to by appellant have been properly clarified in the course of Elmer's testimony.&nbsp; As the Court of Appeals stated in its Decision, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Records reveal that during the direct examination, Elmer testified that immediately after the [appellant] rolled the grenade, he went out and when he was about to reach the gate the grenade exploded, while on cross-examination, Elmer testified that he saw [appellant] leave the [dancing place] after the explosion.&nbsp; However, when the trial court and [appellant's counsel] asked him about the inconsistency, Elmer clarified and confirmed that [appellant] left the dance place before the explosion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses which refer to minor and insignificant details do not destroy their credibility.&nbsp; They, instead, manifest truthfulness and candor and erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>All told, this Court affirms the findings of the trial court and the appellate court that, indeed, appellant was the author of the explosion incident that happened on 15 April 1999 inside the dancing place at <i>Sitio</i> Sto. Niño, Liguan, Rapu-Rapu, Albay, which took away the lives and caused injuries to the people thereat.<br><br><i>As to the crime committed</i>.&nbsp; The trial court and the appellate court convicted appellant of the complex crime of multiple murder with multiple frustrated murder.&nbsp; <b>This Court believes, however, that appellant should only be convicted of the complex crime of multiple murder with double attempted murder</b>.<br><br>Appellant's act of detonating a hand grenade, particularly an M26-A1 fragmentation grenade, inside the dancing place at <i>Sitio</i> Sto.

Time and again, this Court, in a <i>plethora</i> of cases, has consistently held that there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof, which tend directly and specially to ensure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense that the offended party might make.&nbsp; There are two (2) conditions that must concur for treachery to exist, to wit: (a) the employment of means of execution gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (b) the means or method of execution was deliberately and consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; "The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>As elucidated by the trial court in its Decision:<br><br><blockquote>The victims were completely unaware of the danger forthcoming to them as they were in the midst of enjoying a dance.&nbsp; The [appellant] who caused the rolling of the hand grenade was at a complete advantage knowing that no risk to his life was involved as he can immediately fled [and] run away from the scene of the crime before any explosion could occur.&nbsp; There was no defense so to speak of that may came from the victims because they were completely unaware of the danger about to happen in their midst resulting as it did to deaths and injuries to many people among the crowd dancing.&nbsp; The act of rolling the hand grenade is unpardonable.&nbsp; It is a treacherous heinous act of the highest order.&nbsp; The victims can do nothing but to cry to high heavens for vengeance.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As supported by the evidence adduced at the trial, [it] is fully convinced that the crime charge was committed under a cloak of treachery, and there is no doubt about it.&nbsp; The attacker suddenly came armed with a live fragmentation grenade, removed its pin and threw it towards the crowd who were enjoying a dance, unsuspecting of any danger that larks in their midst, thereby depriving them of any real opportunity to defend themselves.&nbsp; The attacker has employed a swift and unexpected attack to insure its execution without risk to himself x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></blockquote><br>As the killing, in this case, is perpetrated with both treachery and by means of explosives, the latter shall be considered as a qualifying circumstance since it is the principal mode of attack.&nbsp; Reason dictates that this attendant circumstance should qualify the offense while treachery will be considered merely as a generic aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The Information also alleged that evident premeditation attended the commission of the crime.&nbsp; For evident premeditation to be appreciated, the prosecution must prove the following elements:&nbsp; (1) the time when the accused decided to commit the crime; (2) an overt act showing that the accused clung to their determination to commit the crime; and (3) the lapse of a period of time between the decision and the execution of the crime sufficient to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; However, none of these elements could be gathered from the evidence on record.<br><br>Appellant's act of detonating a hand grenade, particularly M26-A1 fragmentation grenade, inside the dancing place at<i> Sitio</i> Sto.
