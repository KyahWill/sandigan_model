The Executive Secretary</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> summarized the rule on <i>locus standi</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>Locus standi </i>or legal standing has been defined as a personal and substantial interest in a case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged. The gist of the question on standing is whether a party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<br><br>[A] party who assails the constitutionality of a statute must have <b><u>a direct and personal interest</u></b>. It must show not only that the law or any governmental act is invalid, but also that <b><u>it sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement</u></b>, and not merely that it suffers thereby in some indefinite way. It must show that it has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which it is lawfully entitled or that it is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute or act complained of.<br><br>For a concerned party to be allowed to raise a constitutional question, it must show that (1) it has <b><u>personally suffered some actual or threatened injury</u></b> as a result of the allegedly illegal conduct of the government, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable action. (emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>Petitioner-organizations assert <i>locus standi</i> on the basis of being suspected "communist fronts" by the government, especially the military; whereas individual petitioners invariably invoke the "transcendental importance" doctrine and their status as citizens and taxpayers.<br><br>While <i>Chavez v. PCGG</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> holds that transcendental public importance dispenses with the requirement that petitioner has experienced or is in actual danger of suffering direct and personal injury, cases involving the constitutionality of <i>penal</i> legislation belong to an altogether different genus of constitutional litigation.&nbsp; Compelling State and societal interests in the proscription of harmful conduct, as will later be elucidated, necessitate a closer judicial scrutiny of <i>locus standi.</i><br><br>Petitioners have not presented any <i>personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.&nbsp; </i><b>None of them faces any charge under RA 9372</b>.<br><br><b>KARAPATAN, Hustisya, Desaparecidos, SELDA, EMJP </b>and<b> PCR, </b>petitioners in G.R. No. 178890, allege that they have been subjected to "close security surveillance by state security forces," their members followed by "suspicious persons" and "vehicles with dark windshields," and their offices monitored by "men with military build."&nbsp; They likewise claim that they have been branded as "enemies of the [S]tate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Even conceding such gratuitous allegations, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) correctly points out that petitioners have yet to show any <b><u>connection</u></b><u> <b>between</b></u><b></b> the purported <b><u>"surveillance"</u> and</b> the <b><u>implementation of</u></b><u> <b>RA 9372</b></u><b></b>.<br><br><b> BAYAN, GABRIELA, KMP, MCCCL, COURAGE, KADAMAY, SCW, LFS, Anakbayan, PAMALAKAYA, ACT, Migrante, HEAD</b> and <b>Agham</b>, petitioner-organizations in G.R. No. 178581, would like the Court to take <i>judicial notice</i> of respondents' <i>alleged </i>action of tagging them as militant organizations fronting for the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the National People's Army (NPA).&nbsp; The tagging, according to petitioners, is tantamount to the effects of proscription without following the procedure under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The petition of <b>BAYAN-ST<i>, et al</i></b>. in G.R. No. 179461 pleads the same allegations.<br><br>The Court cannot take judicial notice of the alleged "tagging" of petitioners.<br><br><blockquote>Generally speaking, matters of judicial notice have three material requisites: (1) <b>the matter must be one</b> <b><u>of common and general knowledge</u></b>; (2) <b>it must be <u>well and authoritatively settled</u> and not doubtful or uncertain</b>; and (3) it must be known to be within the limits of the jurisdiction of the court.&nbsp; The principal guide in determining what facts may be assumed to be judicially known is that of notoriety. Hence, it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced by public records and facts of general notoriety. Moreover, a judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to a reasonable dispute in that it is <b>either</b>: (1) <b>generally known</b> within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; <b>or</b> (2) <b>capable of accurate and ready determination</b> by resorting to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questionable.<br><br>Things of "common knowledge," of which courts take judicial matters coming to the knowledge of men generally in the course of the ordinary experiences of life, or they may be matters which are generally accepted by mankind as true and are capable of ready and unquestioned demonstration. Thus, facts which are universally known, and which may be found in encyclopedias, dictionaries or other publications, are judicially noticed, provided, they are of such universal notoriety and so generally understood that they may be regarded as forming part of the common knowledge of every person.&nbsp; As the common knowledge of man ranges far and wide, a wide variety of particular facts have been judicially noticed as being matters of common knowledge.&nbsp; But <b>a court cannot take judicial notice of any fact which, in part, is dependent on the existence or non-existence of a fact of which the court has no constructive knowledge</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>No ground was properly established by petitioners for the taking of judicial notice.&nbsp; Petitioners' apprehension is insufficient to substantiate their plea<i>.&nbsp; </i>That <u>no specific charge</u> or proscription under RA 9372 has been filed against them, three years after its effectivity, <u>belies any claim of imminence</u> of their <i>perceived</i> threat emanating from the so-called tagging.<br><br>The same is true with petitioners <b>KMU, NAFLU </b>and <b>CTUHR </b>in G.R. No. 178554, who merely harp as well on their supposed "link" to the CPP and NPA.&nbsp; They fail to particularize how the implementation of specific provisions of RA 9372 would result in direct injury to their organization and members.<br><br>While in our jurisdiction there is still no judicially declared terrorist organization, the United States of America<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (US) and the European Union<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (EU) have both classified the CPP, NPA and <i>Abu Sayyaf </i>Group as foreign terrorist organizations.&nbsp; The Court takes note of the joint statement of Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita and Justice Secretary Raul Gonzales that the Arroyo Administration would adopt the US and EU classification of the CPP and NPA as terrorist organizations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Such statement notwithstanding,<b> there is yet to be filed before the courts an application to declare the CPP and NPA organizations as domestic terrorist or outlawed organizations under RA 9372</b>. Again, RA 9372 has been in effect for three years now. From July 2007 up to the present, petitioner-organizations have conducted their activities fully and freely without any threat of, much less an actual, prosecution or proscription under RA 9372.<br><br>Parenthetically, the Fourteenth Congress, in a resolution initiated by Party-list Representatives Saturnino Ocampo, Teodoro Casiño, Rafael Mariano and Luzviminda Ilagan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> urged the government to resume peace negotiations with the NDF by removing the impediments thereto, one of which is the adoption of designation of the CPP and NPA by the US and EU as foreign terrorist organizations. Considering the policy statement of the Aquino Administration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of resuming peace talks with the NDF, the government is not imminently disposed to ask for the judicial proscription of the CPP-NPA consortium and its allied organizations.<br><br>More important, there are other parties not before the Court with <b><u>direct and specific interests</u></b> in the questions being raised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Of recent development is the filing of the <b><u>first case</u></b> for proscription under Section 17<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of RA 9372 by the Department of Justice before the Basilan Regional Trial Court against the <i>Abu Sayyaf</i> Group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner-organizations do not in the least allege any link to the <i>Abu Sayyaf</i> Group.<br><br>Some petitioners attempt, in vain though, to show the imminence of a prosecution under RA 9372 by alluding to past rebellion charges against them.<br><br>In <i>Ladlad v. Velasco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court ordered the dismissal of rebellion charges filed in 2006 against then Party-List Representatives Crispin Beltran and Rafael Mariano of Anakpawis, Liza Maza of GABRIELA, and Joel Virador, Teodoro Casiño and Saturnino Ocampo of <i>Bayan Muna</i>. Also named in the dismissed rebellion charges were petitioners Rey Claro Casambre, Carolina Pagaduan-Araullo, Renato Reyes, Rita Baua, Emerencia de Jesus and Danilo Ramos; and accused of being front organizations for the Communist movement were petitioner-organizations KMU, BAYAN, GABRIELA, PAMALAKAYA, KMP, KADAMAY, LFS and COURAGE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The dismissed rebellion charges, however, do not save the day for petitioners.&nbsp; For one, those charges were filed in 2006, prior to the enactment of RA 9372, <u>and dismissed by this Court</u>.&nbsp; For another, rebellion is defined and punished under the Revised Penal Code. Prosecution for rebellion is not made more imminent by the enactment of RA 9372, nor does the enactment thereof make it easier to charge a person with rebellion, its elements not having been altered.<br><br>Conversely, previously filed but dismissed rebellion charges bear no relation to prospective charges under RA 9372.&nbsp; It cannot be overemphasized that three years after the enactment of RA 9372, none of petitioners has been charged.<br><br>Petitioners <b>IBP </b>and <b>CODAL </b>in<b> G.R. No. 179157 </b>base their claim of <i>locus standi</i> on their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.&nbsp; The IBP zeroes in on Section 21 of RA 9372 directing it to render assistance to those arrested or detained under the law.<br><br>The mere invocation of the duty to preserve the rule of law does not, however, suffice to clothe the IBP or any of its members with standing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The IBP failed to sufficiently demonstrate how its mandate under the assailed statute revolts against its constitutional rights and duties.&nbsp; Moreover, both the IBP and CODAL have not pointed to even a single arrest or detention effected under RA 9372.<br><br><b> Former Senator Ma. Ana Consuelo Madrigal</b>, who claims to have been the subject of "political surveillance," also lacks <i>locus standi</i>. Prescinding from the veracity, let alone legal basis, of the claim of "political surveillance," the Court finds that she has not shown even the slightest threat of being charged under RA 9372.&nbsp; Similarly lacking in <i>locus standi</i> are <b>former Senator Wigberto Tañada </b>and <b>Senator Sergio Osmeña III</b>, who cite their being respectively a human rights advocate and an oppositor to the passage of RA 9372.&nbsp; Outside these gratuitous statements, no concrete injury to them has been pinpointed.<br><br>Petitioners <b>Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network </b>and <b>Atty. Soliman Santos Jr.</b> in <b>G.R. No. 178552</b> also conveniently state that the issues they raise are of transcendental importance, "which must be settled early" and are of "far-reaching implications," <u>without mention of any specific provision of RA 9372 under which they have been charged, or may be charged</u>.&nbsp; Mere invocation of human rights advocacy has nowhere been held sufficient to clothe litigants with <i>locus standi</i>.&nbsp; Petitioners must show an actual, or immediate danger of sustaining, direct injury as a result of the law's enforcement. To rule otherwise would be to corrupt the settled doctrine of <i>locus standi</i>, as every worthy cause is an interest shared by the general public.<br><br>Neither can <i>locus standi</i> be conferred upon individual petitioners as <i>taxpayers</i> and <i>citizens</i>.&nbsp; A taxpayer suit is proper only when there is an exercise of the spending or taxing power of Congress,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> whereas citizen standing must rest on direct and personal interest in the proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>RA 9372 is a penal statute and does not even provide for any appropriation from Congress for its implementation, while none of the individual petitioner-citizens has alleged any direct and personal interest in the implementation of the law.<br><br>It bears to stress that generalized interests, albeit accompanied by the assertion of a public right, do not establish <i>locus standi.</i> Evidence of a direct and personal interest is key.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners fail to<br> present an actual <br>case or controversy</i></b><br><br>By constitutional fiat, judicial power operates only when there is an actual case or controversy.<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.

The theory is that "[w]hen statutes regulate or proscribe speech and no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution, the transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression is deemed to justify allowing attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with narrow specificity." The possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that the protected speech of others may be deterred and perceived grievances left to fester because of possible inhibitory effects of overly broad statutes.<br><br><u>This rationale does not apply to penal statutes.&nbsp; Criminal statutes have general <i>in terrorem</i> effect resulting from their very existence, and, if facial challenge is allowed</u> for this reason alone, <u>the State may well be prevented from enacting laws against socially harmful conduct</u>.&nbsp; In the area of criminal law, the law cannot take chances as in the area of free speech.<br><br><b><u>The overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application only to free speech cases</u></b>.&nbsp; They are inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes.&nbsp; As the U.S. Supreme Court put it, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, "we have not recognized an 'overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment."&nbsp; In <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma</i>, the Court ruled that "claims of facial overbreadth have been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate only spoken words" and, again, that "overbreadth claims, if entertained at all, have been curtailed when invoked against ordinary criminal laws that are sought to be applied to protected conduct."&nbsp; For this reason, it has been held that "a facial challenge to a legislative act is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid."&nbsp; As for the vagueness doctrine, it is said that a litigant may challenge a statute on its face only if it is vague in all its possible applications.&nbsp; "A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others."<br><br>In sum, <u>the <b>doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth, and vagueness are analytical tools developed for testing "on their faces" statutes in free speech cases</b></u><b></b><b> or</b>, as they are called in American law, <b>First Amendment cases</b>.&nbsp; They cannot be made to do service <b>when what is involved</b> is a criminal statute.&nbsp; With respect to such statute, the established rule is that "one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional."&nbsp; As has been pointed out, "vagueness challenges in the First Amendment context, like overbreadth challenges typically produce facial invalidation, <b>while <u>statutes found vague</u></b><u> as a matter of due process typically <b>are invalidated [only] 'as applied' to a particular defendant</b></u><b></b><b>."</b>&nbsp; Consequently, there is no basis for petitioner's claim that this Court review the Anti-Plunder Law on its face and in its entirety.<br><br>Indeed, "on its face" invalidation of statutes results in striking them down entirely on the ground that they might be applied to parties not before the Court whose activities are constitutionally protected.&nbsp; It constitutes a departure from the case and controversy requirement of the Constitution and permits decisions to be made without concrete factual settings and in sterile abstract contexts.&nbsp; But, as the U.S. Supreme Court pointed out in <i>Younger v. Harris</i><br><br><blockquote>[T]he task of analyzing a proposed statute, pinpointing its deficiencies, and requiring correction of these deficiencies before the statute is put into effect, is rarely if ever an appropriate task for the judiciary.&nbsp; The combination of the relative remoteness of the controversy, the impact on the legislative process of the relief sought, and above all the speculative and amorphous nature of the required line-by-line analysis of detailed statutes,&nbsp; . . . ordinarily results in a kind of case that is wholly unsatisfactory for deciding constitutional questions, whichever way they might be decided.</blockquote><br>For these reasons, "on its face" invalidation of statutes has been described as "manifestly strong medicine," to be employed "sparingly and only as a last resort," and is generally disfavored.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In determining the constitutionality of a statute, therefore, its provisions which are alleged to have been violated in a case must be examined in the light of the conduct with which the defendant is charged</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>The confusion apparently stems from the interlocking relation of the <i>overbreadth</i> and <i>vagueness</i> doctrines as grounds for a <i>facial</i> or <i>as-applied</i> challenge against a penal statute (under a claim of violation of due process of law) or a speech regulation (under a claim of abridgement of the freedom of speech and cognate rights).<br><br><u><i>To be sure, the doctrine of vagueness and the doctrine of overbreadth do not operate on the same plane.</i></u><br><br>A statute or act suffers from the defect of <u>vagueness</u> when it lacks comprehensible standards that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.&nbsp; It is repugnant to the Constitution in two respects: (1) it violates due process for failure to accord persons, especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of the conduct to avoid; and (2) it leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions and becomes an arbitrary flexing of the Government muscle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The <u>overbreadth</u> doctrine, meanwhile, decrees that a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulations may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>As distinguished from the vagueness doctrine, the overbreadth doctrine assumes that individuals will understand what a statute prohibits and will accordingly refrain from that behavior, even though some of it is protected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><i><u>A "facial" challenge is likewise different from an "as-applied" challenge</u></i>.<br><br>Distinguished from an <b><u>as-applied</u></b> challenge which considers only <u>extant</u> facts affecting real litigants, a <b><u>facial</u></b> invalidation is an examination of the <b><u>entire law</u></b>, pinpointing its flaws and defects, not only on the basis of its actual operation to the parties, but also on the assumption or prediction that its very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Justice Mendoza accurately phrased the subtitle<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> in his concurring opinion that the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines, <i>as grounds for a facial challenge</i>, are not applicable to <b>penal</b> laws. <b>A litigant cannot thus successfully mount a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">facial</span> challenge against a criminal statute on either vagueness or overbreadth grounds.</b><br><br>The allowance of a facial challenge in free speech cases&nbsp; is justified by the aim to avert the "chilling effect" on protected speech, the exercise of which should not at all times be abridged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> As reflected earlier, this rationale is inapplicable to plain penal statutes that generally bear an "<i>in terrorem</i> effect" in deterring socially harmful conduct.

If a facial challenge to a penal statute is permitted, the prosecution of crimes may be hampered.&nbsp; No prosecution would be possible.&nbsp; A strong criticism against employing a facial challenge in the case of penal statutes, if the same is allowed, would effectively go against the grain of the doctrinal requirement of an existing and concrete controversy before judicial power may be appropriately exercised.&nbsp; A facial challenge against a penal statute is, at best, amorphous and speculative.&nbsp; It would, essentially, force the court to consider third parties who are not before it. As I have said in my opposition to the allowance of a facial challenge to attack penal statutes, such a test will impair the State's ability to deal with crime.&nbsp; If warranted, there would be nothing that can hinder an accused from defeating the State's power to prosecute on a mere showing that, as applied to third parties, the penal statute is vague or overbroad, notwithstanding that the law is clear as applied to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>It is settled, on the other hand, that <b>the application of the overbreadth doctrine is limited to a facial kind of challenge and, owing to the given rationale of a facial challenge, applicable only to free speech cases</b>.<br><br>By its nature, the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected speech, inevitably almost always <u>under situations not before the court</u>, that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being substantially overbroad if the court confines itself only to facts as applied to the litigants.<br><br><blockquote>The most distinctive feature of the overbreadth technique is that it marks an exception to some of the usual rules of constitutional litigation.&nbsp; Ordinarily, a particular litigant claims that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him or her; if the litigant prevails, the courts carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law by invalidating its improper applications on a case to case basis.&nbsp; Moreover, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests.&nbsp; <u>In overbreadth analysis, those rules give way; challenges are permitted to raise the rights of third parties; and the court invalidates the entire statute "on its face," not merely "as applied for"</u>; so that the overbroad law becomes unenforceable until a properly authorized court construes it more narrowly.&nbsp; The factor that motivates courts to depart from the normal adjudicatory rules is the concern with the "chilling;" deterrent effect of the overbroad statute on third parties not courageous enough to bring suit.&nbsp; The Court assumes that an overbroad law's "very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression."&nbsp; An overbreadth ruling is designed to remove that deterrent effect on the speech of those third parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis in the original omitted; underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>In restricting the overbreadth doctrine to free speech claims, the Court, in at least two cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> observed that the US Supreme Court has not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and that claims of facial overbreadth have been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate only <u>spoken words</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Virginia v.
