(Order dated September 14, 2004).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Prosecution's Version of Facts</b><br></center><br>On November 9, 2003, at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, a confidential informant arrived at the office of the Station Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Force at the Novaliches Police Station in Quezon City and reported the illegal activities of a person named "Rodante De Leon."<br><br>Thereafter, Police Senior Inspector (P/SInsp.) Nilo Wong formed a team for a buy-bust operation with PO2 Magcalayo as poseur-buyer and Senior Police Officer 3 (SPO3) Mario Concepcion, PO2 Fernando Salonga, PO2 Cesar Collado, PO2 Edmund Paculdar, and PO1 Emeterio Mendoza as team members. A pre-operation report was prepared. P/SInsp. Wong then handed to PO2 Magcalayo two (2) pieces of PhP 100 bills as buy-bust money and on which PO2 Magcalayo wrote his initials "NM."<br><br>At around 6:30 p.m. in the evening, the team proceeded to Sarmiento St., <i>Barangay</i> Sta. Monica, Novaliches, Quezon City, where the confidential informant introduced PO2 Magcalayo to appellant as a buyer of <i>shabu.</i> PO2 Magcalayo then asked appellant if he had <i>shabu</i> and the latter answered in the affirmative and asked him how much he would buy. PO2 Magcalayo handed the money and, in return, appellant handed him one (1) plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance. He then scratched his head, which was the pre-arranged signal that the transaction was consummated, and thereafter arrested appellant. He recovered the buy-bust money from appellant as PO2 Collado approached them and handcuffed appellant. Upon frisking appellant, PO2 Collado discovered another plastic sachet on the person of appellant.<br><br>Afterwards, appellant was brought to the police station for investigation. PO2 Collado then placed his initials on the sachet he found on appellant. The evidence was subsequently turned over to the police investigator, PO1 Estrelles, who prepared a request for its laboratory examination.<br><br>PO2 Collado, PO1 Mendoza, PO2 Paculdar, and PO2 Magcalayo then brought the transparent plastic sachets containing the white crystalline substance subject of the buy-bust operation to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, Eastern Police District on St. Francis Street, Mandaluyong City for examination. Engr. Jabonillo, a Forensic Chemical Officer, conducted a qualitative examination on the specimens, which yielded positive results for Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. He issued Chemistry Report No. D-1240-2003 dated November 9, 2003, which showed the following results:<br><br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>Two (2) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets each containing white crystalline substance having the following markings and recorded net weights:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">A (NM) = 0.16 gm<br>B (CC) = 0.18 gm<br><br>x x x x<br></div><br>PURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">To determine the presence of dangerous drugs.<br><br>x x x x<br></div><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimens gave POSITIVE<b> </b>result to the test for Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. x x x<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Specimen A and B contain Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. x x x<br></blockquote><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></center><br>On the other hand, appellant testified that, prior to his arrest, he was a police officer of Station 7, Araneta, Cubao, Quezon City and had been connected with the PNP for 10 years. On November 9, 2003, at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he went to Sarmiento St., <i>Barangay </i>Sta. Monica, Novaliches, Quezon City to look for a <i>kumpadre </i>from whom he intended to borrow money when policemen accosted him and poked their guns at him. The people around him ran, and as he was the only one left on the scene, the policemen asked him to sit down. He told SPO3 Concepcion, whom he knew, that he was a police officer but he was told to shut up and to explain his side at the police station instead.<br><br>Upon arrival at the police station in Novaliches, Quezon City, his wallet, with his I.D. and police badge, were taken from him. PO2 Magcalayo told him that he had a fake police I.D. When appellant tried to explain himself, PO2 Magcalayo allegedly kicked him saying, "<i>Hindi na uso ang pulis, sundalo na ang nakaupo ngayon</i>."<br><br>The following night, he was presented on inquest during which he was charged with violation of Secs. 5 and 11 of RA 9165. He denied all the charges against him claiming that the alleged <i>shabu</i> marked as Exhibits "B-1" and "B-2" came from the arresting police officers. He did not file a case against them, because he had no money and because he knew that he was not guilty.<br><br>On cross-examination, appellant further testified that he was a follow-up operative at the Station Investigation Division of Police Station 7.  He admitted that he was separated from the service because he was absent without official leave due to a business problem he had to attend to. He likewise said that he did not know his arresting officers, whom he saw then for the first time, and that he was not familiar with RA 9165.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted appellant.

According to him, the trial court erroneously convicted him on the basis of the evidence of the prosecution despite a question of the legality of the buy-bust operation. Further, he asserts that the trial court relied on the disputable presumption of regularity in the performance of the police function, despite the police officers violated the rule on chain of custody of the alleged confiscated items.<br><br>The contentions are unmeritorious.<br><br>It is a fundamental rule that findings of the trial court which are factual in nature and which involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded with respect, when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The reason for this is that the trial court is in a better position to decide the credibility of witnesses having heard their testimonies and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After a thorough examination of the entire records of this case, this Court has failed to identify any error committed by the trial court in its appreciation of the evidence presented before it and in the conclusion it reached.<br><br>In the prosecution for the crime of illegal sale of prohibited drugs, the Court has reiterated the essential elements in <i>People v. Pendatun</i>, to wit: (1) the accused sold and delivered a prohibited drug to another; and (2) he knew that what he had sold and delivered was a prohibited drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Therefore, what is material is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Corpus delicti</i> is the body or substance of the crime, and establishes the fact that a crime has actually been committed. It has two elements, namely: (1) proof of the occurrence of a certain event; and (2) some person's criminal responsibility for the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the prosecution sufficiently established the elements of the crime. Appellant sold and delivered the <i>shabu</i> for PhP 200 to PO2 Magcalayo posing as buyer; the said drug was seized and identified as a prohibited drug and subsequently presented in evidence; there was actual exchange of the marked money and contraband; and finally, appellant was fully aware that he was selling and delivering a prohibited drug. In fact, PO2 Magcalayo testified, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Q:  Mr. Witness, on November 9, 2003, did you report for duty?<br>A:  Yes, sir.<br>Q:  What happened when you reported for duty?<br>A:  Our confidential informant personally appeared in our station and reporting to us the alleged drug pushing activity of Rodante De Leon.<br>Q:  What time was that when this confidential informant arrived at your office?<br>A:  Around 5:00 p.m., sir.<br>Q:  What happened when this confidential informant relayed to you the information about this Rodante De Leon?<br>A:  Our Chief sir, formed a team for possible buy bust operation.<br><br>COURT:<br><br>Who formed?<br>A:  P/Sr. Inspector Nilo Wong, your honor.<br><br>PROS.

The testimony cited above shows clearly that a sale occurred between appellant, as the seller, and PO2 Magcalayo, as the buyer, for PhP 200 worth of <i>shabu</i>. In addition, the said testimony illustrated the seizing of the prohibited drug and the exchange of the marked money. As a matter of fact, the trial court, in disposing of the case, said:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Set against this legal yardstick, the evidence adduced by the prosecution have sufficiently established the elements aforesaid. The prosecution witnesses in the person of PO2 Noel Magcalayo, the one who acted as the poseur buyer in the buy bust operation conducted by his team, described in detail how the operation was commenced with the help of an informant, his introduction to the accused, the ensuing negotiation and consummation of the sale of shabu which ended up in the exchange of the item as well as the buy bust money. Accused was positively identified as the seller thereof and the source of the plastic sachet which contained crystalline substance later on determined after laboratory examination as positive for methylamphetamine, a dangerous drug. Said evidence was presented in court and properly identified as the subject of the buy bust and which was submitted for examination by the Forensic Chemist. All told, all the elements aforementioned are hereby present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote><br>Further, the chain of custody was clearly established by the prosecution. It is elementary that, in every prosecution for the illegal sale of prohibited drugs, the presentation of the drug as evidence in court is material.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It is, therefore, essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. What is more, the fact that the substance bought during the buy-bust operation is the same substance offered in court should be established. The chain of custody requirement performs this function in that it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>To ensure that the chain of custody is established, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 provide:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 21. <b><i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i></b> - The PDEA shall take<b> </b>charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <b><i>Provided</i>, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted</b> <b>at the place where the search warrant is served; or</b> <b>at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures</b>; <b><u><i>Provided, further,</i> that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</u></b> x x x. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>A close examination of the law reveals that it admits of certain exceptions. Thus, contrary to the assertions of appellant, Sec. 21 of the foregoing law need not be followed as an exact science. Non-compliance with Sec. 21 does not render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> What is essential is "the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, there was substantial compliance with the law and the integrity of the drugs seized from appellant was preserved. The chain of custody of the drugs subject matter of the case was shown not to have been broken. The factual milieu of the case reveals that after PO2 Magcalayo seized and confiscated the dangerous drugs, as well as the marked money, appellant was immediately arrested and brought to the police station for investigation, where the sachet of suspected <i>shabu</i> was marked with "NM." Immediately thereafter, the confiscated substance, with a letter of request for examination, was submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination to determine the presence of any dangerous drug. Per Chemistry Report No. D-1240-2003 dated November 9, 2003, the specimen submitted contained methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. The examination was conducted by one Engr. Jabonillo, a Forensic Chemical Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, whose stipulated testimony clearly established the chain of custody of the specimens he received. Thus, it is without a doubt that there was an unbroken chain of custody of the illicit drug purchased from appellant.<br><br>Likewise, the prosecution was able to prove that appellant is guilty of illegal possession of dangerous drugs with moral certainty. In the prosecution for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the following elements must be proved with moral certainty: (1) that the accused is in possession of the object identified as a prohibited or regulatory drug; (2) that such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) that the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Here, appellant was caught in actual possession of the prohibited drugs without showing any proof that he was duly authorized by law to possess them. Having been caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of <i>animus possidendi</i> on appellant's part. As held by this Court, the finding of a dangerous drug in the house or within the premises of the house of the accused is <i>prima facie </i>evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i> and is enough to convict in the absence of a satisfactory explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In the case at bar, appellant failed to present any evidence to rebut his <i>animus possidendi</i> of the <i>shabu</i> found in his pocket during the buy-bust operation.<br><br><center><b>Buy-Bust Operation Was Valid</b><br></center><br>Appellant further argues that the buy-bust operation was full of irregularities, rendering it illegal. He notes that the Pre-Operation Report was full of discrepancies and that the Joint Sworn Affidavit of Apprehension of PO2 Magcalayo and PO2 Collado failed to mention that they placed their markings on the plastic sachets.<br><br>The arguments are specious. Such irregularities cannot overturn the finding of the presence in this case of the elements of violations of Secs. 5 and 11, Art. II of RA 9165.<br><br>A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment whereby ways and means are resorted to for the purpose of trapping and capturing the lawbreakers in the execution of their criminal plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In this jurisdiction, the operation is legal and has been proved to be an effective method of apprehending drug peddlers, provided due regard to constitutional and legal safeguards is undertaken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the evidence clearly shows that the buy-bust operation conducted by the police officers, who made use of entrapment to capture appellant in the act of selling a dangerous drug, was valid and legal. Moreover, the defense has failed to show any evidence of ill motive on the part of the police officers. Even appellant himself declared that it was the first time he met the police officers during his cross-examination. There was, therefore, no motive for the police officers to frame up appellant.<br><br>Likewise, the identity of appellant as the person who sold the dangerous drugs to PO2 Magcalayo and the one in possession of the <i>shabu</i> cannot be doubted anymore. Such positive identification prevails over appellant's defenses of denial and alibi. These defenses have been invariably viewed by the Court with disfavor, for they can easily be concocted but difficult to prove, and they are common and standard defense ploys in most prosecutions arising from violations of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Absent any proof of motive to falsely accuse appellant of such a grave offense, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and the findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses shall prevail over appellant's bare allegation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>We, therefore, uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties and find that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proving the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
