				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Judge Jose Y. Aguirre, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (respondent) of Branch 56 of the Regional Trial Court of Himamaylan, Negros Occidental was charged by Maria Pancho, David Gayotin, Loreto Gran and Marina Gran (complainants) with grave abuse of authority, violation and ignorance of the law resulting in violation of Sections 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 7, Rule 71 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and Grave Oppression.<br><br>The complaint arose from respondent's issuance on July 13, 2000 of an Order finding complainants guilty of Contempt committed <u>against the Municipal Trial Court</u> and sentencing them to suffer imprisonment of <u>four months</u> to be served in the Municipal Jail of Himamaylan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and issuance on even date of warrants for their arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Complainants fault respondent for violation of 1) Section 4, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court for giving due course to a mere unverified motion for contempt and declaring them guilty thereof, and 2)  Section 7 of the same Rule for <u>imposing a penalty of</u> <b>four </b><u>months imprisonment</u>.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, by Decision of October 31, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> affirmed respondent's July 13, 2000 Order but <i>modified</i> the penalty, noting that what complainants violated was an injunctive order which was issued by the <u>Municipal Trial Court</u> (MTC), hence, punishable by <u><b>one</b> month imprisonment</u>, in accordance with Sec. 7, Rule 71 which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Punishment for indirect contempt.</i> - If the respondent is adjudged guilty of indirect contempt committed against a Regional Trial Court or a court of equivalent or higher rank, he may be punished by a fine not exceeding thirty thousand pesos or imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months, or both. If he is adjudged <u>guilty of contempt committed <b>against a lower court</b></u>, he may be punished by <b>a fine</b> not exceeding five thousand pesos <b>or</b> <u>imprisonment of one (1) month</u>, or both. If the contempt consists in the violation of a writ of injunction, temporary restraining order or status quo order, he may also be ordered to make complete restitution to the party injured by such violation of the property involved or such amount as may be alleged and proved.<br><br>The writ of execution, as in ordinary civil actions, shall issue for the enforcement of a judgment imposing a fine unless the court otherwise provides.  (italics in the original;  emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>By Memorandum of April 2, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found respondent liable for gross ignorance of the law, Section 7 of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court being plain and simple.  The OCA accordingly recommended that respondent be fined in the amount of P25,000.<br><br>The Court finds the conclusion of the OCA in order. Indeed, above-quoted Section 7 of Rule 71 is clear.  Since what complainants violated is an order of the MTC, the imposable penalty is one month, <u>not</u> four, of imprisonment or a fine not exceeding P5,000 or both.<br><br>When the law or procedure is so elementary, such as the provisions of the Rules of Court, not to know, or to act as if one does not know the same, constitutes gross ignorance of the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> even without the complainant having to prove malice or bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended, classifies gross ignorance of the law as a serious charge and Section 11 thereof penalizes it with any of the following sanctions:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. <i>Provided, however,</i> That the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;<br><br></li><li>Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or<br><br></li><li>A fine of more than P20,000 but not exceeding P40,000.00.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Since respondent had retired (and died),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the first two sanctions may no longer be considered.  The penalty recommended by the OCA - fine in the amount of P25,000 - is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the now deceased Judge Jose Y. Aguirre, Jr. of the Regional Trial Court, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, Branch 56 is, for gross ignorance of the law, <b>FINED</b> in the amount of Twenty Five Thousand (P25,000) Pesos, to be deducted from the Fifty Thousand (P50,000) Pesos retained/withheld from his retirement benefits.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Carpio, Corona, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr., Perez,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Mendoza, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad, J.,</span> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Now deceased.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> SEC. 4.
