The amount of P8,228,276.34 being claimed by petitioner as alleged unutilized VAT input taxes for the year 2000 was not properly documented;<br><br>7.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In that case, we sustained the denial of petitioner's claim for tax credit/refund for non-compliance with Section 4.108-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, which requires the word "zero rated" to be printed on the invoices/receipts covering zero-rated sales.&nbsp; We explained that:<br><br><blockquote>Zero-rated transactions generally refer to the export sale of goods and services. The tax rate in this case is set at zero. When applied to the tax base or the selling price of the goods or services sold, such zero rate results in no tax chargeable against the foreign buyer or customer. But, although the seller in such transactions charges no output tax, he can claim a refund of the VAT that his suppliers charged him. The seller thus enjoys automatic zero rating, which allows him to recover the input taxes he paid relating to the export sales, making him internationally competitive.<br><br>For the effective zero rating of such transactions, however, the taxpayer has to be VAT-registered and must comply with invoicing requirements. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Petitioner Panasonic points out, however, that in requiring the printing on its sales invoices of the word "zero-rated," the Secretary of Finance unduly expanded, amended, and modified by a mere regulation (Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95) the letter and spirit of Sections 113 and 237 of the 1997 NIRC, prior to their amendment by R.A. 9337. Panasonic argues that the 1997 NIRC, which applied to its payments - specifically Sections 113 and 237 - required the VAT-registered taxpayer's receipts or invoices to indicate only the following information:<br><br><blockquote>(1) A statement that the seller is a VAT-registered person, followed by his taxpayer's identification number (TIN);<br><br>(2) The total amount which the purchaser [paid] or is obligated to pay to the seller with the indication that such amount includes the value-added tax;<br><br>(3) The date of transaction, quantity, unit cost and description of the goods or properties or nature of the service; and<br><br>(4) The name, business style, if any, address and taxpayer's identification number (TIN) of the purchaser, customer or client.<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner Panasonic points out that Sections 113 and 237 did not require the inclusion of the word "zero-rated" for zero-rated sales covered by its receipts or invoices. The BIR incorporated this requirement only after the enactment of R.A. 9337 on November 1, 2005, a law that did not yet exist at the time it issued its invoices.<br><br>But when petitioner Panasonic made the export sales subject of this case, i.e., from April 1998 to March 1999, the rule that applied was Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95, otherwise known as the Consolidated Value-Added Tax Regulations, which the Secretary of Finance issued on December 9, 1995 and [which] took effect on January 1, 1996. It already required the printing of the word "zero-rated" on the invoices covering zero-rated sales. When R.A. 9337 amended the 1997 NIRC on November 1, 2005, it made this particular revenue regulation a part of the tax code. This conversion from regulation to law did not diminish the binding force of such regulation with respect to acts committed prior to the enactment of that law.<br><br>Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95 proceeds from the rule-making authority granted to the Secretary of Finance under Section 245 of the 1977 NIRC (Presidential Decree 1158) for the efficient enforcement of the tax code and of course its amendments. The requirement is reasonable and is in accord with the efficient collection of VAT from the covered sales of goods and services. As aptly explained by the CTA's First Division, the appearance of the word "zero-rated" on the face of invoices covering zero-rated sales prevents buyers from falsely claiming input VAT from their purchases when no VAT was actually paid. If, absent such word, a successful claim for input VAT is made, the government would be refunding money it did not collect.<br><br>Further, the printing of the word "zero-rated" on the invoice helps segregate sales that are subject to 10% (now 12%) VAT from those sales that are zero-rated. Unable to submit the proper invoices, petitioner Panasonic has been unable to substantiate its claim for refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>Consistent with the foregoing jurisprudence, petitioner's claim for credit/ refund of input VAT for the taxable quarters of 2000 must be denied.&nbsp; Failure to print the word "zero-rated" on the invoices/receipts is fatal to a claim for credit/ refund of input VAT on zero-rated sales.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby <b>DENIED.</b>&nbsp; The assailed Decision<br><br>dated January 15, 2007 and the Resolution dated March 16, 2007 of the Court of Tax Appeals <i>En Banc </i>are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b><b>.&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., (Chairperson),&nbsp; Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Perez, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Agencia Exquisite of Bohol, Incorporated v.
