				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At bench is an ordinary appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 3 July 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 02828.  In the said decision, the appellate court affirmed the twin convictions of herein appellant Joel Roa for the sale and for possession of dangerous drugs in violation of Republic Act No. 9165 or <i>The</i> <i>Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002</i>.  The dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the February 23, 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 82, Quezon City, in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-03-120826, is hereby AFFIRMED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The prosecution's version of the events leading to the indictment of the appellant may be summarized as follows:<br><br>At around 10:00 in the evening of 5 September 2003, the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) received information from an "asset" that a certain Joel Roa was peddling <i>shabu</i> somewhere along Senatorial Road in <i>Barangay</i> Batasan Hills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Acting on this information, QCPD Chief Superintendent Raymund Esquival immediately formed a team of police officers to conduct a buy-bust operation with the objective of apprehending the suspected pusher in <i>flagrante delicto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The buy-bust team was composed of Police Officer (PO) 2 Joel Galacgac, Special Police Officer (SPO) 1 Rodolfo Limin, SPO2 Cesar Nano, and SPO1 Michael Fernandez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Before proceeding with the operation, PO2 Galacgac was designated as the team's <i>poseur</i>-buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The team arrived at the target area around 12:30 in the morning of 6 September 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The "asset" and PO2 Galacgac proceeded towards the house of the appellant, while the other members of the buy-bust team positioned themselves in strategic places.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The "asset" went inside the house, and, after about a minute, came out with the appellant.  The "asset" then introduced PO2 Galacgac to the appellant as a user who wants to buy <i>shabu</i>.  The appellant readily agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The appellant handed PO2 Galacgac one (1) small plastic sachet with white crystalline substance.  In turn, PO2 Galacgac handed the previously marked P100.00 bill to the appellant as payment.  Thereafter, PO2 Galacgac scratched his head, which served as the signal to the other members of the buy-bust team that the transaction was completed.  In an instant, the other members of the buy-bust team closed in and apprehended the appellant.  Upon being frisked by SPO1 Limin, two (2) more small plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance were recovered from the appellant's right front pocket.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Later, PO2 Galacgac would mark the small plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance handed to him during the sale, while SPO1 Limin had already marked the sachets he was able to retrieve from frisking the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The appellant was then brought to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> At the police station, PO2 Galacgac and SPO1 Limin forwarded the marked sachets to their investigator, PO3 Diosdado Rocero, who, in turn, made a request for a confirmatory examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Police Inspector (P/Insp.) Leonard Arban, a forensic chemist of the Philippine National Police (PNP), received the marked sachets together with the request for a confirmatory examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The test conducted by P/Insp. Arban yielded a positive result for methamphetamine hydrochloride —  the contents of the sachets were <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As a consequence of these events, two (2) separate criminal informations —  one for violation of Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of Republic Act No. 9165, and another for violation of Section 11<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the same law — were filed against appellant Joel Roa before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 82, in Quezon City. The informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> read:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>CRIMINAL CASE NO.

The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>a.)

Arban.<br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals found itself in agreement with the findings of the trial court, <i>en route</i> to rendering the decision that is now the subject of the present review.<br><br>In this appeal, the appellant asks the Court to consider his contrary version of events.  The appellant denies that he was caught, <i>in flagrante,</i> selling and possessing <i>shabu</i> and claims that he was just a victim of a police frame-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He professes that on the morning of 6 September 2003, while he was eating inside his house on Senatorial Road, <i>Barangay</i> Batasan Hills, four (4) men suddenly barged in and arrested him for no valid reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Then, he was conducted by his captors, who turned out to be QCPD officers, to the police station, and was asked to produce P50,000.00 in exchange for his release.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Not having any money to satisfy the demand, the appellant alleges that the QCPD fabricated the present charges against him in order to justify the detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In support of his denial, the appellant points out that the QCPD never coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) about conducting any buy-bust operation, violating in the process Section 86 of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Neither did the QCPD conduct any surveillance prior to the execution of the purported buy-bust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> These circumstances, the appellant believes, discount the existence of a genuine buy-bust operation and lend credibility to his own version that he was merely a victim of a frame-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>At any rate, the appellant adds that his acquittal for the two charges is in order because the prohibited drugs allegedly taken from him and presented in evidence could not be accepted as adequate proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The <i>shabu</i> that the prosecution claims to have been unlawfully sold and possessed by the appellant was neither photographed nor made the subject of a physical inventory as required under Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 3, Series of 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The appellant argues that as a necessary result of this omission, the identity of the <i>shabu</i> presented in evidence becomes highly suspect.<br><br>We are not impressed.<br><br><i><u>Appellant's Denial</u></i><br><br>In any criminal prosecution, the defenses of denial and frame-up, like <i>alibi</i>, are considered weak defenses and have been invariably viewed by the courts with disfavor for they can just as easily be concocted but are difficult to prove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Negative in their nature, bare denials and accusations of frame-up cannot, as a rule, prevail over the affirmative testimony of truthful witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The foregoing principle applies with equal, if not greater, force in prosecutions involving violations of Republic Act No. 9165, especially those originating from buy-bust operations.  In such cases, the testimonies of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust are generally accorded full faith and credit, in view of the presumption of regularity in the performance of public duties.  Hence, when lined against an unsubstantiated denial or claim of frame-up, the testimony of the officers who caught the accused red-handed is given more weight and usually prevails.<br><br>In order to overcome the presumption of regularity, jurisprudence teaches us that there must be clear and convincing evidence that the police officers did not properly perform their duties or that they were prompted with ill motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In pointing out that the buy-bust conducted by the QCPD was carried out without first coordinating with PDEA and without any prior surveillance, the appellant ascribes irregularity in the manner by which the police operatives of QCPD conducted their operations, thereby casting doubt on the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that a legitimate buy-bust was undertaken.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>In the first place, coordination with the PDEA is not an indispensable requirement before police authorities may carry out a buy-bust operation.   While it is true that Section 86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of Republic Act No. 9165 requires the National Bureau of Investigation, PNP and the Bureau of Customs to maintain "close coordination with the PDEA on all drug related matters," the provision does not, by so saying, make PDEA's participation a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for every buy-bust operation.  After all, a buy-bust is just a form of an <i>in flagrante </i>arrest sanctioned by Section 5, Rule 113<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the Rules of the Court, which police authorities may rightfully resort to in apprehending violators of Republic Act No. 9165 in support of the PDEA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> A buy-bust operation is not invalidated by mere non-coordination with the PDEA.<br><br>Neither is the lack of prior surveillance fatal. The case of <b><i>People v. Lacbanes</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> is quite instructive:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>People v</i>. <i>Ganguso</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><b> </b>it has been held that <b>prior surveillance is not a prerequisite for the validity of an entrapment operation, especially when the buy-bust team members were accompanied to the scene by their informant</b>. In the instant case, the arresting officers were led to the scene by the poseur-buyer. Granting that there was no surveillance conducted before the buy-bust operation, this Court held in <i>People v</i>. <i>Tranca</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><b> </b>that there is no rigid or textbook method of conducting buy-bust operations. Flexibility is a trait of good police work. <b>The police officers may decide that time is of the essence and dispense with the need for prior surveillance</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Failing to show any ill motive and improper performance of duty on the part of the police officers who caused his apprehension, the appellant's defenses of denial and frame-up must necessarily fail.<br><br><i>Proof of Corpus Delicti</i><br><br>The appellant also contends that the prosecution has failed to present competent evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, by reason of the failure of the buy-bust team to make an inventory and photograph the prohibited drugs allegedly retrieved from the former.  For this purpose, appellant cites a violation of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 3, Series of 1979.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>To begin with, the appellant cited a defunct regulation. Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 3, Series of 1979 was already superseded by Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 and its Implementing Rules, which are now the prevailing laws relative to the requirements of making an inventory and photographing confiscated prohibited drugs and paraphernalia. It may not be amiss to point out that the <i>shabu</i> subject of this case was seized from the appellant upon his apprehension on 3 September 2003 —  during which, Republic Act No. 9165 was already in effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>For appellant's position, support is not provided by the applicable law.<br><br>This Court has consistently ruled that non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 will not necessarily render the items seized or confiscated in a buy-bust operation inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Strict compliance with the letter of Section 21 is not required if there is a clear showing that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved, <i>i.e.</i>, the items being offered in court as exhibits are, without a specter of doubt, the very same ones recovered in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Hence, once the possibility of substitution has been negated by evidence of an unbroken and cohesive chain of custody over the contraband, such contraband may be admitted and stand as proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i> notwithstanding the fact that it was never made the subject of an inventory or was photographed pursuant to Section 21(1) of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>A review of the evidence on record will show that the prosecution was able to establish an unbroken chain of custody over the <i>shabu</i> which it claims as having been sold and possessed by the appellant:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">1.)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">On the charge of sale, PO2 Galacgac testified that he placed his markings on the small plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance handed to him by the appellant during the operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2.) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">On the charge of possession, PO2 Galacgac and SPO2 Cesar Nano recounted that they witnessed SPO1 Limin recover the two (2) small plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the accused at the <i>locus criminis </i>after he was bodily searched.

Leonard Arban acknowledged in his testimony the receipt of the sachets along with the request for a confirmatory examination. He also stated that the test he conducted on the specimens yielded a positive result for methamphetamine hydrochloride, for which he issued a corresponding laboratory report. Finally, he attested that he turned over the specimen to the Evidence Custodian, which kept custody of the <i>shabu</i> until it was retrieved for purposes of the trial. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Verily, the prosecution was able to account for each and every link in the chain of custody over the <i>shabu</i>, from the moment it was retrieved during the buy-bust operation up to the time it was presented before the court<i> </i>as<i> </i>proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.  All told, the probability that the sachets taken from the appellant could have been switched for another is nil.  The existence of the <i>shabu</i> sold and possessed by the appellant was, therefore, proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
