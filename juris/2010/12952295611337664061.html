Thereafter, appellant untied her, used a lighter to illuminate himself and the ice pick poked at her, and told her to go back to sleep.<br><br>The following morning, "AAA" just lay in bed and continued crying. Appellant told her to wake up and wash her bloodstained panty.&nbsp; She got up, but instead of obeying appellant, she burned said underwear together with her mat to rid herself of any reminder of the horrible fate she suffered in the hands of her father.<br><br>"AAA" told her mother about the appellant's beastly sexual aggression on January 21, 2004. The following day, January 22, 2004, the mother of "AAA" took her to the Bicol Medical Center for a medical examination conducted by Dr. Augusto M.

It is highly [improbable that a girl would] fabricate a story that would expose herself and her family to a lifetime of dishonor, especially when her charges would mean the death or the long-term imprisonment of her father.&nbsp; Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Considering that the victim in this case underwent a harrowing experience and exposed herself to the rigors of public trial, it is unlikely that she would devise false accusations against appellant, who is her father.<br><br>Further, the testimony of "AAA" was corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Quilon, the physician who conducted the medico-legal examination on her. Dr. Quilon, declared that he found healed hymenal lacerations at the two and seven o'clock notches on the private part of "AAA," which could have been caused by the penetration of a man's penis.&nbsp; He also disclosed that the hymen of "AAA" was no longer intact; she was no longer a virgin.&nbsp; When the testimony of a rape victim is consistent with the medical findings, sufficient basis exists to warrant a conclusion that the essential requisite of carnal knowledge has been established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The testimony of Dr. Quilon, therefore, strengthens "AAA's" claim of rape against appellant.<br><br>In an attempt to exonerate himself, appellant impugns the credibility of "AAA." He avers that the testimony that he tied her hands and feet while she was asleep to facilitate the consummation of rape is unbelievable considering that their house is so small and several people were sleeping beside her on the same mat.&nbsp; He also claims that "AAA" failed to resist the alleged sexual aggression. Moreover, he casts doubt on the testimony of "AAA" that he ordered her to wash her bloodstained panty.&nbsp; He posits that "AAA" could not have stained her panty with blood since she testified that she was already naked at the time he was allegedly raping her and there is no proof that she put on her clothes after he satisfied his lust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Appellant's assertions fail to impress.&nbsp; The testimony of "AAA" that appellant tied her hands and feet to consummate the rape in spite of the fact that their house was small and people were sleeping beside her is not incredible.&nbsp; It is axiomatic that appellant tied the hands and feet of "AAA" to ensure the commission of rape and to eliminate any resistance that she might use. Restraining "AAA" was also intended to limit her movement so that her siblings sleeping beside her would not be awakened and witness the crime.<br><br>Appellant's contention that rape could not be committed in a small house where several people were sleeping does not deserve consideration.&nbsp; "Lust is no respecter of time and place. x x x&nbsp; [R]ape can be committed even inside a house where there are other occupants or where other members of the family are also sleeping. Thus, it is an accepted rule in criminal law that rape may be committed even when the rapist and the victim are not alone.&nbsp; Fact is, rape may even be committed in the same room x x x or in a small room where other family members also sleep,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Appellant's allegation that "AAA" failed to resist the sexual assault is untenable.&nbsp; Obviously, "AAA" could not be expected to offer resistance to the sexual aggression of appellant since her hands and feet were tied.&nbsp; Even if it were true that "AAA" did not seriously resist appellant's offense, her failure cannot be considered to diminish the credibility of her testimony.&nbsp; "It must be stressed that the resistance of the victim is not an element of the crime [of rape]," and "the law does not impose [on the prosecution] the burden of [establishing the same]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; "As long as the force or intimidation is present, whether it was more or less irresistible is beside the point."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In addition, "in the incestuous rape of a minor, actual force or intimidation need not be [proven]. x x x The moral and physical [domination] of the father is sufficient to [intimidate] the victim into submission to his [carnal] desires. x x x The [rapist], by his overpowering and overbearing moral influence, can easily consummate his bestial lust with impunity.&nbsp; [Consequently], proof of force and violence is unnecessary, unlike when the accused is not an ascendant or a blood relative of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Whether the bloodstained panty actually existed will not adversely affect the credibility of "AAA" as appellant wants to make it appear.&nbsp; The fact that "AAA" did not declare on the witness stand that she put on her clothes after the rape does not make her testimony inconsistent.&nbsp; Neither does it make the existence of said bloodstained panty improbable.&nbsp; What is essential is that "AAA" categorically testified that her father asked her to wash said panty the morning after the incident because it had blood on it.&nbsp; However, she burned it along with her mat since it was a reminder of her horrible fate.<br><br>Furthermore, the alleged improbability is an inconsequential matter that does not bear upon the elements of the crime of rape.&nbsp; The decisive factor in the prosecution of rape is whether the commission of the crime has been sufficiently proven.&nbsp; "For a discrepancy or inconsistency in the testimony of a witness to serve as basis for acquittal, it must refer to the significant facts [indispensable] to the guilt or innocence of the [appellant] for the crime charged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As the inconsistencies alleged by appellant had nothing to do with the elements of the crime of rape, they cannot be used as grounds for his acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Appellant's defense of denial was properly rejected. All that is on record is the bare and uncorroborated protestations of appellant that he did not rape his minor daughter, "AAA."&nbsp; He did not proffer evidence to substantiate his averments.&nbsp; "[D]enial is inherently a weak defense.&nbsp; To be believed, it must be [supported] by strong evidence of non-culpability; otherwise, such denial is purely self-serving and has practically no evidentiary value"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>vis a vis</i> the positive declaration of a credible witness.&nbsp; "Between the positive assertions of the [victim] and the negative averments of [appellant], the former indisputably deserve more credence and are entitled to greater evidentiary weight."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the positive identification made by "AAA" of appellant as the person who inserted his penis into her vagina plainly prevails over his denial.<br><br>Given the foregoing circumstances, we find no cogent reason to deviate from the findings and conclusions of the trial court, as affirmed by the CA.&nbsp; The record in this case fully substantiates the incident of rape suffered by "AAA" in the hands of appellant.&nbsp; The prosecution sufficiently proved the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The evaluation of the testimony of "AAA" has been appreciated properly and the evidence is overwhelming to convict appellant of having carnal knowledge of her.<br><br><b><i>The Proper Penalty</i></b><br><br>The rape of "AAA" was committed on January 4, 2004.&nbsp; Accordingly, the provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which is the law in effect when the crime was committed, shall apply.<br><br>In this case, the element of carnal knowledge was proven by the testimony of the victim.&nbsp; "AAA's" minority was established by the presentation of her Certificate of Live Birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> showing that she was born on April 3, 1992.&nbsp; She was only 11 years old when the rape was committed on January 4, 2004.&nbsp; Notably, the appellant admitted that he is the father of "AAA" during the pre-trial conference and the trial of this case.&nbsp; Clearly, the minority of the victim and her filial relationship to the appellant have been alleged in the Information and duly proven during trial. "The presence of the foregoing qualifying circumstance[s] raised the crime of Statutory Rape to Qualified Rape. Simply stated, Qualified Rape is Statutory Rape in its qualified form."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As a result, the trial court's imposition of the penalty of death on appellant was justified.&nbsp; However, with the passage of RA 9346 entitled "An Act Prohibiting The Imposition Of The Death Penalty In The Philippines," the penalty, as correctly imposed by the Court of Appeals, should be <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the same law, the appellant shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Damages</i></b><br><br>In line with prevailing jurisprudence, "AAA" is entitled to an award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, another P75,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The award of civil indemnity, which is in the nature of actual or compensatory damages, is mandatory upon conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, moral damages is awarded without need of pleading or proving their basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Due to the presence of the aggravating/qualifying circumstances of minority and the relationship of "AAA" to appellant, both of which were alleged in the Information and proven during trial, the award of exemplary damages is in order.<br><br>Thus, the CA correctly awarded "AAA" civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00, and another P75,000.00 as moral damages.
