At 3:00 a.m. of the same day, AAA gave a sworn statement reflecting essentially the above account before PO2 Eric Espino Rano at the Baler Police Station, Central Police District Office, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The reporting of the incident and the apprehension of appellant were corroborated by Gener Mendoza, a <i>barangay</i> tanod.&nbsp; He added that appellant was apprehended "inside the barracks" after someone pointed to his whereabouts, and that AAA, on seeing appellant, slapped him.<br><br>Examination of AAA at 4:00 a.m. also on February 20, 2004 revealed the following pertinent findings and conclusion:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>PHYSICAL INJURIES:&nbsp; Area of <u>multiple abrasions, neck, measuring 23 cm x 8 cm</u>, bisected by posterior midline.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>HYMEN: <u>deep fresh laceration at 5 o'clock and deep laceration at 8 o'clock</u>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>PERIURETHRAL AND VAGINAL SMEARS:&nbsp; are <u>positive for spermatozoa</u>.<br><br><b>CONCLUSION</b>:&nbsp; Findings <u>consistent with recent sexual intercourse</u>.&nbsp; Barring unforeseen complications, it is estimated that the <u>above injuries will heal in 7 - 8 days</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Denying the charge and proffering the "sweetheart" defense,&nbsp; appellant, a construction worker, claimed that he courted AAA during two occasions that they met on the bridge;&nbsp; that AAA had told him that she was 18 years old; and that she voluntarily acceded to the sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Appellant's friend Jessie Templor, who was with him at the bridge, corroborated appellant's claim that AAA was appellant's girlfriend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He added that AAA had twice visited appellant at the construction site where appellant used to work;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; that on the night of the incident, appellant and AAA talked for about an hour after which the two went under the bridge;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and that as he wanted to borrow the cellphone of appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> he went under the bridge and saw appellant on top of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In finding for the prosecution, Branch 86 of the Quezon City RTC which convicted appellant, made the following observation:<br><br><blockquote>The childish and innocent demeanor of the complainant convinces the Court that although 16 years of age at the time of the incident, she has the mental status of a twelve year old child.&nbsp; She was looking for her mother on the late night of February 19, 2004.&nbsp; When she encountered the accused on the bridge at West Riverside, San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City, she could not understand why he would drag her to a place beneath the bridge.&nbsp; She was asked not to make noise or she would be pushed into the river below. <u>The threat forced her into submission.&nbsp; She was raped on the path-walk causing abrasions to her back</u> (<i>Exh. "E"). </i>If they were sweethearts as alleged by the accused, they would have gone to a place which would be comfortable for their lovemaking.&nbsp; <u>The fact that complainant suffered from abrasions at her back clearly indicate that she was forced to lie down on the pavement</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the trial court disposed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Jessie Bustillo y Ambal, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <b>reclusion perpetua </b>and to indemnify the private complainant Lourdes Sabarre of <b>P50,000.00 as civil indemnity</b> and <b>P50,000.00 as moral damages</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of September 16, 2008,<i> affirmed </i>the trial court's decision.<br><br>Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>Appellant having admitted engaging in carnal knowledge with AAA,&nbsp; the only issue for consideration is whether the sexual act was done through force, violence or intimidation.<br><br>As did the trial and appellate courts, the Court is not persuaded by appellant's claim of consensuality.&nbsp; The findings and conclusion of the doctor who examined AAA, along with AAA's <u>immediate reporting</u> of the incident to the <i>barangay</i> and police authorities before which she <u>at once narrated the details thereof</u>, negate consensuality, and confirm AAA's claim that the intercourse was committed with intimidation and force.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, Del Castillo,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Villarama, Jr.</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Sereno, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 879 dated August 13, 2010 in lieu of Associate Justice Arturo D.
