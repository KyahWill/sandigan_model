Defendant's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">act of accelerating the maturity of plaintiff's entire obligation</span> would not only be <b style="text-decoration: underline;">in gross bad faith</b>, but also a <b style="text-decoration: underline;">gross abuse of right</b>, as it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subjected the maturity of the loans to its </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">own whims and caprices</b>, to the damage and great prejudice of the plaintiff; not to mention the fact that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">done in the midst of this present economic crisis and during these difficult times</span> of high and exorbitant interest rates;<br><br>8.  There is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no reason for the defendant to hasten the maturity of the loans, as it would not suffer any prejudice</span>, for the loans both under the Credit Line and the Medium Term Loan are secured with collaterals and whatever amount due can very well be taken cared of by the same; on the contrary, it is plaintiff who would suffer the most;<br><br>9.  Surprisingly, defendant BPI Agribank filed with the office of the RTC Sheriff, Ozamiz City, an application for Extra-judicial <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreclosure of the mortgaged properties, which foreclosure will undoubtedly work undeniable injustice and serious irreparable damage to plaintiff</span>.

Petitioner admitted having executed Promissory Note No. 1000045-08.  During the hearing of his application for a writ of preliminary injunction, the cross-default provision of the note was read to him and he admitted having gone over<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> it before he signed the note.  And petitioner admitted that he failed to honor the note on maturity.<br><br>Petitioner alleged in his complaint, however, that respondent's acceleration of the maturity of his entire obligation is "in gross bad faith" and in "gross abuse of [his] right" as it "subjected the maturity of the loans to its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">own whims and caprices</span> . . . not to mention that it [was] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">done in the midst of this present economic crisis</span> . . . ."<br><br>Respondent's declaration that petitioner's availments under the revolving credit line and medium term loans were immediately due and payable was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by virtue of the cross-default provision of Promissory Note No. 1000045-08</span>. Respondent's move to foreclose the mortgages after petitioner defaulted in his obligation under the promissory note was thus in accordance with said provision <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which petitioner did not challenge</span>.
