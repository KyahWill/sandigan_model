				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Angel N. Pascual Jr. died intestate on January 2, 1999 leaving as heirs his siblings, namely:&nbsp; petitioner Amelia P.

Pascual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In a petition for "Judicial Settlement of Intestate Estate and Issuance of Letters of Administration," docketed as Special Proceeding Case No. M-5034, filed by respondents on April 28, 2000 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati, respondents alleged, <i>inter alia</i>, that a parcel of land (the donated property) located in Teresa Village, Makati, which was, by Deed of Donation, transferred by the decedent to petitioner the validity of which donation respondents assailed, "may be considered as an advance legitime" of petitioner.<br><br>Respondent's nephew Victor was, as they prayed for, appointed as Administrator of the estate by Branch 135 of the Makati RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Respecting the donated property, now covered in the name of petitioner by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 181889 of the Register of Deeds of Makati, which respondents assailed but which they, in any event, posited that it "may be considered as an advance legitime" to petitioner, the trial court, acting as probate court, held that it was precluded from determining the validity of the donation.<br><br>Provisionally passing, however, upon the question of title to the donated property <u>only for the purpose of determining whether it formed part of the decedent's estate</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the probate court found the Deed of Donation valid in light of the presumption of validity of notarized documents.&nbsp; It thus went on to hold that it is subject to collation following Article 1061 of the New Civil Code which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Every compulsory heir, who succeeds with other compulsory heirs, must bring into the mass of the estate any property or right which he may have received from the decedent, during the lifetime of the latter, by way of donation, or any other gratuitous title in order that it may be computed in the determination of the legitime of each heir, and in the account of the partition.<br></blockquote><br>The probate court thereafter partitioned the properties of the intestate estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring that:<br><br><ol><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The property covered by TCT No. 181889 of the Register of Deeds of Makati as part of the estate of Angel N.

Pascual</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; (citation omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The appellate court, however, held that, contrary to the ruling of the probate court, herein petitioner "was able to submit <i>prima facie </i>evidence of shares of stocks owned by the [decedent] which have not been included in the inventory submitted by the administrator."<br><br>Thus, the appellate court disposed, <i>quoted verbatim</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present appeal is hereby PARTLY GRANTED.&nbsp; The Decision dated January 29, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 135 in Special Proceeding Case No. M-5034 is hereby <u>REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as the order of inclusion of properties</u> of the Intestate Estate of Angel N.

If there is no compulsory heir, there is no legitime to be safeguarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The records do not show that the decedent left any primary, secondary, or concurring compulsory heirs.&nbsp; He was only survived by his siblings, who are his <i>collateral</i> relatives and, therefore, are not entitled to any legitime - that part of the testator's property which he cannot dispose of because the law has reserved it for <i>compulsory</i> heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The compulsory heirs may be classified into (1) primary, (2) secondary, and (3) concurring. The primary compulsory heirs are those who have precedence over and exclude other compulsory heirs; legitimate children and descendants are primary compulsory heirs. The secondary compulsory heirs are those who succeed only in the absence of the primary heirs; the legitimate parents and ascendants are secondary compulsory heirs. The concurring compulsory heirs are those who succeed together with the primary or the secondary compulsory heirs; the illegitimate children, and the surviving spouse are concurring compulsory heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The decedent not having left any compulsory heir who is entitled to any legitime, he was at liberty to donate all his properties, even if nothing was left for his siblings-collateral relatives to inherit.&nbsp; His donation to petitioner, assuming that it was valid,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is deemed as donation made to a "stranger," chargeable against the free portion of the estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; There being no compulsory heir, however, the donated property is not subject to collation.<br><br>On the second issue:<br><br>The decedent's remaining estate should thus be partitioned <i>equally </i>among his heirs-siblings-collateral relatives, herein petitioner and respondents, pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 1003.</b> If there are no descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children, or a surviving spouse, <u>the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased in accordance with the following articles</u>.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)<br><br><b>Art. 1004.</b> Should the only survivors be brothers and sisters of the full blood, they shall <b><u>inherit in equal shares</u></b>.&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals Decision ordering the collation of the property donated to petitioner, Amelia N. Arellano, to the estate of the deceased Angel N.
