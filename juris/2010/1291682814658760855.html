From October 7, 2004 until the full payment, the simple interest rate is raised to 12% per annum.&nbsp; The reason is that the amount thus determined had by then acquired the character of a forbearance in money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>LBP disagreed with the imposition of 12% interest and its liability to pay the costs of suit.&nbsp; It filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied in the Court of Appeals' Resolution dated 18 March 2008.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held:<br><br><blockquote>We DENY the petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration for the following reasons, to wit:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Anent the first ground, the decision of October 9, 2007 has explained in detail why the obligation of the petitioner should be charged 12% interest.&nbsp; Considering that the motion fails to persuasively show that a modification of the decision thereon would be justified, we reject such ground for lack of merit.<br><br>2.&nbsp; Regarding costs of suit, they are allowed to the prevailing party as a matter of course, unless there be special reasons for the court to decree otherwise (Sec. 1, Rule 43, Rules of Court).&nbsp; In appeals, the Court has the power to render judgment for costs as justice may require (Sec. 2, Rule 142, Rules of Court).<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the award of costs to the respondents was warranted under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Before this Court, LBP raises the same issues for resolution:<br><br><blockquote>I.&nbsp; Is it valid or lawful to award 12% rate of interest per annum in favor of respondents notwithstanding the 6% rate of interest per annum compounded annually prescribed under DAR A.O. No. 13, series of 1994, DAR A.O. No. 02, series of 2004, and DAR A.O. No. 06, series of 2008, "xxx from November 1994 up to the time of actual payment?<br><br>II. Is it valid or lawful to adjudge petitioner LBP, which is performing a governmental function, liable for costs of suit?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br>At the outset, the Court notes that the parcels of land subject matter of this case were acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27, but the complaint for just compensation was filed in the RTC on 1 December 1994 after Republic Act No. 6657 already took into effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, our pronouncement in <i>LBP v. Soriano</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> finds application. We quote<i>:</i><br><br><blockquote>x x x [I]f just compensation is not settled prior to the passage of Republic Act No. 6657, it should be computed in accordance with the said law, although the property was acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27.&nbsp; The fixing of just compensation should therefore be based on the parameters set out in Republic Act No. 6657, with Presidential Decree No. 27 and Executive Order No. 228 having only suppletory effect.<br><br>In the instant case, while the subject lands were acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27, the complaint for just compensation was only lodged before the court on 23 November 2000 or long after the passage of Republic Act No. 6657 in 1998.&nbsp; <b>Therefore, Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 should be the principal basis of the computation for just compensation.</b>&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the factors enumerated therein had already been translated into a basic formula by the DAR pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of Republic Act No. 6657.&nbsp; The formula outlines in DAR Administrative Order No. 5, series of 1998 should be applied in computing just compensation, thus:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br></div><br>Where: LV = Land Value<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br>&nbsp; CS = Comparable Sales<br>&nbsp;MV = Market Value per Tax Declaration</div></blockquote><br>In the case before Us, the just compensation was computed based on Executive Order No. 228, which computation the parties do not contest. Consequently, we reiterate our rule in <i>LBP v. Soriano </i>that "while we uphold the amount derived from the old formula, since the application of the new formula is a matter of law and thus, should be made applicable, the parties are not precluded from asking for any additional amount as may be warranted by the new formula."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>That settled, we now proceed to resolve the issue of the propriety of the imposition of 12% interest on just compensation awarded to the respondents.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals imposed interest of 12% per annum on the amount of P515,777.57 beginning 7 October 2004, until full payment.<br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> we affirmed the award of 12% interest on just compensation due to the landowner. The court decreed:<br><br><blockquote>The constitutional limitation of "just compensation" is considered to be the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described to be the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition or the fair value of the property as between one who receives, and one who desires to sell, if fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government.&nbsp; Thus, <b>if property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interest on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court.&nbsp; In fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred. </b><br><br>The Bulacan trial court, in its 1979 decision, was correct in imposing interest on the zonal value of the property to be computed from the time petitioner instituted condemnation proceedings and "took" the property in September 1969.&nbsp; This allowance of interest on the amount found to be the value of the property as of the time of the taking computed, being an effective forbearance, at 12% per annum should help eliminate the issue of the constant fluctuation and inflation of the value of the currency over time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>We similarly upheld <i>Republic's </i>12% per annum interest rate on the unpaid expropriation compensation in the following cases:&nbsp; <i>Reyes v. National Housing Authority,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><i> Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><i> Republic v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><i> Land Bank of the Philippines v. Imperial,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><i> Philippine Ports Authority v. Rosales-Bondoc,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><i> Nepomuceno v. City of Surigao,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><i>&nbsp; </i>and <i>Curata v. Philippine Ports Authority.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Conformably with the foregoing resolution, this Court rules that a 12% interest per annum on just compensation, due to the respondents, from the finality of this decision until its satisfaction, is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We now proceed to the issue of whether or not the Court of Appeals correctly adjudged LBP liable to pay the cost of suit.<br><br>According to LBP, it performs a governmental function when it disburses the Agrarian Reform Fund to satisfy awards of just compensation.&nbsp; Hence, it cannot be made to pay costs in eminent domain proceedings.<br><br>LBP cites <i>Sps. Badillo v. Hon. Tayag,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to further bolster its claim that it is exempt from the payment of costs of suit.&nbsp; The Court in that case made the following pronouncement:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, the NHA contends that it is exempt from paying all kinds of fees and charges, because it performs governmental functions. It cites <i>Public Estates Authority v. Yujuico</i>, which holds that the Public Estates Authority (PEA), a government-owned and controlled corporation, is exempt from paying docket fees whenever it files a suit in relation to its governmental functions.<br><br>We agree. <i>People's Homesite and Housing Corporation v. Court of Industrial Relations</i> declares that the provision of mass housing is a governmental function:<br><br>Coming now to the case at bar, We note that since 1941 when the National Housing Commission (predecessor of PHHC, which is now known as the National Housing Authority [NHA] was created, the Philippine government has pursued a mass housing and resettlement program to meet the needs of Filipinos for decent housing. The agency tasked with implementing such governmental program was the PHHC.<br><br>These can be gleaned from the provisions of Commonwealth Act 648, the charter of said agency.<br><br>We rule that the PHHC is a governmental institution performing governmental functions.<br><br>This is not the first time We are ruling on the proper characterization of housing as an activity of the government. In the 1985 case of <i>National Housing Corporation v. Juco and the NLRC</i> (No. L-64313, January 17, 1985, 134 SCRA 172), We ruled that housing is a governmental function.<br><br>While it has not always been easy to distinguish governmental from proprietary functions, the Court's declaration in the Decision quoted above is not without basis. Indeed, the characterization of governmental functions has veered away from the traditional constituent-ministrant classification that has become unrealistic, if not obsolete.&nbsp; Justice Isagani A. Cruz avers: "[I]t is now obligatory upon the State itself to promote social justice, to provide adequate social services to promote a rising standard of living, to afford protection to labor to formulate and implement urban and agrarian reform programs, and to adopt other measures intended to ensure the dignity, welfare and security of its citizens.....These functions, while traditionally regarded as merely ministrant and optional, have been made compulsory by the Constitution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>We agree with the LBP.&nbsp; The relevant provision of the Rules of Court states:<br><br><blockquote><center>Rule 142<br>Costs<br></center><br>Section 1. <i>Costs ordinarily follow results of suit. -</i> <b>Unless otherwise provided in these rules, costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party as a matter of course</b> but the court shall have power, for special reasons adjudge that either party shall pay the costs of an action, or that the same be divided, as may be equitable.&nbsp; <b>No costs shall be allowed against the Republic of the Philippines unless otherwise provided by law.</b></blockquote><br>In <i>Heirs of Vidad v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>this Court extensively discussed the role of LBP in the implementation of the agrarian reform program.<br><br><blockquote><b>LBP is an agency created primarily to provide financial support in all phases of agrarian reform pursuant to Section 74 of Republic Act (RA) No. 3844 and Section 64 of RA No. 6657. It is vested with the primary responsibility and authority in the valuation and compensation of covered landholdings to carry out the full implementation of the Agrarian Reform Program.</b> It may agree with the DAR and the land owner as to the amount of just compensation to be paid to the latter and may also disagree with them and bring the matter to court for judicial determination.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To the contrary, the Court had already recognized in <i>Sharp International Marketing v. Court of Appeals</i> that the LBP plays a significant role under the CARL and in the implementation of the CARP, thus:<br><br>As may be gleaned very clearly from EO 229, the LBP is an <b>essential part</b> of the government sector with regard to the payment of compensation to the landowner. It is, after all, the instrumentality that is charged with the disbursement of public funds for purposes of agrarian reform. It is therefore part, an indispensable cog, in the governmental machinery that fixes and determines the amount compensable to the landowner. Were LBP to be excluded from that intricate, if not sensitive, function of establishing the compensable amount, there would be no amount "to be established by the government" as required in Sec. 6, EO 229. This is precisely why the law requires the [Deed of Absolute Sale (DAS)], even if already approved and signed by the DAR Secretary, to be <b>transmitted still to the LBP for its review, evaluation and approval</b>.<br><br>It needs no exceptional intelligence to understand the implications of this transmittal. It simply means that if LBP agrees on the amount stated in the DAS, after its review and evaluation, it becomes its duty to sign the deed. But not until then. For, it is only in that event that the amount to be compensated shall have been "established" according to law. Inversely, if the LBP, after review and evaluation, refuses to sign, it is because as a party to the contract it does not give its consent thereto. This <b>necessarily implies the exercise of judgment on the part of LBP, which is not supposed to be a mere rubber stamp in the exercise.</b> Obviously, were it not so, LBP could not have been made a distinct member of [Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC)], the super body responsible for the successful implementation of the CARP. Neither would it have been given the power to review and evaluate the DAS already signed by the DAR Secretary. If the function of the LBP in this regard is merely to sign the DAS without the concomitant power of review and evaluation, its duty to "review/evaluate" mandated in Adm. Order No. 5 would have been a mere surplus age, meaningless, and a useless ceremony.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Even more explicit is R.A. 6657 with respect to the indispensable role of LBP in the determination of the amount to be compensated to the landowner. Under Sec. 18 thereof, "the LBP shall compensate the landowner in <b>such amount as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and LBP</b>, in accordance with the criteria provided in Secs. 16 and 17, and other pertinent provisions hereof, or as may be finally determined by the court, as the just compensation for the land."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It must be observed that once an expropriation proceeding for the acquisition of private agricultural lands is commenced by the DAR, the <b>indispensable role of Land Bank</b> begins.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is evident from the afore-quoted jurisprudence that the role of LBP in the CARP is more than just the ministerial duty of keeping and disbursing the Agrarian Reform Funds. As the Court had previously declared, the LBP is primarily responsible for the valuation and determination of compensation for all private lands. It has the discretion to approve or reject the land valuation and just compensation for a private agricultural land placed under the CARP. In case the LBP disagrees with the valuation of land and determination of just compensation by a party, the DAR, or even the courts, the LBP not only has the right, but the duty, to challenge the same, by appeal to the Court of Appeals or to this Court, if appropriate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>It is clear from the above discussions that since LBP is performing a governmental function in agrarian reform proceeding, it is exempt from the payment of costs of suit as provided under Rule 142, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
