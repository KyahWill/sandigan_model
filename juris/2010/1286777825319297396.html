Theresa Linaja<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On 5 May 1998, respondent filed before the Department of Labor and Employment-National Capital Region (DOLE-NCR) a complaint for underpayment of wages and non-payment of holiday pay.<br><br>Sometime in June 1998, respondent reported back to work with a medical certificate stating he was fit to work but he was refused work.<br><br>On 22 June 1998, the DOLE-NCR endorsed respondent's complaint to the NLRC when it determined that the issue of constructive dismissal was involved.&nbsp; On 23 July 1998, respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal before the NLRC-NCR. On 3 August 1998, respondent again attempted to return to work but was refused again.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Labor Arbiter</b></center></u><br><br>On 25 August 1999, Labor Arbiter Madjayran H. Ajan rendered a decision in favor of respondent.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter found that "complainant's dismissal was the price of his having filed a case with DOLE-NCR against the respondents, plus his perennial absences, which nevertheless is not a just cause.&nbsp; We likewise agree that the gesture of respondents to reinstate or re-employ complainant unconditionally during the proceedings did not cure the illegality of complainant's dismissal."<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises above considered a decision is hereby issued declaring the dismissal of the complainant illegal.&nbsp; Consequently, respondents VIP's Coffee Shop &amp; Restaurant and/or Irene Francisco are ordered to reinstate complainant to his former or equivalent position without loss of seniority rights, and to pay complainant jointly and severally his backwages hereby fixed at P88,000.00 as of August 31, 1999, plus his paternity pay, and attorney's&nbsp; fees equivalent to the monetary award, all in the aggregate of ninety nine thousand three hundred fifty pesos and 90/100 centavos (P99,350.90).<br><br>Respondents are likewise ordered to pay complainant P50,000.00 for moral damages and P20,000.00 for exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the NLRC</b><br></center></u><br>The NLRC found respondent's filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal premature.&nbsp; The NLRC stated "[t]his conclusion is supported by the fact that in respondent's memorandum to complainant directing him to avail of his vacation/sick leave, the same is to last from April 30, 1998 to August 1, 1998. The complaint therefore filed on May 5, 1998 has no legal basis to support itself.&nbsp; When he filed his complaint on May 5, 1998, his cause of action based on illegal dismissal has not yet accrued."<br><br>Nevertheless, the NLRC noted,&nbsp; "a supervening event occurred during the pendency of the instant case which is the closure of VIPS Coffee Shop and Restaurant effective 26 August 1999, as evidenced by the Notice and report to the Department of Labor and Employment (Annexes "1" and "2" of Appeal). x x x This being the case, and in the spirit of compassion, respondents are directed to pay complainant his separation pay equivalent to one half month pay for every year of service x x x."<br><br>The dispositive portion of the NLRC's decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated August 25, 1999 is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b> and respondents are instead directed to pay the complainant separation pay in the amount of P13,750.00 plus his paternity leave pay in the amount of P1,519.00 (P217.00 x 7 days).&nbsp; The award for moral and exemplary damages are deleted and set aside for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b><br></center></u><br>The Court of Appeals found respondent constructively dismissed for having been granted an increased three months leave instead of the three days leave he applied for.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The decision of the NLRC, First Division, dated December 21, 2001, is hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b> and the decision of Labor Arbiter Madjayran H. Ajan dated August 25, 1999 is hereby <b>REINSTATED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><u><b>The Issue</b></u><br></center><br>The main issue in this case is whether petitioner is personally liable for the monetary awards granted in favor of respondent arising from his alleged illegal termination.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of this Court</b><br></center></u><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>In <i>Santos v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court held that "A corporation is a juridical entity with legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it. The rule is that obligations incurred by the corporation, acting through its directors, officers and employees, are its sole liabilities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>To hold a director or officer personally liable for corporate obligations, two requisites must concur:&nbsp; (1) <b>complainant must allege in the complaint that the director or officer assented to patently unlawful acts of the corporation, or that the officer was guilty of gross negligence or bad faith</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and (2) <b>complainant must clearly and convincingly prove such unlawful acts,&nbsp; negligence or bad faith.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In <i>Carag v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court did not hold a director personally liable for corporate obligations because the two requisites are lacking, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Complainants did not allege in their complaint that Carag willfully and knowingly voted for or assented to any patently unlawful act of MAC. Complainants did not present any evidence showing that Carag willfully and knowingly voted for or assented to any patently unlawful act of MAC.</b> Neither did Arbiter Ortiguerra make any finding to this effect in her Decision.<br><br><b> Complainants did not also allege that Carag is guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of MAC. Complainants did not present any evidence showing that Carag is guilty of gross neglige</b>nce or bad faith in directing the affairs of MAC. Neither did Arbiter Ortiguerra make any finding to this effect in her Decision.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>To hold a director personally liable for debts of the corporation, and thus pierce the veil of corporate fiction, the bad faith or wrongdoing of the director must be established clearly and convincingly. </b>Bad faith is never presumed. Bad faith does not connote bad judgment or negligence. Bad faith imports a dishonest purpose. Bad faith means breach of a known duty through some ill motive or interest. Bad faith partakes of the nature of fraud. In <i>Businessday Information Systems and Services, Inc. v. NLRC</i>, we held:<br><br><blockquote>There is merit in the contention of petitioner Raul Locsin that the complaint against him should be dismissed.<b> A corporate officer is not personally liable for the money claims of discharged corporate employees unless he acted with evident malice and bad faith in terminating their employment. There is no evidence in this case that Locsin acted in bad faith or with malice </b>in carrying out the retrenchment and eventual closure of the company (Garcia vs. NLRC, 153 SCRA 640), hence, he may not be held personally and solidarily liable with the company for the satisfaction of the judgment in favor of the retrenched employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>In <i>McLeod v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court did not hold a director, an officer, and other corporations personally liable for corporate obligations of the employer because the second requisite was lacking.&nbsp; The Court held:<br><br><blockquote>A corporation is an artificial being invested by law with a personality <b>separate and distinct from that of its stockholders and from that of other corporations to which it may be connected.</b><br><br>While a corporation may exist for any lawful purpose, the law will regard it as an association of persons or, in case of two corporations, merge them into one, when its corporate legal entity is used as a cloak for fraud or illegality. This is the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction. The doctrine applies only when such corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime, or when it is made as a shield to confuse the legitimate issues, or where a corporation is the mere alter ego or business conduit of a person, or where the corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of another corporation.<br><br><b>To disregard the separate juridical personality of a corporation, the wrongdoing must be established clearly and convincingly. It cannot be presumed.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><b>&nbsp; </b>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Lowe, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court did not hold the officers personally liable for corporate obligations because the second requisite was lacking, thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is settled that in the absence of malice, bad faith, or specific provision of law, a director or an officer of a corporation cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Gustilo and Castro, as corporate officers of Lowe, have personalities which are distinct and separate from that of Lowe's. <b>Hence, in the absence of any evidence showing that they acted with malice or in bad faith in declaring Mutuc's position redundant, Gustilo and Castro are not personally liable for the monetary awards to Mutuc.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In<i> David v. National Federation of Labor Unions</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court did not hold an officer liable for corporate obligations because the second requisite was lacking.&nbsp; The Court held that "There was no showing of David willingly and knowingly voting for or assenting to patently unlawful acts of the corporation, or that David was guilty of gross negligence or bad faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Labor Arbiter, whose decision was reinstated by the Court of Appeals, stated that petitioner acted with malice and bad faith in constructively dismissing respondent. Thus, the Labor Arbiter held petitioner personally liable for the monetary awards to respondent.<br><br>This finding lacks basis. Based on the records, respondent failed to allege either in his complaint or position paper that petitioner, as Vice-President of VIPS Coffee Shop and Restaurant, acted in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Neither did respondent clearly and convincingly prove that petitioner, as Vice-President of VIPS Coffee Shop and Restaurant, acted in bad faith.&nbsp; <b>In fact, there was no evidence whatsoever to show petitioner's participation in respondent's alleged illegal dismissal. </b> Clearly, the twin requisites of allegation and proof of bad faith, necessary to hold petitioner personally liable for the monetary awards to respondent, are lacking.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Court deems it unnecessary to determine whether respondent was constructively dismissed.&nbsp; Besides, it appears from the records that VIPS Coffee Shop and Restaurant did not challenge the adverse Court of Appeals' decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 72115, rendering such decision final insofar as VIPS Coffee Shop and Restaurant is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition.&nbsp; We <b>MODIFY</b> the Court of Appeals' Decision, dated 16 September 2005, in CA-G.R.
