Appellee insisted that the crimes committed were three counts of qualified, and not simple, rape considering that "AAA" was a minor and the offender was her father,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and that the parties had already stipulated during pre-trial as regards the age of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On November 5, 2007, the appellate court rendered its Decision disposing thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated 28 November 2003 of the Regional Trial Court of Tayug, Pangasinan, Branch 51 in <i>Crim.

Hence, the said elements have been sufficiently alleged in the Informations and proven during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA held that appellant's denial is intrinsically weak and self-serving especially considering "AAA's" credible and straightforward testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>Both the appellant and the appellee opted not to file their supplemental briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, we must state that we entertain no doubt that appellant thrice raped his daughter, "AAA."&nbsp; We examined the records and we find "AAA's" testimony convincing and straightforward.&nbsp; We therefore have no reason to reverse or modify the findings of the trial court on the credibility of the victim's testimony, more so in this case where the said findings were affirmed by the CA.<br><br>We also agree with the ruling of the appellate court that appellant could be convicted of rape even without the medical certificate.&nbsp; "In rape cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the testimony of the victim, provided the testimony is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; As stated above, "AAA's" testimony was credible and convincing.&nbsp; As such, appellant's conviction could rest solely on it. The medical certificate would only serve as corroborative evidence.<br><br>We, however, agree with the appellant that both the medical certificate and "AAA's" birth certificate, although marked as exhibits during the pre-trial, should not have been considered by the trial court and the CA because they were not formally offered in evidence.&nbsp; Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court explicitly provides: "The court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.&nbsp; The purpose for which the evidence is offered must be specified."<br><br>In this case, we note that after the marking of the exhibits during pre-trial, the prosecution did not formally offer the said medical certificate or birth certificate in evidence.&nbsp; In fact, the prosecution rested its case after presenting the testimony of "AAA" without formally offering any documentary exhibit at all.<br><br>Our ruling in <i>Heirs of Pedro Pasag v. Parocha</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> is instructive, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The rule on formal offer of evidence is not a trivial matter. Failure to make a formal offer within a considerable period of time shall be deemed a waiver to submit it. Consequently, as in this case, any evidence that has not been offered shall be excluded and rejected.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Rules of Court [provide] that `the court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.'&nbsp; A formal offer is necessary because judges are mandated to rest their findings of facts and their judgment only and strictly upon the evidence offered by the parties at the trial.&nbsp; Its function is to enable the trial judge to know the purpose or purposes for which the proponent is presenting the evidence.&nbsp; On the other hand, this allows opposing parties to examine the evidence and object to its admissibility.&nbsp; Moreover, it facilitates review as the appellate court will not be required to review documents not previously scrutinized by the trial court.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, the trial court is bound to consider only the testimonial evidence presented and exclude the documents not offered.&nbsp; <b>Documents which may have been identified and marked as exhibits during pre-trial or trial but which were not formally offered in evidence cannot in any manner be treated as evidence.&nbsp; Neither can such unrecognized proof be assigned any evidentiary weight and value</b>. It must be stressed that there is a significant distinction between identification of documentary evidence and its formal offer.&nbsp; The former is done in the course of the pre-trial, and trial is accompanied by the marking of the evidence as an exhibit; while the latter is done only when the party rests its case.&nbsp; The mere fact that a particular document is identified and marked as an exhibit does not mean that it has already been offered as part of the evidence.&nbsp; It must be emphasized that any evidence which a party desires to submit for the consideration of the court must formally be offered by the party; otherwise, it is excluded and rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>We reiterated the above ruling in <i>Dizon v. Court of Tax Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> where one of the issues presented was whether the Court of Tax Appeals and the CA gravely abused their discretion "in allowing the admission of the pieces of evidence which were not formally offered" by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; In finding the case impressed with merit, the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Under Section 8 of RA 1125, the CTA is categorically described as a court of record.&nbsp; As cases filed before it are litigated <i>de novo</i>, party-litigants shall prove every minute aspect of their cases. Indubitably, no evidentiary value can be given the pieces of evidence submitted by the BIR, as the rules on documentary evidence require that these documents must be formally offered before the CTA. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [T]he presentation of the BIR's evidence is not a mere procedural technicality which may be disregarded considering that it is the only means by which the CTA may ascertain and verify the truth of BIR's claims against the Estate.&nbsp; The BIR's failure to formally offer these pieces of evidence, despite CTA's directives, is fatal to its cause.&nbsp; Such failure is aggravated by the fact that not even a single reason was advanced by the BIR to justify such fatal omission.&nbsp; This, we take against the BIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We are not unaware that there is an exception to the above-stated rule. In <i>People v. Mate</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Silvestre Mate (Mate) was charged with the crime of "Kidnapping for Ransom with Murder and Frustrated Murder."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> During arraignment, he entered a plea of "guilty."&nbsp; The court then propounded clarificatory questions to determine whether the accused understood the consequences of his plea.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, the trial court promulgated its decision finding the accused guilty as charged and sentenced him to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; It was only after the rendition of the judgment that the trial court conducted hearings for the reception of the prosecution's evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>From the prosecution's evidence, it would appear that during the investigation, Mate voluntarily made extra-judicial statements as contained in Exhibits "A," "B," and "J."&nbsp; Also, after his conviction, he appeared as witness for the prosecution against his co-accused where he affirmed his extra-judicial statements in Exhibits "A," "B," and "J."&nbsp; However, the state prosecutor failed to formally offer said exhibits.<br><br>In debunking the defense's contentions that the trial court erred in rendering a judgment of conviction on Mate even before the prosecution could present its evidence, and in considering the exhibits which were not formally offered, the Court held thus:<br><br><blockquote>The defense contends that the trial court committed a serious error in rendering judgment of conviction immediately after Mate had pleaded guilty to the crime charged on the basis of his plea of guilty and before receiving any evidence.&nbsp; While the trial court committed an error in rendering judgment immediately after the accused had pleaded guilty, and, thereafter, conducted hearings for the reception of the evidence for the prosecution, such an irregularity, is insufficient to justify the setting aside of the judgment of conviction, considering that it is supported by the judicial and extra-judicial confessions of the accused and by other evidence. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The defense questions also the failure of the state prosecutor Cornelio Melendres to make a formal offer of his exhibits, although they have been marked and identified. Such an oversight appears trivial because the entire evidence for the prosecution is recorded.&nbsp; Even without the exhibits which have been incorporated into the records of the case, the prosecution can still establish the case because the witnesses properly identified those exhibits and their testimonies are recorded.<br><br>Exhibits "A", "B", and "J" are all admissible against Mate because it appears with clarity that he voluntarily and spontaneously gave those narrations without compulsion from anybody.&nbsp; In fact, . . . when he testified against Ben Bohol he affirmed those narrations again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Mato v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we concretized the above ruling by holding that evidence, although not formally offered in evidence, may be "admitted and considered by the trial court provided the following requirements are present, <i>viz</i>:&nbsp; first, the same must have been duly identified by testimony duly recorded and, second, the same must have been incorporated in the records of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Ramos v. Dizon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we deemed the exhibits to have been incorporated into the records because they had been "presented and marked during the pre-trial of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, the first requisite was deemed satisfied because one of the parties therein explained the contents of the exhibits when interrogated by the respondents' counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, we find the rulings espoused in <i>People v. Mate</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> <i>Mato v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; and <i>Ramos v. Dizon</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> not applicable.&nbsp; Thus, we find that both the trial court and the CA erred in allowing the admission of "AAA's" medical certificate and birth certificate.&nbsp; The records would show that the lone witness for the prosecution did not identify the said exhibits or explain their contents.&nbsp; When "AAA" was placed on the witness stand, she merely stated that she was 13 years old.&nbsp; No reference was ever made to her birth certificate.&nbsp; The same is true with the medical certificate.&nbsp; After the marking during the pre-trial, the prosecution did not refer to it in any stage of the proceedings.&nbsp; Neither did it present the doctor who prepared the same.<br><br>Moreover, appellant's admission during the pre-trial that "AAA" was a minor below 12 years of age<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> would not help the prosecution's case.&nbsp; First, the trial court found this admission inaccurate as in fact, "AAA" was already above 12 years of age when the rape incident transpired on June 9, 2002.&nbsp; Second and more important, appellant's admission during pre-trial is not admissible as it violates&nbsp; Section 2, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court which explicitly provides that:&nbsp; "All agreements or admissions made or entered during the pre-trial conference shall be reduced in writing and signed by the accused and his counsel, otherwise they cannot be used against the accused. x x x." In <i>People v. Chua Uy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> we held that:<br><br><blockquote>Even granting for the sake of argument that RAMON admitted during the pre-trial that Exhibits "D" to "D-4", inclusive, and Exhibit "E" contained methamphetamine hydrochloride, the admission cannot be used in evidence against him <i>because the Joint Order was not signed by RAMON and his counsel.</i>&nbsp; Section 4 of Rule 118 of the Rules of Court expressly provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4.&nbsp; <i>Pre-trial agreements must be signed.</i>&nbsp; No agreement or admission made or entered during the pre-trial conference shall be used in evidence against the accused unless reduced to writing and signed by his counsel.<br></blockquote><br>Put in another way, to bind the accused the pre-trial order must be signed not only by him but his counsel as well.&nbsp; The purpose of this requirement is to further safeguard the rights of the accused against improvident or unauthorized agreements or admissions which his counsel may have entered into without his knowledge, as he may have waived his presence at the pre-trial conference; eliminate any doubt on the conformity of the accused of the facts agreed upon.</blockquote><br>In this case, records would show that the Pre-trial Order was not signed by both appellant and his counsel.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find that the prosecution did not present any satisfactory evidence to prove "AAA's" minority.&nbsp; "In the prosecution of criminal cases, x x x, nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which an accused is charged must be established.&nbsp; Qualifying circumstances or special qualifying circumstances must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself; otherwise, there can be no conviction of the crime in its qualified form.&nbsp; As a qualifying circumstance of the crime of rape, the concurrence of the victim's minority and her relationship to the accused-appellant must be both alleged and proven beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find appellant guilty only of three counts of simple rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the penalty for which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count. Accordingly, the awards of civil indemnity must be reduced to P50,000.00 and moral damages to P50,000.00.&nbsp; Finally, the award of exemplary damages is proper. "Exemplary damages may be awarded in criminal cases as part of civil liability if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; Relationship as an alternative circumstance under Article 15 of the Revised Penal Code is considered aggravating in the crime of rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the aggravating circumstance of relationship was duly established. Appellant himself admitted when he testified in open court that he is "AAA's" father.&nbsp; However, the award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages must be increased to P30,000.00 in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we find appellant Saturnino Villanueva <b>GUILTY</b> of three counts of simple rape and accordingly sentence him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and to indemnify his victim "AAA" the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, for each count.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.
