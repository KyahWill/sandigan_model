				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Before the Court is a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with a prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or a writ of preliminary injunction filed by petitioners Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).&nbsp; Petitioners pray that the Court declare as null and void the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated February 14, 2007 of respondent Judge Franco T. Falcon (Judge Falcon) in <i>Civil Case No. 71079</i>, which granted the application for preliminary injunction filed by respondent BCA International Corporation (BCA).&nbsp; Likewise, petitioners seek to prevent respondent Judge Falcon from implementing the corresponding Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated February 23, 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> issued pursuant to the aforesaid Order.<br><br>The facts of this case, as culled from the records, are as follows:<br><br>Being a member state of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Philippines has to comply with the commitments and standards set forth in ICAO Document No. 9303<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which requires the ICAO member states to issue machine readable travel documents (MRTDs)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> by April 2010.<br><br>Thus, in line with the DFA's mandate to improve the passport and visa issuance system, as well as the storage and retrieval of its related application records, and pursuant to our government's ICAO commitments, the DFA secured the approval of the President of the Philippines, as Chairman of the Board of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), for the implementation of the Machine Readable Passport and Visa Project (the MRP/V Project) under the Build-Operate-and-Transfer (BOT) scheme, provided for by Republic Act No. 6957, as amended by Republic Act No. 7718 (the BOT Law), and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).&nbsp; Thus, a Pre-qualification, Bids and Awards Committee (PBAC) published an invitation to pre-qualify and bid for the supply of the needed machine readable passports and visas, and conducted the public bidding for the MRP/V Project on January 10, 2000.&nbsp; Several bidders responded and BCA was among those that pre-qualified and submitted its technical and financial proposals.&nbsp; On June 29, 2000, the PBAC found BCA's bid to be the sole complying bid; hence, it permitted the DFA to engage in direct negotiations with BCA. On even date, the PBAC recommended to the DFA Secretary the award of the MRP/V Project to BCA on a BOT arrangement.<br><br>In compliance with the Notice of Award dated September 29, 2000 and Section 11.3, Rule 11 of the IRR of the BOT Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> BCA incorporated a project company, the Philippine Passport Corporation (PPC) to undertake and implement the MRP/V Project.<br><br>On February 8, 2001, a Build-Operate-Transfer Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (BOT Agreement) between the DFA and PPC was signed by DFA Acting Secretary Lauro L. Baja, Jr. and PPC President Bonifacio Sumbilla.&nbsp; Under the BOT Agreement, the MRP/V Project was defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>Section 1.02 MRP/V Project</i></b> - refers to all the activities and services undertaken in the fulfillment of the Machine Readable Passport and Visa Project as defined in the Request for Proposals (RFP), a copy of which is hereto attached as Annex A, including but not limited to project financing, systems development, installation and maintenance in the Philippines and Foreign Service Posts (FSPs), training of DFA personnel, provision of all project consumables (related to the production of passports and visas, such as printer supplies, etc.), scanning of application and citizenship documents, creation of data bases, issuance of machine readable passports and visas, and site preparation in the Central Facility and Regional Consular Offices (RCOs) nationwide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>On April 5, 2002, former DFA Secretary Teofisto T. Guingona and Bonifacio Sumbilla, this time as BCA President, signed an Amended BOT Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in order to reflect the change in the designation of the parties and to harmonize Section 11.3 with Section 11.8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the IRR of the BOT Law.&nbsp; The Amended BOT Agreement was entered into by the DFA and BCA with the conformity of PPC.<br><br>The two BOT Agreements (the original version signed on February 8, 2001 and the amended version signed April 5, 2002) contain substantially the same provisions except for seven additional paragraphs in the whereas clauses and two new provisions - Section 9.05 on Performance and Warranty Securities and Section 20.15 on Miscellaneous Provisions.&nbsp; The two additional provisions are quoted below:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>Section 9.05</i></b>.&nbsp; The PPC has posted in favor of the DFA the performance security required for Phase 1 of the MRP/V Project and shall be deemed, for all intents and purposes, to be full compliance by BCA with the provisions of this Article 9.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><i>Section 20.15</i></b>&nbsp; It is clearly and expressly understood that BCA may assign, cede and transfer all of its rights and obligations under this Amended BOT Agreement to PPC, as fully as if PPC is the original signatory to this Amended BOT Agreement, provided however that BCA shall nonetheless be jointly and severally liable with PPC for the performance of all the obligations and liabilities under this Amended BOT Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>Also modified in the Amended BOT Agreement was the Project Completion date of the MRP/V Project which set the completion of the implementation phase of the project within 18 to 23 months from the date of effectivity of the Amended BOT Agreement as opposed to the previous period found in the original BOT Agreement which set the completion within 18 to 23 months from receipt of the NTP (Notice to Proceed) in accordance with the Project Master Plan.<br><br>On April 12, 2002, an Assignment Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> was executed by BCA and PPC, whereby BCA assigned and ceded its rights, title, interest and benefits arising from the Amended BOT Agreement to PPC.<br><br>As set out in Article 8 of the original and the Amended BOT Agreement, the MRP/V Project was divided into six phases:<br><br><blockquote><b>Phase 1.&nbsp; Project Planning Phase</b> - The Project Proponent [BCA] shall prepare detailed plans and specifications in accordance with Annex A of this [Amended] BOT Agreement within three (3) months from issuance of the NTP (Notice to Proceed) [from the date of effectivity of this Amended BOT Agreement].&nbsp; This phase shall be considered complete upon the review, acceptance and approval by the DFA of these plans and the resulting Master Plan, including the Master Schedule, the business process specifications, the acceptance criteria, among other plans.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The DFA must approve all detailed plans as a condition precedent to the issuance of the CA [Certificate of Acceptance] for Phase 1.<br><br><b>Phase 2.&nbsp; Implementation of the MRP/V Project at the Central Facility</b> - Within six (6) months from issuance of the CA for Phase 1, the PROJECT PROPONENT [BCA] shall complete the implementation of the MRP/V Project in the DFA Central Facility, and establish the network design between the DFA Central Facility, the ten (10) RCOs [Regional Consular Offices] and the eighty (80) FSPs [Foreign Service Posts].<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Phase 3.&nbsp; Implementation of the MRP/V Project at the Regional Consular Offices</b> - This phase represents the replication of the systems as approved from the Central Facility to the RCOs throughout the country, as identified in the RFP [Request for Proposal]. The approved systems are those implemented, evaluated, and finally approved by DFA as described in Phase 1.&nbsp; The Project Proponent [BCA] will be permitted to begin site preparation and the scanning and database building operations in all offices as soon as the plans are agreed upon and accepted.&nbsp; This includes site preparation and database building operations in these Phase-3 offices.<br><br>Within six (6) months from issuance of CA for Phase 2, the Project Proponent [BCA] shall complete site preparation and implementation of the approved systems in the ten (10) RCOs, including a fully functional network connection between all equipment at the Central Facility and the RCOs.<br><br><b>Phase 4.&nbsp; Full Implementation, including all Foreign Service Posts</b> - Within three (3) to eight (8) months from issuance of the CA for Phase-3, the Project Proponent [BCA] shall complete all preparations and fully implement the approved systems in the eighty (80) FSPs, including a fully functional network connection between all equipment at the Central Facility and the FSPs. Upon satisfactory completion of Phase 4, a CA shall be issued by the DFA.<br><br><b>Phase 5.&nbsp; In Service Phase</b> - Operation and maintenance of the complete MRP/V Facility to provide machine readable passports and visas in all designated locations around the world.<br><br><b>Phase 6.&nbsp; Transition/Turnover</b> - Transition/Turnover to the DFA of all operations and equipment, to include an orderly transfer of ownership of all hardware, application system software and its source code and/or licenses (subject to Section 5.02 [H]), peripherals, leasehold improvements, physical and computer security improvements, Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems, and all other MRP/V facilities shall commence at least six (6) months prior to the end of the [Amended] BOT Agreement.&nbsp; The transition will include the training of DFA personnel who will be taking over the responsibilities of system operation and maintenance from the Project Proponent [BCA].&nbsp; The Project Proponent [BCA] shall bear all costs related to this transfer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Words in brackets appear in the Amended BOT Agreement)</blockquote><br>To place matters in the proper perspective, it should be pointed out that both the DFA and BCA impute breach of the Amended BOT Agreement against each other.<br><br>According to the DFA, delays in the completion of the phases permeated the MRP/V Project due to the submission of deficient documents as well as intervening issues regarding BCA/PPC's supposed financial incapacity to fully implement the project.<br><br>On the other hand, BCA contends that the DFA failed to perform its reciprocal obligation to issue to BCA a Certificate of Acceptance of Phase 1 within 14 working days of operation purportedly required by Section 14.04 of the Amended BOT Agreement. BCA bewailed that it took almost three years for the DFA to issue the said Certificate allegedly because every appointee to the position of DFA Secretary wanted to review the award of the project to BCA.&nbsp; BCA further alleged that it was the DFA's refusal to approve the location of the DFA Central Facility which prevented BCA from proceeding with Phase 2 of the MRP/V Project.<br><br>Later, the DFA sought the opinion of the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the appropriate legal actions in connection with BCA's alleged delays in the completion of the MRP/V Project.&nbsp; In a Letter dated February 21, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the DOJ opined that the DFA should issue a final demand upon BCA to make good on its obligations, specifically on the warranties and responsibilities regarding the necessary capitalization and the required financing to carry out the MRP/V Project.&nbsp; The DOJ used as basis for said recommendation, the Letter dated April 19, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of DOF Secretary Juanita Amatong to then DFA Secretary Delia Albert stating, among others, that BCA may not be able to infuse more capital into PPC to use for the completion of the MRP/V Project.<br><br>Thus, on February 22, 2005, DFA sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to BCA, through its project company PPC, invoking BCA's financial warranty under Section 5.02(A) of the Amended BOT Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The DFA required BCA to submit (a) proof of adequate capitalization (<i>i.e</i>., full or substantial payment of stock subscriptions); (b) a bank guarantee indicating the availability of a credit facility of P700 million; and (c) audited financial statements for the years 2001 to 2004.<br><br>In reply to DFA's letter, BCA, through PPC, informed the former of its position that its financial capacity was already passed upon during the prequalification process and that the Amended BOT Agreement did not call for any additional financial requirements for the implementation of the MRP/V Project. Nonetheless, BCA submitted its financial statements for the years 2001 and 2002 and requested for additional time within which to comply with the other financial requirements which the DFA insisted on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>According to the DFA, BCA's financial warranty is a continuing warranty which requires that it shall have the necessary capitalization to finance the MRP/V Project in its entirety and not on a "per phase" basis as BCA contends.&nbsp; Only upon sufficient proof of its financial capability to complete and implement the whole project will the DFA's obligation to choose and approve the location of its Central Facility arise.&nbsp; The DFA asserted that its approval of a Central Facility site was not ministerial and upon its review, BCA's proposed site for the Central Facility was purportedly unacceptable in terms of security and facilities. Moreover, the DFA allegedly received conflicting official letters and notices<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> from BCA and PPC regarding the true ownership and control of PPC.&nbsp; The DFA implied that the disputes among the shareholders of PPC and between PPC and BCA appeared to be part of the reason for the hampered implementation of the MRP/V Project.<br><br>BCA, in turn, submitted various letters and documents to prove its financial capability to complete the MRP/V Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; However, the DFA claimed these documents were unsatisfactory or of dubious authenticity. Then on August 1, 2005, BCA terminated its Assignment Agreement with PPC and notified the DFA that it would directly implement the MRP/V Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; BCA further claims that the termination of the Assignment Agreement was upon the instance, or with the conformity, of the DFA, a claim which the DFA disputed.<br><br>On December 9, 2005, the DFA sent a Notice of Termination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to BCA and PPC due to their alleged failure to submit proof of financial capability to complete the entire MRP/V Project in accordance with the financial warranty under Section 5.02(A) of the Amended BOT Agreement.&nbsp; The Notice states:<br><br><blockquote>After a careful evaluation and consideration of the matter, including the reasons cited in your letters dated March 3, May 3, and June 20, 2005, and upon the recommendation of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the Department is of the view that your continuing default in complying with the requisite bank guarantee and/or credit facility, despite repeated notice and demand, is legally unjustified.<br><br>In light of the foregoing considerations and upon the instruction of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, the Department hereby formally TERMINATE (sic) the Subject Amended BOT Agreement dated 5 April 2005 (sic)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> effective 09 December 2005.&nbsp; Further, and as a consequence of this termination, the Department formally DEMAND (sic) that you pay within ten (10) days from receipt hereof, liquidated damages equivalent to the corresponding performance security bond that you had posted for the MRP/V Project.<br><br>Please be guided accordingly.</blockquote><br>On December 14, 2005, BCA sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> to the DFA demanding that it immediately reconsider and revoke its previous notice of termination, otherwise, BCA would be compelled to declare the DFA in default pursuant to the Amended BOT Agreement. When the DFA failed to respond to said letter, BCA issued its own Notice of Default dated December 22, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> against the DFA, stating that if the default is not remedied within 90 days, BCA will be constrained to terminate the MRP/V Project and hold the DFA liable for damages.<br><br>BCA's request for mutual discussion under Section 19.01 of the Amended BOT Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> was purportedly ignored by the DFA and left the dispute unresolved through amicable means within 90 days. Consequently, BCA filed its Request for Arbitration dated April 7, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. (PDRCI), pursuant to Section 19.02 of the Amended BOT Agreement which provides:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>Section 19.02&nbsp; Failure to Settle Amicably</i></b> - If the Dispute cannot be settled amicably within ninety (90) days by mutual discussion as contemplated under Section 19.01 herein, the Dispute shall be settled with finality by an arbitrage tribunal operating under International Law, hereinafter referred to as the "<i>Tribunal</i>", under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules contained in Resolution 31/98 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 15, 1976, and entitled "<i>Arbitration Rules on the United Nations Commission on the International Trade Law</i>".&nbsp; The DFA and the BCA undertake to abide by and implement the arbitration award.&nbsp; The place of arbitration shall be Pasay City, Philippines, or such other place as may mutually be agreed upon by both parties.&nbsp; The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the English language.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>As alleged in BCA's Request for Arbitration, PDRCI is a non-stock, non-profit organization composed of independent arbitrators who operate under its own Administrative Guidelines and Rules of Arbitration as well as under the United Nations Commission on the International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and other applicable laws and rules.&nbsp; According to BCA, PDRCI can act as an arbitration center from whose pool of accredited arbitrators both the DFA and BCA may select their own nominee to become a member of the arbitral tribunal which will render the arbitration award.<br><br>BCA's Request for Arbitration filed with the PDRCI sought the following reliefs:<br><br><blockquote>1. A judgment nullifying and setting aside the Notice of Termination dated December 9, 2005 of Respondent [DFA], including its demand to Claimant [BCA] to pay liquidated damages equivalent to the corresponding performance security bond posted by Claimant [BCA];<br><br>2. A judgment (a) confirming the Notice of Default dated December 22, 2005 issued by Claimant [BCA] to Respondent [DFA]; and (b) ordering Respondent [DFA] to perform its obligation under the Amended BOT Agreement dated April 5, 2002 by approving the site of the Central Facility at the Star Mall Complex on Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City, within five days from receipt of the Arbitral Award; and<br><br>3. A judgment ordering respondent [DFA] to pay damages to Claimant [BCA], reasonably estimated at P50,000,000.00 as of this date, representing lost business opportunities; financing fees, costs and commissions; travel expenses; legal fees and expenses; and costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator/s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>PDRCI, through a letter dated April 26, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> invited the DFA to submit its Answer to the Request for Arbitration within 30 days from receipt of said letter and also requested both the DFA and BCA to nominate their chosen arbitrator within the same period of time.<br><br>Initially, the DFA, through a letter dated May 22, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> requested for an extension of time to file its answer, "without prejudice to jurisdictional and other defenses and objections available to it under the law."&nbsp; Subsequently, however, in a letter dated May 29, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the DFA declined the request for arbitration before the PDRCI.&nbsp; While it expressed its willingness to resort to arbitration, the DFA pointed out that under Section 19.02 of the Amended BOT Agreement, there is no mention of a specific body or institution that was previously authorized by the parties to settle their dispute.&nbsp; The DFA further claimed that the arbitration of the dispute should be had before an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration body, and not before the PDRCI which has as its accredited arbitrators, two of BCA's counsels of record.&nbsp; Likewise, the DFA insisted that PPC, allegedly an indispensable party in the instant case, should also participate in the arbitration.<br><br>The DFA then sought the opinion of the DOJ on the Notice of Termination dated December 9, 2005 that it sent to BCA with regard to the MRP/V Project.<br><br>In DOJ Opinion No. 35 (2006) dated May 31, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the DOJ concurred with the steps taken by the DFA, stating that there was basis in law and in fact for the termination of the MRP/V Project.&nbsp; Moreover, the DOJ recommended the immediate implementation of the project (presumably by a different contractor) at the soonest possible time.<br><br>Thereafter, the DFA and the BSP entered into a Memorandum of Agreement for the latter to provide the former passports compliant with international standards.&nbsp; The BSP then solicited bids for the supply, delivery, installation and commissioning of a system for the production of Electronic Passport Booklets or e-Passports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>For BCA, the BSP's invitation to bid for the supply and purchase of e-Passports (the e-Passport Project) would only further delay the arbitration it requested from the DFA.&nbsp; Moreover, this new e-Passport Project by the BSP and the DFA would render BCA's remedies moot inasmuch as the e-Passport Project would then be replacing the MRP/V Project which BCA was carrying out for the DFA.<br><br>Thus, BCA filed a Petition for Interim Relief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> under Section 28 of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004 (R.A. No. 9285),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City, Branch 71, presided over by respondent Judge Falcon. In that RTC petition, BCA prayed for the following:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, BCA respectfully prays that this Honorable Court, before the constitution of the arbitral tribunal in PDRCI Case No. 30-2006/BGF, grant petitioner <i>interim</i> relief in the following manner:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; upon filing of this Petition, immediately issue an order temporarily restraining Respondents [DFA and BSP], their agents, representatives, awardees, suppliers and assigns (i) from awarding a new contract to implement the Project, or any similar electronic passport or visa project; or (ii) if such contract has been awarded, from implementing such Project or similar projects until further orders from this Honorable Court;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; after notice and hearing, issue a writ of preliminary injunction ordering Respondents [DFA and BSP], their agents, representatives, awardees, suppliers and assigns to desist (i) from awarding a new contract to implement the Project or any similar electronic passport or visa project; or (ii) if such contract has been awarded, from implementing such Project or similar projects, and to maintain the <i>status quo ante</i> pending the resolution on the merits of BCA's Request for Arbitration; and<br><br>(c)&nbsp; render judgment affirming the <i>interim</i> relief granted to BCA until the dispute between the parties shall have been resolved with finality.<br><br>BCA also prays for such other relief, just and equitable under the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>BCA alleged, in support for its application for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), that unless the DFA and the BSP were immediately restrained, they would proceed to undertake the project together with a third party to defeat the reliefs BCA sought in its Request for Arbitration, thus causing BCA to suffer grave and irreparable injury from the loss of substantial investments in connection with the implementation of the MRP/V Project.<br><br>Thereafter, the DFA filed an Opposition (to the Application for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) dated January 18, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> alleging that BCA has no cause of action against it as the contract between them is for machine readable passports and visas which is not the same as the contract it has with the BSP for the supply of electronic passports.&nbsp; The DFA also pointed out that the Filipino people and the government's international standing would suffer great damage if a TRO would be issued to stop the e-Passport Project.&nbsp; The DFA mainly anchored its opposition on Republic Act No. 8975, which prohibits trial courts from issuing a TRO, preliminary injunction or mandatory injunction against the bidding or awarding of a contract or project of the national government.<br><br>On January 23, 2007, after summarily hearing the parties' oral arguments on BCA's application for the issuance of a TRO, the trial court ordered the issuance of a TRO restraining the DFA and the BSP, their agents, representatives, awardees, suppliers and assigns from awarding a new contract to implement the Project or any similar electronic passport or visa project, or if such contract has been awarded, from implementing such or similar projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court also set for hearing BCA's application for preliminary injunction.<br><br>Consequently, the DFA filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the January 23, 2007 Order.&nbsp; The BSP, in turn, also sought to lift the TRO and to dismiss the petition.&nbsp; In its Urgent Omnibus Motion dated February 1, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the BSP asserted that BCA is not entitled to an injunction, as it does not have a clear right which ought to be protected, and that the trial court has no jurisdiction to enjoin the implementation of the e-Passport Project which, the BSP alleged, is a national government project under Republic Act No. 8975.<br><br>In the hearings set for BCA's application for preliminary injunction, BCA presented as witnesses, Mr. Bonifacio Sumbilla, its President, Mr. Celestino Mercader, Jr. from the Independent Verification and Validation Contractor commissioned by the DFA under the Amended BOT Agreement, and DFA Assistant Secretary Domingo Lucenario, Jr. as adverse party witness.<br><br>The DFA and the BSP did not present any witness during the hearings for BCA's application for preliminary injunction.&nbsp; According to the DFA and the BSP, the trial court did not have any jurisdiction over the case considering that BCA did not pay the correct docket fees and that only the Supreme Court could issue a TRO on the bidding for a national government project like the e-Passport Project pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 8975.&nbsp; Under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8975, the RTC could only issue a TRO against a national government project if it involves a matter of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a TRO is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise.<br><br>Thereafter, BCA filed an Omnibus Comment [on Opposition and Supplemental Opposition (To the Application for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction)] and Opposition [to Motion for Reconsideration (To the Temporary Restraining Order dated January 23, 2007)] and Urgent Omnibus Motion [(i) To Lift Temporary Restraining Order;

Most recently, we relaxed the rule on court hierarchy in the case of <i>Roque, Jr. v.

Custodio (who verified the Petition on behalf of the DFA) did not have personal knowledge of the facts of the case and was appointed to his position as Acting Secretary under purportedly irregular circumstances, we find that BCA failed to sufficiently prove such allegations.&nbsp; In any event, we have previously held that "[d]epending on the nature of the allegations in the petition, the verification may be based either purely on personal knowledge, or entirely on authentic records, or on both sources."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The alleged lack of personal knowledge of Mr. Custodio (which, as we already stated, BCA failed to prove) would not necessarily render the verification defective for he could have verified the petition purely on the basis of authentic records.<br><br>As for the assertion that the partial verification of Assistant Governor and General Counsel Juan de Zuniga, Jr. was for the purpose of misleading this Court, BCA likewise failed to adduce evidence on this point.&nbsp; Good faith is always presumed. Paragraph 3 of Mr. Zuniga's verification indicates that his partial verification is due to the fact that he is verifying only the allegations in the petition peculiar to the BSP.&nbsp; We see no reason to doubt that this is the true reason for his partial or selective verification.<br><br>In sum, BCA failed to successfully rebut the presumption that the official acts (of Mr. Custodio and Mr. Zuniga) were done in good faith and in the regular performance of official duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Even assuming the verifications of the petition suffered from some defect, we have time and again ruled that "[t]he ends of justice are better served when cases are determined on the merits -- after all parties are given full opportunity to ventilate their causes and defenses -- rather than on technicality or some procedural imperfections."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, the Court may suspend or even disregard rules when the demands of justice so require.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>We now come to the substantive issues involved in this case.<br><br><b><i>On whether the trial court had jurisdiction<br> to issue a writ of preliminary injunction in <br>the present case</i></b><br><br>In their petition, the DFA and the BSP argue that respondent Judge Falcon gravely abused his discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when he issued the assailed orders, which effectively enjoined the bidding and/or implementation of the e-Passport Project. According to petitioners, this violated the clear prohibition under Republic Act No. 8975 regarding the issuance of TROs and preliminary injunctions against national government projects, such as the e-Passport Project.<br><br>The prohibition invoked by petitioners is found in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8975, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.&nbsp; <i>Prohibition on the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders, Preliminary Injunctions and Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions</i>. - No court, except the Supreme Court, shall issue any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction against the government, or any of its subdivisions, officials or any person or entity, whether public or private, acting under the government's direction, to restrain, prohibit or compel the following acts:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="95%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Acquisition, clearance and development of the right-of-way and/or site or location of any national government project;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Bidding or awarding of contract/project of the national government as defined under Section 2 hereof;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Commencement, prosecution, execution, implementation, operation of any such contract or project;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Termination or rescission of any such contract/project; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(e)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The undertaking or authorization of any other lawful activity necessary for such contract/project.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>This prohibition shall apply in all cases, disputes or controversies instituted by a private party, including but not limited to cases filed by bidders or those claiming to have rights through such bidders involving such contract/project.

No. 1818 and definitely not a repudiation of what I have earlier said, as my good friend clearly stated.&nbsp; But this is really an effort to improve both the scope and definition of the term "government projects" and to ensure that lower court judges obey and observe this prohibition on the issuance of TROs on infrastructure projects of the government.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Senator Cayetano</b>.&nbsp; That is why, Mr. President, I did try to explain why I would accept the proposed amendment, meaning the totality of the repeal of P.D. 1818 which is not found in the original version of the bill, because of my earlier explanation that the definition of the term `government infrastructure project' covers all of those enumerated in Section 1 of P.D. No. 1818. And the reason for that, as we know, is we do not know what else could be considered government infrastructure project in the next 10 or 20 years.<br><br>x x x&nbsp; So, using the Latin maxim of expression unius est exclusion alterius, which means what is expressly mentioned is tantamount to an express exclusion of the others, that is the reason we did not include particularly an enumeration of certain activities of the government found in Section 1 of P.D. No. 1818.&nbsp; Because to do that, it may be a good excuse for a brilliant lawyer to say `Well, you know, since it does not cover this particular activity, ergo, the Regional Trial Court may issue TRO.</blockquote><br>Using the foregoing discussions to establish that the intent of the framers of the law was to broaden the scope and definition of national government projects and national infrastructure projects, the DFA and the BSP submit that the said scope and definition had since evolved to include the e-Passport Project.&nbsp; They assert that the concept of "infrastructure" must now refer to any and all elements that provide support, framework, or structure for a given system or organization, including information technology, such as the e-Passport Project.<br><br>Interestingly, petitioners represented to the trial court that the e-Passport Project is a BOT project but in their petition with this Court, petitioners simply claim that the e-Passport Project is a national government project under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 8975.&nbsp; This circumstance is significant, since relying on the claim that the e-Passport Project is a BOT project, the trial court ruled in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>The prohibition against issuance of TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction under RA 8975 <b>applies only to national government infrastructure project covered by the BOT Law</b>, (RA 8975, Sec 3[b] in relation to Sec. 2).<br><br>The national government <b>projects covered under the BOT</b> are enumerated under Sec. 2 of RA6957, as amended, otherwise known as the BOT Law.

All the rules applicable to traditional infrastructure projects are also applicable to information technology projects. In fact, the MRP/V Project awarded to BCA under the BOT Law appears to include both civil works (<i>i.e</i>., site preparation of the Central Facility, regional DFA offices and foreign service posts) and non-civil works aspects (<i>i.e.</i>, development, installation and maintenance in the Philippines and foreign service posts of a computerized passport and visa issuance system, including creation of databases, storage and retrieval systems, training of personnel and provision of consumables).<br><br>In contrast, under Republic Act No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, which contemplates projects to be funded by public funds, the term "infrastructure project" was limited to only the "civil works component" of information technology projects.&nbsp; The non-civil works component of information technology projects would be treated as an acquisition of goods or consulting services as the case may be.<br><br>This limited definition of "infrastructure project" in relation to information technology projects under Republic Act No. 9184 is significant since the IRR of Republic Act No. 9184 has some provisions that are particular to infrastructure projects and other provisions that are applicable only to procurement of goods or consulting services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Implicitly, the civil works component of information technology projects are subject to the provisions on infrastructure projects while the technological and other components would be covered by the provisions on procurement of goods or consulting services as the circumstances may warrant.<br><br>When Congress adopted a limited definition of what is to be considered "infrastructure" in relation to information technology projects under the Government Procurement Reform Act, legislators are presumed to have taken into account previous laws concerning infrastructure projects (the BOT Law and Republic Act No. 8975) and deliberately adopted the limited definition. We can further presume that Congress had written into law a different treatment for information technology projects financed by public funds <i>vis-a-vis</i> privately funded projects for a valid legislative purpose.<br><br>The idea that the definitions of terms found in the Government Procurement Reform Act were not meant to be applied to projects under the BOT Law is further reinforced by the following provision in the IRR of the Government Procurement Reform Act:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 1. Purpose and General Coverage</b><br><br>This Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) Part A, hereinafter called "IRR-A," is promulgated pursuant to Section 75 of Republic Act No. 9184 (R.A. 9184), otherwise known as the "Government Procurement Reform Act" (GPRA), for the purpose of prescribing the necessary rules and regulations for the modernization, standardization, and regulation of the procurement activities of the government. <b>This IRR-A shall cover all fully domestically-funded procurement activities</b> from procurement planning up to contract implementation and termination, <b>except</b> <b>for the following</b>:<br><br>a) Acquisition of real property which shall be governed by Republic Act No. 8974 (R.A. 8974), entitled "An Act to Facilitate the Acquisition of Right-of-Way Site or Location for National Government Infrastructure Projects and for Other Purposes," and other applicable laws; and<br><br><b>b) Private sector infrastructure or development projects and other procurement covered by Republic Act No. 7718 (R.A. 7718), entitled "An Act Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector, and for Other Purposes," as amended: <i>Provided, however</i>, That for the portions financed by the Government, the provisions of this IRR-A shall apply.</b><br><br>The IRR-B for foreign-funded procurement activities shall be the subject of a subsequent issuance.

The Court deems it best to refrain from ruling on these matters since they should be litigated in the appropriate arbitration or court proceedings between or among the concerned parties.<br><br>One preliminary point, however, that must be settled here is whether BCA retains a right to seek relief against the DFA under the Amended BOT Agreement in view of BCA's previous assignment of its rights to PPC. Without preempting any factual finding that the appropriate court or arbitral tribunal on the matter of the validity of the assignment agreement with PPC or its termination, we agree with BCA that it remained a party to the Amended BOT Agreement, notwithstanding the execution of the assignment agreement in favor of PPC, for it was stipulated in the Amended BOT Agreement that BCA would be solidarily liable with its assignee.&nbsp; For convenient reference, we reproduce the relevant provision of the Amended BOT Agreement here:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>Section 20.15</i></b>. It is clearly and expressly understood that BCA may assign, cede and transfer all of its rights and obligations under this Amended BOT Agreement to PPC [Philippine Passport Corporation], as fully as if PPC is the original signatory to this Amended BOT Agreement, <b>provided however that BCA shall nonetheless be jointly and severally liable with PPC for the performance of all the obligations and liabilities under this Amended BOT Agreement. </b>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Furthermore, a review of the records shows that the DFA continued to address its correspondence regarding the MRP/V Project to both BCA and PPC, even after the execution of the assignment agreement. Indeed, the DFA's Notice of Termination dated December 9, 2005 was addressed to Mr. Bonifacio Sumbilla as President of both BCA and PPC and referred to the Amended BOT Agreement "executed between the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), on one hand, and the BCA International Corporation and/or the Philippine Passport Corporation (BCA/PPC)."&nbsp; At the very least, the DFA is estopped from questioning the personality of BCA to bring suit in relation to the Amended BOT Agreement since the DFA continued to deal with both BCA and PPC even after the signing of the assignment agreement. In any event, if the DFA truly believes that PPC is an indispensable party to the action, the DFA may take necessary steps to implead PPC but this should not prejudice the right of BCA to file suit or to seek relief for causes of action it may have against the DFA or the BSP, for undertaking the e-Passport Project on behalf of the DFA.<br><br>With respect to petitioners' contention that BCA will suffer no grave and irreparable injury so as to justify the grant of injunctive relief, the Court finds that this particular argument merits consideration.<br><br>The BOT Law as amended by Republic Act No. 7718, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Contract Termination</i>. - <b>In the event that a project is revoked, cancelled or terminated by the Government through no fault of the project proponent</b> or by mutual agreement, the <b>Government shall</b> <b>compensate the said project proponent for its actual expenses</b> incurred in the project <b>plus a reasonable rate of return</b> thereon not exceeding that stated in the contract as of the date of such revocation, cancellation or termination: <i>Provided</i>, That the interest of the Government in this instances shall be duly insured with the Government Service Insurance System [GSIS] or any other insurance entity duly accredited by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That the cost of the insurance coverage shall be included in the terms and conditions of the bidding referred to above.<br><br><b>In the event that the government defaults</b> on certain major obligations in the contract and such failure is not remediable or if remediable shall remain unremedied for an unreasonable length of time, <b>the project proponent/contractor may</b>, by prior notice to the concerned national government agency or local government unit specifying the turn-over date, <b>terminate the contract</b>.

However, even if we hypothetically accept BCA's contention that the DFA terminated the Amended BOT Agreement without any default or wrongdoing on BCA's part, it is not indubitable that BCA is entitled to injunctive relief.<br><br>The BOT Law expressly allows the government to terminate a BOT agreement, even without fault on the part of the project proponent, subject to the payment of the actual expenses incurred by the proponent plus a reasonable rate of return.<br><br>Under the BOT Law and the Amended BOT Agreement, in the event of default on the part of the government (in this case, the DFA) or on the part of the proponent, the non-defaulting party is allowed to terminate the agreement, again subject to proper compensation in the manner set forth in the agreement.<br><br>Time and again, this Court has held that to be entitled to injunctive relief the party seeking such relief must be able to show grave, irreparable injury that is not capable of compensation. &nbsp;<br><br>In <i>Lopez v.

Two requisites are necessary if a preliminary injunction is to issue, namely, the existence of a right to be protected and the facts against which the injunction is to be directed are violative of said right. In particular, for a writ of preliminary injunction to issue, the existence of the right and the violation must appear in the allegation of the complaint <b>and a preliminary injunction is proper only when the plaintiff (private respondent herein) appears to be entitled to the relief demanded in his complaint.</b>&nbsp; (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>We reiterated this point in <i>Transfield Philippines, Inc. v.

In seeking to enjoin the government from awarding or implementing a machine readable passport project or any similar electronic passport or visa project and praying for the maintenance of the <i>status quo ante</i> pending the resolution on the merits of BCA's Request for Arbitration, BCA effectively seeks to enjoin the termination of the Amended BOT Agreement for the MRP/V Project.<br><br>There is no doubt that the MRP/V Project is a project covered by the BOT Law and, in turn, considered a "national government project" under Republic Act No. 8795.&nbsp; Under Section 3(d) of that statute, trial courts are prohibited from issuing a TRO or writ of preliminary injunction against the government to restrain or prohibit the termination or rescission of any such national government project/contract.<br><br>The rationale for this provision is easy to understand. For if a project proponent - that the government believes to be in default - is allowed to enjoin the termination of its contract on the ground that it is contesting the validity of said termination, then the government will be unable to enter into a new contract with any other party while the controversy is pending litigation.&nbsp; Obviously, a court's grant of injunctive relief in such an instance is prejudicial to public interest since government would be indefinitely hampered in its duty to provide vital public goods and services in order to preserve the private proprietary rights of the project proponent.&nbsp; On the other hand, should it turn out that the project proponent was not at fault, the BOT Law itself presupposes that the project proponent can be adequately compensated for the termination of the contract.&nbsp; Although BCA did not specifically pray for the trial court to enjoin the termination of the Amended BOT Agreement and thus, there is no direct violation of Republic Act No. 8795, a grant of injunctive relief as prayed for by BCA will indirectly contravene the same statute.<br><br>Verily, there is valid reason for the law to deny preliminary injunctive relief to those who seek to contest the government's termination of a national government contract.&nbsp; The only circumstance under which a court may grant injunctive relief is the existence of a matter of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a TRO or injunctive writ is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will result.<br><br>Now, BCA likewise claims that unless it is granted injunctive relief, it would suffer grave and irreparable injury since the bidding out and award of the e-Passport Project would be tantamount to a violation of its right against deprivation of property without due process of law under Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution.&nbsp; We are unconvinced.<br><br>Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution provides "[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws."&nbsp; Ordinarily, this constitutional provision has been applied to the exercise by the State of its sovereign powers such as, its legislative power,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> police power,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> or its power of eminent domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the State action being assailed is the DFA's termination of the Amended BOT Agreement with BCA.&nbsp; Although the said agreement involves a public service that the DFA is mandated to provide and, therefore, is imbued with public interest, the relationship of DFA to BCA is primarily contractual and their dispute involves the adjudication of contractual rights.&nbsp; The propriety of the DFA's acts, in relation to the termination of the Amended BOT Agreement, should be gauged against the provisions of the contract itself and the applicable statutes to such contract. These contractual and statutory provisions outline what constitutes due process in the present case.&nbsp; In all, BCA failed to demonstrate that there is a constitutional issue involved in this case, much less a constitutional issue of extreme urgency.<br><br>As for the DFA's purported failure to appropriate sufficient amounts in its budget to pay for liquidated damages to BCA, this argument does not support BCA's position that it will suffer grave and irreparable injury if it is denied injunctive relief.&nbsp; The DFA's liability to BCA for damages is contingent on BCA proving that it is entitled to such damages in the proper proceedings.&nbsp; The DFA has no obligation to set aside funds to pay for liquidated damages, or any other kind of damages, to BCA until there is a final and executory judgment in favor of BCA.&nbsp; It is illogical and impractical for the DFA to set aside a significant portion of its budget for an event that may never happen when such idle funds should be spent on providing necessary services to the populace.&nbsp; For if it turns out at the end of the arbitration proceedings that it is BCA alone that is in default, it would be the one liable for liquidated damages to the DFA under the terms of the Amended BOT Agreement.<br><br>With respect to BCA's allegation that the e-Passport Project is grossly disadvantageous to the Filipino people since it is the government that will be spending for the project unlike the MRP/V Project which would have been privately funded, the same is immaterial to the issue at hand. If it is true that the award of the e-Passport Project is inimical to the public good or tainted with some anomaly, it is indeed a cause for grave concern but it is a matter that must be investigated and litigated in the proper forum.&nbsp; It has no bearing on the issue of whether BCA would suffer grave and irreparable injury such that it is entitled to injunctive relief from the courts.<br><br>In all, we agree with petitioners DFA and BSP that the trial court's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, despite the lack of sufficient legal justification for the same, is tantamount to grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>To be very clear, the present decision touches only on the twin issues of (a) the jurisdiction of the trial court to issue a writ of preliminary injunction as an interim relief under the factual milieu of this case; and (b) the entitlement of BCA to injunctive relief.&nbsp; The merits of the DFA and BCA's dispute regarding the termination of the Amended BOT Agreement must be threshed out in the proper arbitration proceedings.&nbsp; The civil case pending before the trial court is purely for the grant of interim relief since the main case is to be the subject of arbitration proceedings.<br><br>BCA's petition for interim relief before the trial court is essentially a petition for a provisional remedy (<i>i.e</i>., preliminary injunction) ancillary to its Request for Arbitration in PDRCI Case No. 30-2006/BGF.&nbsp; BCA specifically prayed that the trial court grant it interim relief pending the constitution of the arbitral tribunal in the said PDRCI case. Unfortunately, during the pendency of this case, PDRCI Case No. 30-2006/BGF was dismissed by the PDRCI for lack of jurisdiction, in view of the lack of agreement between the parties to arbitrate before the PDRCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Philippine National Bank v.
