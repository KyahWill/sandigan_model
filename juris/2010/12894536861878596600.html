The Memorandum reads:<br><br><blockquote>Please be informed that during the Special Meeting of the Board of Directors, held last August 26, 2000, which was presided over by the outgoing Chairman, Engr. Jovencio S. Egos, it deliberated the issue of MISMANAGEMENT IN YOUR OPERATION - the non-monitoring/non-compliance on the application of the correct dosage of Chlorine to the system. Not only this month, August, that the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> called our attention to explain in writing, but we were also called last year, when there was an outbreak in dysentery wherein you made promises to them, that this will not happen again, and this time, the issue is purely mismanagement.<br><br>To this effect, you are hereby requested to submit your Letter [of] Explanation to the Board within forty-eight (48) hours after the receipt of this Memorandum. Failure to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors of your explanation and much so, if you will not submit it, the Board will take a drastic action against you and this shall be dealt with accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioner submitted his letter-explanation and claimed that he complied with all the recommendations of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i>. He shifted the blame to the Chlorinator and the Master Plumber who were&nbsp; directly responsible over the chlorination. He likewise asserted that the Board of Directors was equally culpable and accountable to the lapses committed by the Chlorinator and Master Plumber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 18 September 2000, the Board adopted Resolution No. 9 terminating the services of petitioner for loss of trust and confidence.

Petitioner added that the Master Plumber and the Chlorinator, who both admitted their lapses, were not even summoned and investigated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Respondents COWASSCO and its Board justified petitioner's dismissal as valid on the ground of loss of trust and confidence after finding; him guilty of mismanagement. Respondent also claimed to have observed due process in terminating petitioner's employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The labor arbiter'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> found petitioner's dismissal as illegal. The dispositive portion of the labor arbiter's decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring that complainant was illegally dismissed thereby ordering respondents COMMUNITY WATER &amp; SANITATION COOPERATIVE and the BOARD OF DIRECTORS to pay complainant the amount of THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY PESOS (P380,160.00) in the concept of separation pay, backwages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>The labor arbiter ruled that respondents failed to prove that there was mismanagement of operations on the part of petitioner to support the ground of loss of trust and confidence in dismissing the latter's employment. Moreover, the labor arbiter observed that petitioner was not accorded due process when only one incident of mismanagement was mentioned in the show-cause notice but petitioner was dismissed on the ground of several other incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, respondents appealed to the NLRC. In a Decision dated 25 June 2004, the NLRC reversed and set aside the labor arbiter's decision. It upheld.petitioner's dismissal as valid on the ground of loss of trust and confidence. The dispositive portion provides:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby REVERSED, SET ASIDE and VACATED and a new-one entered DISMISSING the case of illegal dismissal. Respondent COWASSCO is however ordered to pay complainant the sum of P14,400.00 by way of financial assistance. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Notably, the NLRC was mum on the issue of due process.<br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration but it was denied in a Resolution dated 17 November 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup><br><br>Petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals. Finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition on 21 November 2006. The appellate court held that petitioner was remiss in his duties and responsibilities as general manager of COWASSCO in failing to see to it that the correct dosage of chlorine was added to the water resource thus resulting in its contamination with <i>coliform</i> organisms. Hence, according to the appellate court, petitioner was rightfully dismissed on the ground of loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> However, the appellate court ordered respondents to pay nominal damages to petitioner amounting to P30,000.00 for failure to observe the due process requirement in the termination of an employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18] </sup><br><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' decision. Its denial prompted petitioner to elevate the case to this Court via petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Petitioner insists that respondents failed to prove that there was mismanagement on the part of petitioner resulting from the alleged non-monitoring/non-compliance on the application of the correct .dosage of <i>chlorine</i> in the water system. Thus, petitioner argues that it was not a sufficient basis for loss of trust and confidence, which is a cause for his termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Moreover, petitioner maintains that he was denied due process because the first notice requirement for dismissing an employee was not faithfully observed by respondents. Petitioner elucidates that the show-cause notice mentioned only of one incident, which respondents considered as constituting mismanagement, but in the resolution terminating petitioner, there&nbsp; were&nbsp; other&nbsp; incidents&nbsp; cited&nbsp; which&nbsp; petitioner was&nbsp; not&nbsp; previously informed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In fine, petitioner seeks to reinstate the labor arbiter's decision. Respondents&nbsp; allege&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner was validly dismissed for his numerous infractions, which were all mentioned in the letter dated 21 August 2000 sent to respondents by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Respondents reiterate that petitioner was afforded due process. Respondents explain that they sent a memorandum to petitioner requiring him to explain why no disciplinary action should be taken against him. Unsatisfied with this explanation, respondents conducted a formal investigation wherein petitioner was given the full opportunity to defend himself. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondents assert that petitioner is not entitled to his money claims because he was not illegally dismissed from service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The core issues to be resolved are: (1) whether petitioner was validly dismissed on the ground of loss of trust and confidence; and (2) whether the due process requirement for termination was observed.<br><br>The issues raised by petitioner are evidently factual in nature. By giving due coarse to his petition, this Court is not departing from the well-settled rule that questions of facts are not reviewable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The discordant findings between the Labor Arbiter and the NLR.C however open the door for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Respondents invoked loss of trust and confidence as a just cause for terminating petitioner from employment. Article 282(c) of the Labor Code allows an employer to terminate the services of an employee for fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or his duly authorized representative.<br><br>For there to be a valid dismissal based on loss of trust and confidence, the employee concerned must be holding a position of trust and confidence and there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner held the position of Geneva! Manager of COWASSCO prior to his termination. As General Manager, he was tasked the general operation of the cooperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Undoubtedly, petitioner held a position of trust and confidence. As correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, "the nature of petitioner's work as manager requires a substantial amount of trust and confidence reposed on him by his employer. He occupies a highly sensitive and critical position which involves a high degree of responsibility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Having established that petitioner is a managerial employee, we shall proceed to determine whether the guidelines for the application of loss of trust and confidence as a just cause for dismissal of an employee from the service were complied with, i.e., 1) loss of confidence should not be simulated; 2) it should not be used as subterfuge for causes which are improper, illegal or unjustified; 3) it may not be arbitrarily asserted in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary; and 4) it must be genuine, not a mere afterthought to justify earlier action taken in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The notice of termination stated that petitioner was terminated for loss of confidence premised on his alleged mismanagement resulting in the contamination of the water system in the municipality of Argao, Cebu. Records reveal that based on the laboratory tests conducted, the water provided by COWASSCO was contaminated.&nbsp; It appears that, there were indeed previous incidents relating to the water supply which petitioner failed to act upon.&nbsp; In 28 September 1998, there was no water supply. In 1999, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever, which was traceable to the water supply of COWASSCO.&nbsp; And finally, the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> summoned petitioner to explain the finding that the water supplied by COWASSCO is positive of <i>coliform</i> organisms.&nbsp; Despite numerous invitations on petitioner to appear before the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> to explain these lapses, petitioner failed to do so.<br><br>As the general manager, petitioner is tasked to perform key functions such as the monitoring of COWASSCO's day-to-day operation. Therefore, any lapse brought to the company's attention must be directly addressed by the manager. The NLRC aptly observed;<br><br><blockquote>xxx That complainant holds a very sensitive position cannot be over-emphasized. As General Manager, lie is tasked with the duty of delivering safe, clean and potable water to the consumers. In his hands therefore lies the health and even lives of the people of the Municipality of Argao. Even the slightest case of water contamination, (in this case, the presence of <i>coliform</i> organisms) if not treated immediately could result in an epidemic of epic proportions thus putting at risk the lives of thousands of innocent consumers. He cannot simply ignore the case with the wry remark "<i>Wa pa man kahay namatay</i>" (Nobody has died yet). He cannot also exculpate himself by saying that he already implemented the recommendations of the SB and the Board of Directors, nor can he wash his hands by saying that it was the fault of the Chiorinator/Reservoir Tender and Master Plumber. As earlier pointed out, the job of General Manager of a water service cooperative calls for a hands-on leader not a swivel chair executive who contents himself with issuing memos and office orders. He has to make himself visible in the field to keep the men working under him on their toes guarding against seepage of contaminated water. This is the kind of General Manager that respondents want, not the herein complainant who was quick to pass the buck to the Board of Directors under the principle of command responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote><br>For breach of trust to constitute a valid cause for dismissal, it must be willful, meaning it must be done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Petitioner did not deny that lie was remiss in his duties, particularly in monitoring the application of the correct dosage of chlorine in. the water system. What he did was to shift the blame to his subordinates -- the Chlorinator and Master Plumber. During the investigation however, it appears that petitioner did not even bother to impose disciplinary action against these erring employees. As manager, petitioner should have paid close attention to the persistent problem of chlorination given the fact that the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> had repeatedly called his attention on the matter.<br><br>Petitioner's failure to closely monitor the contamination of water supply, his repeated failure to appear before the Sanggunaing Bayan to explain his lapses, and his overall indifference in performing the task assigned to him as general manager clearly demonstrate a willful breach of trust.<br><br>Aside from dismissal for a just cause, the other part of the two-tiered rule for a valid dismissal is the observance of due process.<br><br>Article 277(b) of the Labor Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 277. Miscellaneous provisions. - x x x (b) Subject to the constitutional right of workers to security of tenure and their right-to be protected against dismissal except for a just and authorized cause and without prejudice to the requirement of notice under Article 283 of this Code, the employer shall furnish the worker whose employment is sought to be terminated a written notice containing a statement of the causes for termination and shall afford the latter ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the assistance of his representative if he so desires in accordance with company rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to guidelines set by the Department of Labor and Employment x x x.</blockquote><br>In addition, Section 2, Rule XXIII, Book V of the Rules Implementing the Labor Code, requires the employer io furnish the employee with two written notices. These are: (1) a written notice served on the employee specifying the ground or grounds for termination, and giving to said employee reasonable opportunity within which to explain his side; and (2) a written notice of termination served on the employee indicating that upon due consideration of all the circumstances, grounds have been established to justify his termination.<br><br>The twin requirements of notice and hearing constitute the elements of due process in cases of employee's dismissal. The requirement of notice is intended to inform the employee concerned of the employer's intent to dismiss and the reason for the proposed dismissal. Upon the other hand the requirement of hearing affords the employee an opportunity to answer his employer's charges against him and accordingly to defend himself therefrom before dismissal is effected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; On these essentials of due process, we modify the findings of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals observed that petitioner was not afforded a hearing or conference before the termination was effected. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is however belied by the evidence presented by respondents. Petitioner was in fact given the opportunity to defend himself in an investigation conducted by the Board of Directors on 12 September 2000. In the presence of the Board of Directors, petitioner insisted that he and the Board of Directors are equally culpable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner however failed to squarely address the issue of his mismanagement.<br><br>Petitioner also harps on the inclusion of several other incidents in the notice of termination which were not mentioned in the show cause notice. The simple fact that petitioner failed to closely monitor the application of chlorine, resulting in the contamination of the water system in Argao; Cebu, is a sufficient and valid ground for respondents to lose their trust and confidence on the management skills of petitioner. The invocation of an additional ground in the resolution terminating the services of petitioner, i.e., the failure to implement a Board Resolution providing for a Code of Ethical Standard to employees of COWASSCO, does not by itself constitute denial of due process. Petitioner was informed in the first memorandum regarding the incorrect application of chlorine, which was the more important ground by which his dismissal was premised.&nbsp; Petitioner did not make a categorical denial of this allegation against him. Instead of assuming responsibility over the lapses he committed, petitioner resorted to finger pointing, blaming the Master Plumber and Chlorinator for the incorrect dosage of chlorine. In the second notice, the issue of incorrect chlorination was also discussed in detail. The Board of Directors cited instances showing that petitioner had not properly safeguarded the well-being of the water consumers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Hence, it cannot be concluded that there was denial of due process. <br><br>The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard; it is the denial of this opportunity that constitutes violation of due process of&nbsp; law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as petitioner was given an opportunity to explain his side, the requirements of due process have been substantially complied with. WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated 21 November 2006 and the Resolution dated 28 May 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 00165 are <b>AFFIRMED</b> insofar as its findings of loss of trust and confidence are concerned, but it is <b>REVERSED</b> on its findings of lack of due process.
