CR-H.C. No. 01694 entitled <i>People of the Philippines v.

After presentation of evidence, the trial court resolved to deny the petitions for bail filed by the accused for lack of merit, except that of accused Yap-Obeles who was granted bail for his temporary liberty in the amount of PhP 300,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Likewise before trial on the merits, the prosecution sought the discharge of accused Palapar as a state witness which, after due hearing and despite the opposition of his co-accused, was granted by the trial court through a Resolution dated July 3, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Trial on the merits finally commenced on March 27, 2001.<br><br>During the trial, the prosecution offered the testimonies of Fritzie So (Fritzie), Dexter So (Dexter), P/Sr. Insp. Fernando Ortega (P/Sr. Insp. Ortega), Atty. Florimond Rous (Atty. Rous) and Palapar. On the other hand, the defense presented as its witnesses Yap-Obeles, Morales, and Bautista, the accused-appellant.<br><br><center><b>Version of the Prosecution</b><br></center><br>A summary of the facts according to the prosecution is as follows:<br><br>On November 12, 2000, at around 12 noon to 1 o'clock in the afternoon, Fritzie was inside their store located at 2485 Taft Avenue, Pasay City. She was with her brothers Dexter and Kingsley So, and her mother, Lolita So, when they noticed a grey Toyota Corolla car and a black Mitsubishi Adventure going around their place. The cars were driven by men later identified as Palapar and Yap-Obeles, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Yap-Obeles, a doctor by profession and a businessman, had been known to the So family for 10 years. He had also been a tenant for six months at the So family's apartment located at the back of the family's hardware store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>After a while, Fritzie noticed that the Toyota Corolla stopped in front of the store while the Mitsubishi Adventure parked some two meters away. Three (3) armed men then alighted from the Toyota Corolla and entered the store. Two (2) of the armed men, later identified as Morales and accused Luis Miranda, poked their guns at Fritzie's brothers and mother and warned them not to report the incident to the police. The remaining armed man, later identified as alias "Centes," forcibly took and carried Fritzie from the store and forced her to board the Toyota Corolla. The car then sped towards the direction of Baclaran, followed by the Mitsubishi Adventure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On board the vehicle, Fritzie noticed that aside from her, there were five (5) other persons inside the car: Palapar, the driver, Morales, and three (3) other unidentified men. Fritzie was seated between Morales and an unidentified man. During the ride, Fritzie was blindfolded and the blindfold was not removed until they reached the safe house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, after Fritzie was abducted from the store, Dexter called up the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Pasay City Police Station to report the incident but was advised to go directly to the police headquarters. At around 1:45 in the afternoon, or 15 minutes after Fritzie's abduction was reported to the police, Mrs. Lolita So received a telephone call from the armed men who informed her that they had Fritzie. Dexter also received similar calls from the kidnappers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>At 2:00 in the afternoon of November 12, 2000, Dexter went to the CID of the Pasay City Police where he was referred to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) and he was able to talk to Colonel Michael Ray Aquino (Col. Aquino) through the telephone. Col. Aquino told Dexter that his men would arrive at their house later that evening to coordinate with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>When Dexter returned home from the office of the CID, he received a call from the kidnappers who demanded PhP 8 million for the release of Fritzie. Dexter told the caller that he and his family could not raise such amount although they would try their best to look for such amount. The caller replied that Dexter better do something as he would call back and if they fail to raise the amount, Dexter would find the corpse or dead body of his sister in Pampanga. This threat made Dexter and his mother so afraid that they could not sleep or eat thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>When the abductors arrived at their destination in San Nicolas, Bacoor, Cavite, Fritzie was told to alight and later brought inside a room. When the blindfold was removed, she noticed that the persons who abducted her were the same ones attending to the safe house. She identified them as Palapar, Yap-Obeles, a certain alias "Roy" and alias "Centes," Luis Miranda, Morales, and accused-appellant Bautista.<br><br>Fritzie was kept inside one of the rooms in the safe house. She was allowed to go and use the comfort room for her personal need. But while at the safe house, she noticed that all of her abductors tried to hide their faces from her but, nonetheless, she recognized and remembered one of them as accused-appellant Bautista.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Later that night, one of the abductors, identified by Fritzie as the accused alias "Roy," entered her room and angrily told her that her family reported her abduction to the <i>barangay</i> authorities and did not make any arrangements for the payment of the ransom money. Roy then told Fritzie that they would just kill her. Because of such threat, she became so afraid that she cried for a long time for fear that she would really be killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>After several negotiations, Dexter was able to bargain for the payment of PhP 1 million ransom for the release of his sister. He agreed to meet with the kidnappers at the Magallanes Supermarket along the South Expressway at 4:00 in the afternoon on November 14, 2000. The kidnappers instructed him to lower down the windshields of his car, not to report the meeting to the police, and to bring the exact amount of ransom money in a travelling bag; otherwise, something will happen to his sister. Subsequently, the kidnappers changed the location and instead instructed him to bring the money to the Magallanes Bridge, not the Magallanes Supermarket, particularly at the broken post situated beside a billboard of Guess on top of the same bridge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>When Dexter arrived at the place designated by the kidnappers, he threw the money bag along the street near the bridge, after which the kidnapper called him in his cellphone and Dexter was told to pick up the bag and throw it on the road underneath the bridge. As instructed, Dexter dropped the bag and he suddenly saw someone catch the bag. He later identified accused-appellant Bautista as the person who caught the bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After delivering the ransom money, Dexter went home. Thereupon, he received a call from the kidnapper telling him that the money was complete and that his sister, Fritizie, would be released after an hour. The kidnappers gave Fritzie PhP 1,000 for taxi fare and at around 8:30 in the evening of November 14, 2000, she finally arrived home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>That night, alias "Roy" received a phone call from Yap-Obeles instructing him to go to his (Yap-Obeles) warehouse in Paco, Manila. Roy answered that he would instead send Palapar.&nbsp; Upon Roy's instructions, Palapar went to the warehouse and found Yap-Obeles, accused-appellant, and accused-appellant's sister, Doris, who is also Yap-Obeles' wife, waiting for him. Yap-Obeles and Doris gave Palapar PhP 300,000 wrapped in a yellow plastic bag, with instructions to deliver it to Roy as his share in the ransom money.&nbsp; Palapar did as told and was in turn given PhP 7,000 by Roy as payment for his services as the driver of the group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On November 15, 2000, two teams were designated by Col. Cesar Mancao of the PAOCTF to investigate the kidnapping of Fritzie. One team was headed by P/Sr. Insp. Ortega and the other by P/Col. Tucay. The following day, at about 4:00 in the morning, Col. Mancao conducted a briefing of the teams informing them that the PAOCTF was able to trace a call made by Palapar to a certain Marilyn Pena, a reported neighbor of Palapar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The teams were then sent to scout the area and found a person fitting the description of Palapar. Palapar informed P/Col. Tucay that he would cooperate with the task force in the apprehension of the persons involved in the kidnapping.<br><br>Palapar disclosed that the plan to kidnap Fritzie was hatched in a meeting among the group which, among others, included Yap-Obeles and Bautista.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Further, he narrated that on November 10, 2000, he, Luis Miranda, and Roy even went to the hardware store of the victim to familiarize themselves with the appearance of Fritzie and with the vicinity of the hardware store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He pointed to Yap-Obeles as the mastermind and financier of the kidnapping and also mentioned the names and whereabouts of the other persons involved in the kidnapping.<br><br>Relying on this information, the teams proceeded to Pier 4, North Harbor to search for a certain person, who was subsequently identified as Morales. They proceeded to a house pointed to by Palapar as the residence of Morales, but the person who opened the door of the house was not Morales. Instead, this person pointed to the whereabouts of Morales, and he (Morales) was subsequently invited by the team of PAOCTF officers to give his side on his alleged involvement in the kidnapping incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Next, the teams proceeded to locate a certain Yap-Obeles at 321 Southway Mansion in Manila and likewise invited him to go to Camp Crame. As a last stop, the team of P/Sr. Insp. Ortega dropped by the warehouse of Yap-Obeles at Paco, Manila to retrieve the motor vehicle and the red scooter involved in the kidnapping incident. At the warehouse, they met Yap-Obeles' wife, Doris Bautista, and asked her permission to bring both the scooter and the Mitsubishi Adventure to their office. Doris Bautista agreed and both vehicles were turned over to the Legal Investigation Division after said team arrived at the PAOCTF office in Camp Crame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The police then went after Roy, who was able to escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Bautista, on the other hand, was persuaded by his younger brother to surrender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The following day, the police called up Dexter saying that certain persons surrendered and others were arrested. He was requested to go to Camp Crame to identify the suspects. Upon arriving at Camp Crame, Dexter was shown a police line up and he identified two persons: first, accused-appellant Bautista as the one who received the money; and second, Yap-Obeles as the driver of the black Mitsubishi Adventure who followed the Toyota Corolla car that carried away his sister.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></center><br>Bautista's defense, on the other hand, was confined to an alibi, to wit:<br><br>In the evening of November 11, 2000, accused-appellant and his live-in partner, Janet Arida (Janet), left Manila on board a gray Honda City to attend the town fiesta in Gumaca which was scheduled on November 12, 2000. He stayed at Janet's house in Barangay Progreso, Gumaca, Quezon the entire day and only left for Manila the following day, November 13, 2000 at around 4:00 in the morning. He then reported for work the next day, November 14, 2000, at the Almighty Trading Corporation in Paco, Manila, a corporation owned by the family of Yap-Obeles, the husband of his younger sister, Doris.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>He denied knowledge of any of the accused, except Yap-Obeles, because of his marriage to his sister. But, he admitted that he fled to Bicol when he learned that Yap-Obeles was arrested fearing that he might be implicated as he was an employee of Yap-Obeles. Further, he admitted that he rented a vehicle for Yap-Obeles at a rent-a-car company and the said vehicle was delivered on November 10 or 11, 2000. Yap-Obeles allegedly provided the rent money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>But contrary to his initial testimony, the accused-appellant subsequently admitted knowing Palapar as early as second week of October 2000 when the latter went to the warehouse where accused-appellant was working. With the help of his younger brother and a certain Police Inspector Moya, accused-appellant eventually surrendered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>His alibi was corroborated by the mother of his live-in partner, Ludivina Arida. She testified that accused-appellant was indeed with her daughter on November 12, 2000 attending the fiesta, and that he left early in the morning of November 13, 2000.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted the appellant. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing facts and considerations, this Court hereby renders judgment finding the accused Roberto Yap-Obeles, Johnny Bautista y Bautista and Jerry Morales y Ursal all GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as principals in the crime of Kidnapping for Ranson, as this felony is defined and penalized under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and are sentenced each to death. The same accused are further ordered to restore and to pay jointly and severally the family of the victim Fritzie So the sum of Php1,000,000.00, by way of restitution, and the sum of Php200,000.00, as moral damages, plus costs of suit.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On March 18, 2009, the CA affirmed the judgment of the lower court with a modification as to the penalty. The CA noted that the passage of Republic Act No. 9346, otherwise known as "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of the Death Penalty in the Philippines," effectively proscribed the imposition of the death penalty. In lieu of which, the CA imposed <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility of parole, notwithstanding the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. The CA reasoned that a single indivisible penalty, like <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, is "applied by the courts regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is affirmed with the MODIFICATION that appellants are each sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Costs against the appellants.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Bautista contends in his <i>Brief</i> that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><blockquote>1. The court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in giving full credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses;<br><br>2. Assuming arguendo that the accused-appellant is guilty, the court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in finding that the accused-appellant acted in conspiracy with the other co-accused and in not finding that his participation in the commission of the crime was as a mere accomplice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>We sustain appellant's conviction.<br><br><b>Factual Findings of the Trial<br> Court should be Respected</b><br><br>In his <i>Brief</i>, accused-appellant argues that the trial court failed to consider several inconsistencies in the testimonies of the victim. Notably, he pounds on the fact that on cross-examination Fritzie stated that she had no personal knowledge of the participation of the accused-appellant in the alleged kidnapping for ransom. It is his position that Fritzie's identification was merely derived from the confession of the state witness, Palapar.<br><br>In addition, accused-appellant asserts that the trial court also failed to consider the material inconsistencies of the testimony of the victim's brother, Dexter, with regard to his (accused-appellant's) identification as the recipient of the ransom money.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>After a careful perusal of the records of this case, this Court finds no cogent reason to question the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.<br><br>It is a well-entrenched doctrine that the assessment of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses first hand and note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The trial court has the singular opportunity to observe the witnesses "through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready reply; or the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the sincere or the flippant or sneering tone, the heat, the calmness, the yawn, the sign, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, the carriage and mien."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>This rule admits of exceptions, however, such as when the trial court's findings of facts and conclusions are not supported by the evidence on record, or when certain facts of substance and value, likely to change the outcome of the case have been overlooked by the lower court, or when the assailed decision is based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> None of these exceptions exists in this case.<br><br>Moreover, the alleged inconsistencies in the declarations and testimony of the witnesses were sufficiently explained. The reason why Fritzie's affidavit did not mention accused-appellant's participation was because the affidavit was only limited to those who participated in the actual kidnapping. Likewise, as to the specific role of accused-appellant, Fritzie could only testify on what she heard about this from Palapar who was privy to the conspiracy to kidnap her. However, Fritzie categorically affirmed in open court that accused-appellant was among those who guarded her in the safe house. This observation indicates the complicity of accused-appellant in the kidnapping.<br><br>As to Dexter's contradicting affidavit and testimony, this was more than adequately explained, as well, when he testified in open court that his statement in the affidavit did not mean that he had no opportunity to recognize accused-appellant Bautista as the person who received the ransom money. It only mean that he will be able to identify the accused-appellant if he saw him again, viz:<br><br><blockquote>COURT:<br><br>Q:&nbsp; So would you still insist that you recognized Bautista as the one who catched (<i>sic</i>) or received the bag of money?<br><br>A: Yes, your honor.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; Then if you insist now that it was Bautista who catched (<i>sic</i>) or received the money, why is it that in your sworn statement you did not mention it and you mentioned that you did not recognize the one who received the money?<br><br>A: <b>When I threw the bag, I did not closely see him but when I see him again I can identify him, you Honor.<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></b> </b>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>It is quite common for a witness to recognize a malefactor better when there is a face-to-face confrontation during the hearing. Jurisprudence is cognizant of this situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Therefor, such testimonies prevail over the affidavits previously executed by the witnesses. It is settled that whenever there is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight considering that affidavits taken <i>ex parte</i> are inferior to testimony given in court, the former being almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Additionally, accused-appellant cannot plausibly bank on the minor inconsistencies in the testimonies, even if they do exist because such minor and insignificant inconsistencies tend to bolster, rather than weaken, the credibility of the witness for they show that his testimony was not contrived or rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Trivial inconsistencies do not rock the pedestal upon which the credibility of the witness rests, but enhances credibility as they manifest spontaneity and lack of scheming.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, accused-appellant was unable to prove any ill motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses. The presumption is that their testimonies were not moved by any ill will and was untainted by bias, and thus entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>Conspiracy was present</b><br><br>In addition, accused-appellant submits that his participation in the commission of the crime was merely that of an accomplice and that the finding of the trial court of conspiracy is in error. He argues that the prosecution failed miserably to prove the existence of a conspiracy.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Where all the accused acted in concert at the time of the commission of the offense, and it is shown by such acts that they had the same purpose or common design and were united in its execution, conspiracy is sufficiently established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It must be shown that all participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to indicate a common purpose or design to commit the felony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Pagalasan</i>, the Court elaborately discussed the concept of conspiracy, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Judge Learned Hand once called conspiracy "the darling of the modern prosecutor's nursery." There is conspiracy when two or more persons agree to commit a felony and decide to commit it. <b>Conspiracy as a mode of incurring criminal liability must be proven separately from and with the same quantum of proof as the crime itself. Conspiracy need not be proven by direct evidence.</b> After all, secrecy and concealment are essential features of a successful conspiracy. Conspiracies are clandestine in nature. <b>It may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, showing that they had acted with a common purpose and design.</b> Paraphrasing the decision of the English Court in Regina v. Murphy, conspiracy may be implied if it is proved that two or more persons aimed by their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their combined acts, though apparently independent of each other, were, in fact, connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment. <b>To hold an accused guilty as a co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity. There must be intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.</b><br><br>The United States Supreme Court in Braverman v. United States, held that the precise nature and extent of the conspiracy must be determined by reference to the agreement which embraces and defines its objects. For one thing, the temporal dimension of the conspiracy is of particular importance. Settled as a rule of law is that the conspiracy continues until the object is attained, unless in the meantime the conspirator abandons the conspiracy or is arrested. There is authority to the effect that the conspiracy ends at the moment of any conspirator's arrest, on the presumption, albeit rebuttable, that at the moment the conspiracy has been thwarted, no other overt act contributing to the conspiracy can possibly take place, at least as far as the arrested conspirator is concerned. The longer a conspiracy is deemed to continue, the greater the chances that additional persons will be found to have joined it. There is also the possibility that as the conspiracy continues, there may occur new overt acts. If the conspiracy has not yet ended, then the hearsay acts and declarations of one conspirator will be admissible against the other conspirators and one conspirator may be held liable for substantive crimes committed by the others.<br><br><b>Each conspirator is responsible for everything done by his confederates</b> which follows incidentally in the execution of a common design as one of its probable and natural consequences even though it was not intended as part of the original design. Responsibility of a conspirator is not confined to the accomplishment of a particular purpose of conspiracy but extends to collateral acts and offenses incident to and growing out of the purpose intended. Conspirators are held to have intended the consequences of their acts and by purposely engaging in conspiracy which necessarily and directly produces a prohibited result that they are in contemplation of law, charged with intending the result. <b>Conspirators are necessarily liable for the acts of another conspirator even though such act differs radically and substantively from that which they intended to commit.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> x x x&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Evidently, to hold an accused guilty as a co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity. There must be intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose. Responsibility of a conspirator is not confined to the accomplishment of a particular purpose of conspiracy but extends to collateral acts and offenses incident to and growing out of the purpose intended.<br><br>In this case, the evidence on record inscrutably shows the existence of a conspiracy between accused-appellant and his co-accused. The testimony of the state witness Palapar was replete with instances of accused-appellant's involvement with the kidnapping group considering: (a) accused-appellant was present at Chowking Malate when the kidnapping was being planned with the group;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (b) he was also with the group of Yap-Obeles immediately after the kidnapping attempt on a certain trader was foiled;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (c) he was the one who rented the gray Toyota Corolla that was used in the kidnapping;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>and (d) he was likewise present with Yap-Obeles and his wife, Doris, when the couple asked Palapar to deliver Roy's share of the ransom money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Taking these facts in conjunction with the testimony of Dexter, who testified that accused-appellant was the one who received the ransom money and apparently, was also the one giving him instructions, and that of Fritzie, who testified that accused-appellant was one of her guards at the safe house, then the commonality of purpose of the acts of accused-appellant together with the other accused can no longer be denied. Such acts have the common design or purpose to commit the felony of kidnapping for ransom.<br><br>Thus, accused-appellants' argument that he is a mere accomplice must fail. He is liable as a principal for being a co-conspirator in the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom under Art. 267 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 7659, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 267. <i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention</i>. -- Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death:<br><br><ol><li>If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than five days.</li><li>If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.</li><li>If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained; or if threats to kill him shall have been made.</li><li>If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, female or a public officer.</li></ol><br>The penalty shall be death penalty where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.<br><br>When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed.</blockquote><br>The prosecution has proved that the motive for the kidnapping was indeed to obtain ransom money for the victim. Ransom is money, price or consideration paid or demanded for the redemption of a captured person or persons; a payment that releases from captivity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In the instant case, the testimonies of the witnesses were more than sufficient to satisfy the motive of the accused-appellant and his co-conspirators to obtain ransom money from the victim's family.<br><br><b>Defense of Alibi cannot Stand</b><br><br>In a last attempt to avoid liability, accused-appellant relays an alibi, which, according to him, would be sufficient to acquit him when taken in light of his other arguments. The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>Consistently, this Court has declared that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the defense must establish the physical impossibility for the accused to be present at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The facts in this case illustrate that there was no physical impossibility for the accused-appellant to be at the scene of the crime, considering that Manila is just a short ride away from Gumaca, Quezon.<br><br>Physical impossibility takes into consideration not only the geographical distance between the scene of the crime and the place where the accused-appellant maintains where he was at, but more importantly, the accessibility between these two points - how this distance translates to number of hours of travel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Geographical distances may be taken judicial notice of, but this alone will not suffice for purposes of proving an alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>What is more, alibi is considered as one of the weakest defenses not only due to its inherent weakness and unreliability, but also because it is easy to fabricate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Nothing is more settled in criminal law jurisprudence than the doctrine that alibi cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony and identification of the accused by the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Such is the situation in the instant case. Accused-appellant was positively and categorically identified not only by the victim but as well as her brother. As has been consistently ruled by this Court, an affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness and alibi, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that accused-appellant fled to Bicol when he learned that Yap-Obeles was arrested by the authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In <i>People v. Deduyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this Court said that flight by the accused clearly evinces "consciousness of guilt and a silent admission of culpability. Indeed, the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the innocent are as bold as lion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In conclusion, in criminal cases such as the one on hand, the prosecution is not required show the guilt of the accused with absolute certainty. Only moral certainty is demanded, or that degree of proof which, to an unprejudiced mind, produces conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> We find that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proving the guilt of the accused-appellant for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with moral certainty.<br><br>With respect to the award of damages, the prevailing jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dictates the following amounts to be imposed: PhP 75,000 as civil indemnity which is awarded if the crime warrants the imposition of death penalty; PhP 75,000 as moral damages because the victim is assumed to have suffered moral injuries, without need of proof; and PhP 30,000 as exemplary damages.<br><br>Even though the penalty of death was not imposed, the civil indemnity of PhP 75,000 is still proper because the said award is not dependent on the actual imposition of the death penalty but on the fact that qualifying circumstances warranting the imposition of the death penalty attended the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Instead of the usual award of PhP 75,000 as moral damages without need of proof, this Court, however, sustains the award of the RTC of PhP 200,000 as moral damages for the ignominy and sufferings of Fritzie and her family have suffered due to the accused-appellant's act of detaining the victim in blindfold and mentally torturing her and her family into raising the ransom money.<br><br>And to set an example for the public good, accused-appellant should pay the victim PhP 30,000 as exemplary damages following prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 01694 finding accused-appellant Johnny Bautista guilty of the crime charged is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with<b> MODIFICATION</b>. In addition to the sum of PhP 1,000,000 as restitution for the ransom money and PhP 200,000 as moral damages, accused-appellant is likewise ordered to pay the victim the amount of PhP 75,000 as civil indemnity and PhP 30,000 as exemplary damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 2-25.
