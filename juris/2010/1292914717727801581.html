(<i>A.M. No. 01-1-03- SC, June 19, 2001</i>)<br><br>The period of appeal shall be interrupted by a timely motion for new trial or reconsideration. No motion for extension of time to file a motion for new trial or reconsideration shall be allowed. (emphasis, underscoring and italics supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 9. <i>Perfection of appeal; effect thereof</i>. - x x x.<br><br>A party's appeal by record on appeal is deemed perfected as to him with respect to the subject matter thereof upon the approval of the record on appeal filed in due time.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Opposing the motion, petitioner countered that a record on appeal is required only in proceedings where <i>multiple</i> appeals may arise, a situation not obtaining in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of September 2, 2008, the appellate court <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dismissed</span> petitioner's appeal, holding that since respondent's petition before the RTC "is classified as a special proceeding," petitioner should have filed <i>both</i> notice of appeal and a record on appeal within 30 days from receipt of the October 8, 2007 Order granting respondent's petition, and by not filing a record on appeal, petitioner "never perfected" its appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Its motion for reconsideration having been denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of December 22, 2008, petitioner filed the present petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 109 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure specifies the orders or judgments in special proceedings which may be the subject of an appeal, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Orders or judgments from which appeals may be taken</i>. - An interested person may appeal in special proceedings from an order or judgment rendered by a Court of First Instance or a Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, where such order or judgment:<br><br>(a) Allows or disallows a will;<br><br>(b) Determines who are the lawful heirs of a deceased person, or the distributive share of the estate to which such person is entitled;<br><br>(c) Allows or disallows, in whole or in part, any claim against the estate of a deceased person, or any claim presented on behalf of the estate in offset to a claim against it;<br><br>(d) Settles the account of an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian;<br><br>(e) Constitutes, in proceedings relating to the settlement of the estate of a deceased person, or the administration of a trustee or guardian, a final determination in the lower court of the rights of the party appealing, except that no appeal shall be allowed from the appointment of a special administrator; and<br><br>(f) Is the final order or judgment rendered in the case, and affects the substantial rights of the person appealing unless it be an order granting or denying a motion for a new trial or for reconsideration.</blockquote><br>The above-quoted rule contemplates<i> multiple </i>appeals <span style="text-decoration: underline;">during the pendency of special proceedings</span>. A record on appeal - in addition to the notice of appeal - is thus required to be filed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as the original records of the case should remain with the trial court</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to enable the rest of the case to proceed in the event that a separate and distinct issue is resolved by said court and held to be final</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the filing of a record on appeal was <i>not</i> necessary since no other matter remained to be heard and determined by the trial court <i>after</i> it issued the appealed order granting respondent's petition for cancellation of birth record and change of surname in the civil registry.<br><br>The appellate court's reliance on <i>Zayco v. Hinlo, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration is misplaced. In <i>Zayco </i>which was a <i>petition for letters of administration of a deceased person's estate</i>, the decedent's children appealed the trial court's <i>order appointing the grandson of the decedent as administrator of the estate</i>. Their notice of appeal and record on appeal were denied due course by the trial court on the ground that the appealed order is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interlocutory </span>and not subject to appeal. But even if the appeal were proper, it was belatedly filed. On certiorari by the decedent's children, the appellate court sustained the trial court. On petition for review, this Court reversed the appellate court, holding that "[a]n order appointing an administrator of a deceased person's estate is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">final</span> determination of the rights of the parties in connection with the administration, management and settlement of the decedent's estate," hence, the order is "final" and "appealable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Court also held that the appeal was filed on time.<br><br>In <i>Zayco</i>, unlike in the present case, a record on appeal was obviously necessary as the proceedings before the trial court involved the administration, management and settlement of the decedent's estate- matters covered by Section 1 of Rule 109 wherein <i>multiple</i> appeals could, and did in that case, call for them.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Court of Appeals Resolutions of September 2, 2008 and December 22, 2008 in CA G.R. CV No. 90346 are <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</b>.
