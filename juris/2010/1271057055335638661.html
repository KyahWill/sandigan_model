It also proposed that respondent be made to submit the following: the corresponding court orders and acknowledgment receipts pertaining to unwithdrawn cash bonds amounting to P221,700 as proof that they were duly refunded to the bondsmen; the corresponding court orders on withdrawn cash bonds totaling P31,000 and the acknowledgment receipts on withdrawn cash bonds amounting to P164,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Court approved the recommendations of the OCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>By way of compliance, respondent submitted a list of cases with the cash bonds and the status of the bail bonds, whether withdrawn or unwithdrawn, together with the certification of the MTO, affidavits, court orders and acknowledgment receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He then requested that his suspension be lifted and reiterated his prayer that the salaries and other emoluments withheld from him be applied to his cash accountabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Despite respondent's compliance, the OCA stated in a memorandum dated May 4, 2006 that respondent still had a cash shortage of P46,674.86, broken down as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><blockquote><table width="80%" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="70%"> <div align="center">FUND </div></td> <td width="30%"> <div align="center">SHORTAGES </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">1.

Mercado alleging that, when certain criminal cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> pending in the MTC of Bongabon were dismissed due to amicable settlement, the cash bonds posted by the accused (which were supposed to be remitted to the complainants to satisfy the respective obligations of the accused) were applied by respondent as payment for outstanding filing fees without issuing any receipt therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the OCA recommended that respondent be directed to comment on the affidavit of Mercado and to submit the corresponding acknowledgment receipts relating to cash bonds to prove that these had been duly refunded to the bondsmen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> While the OCA also recommended the denial of respondent's request for the lifting of his suspension, it proposed that his request for the release of salaries and other emoluments withheld from him prior to his suspension be granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In a resolution dated June 20, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court approved the recommendations of the OCA.<br><br>In his comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> respondent denied the allegations contained in the affidavit of Mercado. He also presented an affidavit dated July 28, 2006 of purportedly the "real" Evelyn Mercado denying that she had accused respondent of failing to issue receipts for filing fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Due to the nature of respondent's allegations in his comment, the Court resolved to refer to Judge Corazon D. Soluren, executive judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Palayan City, the matter of the "conflicting affidavits" of Mercado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In her investigation report dated March 20, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Judge Soluren stated that the affidavits dated November 12, 2003 and July 26, 2006 were executed by the same person. She noted that the affiant Mercado appeared during the hearing and admitted that respondent was actually her <i>kumpadre</i>.  The 2006 affidavit was executed three years after the execution of the first affidavit in 2003.  Respondent himself secured the 2006 affidavit.<br><br>After evaluating the investigation report of Judge Soluren, the OCA submitted its report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The OCA adopted Judge Soluren's finding that the 2003 and 2006 affidavits had been executed by one and the same person. The OCA concluded that respondent himself secured the 2006 affidavit as a desperate attempt to insulate himself from the additional charge of not issuing receipts, a matter alleged in the 2003 affidavit.<br><br>The 2003 affidavit showed that Mercado intended to file an administrative complaint against respondent but respondent persuaded her to recant the same. Respondent even tried to fabricate a scenario wherein the 2003 affidavit was supposedly executed by a fictitious person to confuse the Court. Notwithstanding the fact that the author of the two affidavits was identified, however, the charge of not issuing receipts was not proven.<br><br>Nonetheless, respondent is not entirely without any liability as there still remains the matter of the shortages he incurred.<br><br>The OCA proposed that respondent be held liable for incurring various cash shortages. That respondent was able to pay a portion of his shortages does not absolve him from the consequences of his wrongdoing. The fact remains that he incurred cash shortage as a result of misappropriation of court funds. Such misappropriation constituted dishonesty, gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct which are grave offenses punishable by dismissal for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Thus, the OCA recommended the following:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">dismissal of respondent from the service, with forfeiture of his retirement benefits, excluding accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the government or in any government-owned or controlled corporation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">computation by the Financial Management Office-OCA of the final money value of all the respondent's accrued leave credits, dispensing with the usual documentary requirements, and to apply the same to the shortage incurred by the respondent, observing the following order of preference: Fiduciary Fund, Special Allowance for the Judiciary and Clerk of Court Fund and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">restitution by respondent of the portion of the shortage not covered by the money value of his accrued leave credits.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>We agree with the findings and recommendations of the OCA.<br><br>The Court's authority -- possessed of neither purse nor sword -- ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The judiciary is intended be the source for secular moral authority in our Republic. That is why all court personnel have the duty to preserve and promote the integrity of the judiciary. As we declared in <i>Judge de la Peña v. Sia</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Persons involved in the administration of justice ought to live up to the strictest standard of honesty and integrity in the public service. The conduct of every personnel connected with the courts should, at all times, be circumspect to preserve the integrity and dignity of our courts of justice. As forerunners in the administration of justice, they ought to live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity, considering that their positions primarily involve service to the public.</blockquote><br>Clerks of court, in particular, are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts.  They must show competence, honesty and probity, having been charged with safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Furthermore, they are judicial officers entrusted with the role of performing delicate functions with regard to the collection of legal fees, and are expected to correctly and effectively implement regulations. Hence, as custodians of court funds and revenues, they have always been reminded of their duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories for they are not supposed to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The clerk of court is primarily accountable for all funds that are collected for the court, whether personally received by him or by a duly appointed cashier who is under his supervision and control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As the custodian of court funds, revenues, records, properties and premises, he is liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of said funds and properties. <b>A clerk of court found short of money accountabilities may be dismissed from the service</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In this case, the financial audit conducted in the MTC of Bongabon, Nueva Ecija showed that respondent incurred cash shortages. While he was able to reduce his accountability by producing the required documents, he could not account for the balance. This indicated two things: (1) respondent's gross negligence and very poor management of the records of collected fees and (2) his failure to account for the remainder which gave rise to the presumption that he misappropriated the same for his personal use. He failed to fully account for the funds despite the ample time he was given to do so.<br><br>His continued failure to remit court funds and to give a satisfactory explanation for such failure constitutes grave misconduct, dishonesty and even malversation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> These, as well as his gross negligence, are <b>all grave offenses that merit the supreme penalty of dismissal</b> <b>even for the first offense</b>.<br><br>As every court employee is a cog in the judicial machinery and plays a vital role in the administration of justice, no breakdown in any part may be allowed if the judicial machinery is to function effectively and efficiently. The same principle holds true for the integrity of all the employees and officers of the judiciary. Grave misconduct and dishonesty have no place in the judicial system if its ethos, its integrity as an institution, which is the foundation of the judiciary's moral authority, is to be preserved.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent Macario C. Villanueva is hereby found <b>GUILTY </b>of dishonesty, gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct. He is <b>DISMISSED </b>from the service, his retirement benefits (excluding accrued leave credits) are <b>FORFEITED </b>and he is<b> PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED</b> from reemployment in the government or in any government-owned or controlled corporation.<br><br>The Financial Management Office of the Office of the Court Administrator is directed to <b>COMPUTE</b> the final monetary value of all the respondent's accrued leave credits, dispensing with the usual documentary requirements, and to <b>APPLY </b>the same to the shortage incurred by the respondent, observing the following order of preference: Fiduciary Fund, Special Allowance for the Judiciary and Clerk of Court Fund.<br><br>Finally, respondent is ordered to <b>RESTITUTE</b> the portion of the shortage not covered by the money value of his accrued leave credits, if any.
