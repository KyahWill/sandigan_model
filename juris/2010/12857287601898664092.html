Thus, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 28, 2002, Bernardino R. Camba, Assistant City Prosecutor of Manila, recommended the filing of an information for parricide against respondent.

The trial court further held that considering the evidence submitted, it finds probable cause for the issuance of the arrest warrant.<br><br>On May 21, 2003, 2<sup>nd</sup> Assistant City Prosecutor Laura D.

Respondent moved that he be given up to October 22, 2003 to file an opposition.<br><br>On October 22, 2003, respondent filed his opposition. Counsel for petitioner heirs then manifested that they be given until November 5, 2003 to submit a reply thereto.<br><br>On November 17, 2003, Assistant City Prosecutor Rebagay issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> denying petitioners' motion to reconsider Office Order No. 1640 and set the continuation of the hearings on December 3 and 10, 2003.<br><br>On December 3, 2003, both parties appeared. Petitioner heirs moved that the hearing be suspended on the ground that they have filed a petition for review before the Department of Justice (DOJ) to assail the Order of November 17, 2003.&nbsp; Respondent's counsel objected in view of the presence of their witness Michelle Luna. Thus, the hearing proceeded. After the hearing, petitioner heirs moved for the cancellation of the December 10, 2003 hearing and filed a formal motion to that effect.<br><br>On December 15, 2003, respondent filed a Motion and Manifestation praying that the case be submitted for resolution or, in the alternative, that it be set for final clarificatory hearing on December 22, 2003.<br><br>The following day or on December 16, 2003, Assistant City Prosecutor Rebagay issued an Order denying the prayers for suspension and submission of the case for resolution and instead set the hearing on December 22, 2003.<br><br>On December 19, 2003, however, Assistant City Prosecutor Rebagay issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> setting aside the October 28, 2002 Resolution and recommending the withdrawal of the information for parricide and the filing of an information for reckless imprudence resulting in parricide in its stead.

They also argued that the Information before the MeTC was invalid.<br><br>On December 6, 2004, the OP dismissed petitioner heirs' appeal of the DOJ Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner heirs promptly moved to reconsider the OP's dismissal of their appeal, but their motion was denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated April 20, 2005.<br><br>On May 5, 2005, respondent moved for Judge Soriaso's inhibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> alleging bias in favor of the prosecution as shown by her continued inaction on his motion to withdraw Information.<br><br>On June 6, 2005, petitioner heirs filed before the CA an appeal by certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> under Rule 43 of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, assailing the denial by the OP of their motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On June 30, 2005, Judge Soriaso inhibited herself from the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The case was eventually re-raffled off to Branch 54 presided over by Judge Manuel M. Barrios.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, Judge Barrios issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> on September 26, 2005 granting the withdrawal of the Information for parricide and recalling the warrant of arrest issued against respondent.&nbsp; Judge Barrios ruled that the Information for parricide found itself without a supporting resolution and thus its withdrawal was appropriate.<br><br>On October 14, 2005, petitioner heirs filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the September 26, 2005 Order but their motion was noted without action on November 3, 2005, as it was made without the approval or intervention of the Public Prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On January 9, 2006, petitioner heirs filed a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> with the CA <b>assailing the September 26, 2005 and November 3, 2005 Orders issued by the RTC through Judge Barrios.</b> Petitioner heirs argued that Judge Barrios granted the motion to withdraw the Information for parricide on grounds other than his personal and independent findings. They likewise contended that Judge Barrios should not have granted the withdrawal of the Information and recall of the arrest warrant since he knew that their appeal with the CA disputing the downgrading of the offense was still pending.&nbsp; Petitioner heirs further argued that the adoption of a contrary stand by the prosecutor after the filing of the Information for parricide should not bar them from prosecuting the case actively sans supervision and intervention of the prosecutor.<br><br>On August 16, 2006, petitioner heirs filed a Motion to Implead the People of the Philippines as party respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> On August 31, 2006, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a similar motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and further prayed that it be furnished a copy of the petition and be given time to file its comment.&nbsp; On October 10, 2006, the CA granted the motions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>On October 1, 2007, the CA dismissed the petition for certiorari. Though it found that Judge Barrios failed to make an independent assessment of the merits of the case and thus abdicated his judicial power and acted as a mere surrogate of the Secretary of Justice, it ruled that the remand of the case to the RTC would serve no useful purpose since it may result in the reopening of the parricide case which would violate respondent's constitutional right against double jeopardy.<br><br>Petitioner heirs and the OSG moved to reconsider the CA decision, but their motions were denied on April 3, 2008. Hence, they filed the present consolidated petitions raising the sole issue of whether the remand of the parricide case to the trial court will violate respondent's constitutional right against double jeopardy.<br><br>Petitioner heirs argue that the MeTC did not validly acquire jurisdiction over the case for parricide through reckless imprudence and that jurisdiction remained with the RTC where the Information for parricide was filed. They also assail the filing with the MeTC of the Information for the downgraded offense after a supposedly dubious reinvestigation and question the hasty arraignment of accused which was done allegedly without notice to petitioner heirs and without them being furnished with the result of the reinvestigation. They even claim that they were not furnished with a copy of the motion for leave to conduct reinvestigation as it was sent to the wrong address. Petitioner heirs further argue that when respondent immediately pleaded guilty to the charge for reckless imprudence without notice to them, such a plea cannot be legally invoked in respondent's defense of double jeopardy. Also, the Information for parricide was still pending with the RTC when accused was hastily arraigned for the downgraded offense. Thus, not all requisites of double jeopardy are present.<br><br>The OSG, for its part, argues that the MeTC could not have validly acquired jurisdiction over the case for the same offense of parricide or any offense necessarily included therein because the prosecution's motion to withdraw the Information for parricide before the RTC remained unacted upon by the said court.<br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that if the petition is granted, it would violate his right against double jeopardy. The first jeopardy has already attached because there was a valid indictment, arraignment and plea and the proceedings were already terminated as he is already serving sentence and has applied for probation. He also contends that proceeding with reinvestigation was justified since the principal action can continue if there is no order from the appellate court to stop the proceedings. He further argues that petitioner heirs have no right to file this appeal especially since the appeal was filed by petitioner heirs without the public prosecutor's conformity. Respondent likewise contends that it is already too late for petitioner heirs to question the validity of the MeTC proceedings since its decision has become final and executory, no appeal having been taken from the decision. Also, petitioner heirs failed to present evidence to prove that there was fraud in the reinvestigation and subsequent plea to a lesser offense.<br><br>We grant the petitions.<br><br>It is beyond cavil that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion in granting the withdrawal of the Information for parricide and recalling the warrant of arrest without making an independent assessment of the merits of the case and the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; By relying solely on the manifestation of the public prosecutor that it is abiding by the Resolution of the Secretary of Justice, the trial court abdicated its judicial power and refused to perform a positive duty enjoined by law.&nbsp; What remains for our resolution is whether the case may be remanded to the RTC without violating respondent's right against double jeopardy.&nbsp; On this question, we find the answer to be in the affirmative.<br><br>Section 7, Rule 117 of the <u>Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure</u>, as amended provides:<br><br><blockquote> SEC. 7. <i>Former conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy</i>. - When an accused has been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent by a <b>court of competent jurisdiction</b>, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information. <br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Thus, double jeopardy exists when the following requisites are present: (1) a first jeopardy attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy has been validly terminated; and (3) a second jeopardy is for the same offense as in the first. A first jeopardy attaches only (a) after a valid indictment; (b) <b>before a competent court</b>; (c) after arraignment; (d) when a valid plea has been entered; and (e) when the accused has been acquitted or convicted, or the case dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In this case, the MeTC took cognizance of the Information for reckless imprudence resulting in parricide while the criminal case for parricide was still pending before the RTC.&nbsp; In <i>Dioquino v. Cruz, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><i> </i>we held that once jurisdiction is acquired by the court in which the Information is filed, it is there retained.&nbsp; Therefore, as the offense of reckless imprudence resulting in parricide was included in the charge for intentional parricide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> pending before the RTC, the MeTC clearly had no jurisdiction over the criminal case filed before it, the RTC having retained jurisdiction over the offense to the exclusion of all other courts.&nbsp; The requisite that the judgment be rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction is therefore absent.&nbsp; <b> </b><br><br>A decision rendered without jurisdiction is not a decision in contemplation of law and can never become executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present petitions are <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated October 1, 2007 and Resolution dated April 3, 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
