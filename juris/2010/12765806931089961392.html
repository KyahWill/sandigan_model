				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The concept of social function of private property which today is presented as one of the possible justifications for agrarian and urban land reform has its roots in the cosmogenic and philosophical concept which maintains that man must answer to the Creator for the use of the resources entrusted to him.It is an old concept and is ultimately related to the genesis of society itself.Hence, the <i>use, enjoyment, occupation </i>or <i>disposition of private property</i> <i>is not</i> <i>absolute. </i>It is predicated on the social functions of property.It is restricted in a sense so as to bring about maximum benefits to all and not to a few chosen individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br><br>This petition concerns four cases, involving herein petitioner Felisa R.

He claims that he complied with all his obligations under the leasehold agreement over the subject agricultural land, and thus prays for the dismissal of the case.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br><b>The DARAB erred in disregarding the<br>Katulagan (Agreement) as evidence.</b><br><br>The DARAB held that the <i>Katulagan</i> is inadmissible in evidence because it was not formally offered before the PARAD, citing our ruling in <i>People v. Mongado.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i> </i> On appeal, however, the CA considered the <i>Katulagan</i>, but found the same to be a mere promissory note tending to prove indebtedness and not as an evidence of mortgage.<br><br>We cannot subscribe with the reasoning of the DARAB. The Rules of Court, particularly the Revised Rules on Evidence, are specifically applicable to judicial proceedings, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.<i>Evidence defined</i>. - Evidence is the means, sanctioned by these rules, of ascertaining <i>in a judicial proceeding</i> the truth respecting a matter of fact.<br><br>Sec. 2.<i>Scope</i>. - The rules of evidence shall be the same in all courts and in all trials and hearings <i>except as otherwise provided by law or these rules</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>quasi judicial</i> proceedings, the said rules shall not apply except "by analogy or in a suppletory character and whenever practicable and convenient".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the instant case, the then prevailing DARAB Rules of Procedures<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  provide that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2.<i>Construction</i>.These Rules shall be liberally construed to carry out the objectives of agrarian reform and to promote just, expeditious and inexpensive adjudication and settlement of agrarian cases, disputes or controversies.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 3.<i>Technical Rules Not Applicable</i>.The Board and its Regional and Provincial Adjudicators shall not be bound by technical rules of procedure and evidence as prescribed in the Rules of Court, but shall proceed to hear and decide all agrarian cases, disputes or controversies in a most expeditious manner, employing all reasonable means to ascertain the facts of every case in accordance with justice and equity.<br><br>a) If and when a case comes up for adjudication wherein there is no applicable provision under these rules, the procedural law and jurisprudence generally applicable to agrarian disputes shall be applied;<br><br>b) The Adjudication Board (Board), and its Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicators (RARADs) and Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicators (PARADs) hereinafter referred to as Adjudicators, shall have the authority to adopt any appropriate measure or procedure in any given situation or matter not covered by these Rules.All such special measures or procedures and the situations to which they have been applied must be reported to the Board; and<br><br>c) <u>The provisions of the Rules of Court shall not apply even in a suppletory character</u> unless adopted herein or by resolution of the Board. However, due process of the law shall be observed and followed in all instances. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The DARAB Rules of Procedures explicitly provides that the Agrarian Reform Adjudicators are not bound by technical rules of procedure and evidence in the Rules of Court nor shall the latter apply even in a suppletory manner.Thus, we find that the DARAB erred in holding the <i>Katulagan</i> as inadmissible since it was not formally offered and admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Moreover, reliance on our ruling in <i>People v. Mongado</i>, <i>i.e., </i>that "[t]he court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered," is misplaced. We simply cannot find any legal basis for the DARAB to cite our ruling in a <i>criminal</i> case;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  the fundamental rule found in Rule 132 of the Rules of Court does not find any application in this agrarian case.<br><br><b>Petitioner has sufficiently proven by <br>clear and convincing evidence the fact<br>of subleasing.</b><br><br>The PARAD summed up the evidence presented by both parties as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, the evidence for the complainant are as follows:<br><br>1. Exhibit 1 - Photocopy of an Investigation Report dated December 19, 1997 submitted by Legal Officer I Dionisio Estimada to the Legal Services Division of DAR wherein he stated in his findings that "Verily, the tenants, particularly Domingo Carganillo, who actually and finally accepted that he subleased the land to another is clear and blatant violation against the landowner and co-owner for that matter".Hence, he recommended that Domingo Carganillo and Sergio Carganillo be ejected from the landholding.<br><br>2. Exhibit 2 - Affidavit dated January 21, 1998 of one Angela [Clarion] wherein she stated that she knew for a fact that Domingo Carganillo mortgaged his tenancy rights in 1995 to his brother Sergio Carganillo.<br><br>On the part of the respondent Domingo Carganillo, his evidence are:<br><br>1. Exhibit 1 - The affidavit of one Sergio Carganillo, the other respondent and brother of respondent Domingo Carganillo denying that the land was mortgaged by his brother to him and stated that he usually help his brother to do some works in the landholding.<br><br>2. Exhibit 2 - Affidavit dated February 3, 1998 of one Mariano Orina stating that being a tenant in the adjoining landholding, he knows that Domingo Carganillo is always present doing or supervising the activities in his field.<br><br>3. Exhibit 3 - Sworn statement of Valentin Costales, the incumbent Barangay Agrarian Reform Council Chairman of the place where the property is located attesting that Domingo and Sergio Carganillo never violated any agrarian laws.<br><br>4. Exhbit 4 - Sworn statement issued by one of the incumbent Barangay Kagawads having jurisdiction of the land in suit, stating also to the fact that respondents never violated any agrarian laws.<br></blockquote><br>The PARAD assessed the evidence submitted and held that Felisa failed to discharge the burden of proof of establishing her allegations, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>After a careful assessment of the facts and evidence presented, the Board is of the view and so holds that there is no evidence showing that respondent Domingo Carganillo subleased the land to his brother Sergio Carganillo. The investigation report dated December 19, 1997 of Legal Officer I Dionisio Estimada (Exhibit 1 of complaint) is not conclusive. His conclusion that Domingo Carganillo accepted to him that he subleased the property could not be accepted by this Board as fact.There is no evidence showing that Domingo Carganillo accepted said matter to him. The Board cannot be compelled to accept the report as true since, in the first place it had not ordered such investigation.</blockquote><br>On appeal, the DARAB concurred with the findings of the PARAD stating that:<br><br><blockquote>One of the contentions invoked by the complainant-appellant is that the landholding in question was subleased by herein respondent-appellee to his co-respondent Sergio Carganillo, who is in actual possession and cultivation thereof. This contention, however, cannot be given due consideration.The Honorable Adjudicator a quo correctly ruled that there was no subleasing in this case.<br><br>At this juncture, it is better to define what a sub-lessee means.In the case of Santiago vs. Rodrigo, et al., CA-G.R. No. 33651-R, June 3, 1965, "sub-tenant or sub-lessee" has been defined as "a person who rents all, or a portion of the leased premises, from the lessor for a term less than the original one, leaving a reversionary interest in the first lessee." Sub-leasing therefore, creates a new estate dependent upon, out of, and distinct from, the original leasehold. However, this is not true in the case at bar.Granting that Sergio Carganillo is working on the land tenanted by respondent-appellee, such is not in the nature of being a sub-lessee, but is merely helping his brother as an immediate member of the family to cultivate the land.The employment of respondent-appellee's brother to cultivate the landholding in question is not in any way prejudicial to the interest of the landowner.Also, it was ruled that the employment by the lessee of the members of his immediate farm household does not come within the prohibition (De Guzman v. Santos, 6 SCRA 796, November 30, 1962).<br><br>Since the issue of sub-leasing was not properly proved by substantial evidence, the same cannot be given favorable consideration.</blockquote><br>On further appeal, the CA held thus:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, petitioner's assertion that respondent Domingo subleased the subject landholding to respondent Sergio cannot be given weight.She failed to prove with sufficient evidence neither the fact of subleasing the subject landholding nor the mortgaging of the possessory rights thereof to respondent Sergio.The document belatedly presented by petitioner and denominated as "Katulagan", is merely a promissory note which is a proof of indebtedness and not as evidence to prove mortgage.<br></blockquote><br>We disagree with the findings of fact of the CA and the agencies below.The confluence of evidence shows that Felisa has clearly and convincingly established her allegation that Domingo subleased his landholding to Sergio, to wit:<br><br>a) The investigation conducted by MARO Legal Officer Estimada shows that Domingo admitted that the cultivation and possession of the subject landholding was subleased to Sergio as he was then applying for work abroad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <br><br>b) In her complaint, Felisa stressed that in one of her visits to the subject landholding prior to the filing of the said complaint, she discovered that Sergio, the sublessee, was in actual possession and cultivation of the landholding in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Petitioner further contended that Domingo subleased the said agricultural leasehold to Sergio for the amount of P15,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <br><br>c) The <i>Katulagan</i> or Agreement establishes that indeed Domingo was indebted to Sergio in the amount of P15,000.00.<br><br>d) The affidavit of Clarion, a resident of the municipality where the subject landholding lies, further corroborates the said facts when she narrated the series of events leading up to Sergio's possession of said agricultural land:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>That I know for a fact that the above-described parcel of land was under cultivation by one RICARDO PADILLO of Brgy. Amistad, Tayug, Pangasinan, formerly, but when the same went abroad, he transferred his tenancy right to DOMINGO CARGANILLO, who in the year 1995 mortgaged his tenancy rights to SERGIO CARGANILLO, his own brother;<br><br>That at present, the said parcel of land is under the cultivation of said SERGIO CARGANILLO;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Domingo did not even affirm or deny in his answer that Estimada conducted an investigation and during such investigation, he admitted that he subleased subject landholding. It is totally against our human nature to just remain reticent and say nothing in the face of false accusations. The natural instinct of man impels him to resist an unfounded imputation.Hence, silence in such cases is almost always construed as implied admission of the truth thereof.<br><br>Likewise, the attestations of BARC Chairman Costales and <i>Barangay Kagawad</i> Frago that Domingo never violated his agreement with Felisa or any provision of the Land Reform Code, are conclusions of law bereft of any factual basis.Time and again, we have held that general statements, which are mere conclusions of law and not factual proof, are unavailing and do not suffice.<br><br><b>In view of the sublease, Domingo and <br>Sergio should be dispossessed of the <br>subject agricultural landholding.</b><br><br>Republic Act (RA) No. 3844 or the Agricultural Land Reform Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  is the governing statute in actions involving leasehold of agricultural land. The pertinent provisions thereof state as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 36. <i>Possession of Landholding; Exceptions</i>. —Notwithstanding any agreement as to the period or future surrender of the land, an agricultural lessee shall continue in the enjoyment and possession of his landholding <b>except when his dispossession has been authorized by the Court in a judgment that is final and executory if after due hearing it is shown that:</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>(7) the <b>lessee employed a sub-lessee on his landholding</b> in violation of the terms of paragraph 2 of Section twenty seven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Sec. 37.<i>Burden of Proof</i>. —The burden of proof to show the existence of a lawful cause for the ejectment of an agricultural lessee shall rest upon the agricultural lessor.<br></blockquote><br>The prohibition against subleasing an agricultural lease has already been in our statute books even prior to the enactment of RA 3844.RA 1199, of The Agricultural Tenancy Act enacted in 1954, similarly provides that:<br><br>SECTION 24. Prohibitions to Tenant: —<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(2)<b>It shall be unlawful for a share-tenant to employ a sub-tenant to furnish labor or any phase of the work required of him</b> under this Act, except in cases of illness or any temporary incapacity on his part, in which eventuality the tenant or any member of his immediate farm household is under obligation to report such illness or incapacity to the landholder. Payment to the sub-tenant, in whatever form, for services rendered on the land under this circumstance, shall be for the account of the tenant. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>However, Section 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  of RA 3844 declared all share tenancy to be contrary to public policy and, in its stead, provided for the compulsory conversion of the sharing system into leasehold system where the tenant continues in possession of the land for cultivation.<br><br>In this case, Domingo subleased his agricultural landholding to Sergio.It is prohibited, except in the case of illness or temporary incapacity where he may employ laborers.Domingo does not claim illness or temporary incapacity in his Answer. Therefore, we hereby declare the dispossession of Domingo and Sergio from the subject agricultural land of the leaseholder.<br><br><center><b>b) DARAB Case No. 7863</b><br></center><br>Felisa is the owner of a parcel of land with an approximate area of 4,667 square meters registered under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-51201.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> She alleged that the duly instituted lessee of the agricultural land is the late Isabelo Ramirez (Isabelo).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> During Isabelo's lifetime, he subleased said landholding to Soledad Agustin (Soledad), without Felisa's knowledge and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> She argued that the said act of her now deceased tenant is a ground for ejectment of Soledad, who is a mere sublessee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <br><br><b>Ruling of the PARAD</b><br><br>After service of summons, Soledad filed her Answer dated January 20, 1998 affirming that Isabelo was the duly instituted tenant of the subject landholding. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Upon his death, his possessory rights passed on to his surviving spouse, who was not named in the Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Soledad likewise alleged that said surviving spouse continues to cultivate the subject landholding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <br><br>In compliance with the PARAD's Order dated January 20, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  requiring the parties to submit their respective position papers, Felisa filed a position paper for all four cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  attaching thereto a copy of the Investigation Report of Estimada<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  and corroborating affidavit of Gano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <br><br>The Investigation Report of the MARO Legal Officer Estimada stated that the lawful tenant was the late Isabelo and not Soledad.Meanwhile, Gano declared in his affidavit that he knew that Isabelo mortgaged his tenancy rights and possession to Soledad.He further averred that Soledad is presently cultivating said landholding, having acquired her tenancy rights from Isabelo through the alleged mortgage.<br><br>On the other hand, Soledad submitted the following affidavits: (1) her own affidavit wherein she denied that she is Felisa's tenant and contended that the true tenant is her sister-in-law Marina O.

In her petition before the CA, Felisa presented the following arguments: (1) The DARAB erred in holding that there exists no valid ground to warrant the ejectment of Domingo and Sergio; and (2) The DARAB erred in considering only the issue of subleasing without giving credence to the issue of non-payment of lease rentals as ground for ejectment. Nowhere in the discussion portion of either pleadings can the name Soledad be found.Moreover, the issue presented in the case against Soledad is alleged subleasing and not non-payment of lease rentals.If there is no issue presented, then there is no controversy to resolve.<br><br>Similarly, in her appeal by <i>certiorari</i> before this Court, Felisa did not expound specifically on her issues with the decisions of the agencies below with respect to Soledad. Petitioner, however, questions the CA's affirmation of the DARAB Decision dated January 27, 2004.<br><br>We reiterate that the petitioner, as agricultural lessor, has the burden of proof to show the existence of a lawful cause for the ejectment of an agricultural lessee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In support of her allegations, Felisa presented the Investigation Report of MARO Legal Officer Estimada and an affidavit of a resident of the <i>barangay</i> where both the original leaseholder Isabelo and the alleged sublessee, Soledad, reside.The full text of the Investigation Report with respect to his factual findings on the case against Soledad is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In the dispute against Soledad Agustin, the lawful tenant was Isabelo Ramirez and not Soledad Agustin.In the conference/mediation that was conducted it was discovered that the cultivator and possessor of the land is actually Isabelo Ramirez.This is also being covered by an Agricultural leasehold Contract.</blockquote><br>The findings of fact as expressed above are not relevant and material to the question of sublease which the petitioner alleges.<br><br>On the other hand, the affidavit of Gano reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>That I know for a fact that the above-described parcel of land was being cultivated formerly by the late, Isabelo Ramirez, a resident of Brgy.

Neither did she present evidence to establish that their leasehold agreement includes a provision on third cropping.Hence, her allegation of non-payment of the leasehold rentals for the third cropping likewise finds no support in evidence.<br><br>In addition, we find that the evidence presented by Felisa is inconsistent on major points.

She has informed the complainants through their administrator, Mrs. Irene Aguinaldo, the date of threshing and reaping (Exhibits "1", "3", "6", "8", "11" and "12").She also submitted evidence to show that the landowner's share is received by complainant's administrator (Exhibit "2", "4", "5", "9" and "10").Other evidence submitted by respondent is Exh.
