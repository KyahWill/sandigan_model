				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case comes before this Court by way of a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.  In this original action, petitioners Senator Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III and Mayor Jesse Robredo, as public officers, taxpayers and citizens, seek the nullification as unconstitutional of Republic Act No. 9716, entitled "<i>An Act Reapportioning the Composition of the First (1<sup>st</sup>) and Second (2<sup>nd</sup>) Legislative Districts in the Province of Camarines Sur and Thereby Creating a New Legislative District From Such Reapportionment</i>." Petitioners consequently pray that the respondent Commission on Elections be restrained from making any issuances and from taking any steps relative to the implementation of Republic Act No. 9716.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9716 originated from House Bill No. 4264, and was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on 12 October 2009.  It took effect on 31 October 2009, or fifteen (15) days following its publication in the Manila Standard, a newspaper of general circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  In substance, the said law created an additional legislative district for the Province of Camarines Sur by reconfiguring the existing first and second legislative districts of the province.<br><br>Prior to Republic Act No. 9716, the Province of Camarines Sur was estimated to have a population of 1,693,821,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> distributed among four (4) legislative districts in this wise:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td> <div align="center"><b>District</b> </div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="center"><b>Municipalities/Cities</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="center"><b>Population</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align="center">1<sup>st</sup> District </div></td> <td> Del Gallego<br> Ragay Lupi<br> Sipocot <br> Cabusao </td> <td> Libmanan<br> Minalabac<br> Pamplona<br> Pasacao<br> San Fernando </td> <td> <div align="center"><b></b> <b>417,304</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align="center">2<sup>nd</sup> District </div></td> <td> Gainza<br> Milaor<br> Naga<br> Pili <br> Ocampo </td> <td> Canaman<br> Camaligan<br> Magarao<br> Bombon <br> Calabanga </td> <td> <div align="center"><b>474,899</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align="center">3<sup>rd</sup> District </div></td> <td> Caramoan<br> Garchitorena<br> Goa<br> Lagonoy<br> Presentacion </td> <td> Sangay<br> San Jose<br> Tigaon<br> Tinamba<br> Siruma </td> <td> <div align="center"><b>372,548</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align="center">4<sup>th</sup> District </div></td> <td> Iriga<br> Baao<br> Balatan<br> Bato </td> <td> Buhi<br> Bula<br> Nabua </td> <td> <div align="center"><b>429,070</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 9716, the first and second districts of Camarines Sur were reconfigured in order to create an additional legislative district for the province.

The factual recitals by both parties of the origins of the bill that became the law show that, from the filing of House Bill No. 4264 until its approval by the Senate on a vote of thirteen (13) in favor and two (2) against, the process progressed step by step, marked by public hearings on the sentiments and position of the local officials of Camarines Sur on the creation of a new congressional district, as well as argumentation and debate on the issue, now before us, concerning the stand of the oppositors of the bill that a population of at least 250,000 is required by the Constitution for such new district.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Aquino III was one of two senators who voted against the approval of the Bill by the Senate. His co-petitioner, Robredo, is the Mayor of Naga City, which was a part of the former second district from which the municipalities of Gainza and Milaor were taken for inclusion in the new second district.  No other local executive joined the two; neither did the representatives of the former third and fourth districts of the province.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the reapportionment introduced by Republic Act No. 9716, runs afoul of the <i>explicit</i> <i>constitutional standard</i> that requires a minimum population of two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) for the creation of a legislative district.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The petitioners claim that the reconfiguration by Republic Act No. 9716 of the first and second districts of Camarines Sur is unconstitutional, because the proposed first district will end up with a population of less than 250,000 or only 176,383.<br><br>Petitioners rely on Section 5(3), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution as basis for the cited 250,000 minimum population standard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  The provision reads:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>Article VI</b><br></center><br>Section 5. (1) x x x x<br><br>(2) x x x x<br><br>(3) Each legislative district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent territory.  <u><b>Each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand, or each province, shall have at least one representative</b></u>.<br><br>(4) x x x x (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote><br>The petitioners posit that the 250,000 figure appearing in the above-cited provision is the minimum population requirement for the creation of a legislative district.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  The petitioners theorize that, save in the case of a newly created province, each legislative district created by Congress must be supported by a minimum population of at least 250,000 in order to be valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Under this view, existing legislative districts may be reapportioned and severed to form new districts, provided each resulting district will represent a population of at least 250,000.  On the other hand, if the reapportionment would result in the creation of a legislative seat representing a populace of less than 250,000 inhabitants, the reapportionment must be stricken down as invalid for non-compliance with the minimum population requirement.<br><br>In support of their theory, the petitioners point to what they claim is the intent of the framers of the 1987 Constitution to adopt a population minimum of 250,000 in the creation of additional legislative seats.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  The petitioners argue that when the Constitutional Commission fixed the original number of district seats in the House of Representatives to two hundred (200), they took into account the projected national population of fifty five million (55,000,000) for the year 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  According to the petitioners, 55 million people represented by 200 district representatives translates to <i>roughly</i> 250,000 people for every one (1) representative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Thus, the 250,000 population requirement found in Section 5(3), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution is actually based on the population constant used by the Constitutional Commission in distributing the initial 200 legislative seats.<br><br>Thus did the petitioners claim that in reapportioning legislative districts independently from the creation of a province, Congress is bound to observe a 250,000 population threshold, in the same manner that the Constitutional Commission did in the original apportionment.<br><br>Verbatim, the submission is that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Republic Act 9716 is unconstitutional because the newly apportioned first district of Camarines Sur failed to meet the population requirement for the creation of the legislative district as explicitly provided in Article VI, Section 5, Paragraphs (1) and (3) of the Constitution and Section 3 of the Ordinance appended thereto; and<br><br></li><li>Republic Act 9716 violates the principle of proportional representation as provided in Article VI, Section 5 paragraphs (1), (3) and (4) of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>The provision subject of this case states:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article VI<br></center><br>Section 5. (1) The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations.<br><br>(2) x x x x<br><br>(3) Each legislative district shall comprise, as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent territory.  Each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand, or each province, shall have at least one representative.<br><br>(4) Within three years following the return of every census, the Congress shall make a reapportionment of legislative districts based on the standards provided in this section.</blockquote><br>On the other hand, the respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, seek the dismissal of the present petition based on procedural and substantive grounds.<br><br>On procedural matters, the respondents argue that the petitioners are guilty of two (2) fatal technical defects:  first, petitioners committed an error in choosing to assail the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9716 <i>via</i> the remedy of <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court; and second, the petitioners have no <i>locus standi</i> to question the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9716.<br><br>On substantive matters, the respondents call attention to an apparent distinction between cities and provinces drawn by Section 5(3), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution.  The respondents concede the existence of a 250,000 population condition, but argue that a plain and simple reading of the questioned provision will show that the same has no application with respect to the creation of legislative districts in provinces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  Rather, the 250,000 minimum population is only a requirement for the creation of a legislative district in a city.<br><br>In sum, the respondents deny the existence of a fixed population requirement for the reapportionment of districts in provinces. Therefore, Republic Act No. 9716, which only creates an additional legislative district within the province of Camarines Sur, should be sustained as a perfectly valid reapportionment law.<br><br>We first pass upon the threshold issues.<br><br>The respondents assert that by choosing to avail themselves of the remedies of <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition, the petitioners have committed a fatal procedural lapse.  The respondents cite the following reasons:<br><br><ol><li>The instant petition is bereft of any allegation that the respondents had acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br></li><li>The remedy of <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition must be directed against a tribunal, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial functions.  Respondents maintain that in implementing Republic Act No. 9716, they were not acting as a judicial or quasi-judicial body, nor were they engaging in the performance of a ministerial act.<br><br></li><li>The petitioners could have availed themselves of another plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Considering that the main thrust of the instant petition is the declaration of unconstitutionality of Republic Act No. 9716, the same could have been ventilated through a <i>petition for declaratory relief</i>, over which the Supreme Court has only appellate, not original jurisdiction.<br></li></ol><br>The respondents likewise allege that the petitioners had failed to show that they had sustained, or is in danger of sustaining any substantial injury as a result of the implementation of Republic Act No. 9716.  The respondents, therefore, conclude that the petitioners lack the required legal standing to question the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9716.<br><br>This Court has paved the way away from procedural debates when confronted with issues that, by reason of constitutional importance, need a direct focus of the arguments on their content and substance.<br><br>The Supreme Court has, on more than one occasion, tempered the application of procedural rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> as well as relaxed the requirement of <i>locus standi</i> whenever confronted with an important issue of overreaching significance to society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Hence, in <b><i>Del Mar v. Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR)</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and <b><i>Jaworski v. PAGCOR</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this Court sanctioned momentary deviation from the principle of the hierarchy of courts, and took original cognizance of cases raising issues of paramount public importance.  The <b><i>Jaworski case</i></b> ratiocinates:<br><br><blockquote>Granting arguendo that the present action cannot be properly treated as a petition for prohibition, <u><b>the transcendental importance of the issues involved in this case warrants that we set aside the technical defects and take primary jurisdiction over the petition at bar</b></u>. One cannot deny that the issues raised herein have potentially pervasive influence on the social and moral well being of this nation, specially the youth; hence, their proper and just determination is an imperative need. <u><b>This is in accordance with the well-entrenched principle that rules of procedure are not inflexible tools designed to hinder or delay, but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate, rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed</b></u>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Anent the <i>locus standi</i> requirement, this Court has already uniformly ruled in <b><i>Kilosbayan v. Guingona,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <b><i>Tatad v. Executive Secretary,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <b><i>Chavez v.

Zamora,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> just to name a few, that absence of direct injury on the part of the party seeking judicial review may be excused when the latter is able to craft an issue of transcendental importance.  In<b><i> Lim v. Executive Secretary,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><b><i> </i></b>this Court held that in cases of transcendental importance, the cases must be settled promptly and definitely, and so, the standing requirements may be relaxed.  This liberal stance has been echoed in the more recent decision on <b><i>Chavez v. Gonzales.</i></b><i><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></b></i><br><br>Given the weight of the issue raised in the instant petition, the foregoing principles must apply.  The beaten path must be taken.  We go directly to the determination of whether or not a population of 250,000 is an indispensable constitutional requirement for the creation of a new legislative district in a province.<br><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>We start with the basics. Any law duly enacted by Congress carries with it the presumption of constitutionality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  Before a law may be declared unconstitutional by this Court, there must be a clear showing that a <i>specific provision</i> of the fundamental law has been violated or transgressed.  When there is neither a violation of a specific provision of the Constitution nor any proof showing that there is such a violation, the presumption of constitutionality will prevail and the law must be upheld.  To doubt is to sustain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>There is<b> </b>no specific provision in the Constitution<b><i> </i></b>that fixes a 250,000 minimum population that must compose a legislative district.<br><br>As already mentioned, the petitioners rely on the second sentence of Section 5(3), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, coupled with what they perceive to be the intent of the framers of the Constitution to adopt a minimum population of 250,000 for each legislative district.<br><br>The second sentence of Section 5(3), Article VI of the Constitution, succinctly provides:  "<i>Each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand, or each province, shall have at least one representative</i>."<br><br>The provision draws a plain and clear distinction between the entitlement of a city to a district on one hand, and the entitlement of a province to a district on the other.  For while a province is entitled to at least a representative, with nothing mentioned about population, a city must first meet a population minimum of 250,000 in order to be similarly entitled.<br><br>The use by the subject provision of a comma to separate the phrase "each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand"<i> </i>from<i> </i>the phrase "or each province" point to no other conclusion than that the 250,000 minimum population is only required for a city, but not for a province. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Plainly read, Section 5(3) of the Constitution requires a <u><b>250,000 minimum population only for a city to be entitled to a representative, but not so for a province</b></u>.<br><br>The 250,000 minimum population requirement for legislative districts in cities was, in turn, the subject of interpretation by this Court in <b><i>Mariano, Jr.  v. COMELEC</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In <b><i>Mariano</i></b>, the issue presented was the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 7854, which was the law that converted the Municipality of Makati into a Highly Urbanized City.  As it happened, Republic Act No. 7854 created an additional legislative district for Makati, which at that time was a lone district.  The petitioners in that case argued that the creation of an additional district would violate Section 5(3), Article VI of the Constitution, because the resulting districts would be supported by a population of less than 250,000, considering that Makati had a total population of only 450,000.  The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the law and the validity of the newly created district, explaining the operation of the Constitutional phrase "each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand," to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners cannot insist that the addition of another legislative district in Makati is not in accord with section 5(3), Article VI<b> </b>of the Constitution for as of the latest survey (1990 census), the population of Makati stands at only four hundred fifty thousand (450,000).<b>  </b>Said section provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a city with a population of <i>at least two hundred fifty thousand</i> (250,000) shall have <i>at least one representative</i>. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even granting that the population of Makati as of the 1990 census stood at four hundred fifty thousand (450,000), its legislative district may still be increased since it has met the minimum population requirement of two hundred fifty thousand (250,000). In fact, Section 3 of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution provides that a city whose population has </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">increased to more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall be entitled to </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">at least one congressional representative</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The <b><i>Mariano case</i></b> limited the application of the 250,000 minimum population requirement for cities only to its <i>initial</i> legislative district.  <u>In other words, while Section 5(3), Article VI of the Constitution requires a city to have a minimum population of 250,000 to be entitled to a representative, it does not have to increase its population by another 250,000 to be entitled to an <i>additional</i> district.</u><br><br>There is no reason why the <b><i>Mariano case</i>,</b> which involves the creation of an <i>additional</i> district within a <i>city</i>, should not be applied to <i>additional</i> districts in provinces.  Indeed, if an <i>additional</i> legislative district created within a city is not required to represent a population of at least 250,000 in order to be valid, neither should such be needed for an additional district in a province, considering moreover that a province is entitled to an <i>initial</i> seat by the mere fact of its creation and regardless of its population.<br><br>Apropos for discussion is the provision of the Local Government Code on the creation of a province which, by virtue of and upon creation, is entitled to at least a legislative district.  Thus, Section 461 of the Local Government Code states:<br><br><blockquote>Requisites for Creation. - (a) A province may be created if it has an average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of not less than Twenty million pesos (P20,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices and either of the following requisites:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(i) a contiguous territory of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau; or<br><br>(ii) a population of not less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office.</div></blockquote><br>Notably, the requirement of population is not an indispensable requirement, but is merely an <u>alternative</u> addition to the indispensable income requirement.<br><br><b><i>Mariano</i></b>, it would turn out, is but a reflection of the pertinent ideas that ran through the deliberations on the words and meaning of Section 5 of Article VI.<br><br>The whats, whys, and wherefores of the population requirement of "at least two hundred fifty thousand" may be gleaned from the records of the Constitutional Commission which, upon framing the provisions of Section 5 of Article VI, proceeded to form an ordinance that would be appended to the final document. The Ordinance is captioned "APPORTIONING THE SEATS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES TO THE DIFFERENT LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS IN PROVINCES AND CITIES AND THE METROPOLITAN MANILA AREA."  Such records would show that the 250,000 population benchmark was used for the 1986 nationwide <u>apportionment</u> of legislative districts <u>among</u> provinces, cities and Metropolitan Manila.  Simply put, the population figure was used to determine <u>how many</u> districts a <u>province, city, or Metropolitan Manila should have.</u>  Simply discernible too is the fact that, for the purpose, population had to be the determinant.  Even then, the requirement of 250,000 inhabitants was not taken as an absolute minimum for one legislative district.  And, closer to the point herein at issue, in the determination of the precise district within the province to which, through the use of the population benchmark, so many districts have been apportioned, population as a factor was <u>not the sole</u>, though it was among, several determinants.<br><br>From its journal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we can see that the Constitutional Commission originally divided the entire country into two hundred (200) districts, which corresponded to the original number of district representatives. The 200 seats were distributed by the Constitutional Commission in this manner: <i>first</i>, one (1) seat each was given to the seventy-three (73) provinces and the ten (10) cities with a population of at least 250,000;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>second</i>, the remaining seats were then redistributed among the provinces, cities and the Metropolitan Area "in accordance with the number of their inhabitants on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Commissioner Davide, who later became a Member and then Chief Justice of the Court, explained this in his sponsorship remark<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for the Ordinance to be appended to the 1987 Constitution:<br><br><blockquote><b>Commissioner Davide:</b>  The ordinance fixes at 200 the number of legislative seats which are, in turn, apportioned among provinces and cities with a population of at least 250, 000 and the Metropolitan Area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio.  The population is based on the 1986 projection, with the 1980 official enumeration as the point of reckoning.  This projection indicates that our population is more or less 56 million.  <u><b>Taking into account the mandate that each city with at least 250, 000 inhabitants and each province shall have at least one representative, we first allotted one seat for each of the 73 provinces, and each one for all cities with a population of at least 250, 000, which are the Cities of Manila, Quezon, Pasay, Caloocan, Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro, Davao and Zamboanga. Thereafter, we then proceed[ed] to increase whenever appropriate the number of seats for the provinces and cities in accordance with the number of their inhabitants on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio</b></u>. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>Thus was the number of seats computed for each province and city. Differentiated from this, the determination of the districts within the province had to consider "all protests and complaints formally received" which, the records show, dealt with determinants other than population as already mentioned.<br><br>Palawan is a case in point.  Journal No. 107 of the Constitutional Commission narrates:<br><br><blockquote>INTERPELLATION OF MR. NOLLEDO:<br><br>Mr. Nolledo inquired on the reason for including Puerto Princesa in the northern towns when it was more affinity with the southern town of Aborlan, Batarasa, Brooke's Point, Narra, Quezon and Marcos.  He stated that the First District has a greater area than the Second District.  He then queried whether population was the only factor considered by the Committee in redistricting.<br><br>Replying thereto, Mr. Davide explained that the Committee took into account the standards set in Section 5 of the Article on the Legislative Department, namely:  1) the legislative seats should be apportioned among the provinces and cities and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with their inhabitants on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio; and 2) the legislative district must be compact, adjacent and contiguous.<br><br>Mr. Nolledo pointed out that the last factor was not met when Puerto Princesa was included with the northern towns.  He then inquired what is the distance between Puerto Princesa from San Vicente.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thereupon, Mr. Nolledo stated that Puerto Princesa has a population of 75,480 and based on the apportionment, its inclusion with the northern towns would result in a combined population of 265,000 as against only 186,000 for the south. He added that Cuyo and Coron are very important towns in the northern part of Palawan and, in fact, Cuyo was the capital of Palawan before its transfer to Puerto Princesa.  He also pointed out that there are more potential candidates in the north and therefore if Puerto Princesa City and the towns of Cuyo and Coron are lumped together, there would be less candidates in the south, most of whose inhabitants are not interested in politics.

He stated that he was toying with the idea that, perhaps as a special consideration for Baguio because it is the summer capital of the Philippines, Tuba could be divorced from Baguio City so that it could, by itself, have its own constituency and Tuba could be transferred to the Second District together with Itogon.  Mr. Davide, however, pointed out that the population of Baguio City is only 141,149.<br><br>Mr. Regalado admitted that the regular population of Baguio may be lower during certain times of the year, but the transient population would increase the population substantially and, therefore, for purposes of business and professional transactions, it is beyond question that population-wise, Baguio would more than qualify, not to speak of the official business matters, transactions and offices that are also there.<br><br>Mr. Davide adverted to Director de Lima's statement that unless Tuba and Baguio City are united, Tuba will be isolated from the rest of Benguet as the place can only be reached by passing through Baguio City.  He stated that the Committee would submit the matter to the Body.<br><br>Upon inquiry of the Chair whether he is insisting on his amendment, Mr. Regalado stated that the Body should have a say on the matter and that the considerations he had given are not on the demographic aspects but on the fact that Baguio City is the summer capital, the venue and situs of many government offices and functions.<br><br>On motion of Mr. Davide, there being no objection, the Body approved the reconsideration of the earlier approval of the apportionment and districting of Region I, particularly Benguet.<br><br>Thereafter, on motion of Mr. Davide, there being no objection, the amendment of Mr. Regalado was put to a vote.  With 14 Members voting in favor and none against, the amendment was approved by the Body.<br><br>Mr. Davide informed that in view of the approval of the amendment, Benguet with Baguio City will have two seats.

And the formulation of the Ordinance in the implementation of the provision, nay, even the Ordinance itself, refutes the contention that a population of 250,000 is a constitutional sine qua non for the formation of an additional legislative district in a province, whose population growth has increased beyond the 1986 numbers.<br><br>Translated in the terms of the present case:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. The Province of Camarines Sur, with an estimated population of 1,693,821 in 2007 is — based on the formula and constant number of 250,000 used by the Constitutional Commission in nationally apportioning legislative districts among provinces and cities — entitled to two (2) districts in addition to the four (4) that it was given in the 1986 apportionment. Significantly, petitioner Aquino concedes this point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  In other words, Section 5 of Article VI as clearly written allows and does not prohibit an additional district for the Province of Camarines Sur, such as that provided for in Republic Act No. 9786;<br><br>2. Based on the pith and pitch of the exchanges on the Ordinance on the protests and complaints against strict conformity with the population standard, and more importantly based on the final districting in the Ordinance on considerations other than population, the reapportionment or the recomposition of the first and second legislative districts in the Province of Camarines Sur that resulted in the creation of a new legislative district is valid even if the population of the new district is 176,383 and not 250,000 as insisted upon by the petitioners.<br><br>3.

This means that legislative districts in provinces can have a minimum population of anywhere from 100 (or even less) to 250,000, while legislative districts in cities will always have a minimum population of 250,000. This will spell the end of our democratic and republican system of government as we know it and as envisioned in the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><center><b><i>Constitutional Standards for Reapportionment:<br>Population and Territory</i></b><br></center><br>The Constitution itself provides the "<b>standards</b>" against which reapportionment laws like RA 9716 will be tested, following its command that "Congress shall make a reapportionment of legislative districts <b><i>based on the <u>standards</u> provided in this section</i>,"</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <b>referring to Section 5, Article VI. These standards relate to <i>first</i>, population, and <i>second</i>, territory</b>.

First is the rule on proportional representation, which is the universal standard in direct representation in legislatures. Second is the rule on a minimum population of 250,000 per legislative district, which was not present in our previous Constitutions.  Third is the rule on progressive ratio, which means that the number of legislative districts shall increase as the number of the population increases in accordance with the rule on proportional representation.  <b>Fourth is the rule on uniformity, which requires that the first three rules shall apply uniformly in all apportionments in provinces, cities and the Metropolitan Manila area</b>.<br><br>The Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and the Ordinance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> appended to the 1987 Constitution fixes the minimum population of a legislative district at 250,000. Although textually relating to cities, this minimum population requirement applies equally to legislative districts apportioned in provinces and the Metropolitan Manila area because of the<i> </i>constitutional command that "legislative districts [shall be] apportioned among the <b><i>provinces, cities</i></b>, and the Metropolitan Manila area <i>in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants</i>, <i>and on the basis of a <b>uniform</b> and progressive ratio</i>."  <b>To reiterate, the Constitution commands that this rule on uniformity shall apply to legislative districts in "<i>provinces</i>, <i>cities</i>, and the Metropolitan Manila area</b>."  Otherwise, districts apportioned in provinces, if freed from the minimum population requirement, will have constituencies two, four, ten times lower than in districts apportioned in cities, violating the constitutional command that apportionment shall be based on a <b><i>uniform</i></b> ratio in "<b><i>provinces, cities</i>,</b> and the Metropolitan Manila area."<br><br><b>In short, the constitutional "<i>standards</i>" in the apportionment of legislative districts under Section 5 of Article VI, as far as population is concerned, are: (1) proportional representation; (2) a minimum "<i>population of at least two hundred fifty thousand</i>" per legislative district; (3) progressive ratio in the increase of legislative districts as the population base increases; and (4) uniformity in the apportionment of legislative districts in "<i>provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area.</i>"</b><br><br>For territory, the Constitution prescribes the "standards" that a legislative district must be, "as far as practicable, contiguous, compact, and adjacent."<br><br>To repeat, other than <b>population</b> and <b>territory</b>, there are no other standards prescribed in Section 5 of Article VI.

In contrast, the remaining four proposed districts have populations way above the minimum with the highest at 439,043 (proposed Third District), lowest at 276,777 (proposed Second District) and an average of 379,359. Indeed, the disparity is so high that three of the proposed districts (Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts) have populations <b><i>more than</i> <i>double</i></b> that of the proposed First District.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  This results in wide variances among the districts' populations. Still using the 2007 census, the ideal per district population for Camarines Sur is 338,764.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <b>The populations of the proposed  districts swing  from  this  ideal  by a high of positive 29.6% (Third </b><br><br><b>District)  to a low  of   negative 47.9%  (First District).<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></b>  This means that  the smallest proposed district (First District) is <i>underpopulated</i> by nearly 50% of the ideal and the biggest proposed district (Third District) is <i>overpopulated</i> by nearly 30% of the ideal.</b><br><br>The resulting vote undervaluation (for voters in the disfavored districts) and vote overvaluation (for voters in the First District) fails even the most liberal application of the constitutional standards. Votes in the proposed First District are <i>overvalued</i> by more than 200% compared to votes from the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts and by more than 60% compared to votes in the Second District. Conversely, votes from the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts are <i>undervalued</i> by more than 200% compared to votes in the First District while those in the Second District suffer more than 60% undervaluation.<br><br>Proportional representation in redistricting does not mean exact numbers of population, to the last digit, for every legislative district.   However, under the assailed RA 9716, the variances swing from negative 47.9% to positive 29.6%.   Under any redistricting yardstick, such variances are grossly anomalous and destructive of the concept of proportional representation.

Clearly, RA 9716 tinkers with vote valuation, and consequently with the constitutional standard of proportional representation, based solely on the whims of incumbent Congressmen, an invalid standard for redistricting under Section 5 of Article VI.<br><br>Equally important, RA 9716 violates the minimum population requirement of 250,000 in creating the proposed First District, <b>which will have a population of only 176,383.</b>   The minimum population of 250,000 per legislative district admits of no variance and must be complied with to the last digit.  The Constitution mandates a population of "<b><i>at least</i></b> two hundred fifty thousand" for a legislative district in a city, and under the principle of "<b><i>uniform and progressive ratio</i></b>," for every legislative district in provinces and in the Metropolitan Manila area.<br><br><center><b><i>Entitlement of "Each Province" to "at Least One Representative"<br>No Basis to Ignore Standard of Uniform Population Ratio</i></b></center><br>The directive in Section 5(3) of Article VI that "each province, shall have at least one representative" means only that when a province is created, a legislative district must also be created with it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Can this district have a population below 250,000?   To answer in the affirmative is to ignore the constitutional mandate that districts in provinces be apportioned "in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio."  That the Constitution never meant to <i>exclude</i> provinces from the requirement of proportional representation is evident in the opening provision of Section 5(1), which states:<br><br><blockquote>The House of Representatives shall be composed of x x x members, x x x, who shall be elected<i> </i>from legislative districts apportioned among the<u><b> <i>provinces, cities</i></b></u><i>, and the Metropolitan Manila</i> area <i>in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants</i>, and on the basis of a <b><i>uniform and progressive ratio</i></b> x x x."

Anyway, we move it left, we move it right, it would change the configuration.  Those are the practical difficulties in trying to figure out how.  That is the situation.

That can be reconfigured if we were just using geography and the test of territoriality.<br><br><i>Now, in sequel to that, the proposed second district of Magarao, Panaman (sic) and Camaligan can be placed in the proposed second district and it will have a population of 258,000.  <u>The body of water alluded to by our distinguished colleague, it seems in our map that the municipalities mentioned are all on the same side of the waterway.</u> We do not see where the issue of contiguousness comes in to play.  The proposed third district, with these changes, would still be having a population of 364,187</i>.<br><br>The only point we are trying to raise is that if it just a question of territory and population, there seems to be other ways of having configured these districts to enable Camarines Sur to have its entire complement of six districts. If the answer is, that the congressmen there who are now representing Camarines Sur cannot agree on the other modes of configuring their district, then that is another.  But will our distinguished colleague agree that there is no constitutional prohibition for us to reconfigure these districts on a different formula.<br><br>Sen. Arroyo.  Mr. President, this is where the Senate must differ to the House of Representatives. Redistricting is a local bill and it cannot emanate from the Senate.  It will emanate only from the House of Representatives.  This has been debated in the House of Representatives over and over and no one could agree.  So, in its wisdom, the House of Representatives agreed to what has been presented here.  If we agree now it to reconfigure it, the Senate now will be intruding into what is purely a House of Representatives business.  This is redistricting.  Quite frankly, what business does the Senate have in trying to reconfigure out the provinces when we do not represent any particular district? Only congressmen who are familiar with their own districts can discuss this. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus, in <i>Sema v.

Said section provides, <b>inter alia</b>, that a city with a population of <b>at least two hundred fifty thousand</b> (250,000) shall have <b>at least one representative</b>.  Even granting that the population of Makati as of the 1990 census stood at four hundred fifty thousand (450,000), its legislative district may still be increased since it has met the minimum population requirement of two hundred fifty thousand (250,000).  In fact, Section 3 of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution provides that a city whose population has <b>increased to more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000)</b> shall be entitled to <b>at least one congressional representative</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  (emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>Nothing in <i>Mariano</i> reflects that the Court disregarded the 250,000 population requirement as it merely stated that Makati's legislative district <i>may</i> still be increased as long as the minimum population requirement is met.  The permissive declaration at that time presupposes that Makati must still meet the constitutional requirements before it can have another congressional district.<br><br>The <i>Local Government Code</i> likewise is not in point since Section 461 thereof tackles the creation of a province and not the reapportioning of a legislative district based on increasing population.

This is the average "<i>uniform and progressive ratio</i>" that should prevail.  Thus, using the present population figure, the benchmark should be anywhere between 250,000-450,000 persons per district.  Using anything less than 250,000 is illogical, for it would operate to allow <u>more than</u> 360 representatives of legislative districts alone on some capricious basis other than the variable of population.<br><br>A case in point is the congressional reapportionment done in the provinces of Sultan Kudarat and Zamboanga Sibugay effected through Republic Act No. 9357<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and Republic Act No. 9360,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> respectively.

From the discussions in the initial apportionment and districting of Puerto Princesa, Baguio, Cavite, Laguna, Maguindanao and Cebu in 1986, it is clear that population and contiguity were the primary considerations, and the extraneous factors considered were circumspectly subsumed thereto.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>harps on petitioners' admission that Camarines Sur is actually entitled to SIX legislative districts, given its population of 1,693,821, to justify its conclusion that there is nothing wrong in the creation of another legislative district in the province.  This is a wrong premise.  It bears noting that petitioners raised the legislative entitlement to underscore the GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION committed in the enactment of R.A. 9716.<br><br>R.A. 9716 created one legislative district by reconfiguring the first and second districts.  It did not, however, touch the third and fourth districts which, when properly reapportioned, can easily form another district.  No reasons were offered except Senator Joker Arroyo's during the Senate Plenary Debates on H.B. No. 4264, <i>viz</i>: "When it comes to their district, congressmen are kings. We cannot touch them.

Linguistic difference is a weak basis to segregate the municipalities in the redistricting.  To sanction that as basis would see a wholesale redistricting of the entire country, given the hundreds of dialects being spoken.  Imagine Binondo being segregated from the Tagalog-speaking district of Tondo or Sta. Cruz in Manila on the ground that Fookien is largely spoken in Binondo.<br><br>The former first district supposedly occupied 40% of the total land area of Camarines Sur.  But the former fourth district (which is now the fifth) comprises the same percentage of land area, if not bigger.  If land area was a factor, then the former fourth district should have been re-districted also since it is endowed with a big area like the former first district.<br><br>The municipality of Libmanan is supposedly isolated by a body of water from the first district.  But so is the municipality of Cabusao which is situated northeast of Libmanan and which is bordered by the same body of water.  Yet Cabusao is part of the new first district.  Considering the similar geographical location of the two municipalities, there is no compelling reason to segregate Libmanan from the first district and tack it to the newly created second district.<br><br>The seminal case of <i>Reynolds v. Sims</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> had already ruled that these factors cannot be permissively considered in legislative reapportionment.<br><br><blockquote>x x x Population is, of necessity, the starting point for consideration and the controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversies.  x x x  [We] hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, [equal protection] requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.  Simply stated, an individual's right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the [State].<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[Equal protection] requires that a State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable.  We realize that it is a practical impossibility to arrange legislative districts so that each one has an identical number of residents, citizens, or voters.  Mathematical exactness or precision is hardly a workable constitutional requirement.  <b>So long as the divergences from a strict population principle are constitutionally permissible, but</b> <u><b>neither history alone, nor economic or other sorts of group interests, are permissible factors in attempting to justify disparities from population-based representation</b></u>.
