Ofilas</b></u><br></center><br>In his Written Explanation and Report, dated March 15, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Atty. Ofilas refuted the charges against him. He blamed the lack of orientation and proper turnover of responsibilities and accountabilities when he assumed the functions of his office on January 28, 1992. Unaware of the basic procedures of his new office, he decided to let the staff continue what they had been doing, especially Ms. Baltazar who was in charge of the financial transactions of the court from the collection of legal fees, remittance thereof to the depositary bank, safekeeping of the daily collections, and the preparation of monthly financial reports and books of accounts. With this practice, Atty. Ofilas relied on the regular audit conducted by the Commission on Audit and the submission of monthly financial reports to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Although Atty. Ofilas was of the view that the missing funds could not be as huge as reported, he offered no denial therefor.  He reiterated the admission made by Ms. Baltazar during the audit and claimed that he was never informed of any concern relating to the court's finances especially the practice of retaining varying amounts of cash from daily collections. Atty. Ofilas maintained that "he did not enjoy nor profit from a single centavo out of the legal fees as he never touched them nor were the fees given to him for safekeeping."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><i> </i><br><br>Atty. Ofilas presented a copy of Land Bank Inter-Office Credit Advice dated December 1, 1997 evidencing the deposit made therein under the Judiciary Development Fund account in the amount of P12,344.25.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> However, with respect to undocumented deposits in the bigger amount of P779,341.45 in the said fund and unauthorized withdrawals from the Fiduciary Fund in the amount of P1,182,330.00, Atty. Ofilas could offer no explanation.<br><br>Atty. Ofilas informed the Court that the interest earned by the Fiduciary Fund account amounting to P286,745.05 had already been transferred to the Special Allowance for Judiciary account, as directed by the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>With respect to his act of opening a separate bank account in the Rural Bank of San Mateo, Atty. Ofilas explained that it was a practical remedy which helped him solve the problem of allocating extra-judicial foreclosure fees. He deposited check payments to the bank, withdrew cash and then allocated the money to the Judicial Development Fund and the General Fund. He denied ill-motive and gave emphasis to the fact that "the account or passbook was not registered in the name of FERMIN M. OFILAS; it was opened in the name of the "THE CLERK OF COURT, RTC SAN MATEO RIZAL."<i>  </i>Although he contended that convenience of the petitioners in the court was the only consideration for the procedure, he apologized for his unintentional breach of an existing circular.<br><br>As to his failure to enforce the collection of filing fees and commission fees on extrajudicial foreclosure cases, Atty. Ofilas admitted that <i>"his focus was never on the correct computation of legal fees"</i> and he <i>"relied much on his Cash Clerk's ability to perform correct arithmetical computation."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  He claimed that he paid more attention to the substantial aspects of the petitions like publication requirements and bidding procedures.  He was unaware of Administrative Circular No. 31-90 which took effect on October 19, 1990 requiring the collection of advertising fees. The required quarterly report on the status of extrajudicial foreclosure petitions and the activities of the sheriffs under his supervision was only made known to him by the SC Financial Audit Team.<br><br>As to the directive to send demand letters to the mortgagees/petitioners in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings to collect deficiencies in filing fees, Atty. Ofilas said that some accounts were already reviewed but other records would have to be thoroughly checked to avoid mistakes and embarrassment. As to the status of the petitions for extra-judicial foreclosure, 159 case records of which have been found but others had yet to be traced. The marriage solemnization fees amounting to P900.00 were already collected from Branch 77.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As to over-payment of cash bond, Atty. Ofilas went on to explain that in all five cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> he had no participation in the processing of claims because it was Ms. Baltazar herself who prepared and signed the vouchers in his name. He opined that the persons who received the overpayment must be required to return the money to the court. Otherwise, it should be Ms. Baltazar who must pay, as she alone made the erroneous refund.<br><br>As directed by the court, Atty. Ofilas also withdrew the confiscated cash bonds and deposited the same to the JDF account and the Special Allowance for the Judiciary account.<br><br>In the meantime, Atty. Ofilas begged the court in a letter dated January 24, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to lift the directive withholding his salary. Attached to this letter was the affidavit executed by Ms. Baltazar wherein she reiterated that Atty. Ofilas had no participation in, or knowledge of, the irregularities found in the financial transactions of the court, and neither did he tolerate them.  After several requests for extension and warnings from the Court, Atty. Ofilas, by way of Motion and Compliance dated September 5, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> furnished the court with thirty-one (31) orders in civil and criminal cases directing the release of posted bonds, official receipts issued for posted cash bonds, and acknowledgment receipts of the cash bond signed by the accused or complainants. Once again he pleaded for the release of his salaries informing the court of his need of medical treatment for prostate cancer.<br><br>On the said letter, the court resolved to direct the immediate release of the salaries of Atty. Ofilas and his re-inclusion in the payroll, in a Resolution dated November 18, 2006.  He was, however, still ordered to submit documents to support the unverified withdrawals from the Fiduciary Fund within ten (10) days from notice.<br><br>In a Memorandum dated April 2, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the OCA took account the Motion and Compliance filed by Atty. Ofilas and reported that the previous amount of undocumented withdrawals was reduced from P1,182,330.00 to P1,049,930.00. The documentation for P132,400.00 was presented by Atty. Ofilas.<br><br>In a Resolution dated June 16, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court resolved to furnish Atty. Ofilas with an amended itemized list of withdrawn or refunded Fiduciary Fund deposits without proper documentation and directed him to submit the needed documents in order for him to be cleared of his financial accountability. In his Compliance and Further Plea for Mercy dated November 28, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Atty. Ofilas submitted copies of court orders authorizing the release of the cash bonds as attached. In turn, the Fiscal Monitoring Division of the OCA took the documents into account and notified the court, in a Memorandum dated March 26, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that the undocumented withdrawals had been reduced to P456,355.00.<br><br>Atty. Ofilas, however, failed to present documents relative to the undeposited collections amounting to P1,119.145.23 and the unexplained double withdrawals at P19,600.00, both with respect to the Fiduciary Fund.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Position of Clerk IV Aranzazu Baltazar</b><br></div><br>Insofar as Aranzazu Baltazar is concerned, she <b>admitted</b> her guilt even prior to the completion of the audit.

Service with loyalty, integrity and efficiency is required of all public officers and employees, who must, at all times, be accountable to the people. In a long line of cases, the Court had untiringly reminded employees involved in the administration of justice to faithfully adhere to their mandated duties and responsibilities. Whether committed by the highest judicial official or by the lowest member of the workforce, any act of impropriety can seriously erode the people's confidence in the Judiciary. "Verily, the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct of its personnel. It is their sacred duty to maintain the good name and standing of the court as a true temple of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  Corollary to this, failure to live up to their avowed duty constitutes a transgression of the trust reposed on them as court officers and inevitably leads to an exercise of disciplinary authority.  Thus, the Court "condemns and would never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the part of all those involved in the administration of justice which would violate the norm of public accountability and would diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  The Judiciary expects the best from all its employees who must be paradigms in the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The outright admission of Clerk IV Aranzazu Baltazar to committing malversation of funds shows her blatant disregard for these principles she had sworn to uphold and thereby eroding public trust. Her admission however, does not exculpate Clerk of Court Atty. Fermin Ofilas of his own negligence.<br><br>As clerk of court, Atty. Ofilas is one of the ranking officers of the judiciary.  Next to the judge, the clerk of court is the chief administrative officer charged with preserving the integrity of court proceedings. A number of non-judicial concerns connected with trial and adjudication of cases is handled by the clerk of court, demanding a dynamic performance of duties, with the prompt and proper administration of justice as the constant objective. The nature of the work and of the office mandates that the clerk of court be an individual of competence, honesty and integrity. For "xxx in relation to the judge, a [clerk of court] occupies a position of confidence which should not be betrayed; and that with the prestige of the office goes the corresponding responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the court and its proceedings, to earn respect therefor, to maintain loyalty thereto and to the judge as the superior officer, to maintain the authenticity and correctness of court records, and to uphold the confidence of the public in the administration of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>"That clerks of courts perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises can never be overemphasized. They wear many hats - those of treasurer, accountant, guard and physical plant manager of the court, hence, are entrusted with the primary responsibility of correctly and effectively implementing regulations regarding fiduciary funds. They are, thus, liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>A previous case shares a similar factual milieu with the case at bench. In <i>Report on the Financial Audit in RTC v. General Santos City and the RTC and MTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the clerk of court, after an audit, was shocked to learn of the irregularities in the handling of court funds committed by a social worker officer cum cash clerk, to whom he delegated his responsibilities because he "did not know accounting procedures and he did not want to antagonize the members of his staff by changing the system already in place upon his assumption to office." The clerk therein admitted the shortage of funds and that "she loaned money taken from her collection to her co-employees because otherwise they would fall prey to loan sharks or usurers charging interest rate ranging from 10% to 21%."<br><br>In this case, we find the respondent, Atty. Ofilas, seriously remiss in the performance of his duties. The explanation proffered by him largely involves apology, denial and claims of ignorance. For the remaining shortage of court funds, he shifts the liability to Ms. Baltazar. What he failed to explain to the satisfaction of the Court, however, is the underlying issue of his failure to carry out the primordial responsibilities of his office.<br><br>Atty. Ofilas utterly failed to perform his duties with the degree of diligence and competence expected of him. Atty. Ofilas played his role in a perfunctory manner, relying heavily on Ms. Baltazar's supposed ability and honesty to handle the finances of the court. This is a reprehensible display of inefficiency which cannot be justified by good faith, naivety or inexperience. Atty. Ofilas' lack of orientation or training prior to his assumption of office is no excuse to delegate his essential duties to Ms. Baltazar especially those concerning financial matters.<br><br>From 1992 until the arrival of the audit team, Atty. Ofilas had been complacent as he merely allowed another person to perform his tasks, absent the initiative to learn the functions of the office he had sworn to hold and fulfill with zeal.  Neither the records nor Atty. Ofilas' statements provide the slightest indication that he at least exerted efforts to take the reins from Baltazar or to introduce improvements in the conduct of office procedures. Granting there was a lack of orientation or formal turnover of responsibilities, he could have consulted the Manual for Clerks of Court, particularly his duties as provided in Chapter VII, Section B thereof.  Unfortunately, Baltazar's substitute performance proved adequate for him that even supervision, which was incumbent upon him to exercise over other court personnel, was lost over time.<br><br>His admission or pretension that he had no knowledge of accounting rules and regulations does not justify his dependence on Baltazar. Atty. Ofilas was glaringly unmindful of the ruling in <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Sylvia R. Yan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that the collection of legal fees, by its nature, is a delicate function of clerks of court as judicial officers entrusted with the correct and effective implementation of the regulations thereon. Functionally, the work involves the examination and verification of every pleading and document to determine with accuracy the amount of collectible revenues or fees which by law properly belong to the Government. It is likewise incumbent upon him "to personally attend to the collection of the fees, the safekeeping of the money thus collected, the making of the proper entries thereof in the corresponding book of accounts, and the deposit of the same in the offices concerned.<i>"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Succinctly put, Atty. Ofilas' performance as an officer of the court is clearly wanting. Throughout this case, he would bank on his alleged ignorance of the irregularities obtaining in the court and pass on the liability to Ms. Baltazar alone.  Time and again, the Court has ruled that the clerk of court is primarily accountable for all funds that are collected for the court, whether received by him personally or by a duly appointed cashier who is under his supervision and control. Thus, Atty. Ofilas is liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.<br><br>Atty. Ofilas' failure to enforce the collection of the correct fees cannot be excused by his limited knowledge of arithmetic computation or by his attention on the substantive requirements in extrajudicial foreclosure cases. "To credit such defense would set similarly situated employees to lightly discharge their duty of employing reasonable skill and diligence and thus evade administrative liability xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  Safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to an orderly administration of justice, and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Atty. Ofilas'claim that he was not aware of circulars relative to collection of fees is unacceptable.<br><br>Anent his excuses for delayed deposit of funds and withdrawal of interest, Atty. Ofilas again failed to convince us with his invocation of good faith. The reasoning of the OCA is well-taken. No amount of convenience or expediency can justify this infraction of the rules. It is the duty of the clerks of court to fully comply with the circulars on deposits of collections.<br><br>SC Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93, as incorporated into the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court provide the guidelines for the accounting of court funds. All fiduciary collections shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank.  In SC Circular No. 5-93, the Land Bank was designated as the authorized government depository. Court personnel tasked with collections of court funds, such as clerk of court and cash clerks, should deposit immediately with authorized government depositories the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody. Delayed remittance of cash collections constitutes gross neglect of duty<sup> </sup>because this omission deprives the court of interest that may be earned if the amounts are deposited in a bank. In the same vein, clerks of court are required by SC Circular No. 13-92 to withdraw interest earned on deposits, and to remit the same to the account of the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) within two (2) weeks after the end of each quarter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Atty. Ofilas did not comply with any of the requirements.<br><br>In a line of decisions, the Court ruled that the "failure of a public officer to remit funds upon demand by an authorized officer constitutes prima facie evidence that the public officer has put such missing funds or property to personal use."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Hence, even when there is restitution of funds, "unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> There is more room for application of said rules in this case where neither of the respondents was able to offer a plausible explanation of the blatant infractions they had committed.<br><br>With respect to the act of opening a bank account with the Rural Bank of San Mateo, Atty. Ofilas can no longer invoke ignorance of existing regulations pertinent to his office. He was previously reminded by the Court to keep abreast of all applicable laws, jurisprudence and administrative circulars pertinent to his office.  It is highly regrettable that Atty. Ofilas took this warning lightly and without due importance, resulting in a greater indiscretion. Hence, his excuse of depositing check payments from extra-judicial foreclosure cases to his account because he had no way of allocating the payment between the Judiciary Development Fund and the General Fund is unnacceptable. The OCA presented a logical refutation: <i>"In the first place, the computation of the docket fee to be paid must already include the respective amounts to be allocated to the JDF and the GF so that the petitioners will know that they have to issue two (2) checks. Second, if payment of the docket fee is made through a single check, the remedy is not to accept the payment."</i><br><br>Based on the foregoing findings, Atty. Ofilas had clearly failed to live up to the standards of competence and integrity expected of an officer of the court. Mediocrity is not at all fit for a member of a complement tasked to dispense justice. His failure to exhibit administrative leadership and ability renders Atty. Ofilas guilty of negligence, incompetence, and gross inefficiency in the performance of his official duty as the Clerk of Court. Thus, the penalty of dismissal from service is proper considering his failure to exercise supervision on Ms. Baltazar's work and to educate himself on the financial aspects of his office resulting in an improper delegation of his duties. However, in view of Atty. Ofilas' compulsory retirement on August 18, 2007, the imposition of accessory penalties including the forfeiture of his retirement benefits is justified.<br><br>As for Judge Balquin-Reyes, the Court finds it inexcusable that she assumed her functions as an Executive Judge with manifest delay. As the Vice-Executive Judge, she should have exercised the duties and functions of an Executive Judge without need for her official designation as such. This is precisely what a Vice-Executive Judge must do: to take over in the absence of the Executive Judge. Lack of instructions from her predecessor does not justify the great risk she took by leaving the financial matters of the court to be handled without her supervision and monitoring. Simply put, had Judge Balquin-Reyes observed the <i>Guidelines in Making Withdrawals provided in SC </i>CIRCULAR NO 13-92,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> unauthorized withdrawals of court funds could have been prevented.<br><br>Judge Balquin-Reyes deserves admonition from the Court to monitor strict compliance of circulars in the proper handling of judiciary funds and to keep herself abreast of the Court's issuances relative to the Office of Executive and Vice-Executive Judges.<br><br>With respect to Ms. Baltazar, she was grossly inefficient in handling the finances of the court. Her bare admission that she performed duties relative to the collection and remittance of fees and had indeed allowed other employees to borrow from the court funds, shows her extensive participation in the irregularities reported by the audit team. There is no doubt that these acts constitute a grave offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Gross dishonesty, grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty, warrant the maximum penalty of dismissal from service as provided in Section 9, Rule XIV of the Civil Service Rules:<br><br><blockquote>"The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and the disqualification for reemployment in the government service. Further, it may be imposed without prejudice to criminal or civil liability."<br></blockquote><br>Ms. Baltazar's leave credits totaling 215.362 days amounting to a terminal leave pay of P98,966.85 (per computation of the Leave Division, Office of Administrative Services) and the salaries which she had earned until her separation from service should be forfeited and be applied to the payment of her liability. Further, the Court agrees that Ms. Baltazar's must be prosecuted for <i>malversation of public funds</i> under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code. Her plea for time extensions in order to repay the amount of shortage can neither mitigate nor exculpate her from criminal prosecution.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Ms. Aranzazu V.
