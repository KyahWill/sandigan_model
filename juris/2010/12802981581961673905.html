				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At bar are three consolidated Petitions for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> all concerning the operation of a preparatory and grade school located in Ayala Alabang Village, more particularly on a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 149166. The Petitions in G.R. Nos. 134269 and 134440 assail the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 51096, dated November 11, 1997 and July 2, 1998, respectively, which enjoined said school's continued operation on the ground that the same is in violation of the Deed of Restrictions annotated on the title of the subject property that limits the use of the lot to the establishment thereon of a preparatory (nursery and kindergarten) school.&nbsp; The Petition in G.R. No. 144518 challenges the Court of Appeals' Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated August 15, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 54438, which upheld the validity of a Muntinlupa Municipal Resolution correcting an alleged typographical error in a zoning ordinance.&nbsp; The zoning ordinance, as corrected by the challenged Muntinlupa Municipal Resolution, classifies the subject property as "institutional" where the operation of a grade school is allowed.<br><br><center><u><b>FACTS</b></u><br></center><br>The factual and procedural antecedents of these consolidated cases are as follows:<br><br>Sometime in 1984, subdivision developer Ayala Land, Inc. (ALI) sold a parcel of land to the spouses Jose and Cristina Yuson.&nbsp; In 1987, the spouses Yuson sold the same to the spouses Felipe and Mary Anne Alfonso.&nbsp; A Deed of Restrictions was annotated in TCT No. 149166 issued to the spouses Alfonso, as had been required by ALI.&nbsp; The Deed of Restrictions indicated that:<br><br><blockquote>2.2 USE AND OCCUPANCY - The property shall be used exclusively for the establishment and maintenance thereon of a preparatory (nursery and kindergarten) school, which may include such installations as an office for school administration, playground and garage for school vehicles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>ALI turned over the right and power to enforce the restrictions on the properties in the Ayala Alabang Village, including the above restrictions on TCT No. 149166, to the association of homeowners therein, the Ayala Alabang Village Association (AAVA).<br><br>In 1989, the spouses Alfonso opened on the same lot The Learning Child Center Pre-school (TLC), a preparatory school which initially consisted of nursery and kindergarten classes.&nbsp; In 1991, TLC was expanded to include a grade school program, the School of the Holy Cross, which provided additional grade levels as the pupils who initially enrolled advanced.<br><br>AAVA wrote several letters to TLC and the spouses Alfonso, essentially (1) protesting the TLC's and the spouses Alfonso's violation of the Deed of Restrictions, (2) requesting them to comply with the same, and (3) ordering them to desist from operating the grade school and from operating the nursery and kindergarten classes in excess of the two classrooms allowed by the ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><u><b>Injunction Case</b></u><br><br>On October 13, 1992, AAVA filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City an action for injunction against TLC and the spouses Alfonso, alleging breach of contract by the defendant spouses, particularly of the Deed of Restrictions, the contents of which likewise appear in the Deed of Absolute Sale.&nbsp; It also alleged violation of Metropolitan Manila Commission Ordinance No. 81-01 (MMC No. 81-01), otherwise known as the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for the National Capital Region and Barangay Ordinance No. 03, Series of 1991.&nbsp; MMC No. 81-01 classified Ayala Alabang Village for zoning purposes as a low-density residential area, or R-1, thereby limiting the use of the subject property to the establishment or operation of a nursery and kindergarten school, which should not exceed two classrooms.&nbsp; The aforementioned <i>barangay</i> ordinance, on the other hand, prohibited parking on either side of any street measuring eight meters in width. TLC is adjacent to Balabac and Cordillera Streets, which are both less than eight meters in width.&nbsp; AAVA prayed that defendants be restrained from continuing the operation of the school.&nbsp; The Complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 92-2950, and was raffled to Branch 65.<br><br>On November 24, 1992, owners of properties within the vicinity of TLC, namely the spouses Ernesto and Alma Arzaga, Maria Luisa Quisumbing, Arturo Sena, KSL Corporation, and LawPhil, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the adjacent property owners), filed a Complaint-in-Intervention, seeking the same relief as AAVA and prayed for damages.<br><br>On July 22, 1994, the RTC rendered its Decision in favor of AAVA, disposing of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, defendants are ordered to cease and desist at the end of the schoolyear 1994-95 from operating The Learning Child School beyond nursery and kindergarten classes with a maximum of two (2) classrooms in accordance with the Deed of Restrictions, and to pay the plaintiff the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) P20,000.00 in attorney's fees<br>2) costs of this suit.<br></div><br>The complaint-in-intervention is dismissed for failure of the plaintiffs-in-intervention to show by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to the damages prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC ruled that the operation of the grade school and the nursery and kindergarten classes in excess of two classrooms was in violation of a contract to which the defendants are bound.&nbsp; The RTC emphasized that the restrictions were in reality an easement which an owner of a real estate may validly impose under Article 688 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; The RTC also agreed with the plaintiffs therein that by allowing parking on either side of the streets adjacent to the school, the defendants likewise violated Barangay Ordinance No. 3, Series of 1991.<br><br>On August 19, 1994, TLC and the spouses Alfonso filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the said Decision.&nbsp; They alleged in the Motion that with the passage of Muntinlupa Zoning Ordinance No. 91-39 reclassifying the subject property as "institutional," there ceased to be a legal basis for the RTC to uphold the Deed of Restrictions on the title of the spouses Alfonso.&nbsp; The adjacent property owners did not move for a reconsideration of, nor appeal from, the said Decision insofar as it dismissed their Complaint-in-Intervention.<br><br>In an Order dated March 1, 1995, the RTC agreed with the spouses Alfonso and set aside its earlier Decision.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the RTC Order reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision of this Court dated 22 July 1995 is hereby reconsidered and set aside and the Complaint and Complaint-in-Intervention filed on 13 October 1992 and 24 November 1992, respectively, are dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC ruled that with the reclassification by Muntinlupa Zoning Ordinance No. 91-39 of the subject property, the earlier residential classification can no longer be enforced.&nbsp; Citing <i>Ortigas &amp; Co. Limited Partnership v. Feati Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> it decreed that while non-impairment of contracts is constitutionally guaranteed, the rule is not absolute since it has to be reconciled with the legitimate exercise of police power by the municipality.<br><br>On March 22, 1995, AAVA moved for a reconsideration of the above RTC Order.&nbsp; On July 21, 1995, the RTC denied the said Motion.<br><br>AAVA filed a Notice of Appeal on August 4, 1995.&nbsp; The Appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 51096.<br><br>On November 11, 1997, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision setting aside the March 1, 1995 RTC Resolution:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed order dated March 1, 1995 of the lower court in Civil Case No. 92-2950 is hereby SET ASIDE.&nbsp; The earlier decision of the said court dated July 22, 1994 is Reinstated. Costs against defendants-appellees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>On December 4, 1997, TLC and the spouses Alfonso moved for a reconsideration of the said Decision.&nbsp; On February 5, 1998, petitioners in G.R. No. 134440, namely, Jose Marie V. Aquino, Lorenzo Maria E. Velasco, Christopher E. Walmsley, Joanna Marie S. Sison, and Matthew Raphael C. Arce (Aquino, <i>et al.</i>), alleging that they are minor children who suffer from various learning disabilities and behavioral disorders benefiting from TLC's full-inclusion program, filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene and their own Motion for Reconsideration with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On July 2, 1998, the Court of Appeals promulgated the assailed Resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by TLC and the spouses Alfonso.&nbsp; In the same Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion to Intervene filed by Aquino, <i>et al</i>., for being proscribed by Section 2, Rule 19<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure.<br><br>TLC and the spouses Alfonso on one hand, and Aquino, <i>et al.</i>, on the other, filed separate Petitions for Review with this Court challenging the July 2, 1998 Resolution of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The Petition of TLC and the spouses Alfonso, filed on July 9, 1998, was docketed as G.R. No. 134269.&nbsp; The Petition of Aquino, <i>et al</i>., filed within the extended period on August 21, 1998, was docketed as G.R. No. 134440.<br><br><b><u>Zoning Ordinance Case</u></b><br><br>In the meantime, on October 3, 1994, while the Motion for Reconsideration of TLC and the spouses Alfonso was still pending in the RTC, the Municipality of Muntinlupa, through its Sangguniang Bayan, passed Resolution No. 94-179 correcting an alleged typographical error in the description of a parcel of land under the heading "Institutional Zone" in Appendix B of Ordinance No. 91-39, adjusting the description "Lot 25, Block <b>1</b>, Phase V, Ayala Alabang" to "Lot 25, Block <b>3</b>, Phase V, Ayala Alabang."&nbsp; This is the same ordinance which was used as basis by the Makati RTC in Civil Case No. 92-2950, when it reversed its own Decision on Motion for Reconsideration in its Order dated March 1, 1995.&nbsp; Lot 25, Block 3, Phase V is the subject property wherein TLC is located.<br><br>On November 29, 1994, the Municipality of Muntinlupa wrote a letter to the Metropolitan Manila Zoning Administration Office, informing the latter of the enactment of Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179.&nbsp; On December 1, 1994, the Municipality of Muntinlupa filed a Petition for the approval of Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB). AAVA and the adjacent property owners filed an Opposition.<br><br>On June 26, 1995, the HLURB issued its Resolution on the Petition of the Municipality of Muntinlupa, the dispositive part of which states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, we defer action to the Muntinlupa SB Resolution No. 94-179 and remand the same to the Sanguniang Bayan of Muntinlupa for the conduct of the required public hearings as mandated by Resolution No. 12, Series of 1991, of the Metro Manila Council entitled "Uniform Guidelines for Rezoning of the Metro Manila Area."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>According to the HLURB, Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 is not a case of a mere correction of an error but an actual rezoning of the property into an institutional area, and therefore remanded the same to the Sanguniang Bayan of Muntinlupa for the conduct of the required public hearings. The Municipality of Muntinlupa, TLC and the spouses Alfonso appealed the HLURB Resolution to the Office of the President.<br><br>On July 27, 1999, the Office of the President rendered its Decision, which held that Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 is a mere rectifying issuance to an alleged typographical error in Ordinance No. 91-39, and therefore does not need for its validity compliance with the mandatory requirements of notice and hearing pursuant to Resolution No. 12, series of 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the Metropolitan Manila Council:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Resolution of the Board of Commissioners, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, dated June 26, 1995 is hereby SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Accordingly, Resolution No. 94-179 of the Sanguniang Bayan (now Sangguniang Panglungsod) of Muntinlupa is declared valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>In said Decision, the Office of the President likewise turned down the alternative prayer of oppositors AAVA and the adjacent property owners that the Office of the President should recognize the Deed of Restrictions on the subject property and restrict the use thereof in accordance therewith.&nbsp; The Office of the President ruled on this matter that:<br><br><blockquote><b>Turning to the alternative relief being sought by the oppositor [that the Office of the President should recognize the Deed of Restrictions], the same cannot be granted.</b> The reason is simple.&nbsp; No less than Ayala Corporation - in consenting to the transfer from the Yusons to the Alfonsos of the subject property - agreed that the "<i>l<u>ot (shall) be used for school and related activities</u></i>", thereby effectively freeing the appellants from the deed restriction that the "<i>Lots (shall) be used exclusively for residential purposes</i>."&nbsp; This is not all.&nbsp; Prior to its sale, the property in question was already used for school purposes.<br><br><b>Further the aforementioned Muntinlupa Zoning Ordinance itself classifies the area occupied by the appellants' school as an "institutional zone" and not a residential area.</b> And the fact that TLC is not the only school operating within the AAV - De la Salle-Zobel, Benedictine Abbey School, Woodrose School, to name a few, conduct classes within the plush village - renders unpersuasive appellees' line that "x x x Through the illegal operation of their school, the parties-in-interest appellants spouses Alfonso have effectively violated the dignity, personality, privacy and peace of mind of the residents of the Village x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Boldfacing supplied; underscoring and italization are present in the original.)</blockquote><br>AAVA and the adjacent property owners filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The Petition was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 54438.<br><br>On August 15, 2000, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision slightly modifying the Decision of the Office of the President:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is partly GRANTED.&nbsp; The Decision appealed from is AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the ruling therein passing upon the effect of Ordinance No. 91-39 on the Deed of Restrictions imposed on the subject property is hereby VACATED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals agreed with the Office of the President that being merely a rectifying issuance and not a rezoning enactment, the questioned Resolution did not have to comply with the mandatory requirements of notice and hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; However, the Court of Appeals found the Office of the President to have exceeded its authority when it ruled<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that the Deed of Restrictions had lost its force and effect in view of the passage of Ordinance No. 91-39. According to the Court of Appeals, the Office of the President effectively overruled said appellate court's Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 51096 wherein it ruled that the reclassification under Ordinance No. 91-39 does not have the effect of nullifying the Deed of Restrictions at the back of the title of the subject property, inasmuch as there is no conflict between the Ordinance and the Deed of Restrictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On October 3, 2000, AAVA and the adjacent property owners filed the third consolidated Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> with this Court assailing the above Court of Appeals Decision. This Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 144518.<br><br><u><center><b>ISSUES</b><br></center></u><br>Though later in time, we shall first determine the issue in G.R. No. 144518, as the validity of Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 impinges on the issue of the legality of operating a grade school in the subject property, which is the main issue in G.R. Nos. 134269 and 134440.&nbsp; We shall then resolve the issue in G.R. No. 134440 on whether Aquino, <i>et al.</i>, should be allowed to intervene in the injunction case against TLC.&nbsp; Thereafter, we shall rule on the merits of G.R. Nos. 134269 and 134440 by deciding once and for all whether or not TLC and the spouses Alfonso should be enjoined from continuing the operation of a grade school in the subject property.<br><br>The main issues to be decided by this Court, culled from the consolidated Petitions, are therefore the following:<br><br><ol><li> Whether or not the Court of Appeals is correct in upholding the validity of Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the Court of Appeals was correct in denying Aquino, <i>et al.</i>'s Motion to Intervene; and<br><br></li><li>Whether or not TLC and the spouses Alfonso should be enjoined from continuing the operation of a grade school in the subject property.</li></ol><br>As regards the third and decisive issue, the parties further exchanged their views on the following two sub-issues:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not Muntinlupa Municipal Ordinance No. 91-39, as allegedly corrected by Muntinlupa Resolution No. 91-179, has the effect of nullifying the provisions of the Deed of Restrictions on the subject property; and<br><br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not AAVA is estopped from enforcing the Deed of Restrictions.<br></div><br><u><center><b>RULINGS</b><br></center></u><br><b><u>Validity of Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179</u></b><br><br>AAVA claims that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the Decision of the Office of the President that Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 was merely a rectifying issuance and not a rezoning enactment, and therefore did not have to comply with the requirements of notice and hearing which are required for zoning ordinances.&nbsp; Notice and hearing are required under the Uniform Guidelines for the Rezoning of the Metropolitan Manila Area, contained in Resolution No. 12, series of 1991, of the then Metropolitan Manila Commission (MMC).<br><br>In asserting that Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 is not a mere rectifying enactment, AAVA faults the Office of the President and the Court of Appeals in allegedly accepting hook, line and sinker the assertion of the ENCRFO Regional Officer and the Municipality (now City) of Muntinlupa itself that Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 was passed merely to correct a typographical error in Appendix B of Ordinance No. 91-39.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; AAVA adopts the HLURB finding that it was allegedly:<br><br><blockquote>[H]ard to believe that the denomination in the text of Block 1 and instead of Block 3 as an institutional zone was an accident of (sic) mere oversight, the numbers 1 &amp; 3 are not adjoining each other, but are separated by the number 2.&nbsp; TLC's position would have been worth considering had the erroneous phrase typed been Block 2 for then it is more plausible and probable for the typist to have mistyped a "2" instead of a "3."&nbsp; Besides, Blocks 1 and 3 are not even near each other on the map. Finally, if it were an error, it is surprising that no one noticed it until after a court had ruled against a party, who now seeks to use said correcting ordinance in its defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>The purpose of Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 is clearly set forth in its whereas clauses:<br><br><blockquote>SAPAGKAT, ang Sanguniang Bayan ng Muntinlupa ay pinagtibay ang Kautusang Bayan Bilang 91-39 na nagsasaad ng bagong pagreresona ng Bayan ng Muntinlupa;<br><br>SAPAGKAT, sa pagrerepaso sa nabanggit na kautusang bayan ay napag-alamang nagkaroon ng isang "typographical error sa Appendix B" nito;<br><br>SAPAGKAT, sa halip na Lot 25, Block 3, Phase V, Ayala Alabang, ang nailagay o nai-type sa hindi sinasadyang dahilan ay Lot 25, Block 1, Phase V, Ayala Alabang;<br><br>SAPAGKAT, ang pagtatamang ito sa teksto ng Appendix B na nakapaloob sa institutional zone ay hindi makakaapekto sa ibang bahagi o kabuuang nilalaman at itinatakda sa kautusang bayan bilang 91-39.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Even more telling that there was indeed a typographical error in Appendix B of Ordinance No. 91-39 is the fact that <b>both</b> the Official Zoning Map of Muntinlupa and that of the Ayala Alabang Village show that the subject property, described as "Lot 25, Block 3, Phase V of Ayala Alabang" is classified as "institutional."&nbsp; On the other hand, <b>neither</b> the Official Zoning Map of Muntinlupa nor that of the Ayala Alabang Village classify "Lot 25, Block 1, Phase V of Ayala Alabang" as institutional.&nbsp; The official zoning map is an indispensable and integral part of a zoning ordinance, without which said ordinance would be considered void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, Section 3 of Ordinance No. 91-39 expressly provides that the Official Zoning Map of Muntinlupa shall be made an integral part of said ordinance.&nbsp; Both the MMC and the HLURB Board of Commissioners approved the Official Zoning Map of Muntinlupa.&nbsp; Furthermore, the very reason for the enactment of Muntinlupa Zoning Ordinance No. 91-39 is the need to accomplish an updated zoning map, as shown by the following clause in MMC's Resolution No. 2, series of 1992:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the Sanguniang Bayan of Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, <b><u>approved on 10 December 1991 Municipal Ordinance No. 91-39</u></b> rezoning the entire municipality (as shown in the accompanying zoning map and described in the attached Appendix "B") <b><u>as a response to the need to have an updated zoning map</u></b>.&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphases supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>It is furthermore noted that TLC's and the spouses Alfonso's claim that Lot 25, Block 1, Phase 5 of Ayala Alabang has been and remains to be a residential lot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> has never been rebutted by AAVA.&nbsp; As regards the comment that Blocks 1 and 3 are not even near the map, we agree with TLC and the spouses Alfonso that this bolsters their position even more, as the distance would make it difficult to commit an error on the map.&nbsp; It is much more plausible to mistype a single digit than to mistake an area for another that is far away from it.<br><br>It is therefore crystal clear that there was a typographical error in Muntinlupa Zoning Ordinance No. 91-39.&nbsp; AAVA, however, furthermore claims that even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that there was a typographical error in the said zoning ordinance, the proper remedy is to legislate a new zoning ordinance, following all the formalities therefor, citing the leading case of <i>Resins, Incorporated v. Auditor General</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Again, we disagree.<br><br><i>Resins</i> was decided on the principle of separation of powers, that the judiciary should not interfere with the workings of the executive and legislative branches of government:<br><br><blockquote>If there has been any mistake in the printing of the bill before it was certified by the officers of Congress and approved by the Executive - on which we cannot speculate, without jeopardizing the principle of separation of powers and undermining one of the cornerstones of our democratic system - the remedy is by amendment or curative legislation, not by judicial decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Resins</i>, it was a taxpayer who alleged that there was an error in the printing of the statute, unlike in the case at bar where it is the Municipality (now City) of Muntinlupa itself which seeks to correct its own error in the printing of the ordinance. While it would be a violation of the principle of separation of powers for the courts to interfere with the wordings of a statute, there would be no violation of said principle for the court to merely affirm the correction made by the same entity which committed the error. In <i>Resins</i>, there is a presumption of regularity in favor of the enrolled bill, which the courts should not speculate on.&nbsp; In the case at bar, it is the curative Muntinlupa Resolution No. 94-179 which is entitled to a presumption of regularity.<br><br>Finally, AAVA claims that the power to evaluate, approve or disapprove zoning ordinances lies with the HLURB under Article IV, Section 5(b) of Executive Order No. 648.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; AAVA reminds us that the decisions of administrative agencies on matters pertaining to their jurisdiction will generally not be disturbed by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We should remind AAVA that the Court of Appeals, the court that was first to reexamine the case at bar, affirmed the Decision of the Office of the President, which had set aside the HLURB ruling.&nbsp; The authority of the HLURB is certainly subordinate to that of the Office of the President and the acts of the former may be set aside by the latter.&nbsp; Furthermore, while it is true that courts will not interfere in matters which are addressed to the sound discretion of government agencies entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under the special technical knowledge and training of such agencies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> it should be noted that the HLURB and the then MMC were both tasked to regulate the rezoning of the Metropolitan Manila area.

The two-classroom limit is actually imposed, not by the Deed of Restrictions, but by MMC Ordinance No. 81-01, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for the National Capital Region, which classified Ayala Alabang Village as a low density residential area or an "R-1 zone."&nbsp; The principal permitted uses of a "low-density residential area" or "R-1 zone," the classification of the subject property if not for the correction under Muntinlupa Municipal Resolution No. 94-179, is listed in Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance No. 81-01 as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In R-1 districts, no building, structure or land used, and no building or structure shall be erected or altered in whole or in part except for one or more of the following:<br><br>Principal Uses<br><br><ol><li>One-family dwellings;<br><br></li><li>Duplex type buildings;<br><br></li><li>Churches or similar places of worship and dwelling for the religious and seminaries;<br><br></li><li><b>Nursery and kindergarten schools, provided that they do not exceed two (2) classrooms;</b><br><br></li><li>Clubhouses, lodges and other social centers;<br><br></li><li> Parks, playgrounds, pocket parks, parkways, promenades and playlots;<br><br></li><li>Recreational uses such as golf courses, tennis courts, baseball diamonds, swimming pools and similar uses operated by the government or private individuals as membership organizations for the benefit of their members, families or guests not primarily for gain;<br><br></li><li>Townhouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></li></ol>&nbsp;

We find that a clarification of the doctrines laid down in the aforestated cases of <i>Co</i>, <i>Ortigas</i>, and <i>Presley</i> is in order.<br><br>In the <i>Ortigas</i> case which had been interpreted differently by the RTC and the Court of Appeals, this Court, in upholding the exercise of police power attendant in the reclassification of the subject property therein over the Deed of Restrictions over the same property, took into consideration the prevailing conditions in the area:<br><br><blockquote>Resolution No. 27, s-1960 declaring the western part of Highway 54, now E. de los Santos Avenue (EDSA, for short) from Shaw Boulevard to the Pasig River as an industrial and commercial zone, was obviously passed by the Municipal Council of Mandaluyong, Rizal in the exercise of police power to safeguard or promote the health, safety, peace, good order and general welfare of the people in the locality.&nbsp; <b><u>Judicial notice may be taken of the conditions prevailing in the area, especially where lots Nos. 5 and 6 are located. The lots themselves not only front the highway; industrial and commercial complexes have flourished about the place.&nbsp; EDSA, a main traffic artery which runs through several cities and municipalities in the Metro Manila area, supports an endless stream of traffic and the resulting activity, noise and pollution are hardly conducive to the health, safety or welfare of the residents in its route.</u></b>&nbsp; Having been expressly granted the power to adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances or regulations, the municipality of Mandaluyong, through its Municipal Council, was reasonably, if not perfectly, justified under the circumstances, in passing the subject resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Near the end of the <i>Ortigas </i>Decision, this Court added:<br><br><blockquote>Applying the principle just stated to the present controversy, We can say that <b><u>since it is now unprofitable, nay a hazard to the health and comfort, to use Lots Nos. 5 and 6 for strictly residential purposes, defendants-appellees should be permitted, on the strength of the resolution promulgated under the police power of the municipality, to use the same for commercial purposes</u>.</b> In <i>Burgess v. Magarian, et al.,</i> it was held that "restrictive covenants running with the land are binding on all subsequent purchasers x x x."&nbsp; However, Section 23 of the zoning ordinance involved therein contained a <i>proviso</i> expressly declaring that the ordinance was not intended "to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreement between parties." <b> </b>In the case at bar, no such <i>proviso</i> is found in the subject resolution.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, as observed by the Court of Appeals, the subject property, though declared as an institutional lot, nevertheless lies within a residential subdivision and is surrounded by residential lots.&nbsp; Verily, the area surrounding TLC did not undergo a radical change similar to that in <i>Ortigas </i>but rather remained purely residential to this day.&nbsp; Significantly, the lot occupied by TLC is located along one of the smaller roads (less than eight meters in width) within the subdivision.&nbsp; It is understandable why ALI, as the developer, restricted use of the subject lot to a smaller, preparatory school that will generate less traffic than bigger schools.&nbsp; With its operation of both a preparatory and grade school, TLC's student population had already swelled to around 350 students at the time of the filing of this case.&nbsp; Foreseeably, the greater traffic generated by TLC's expanded operations will affect the adjacent property owners enjoyment and use of their own properties.&nbsp; AAVA's and ALI's insistence on (1) the enforcement of the Deed of Restrictions or (2) the obtainment of the approval of the affected residents for any modification of the Deed of Restrictions is reasonable.&nbsp; On the other hand, the then Municipality of Muntinlupa did not appear to have any special justification for declaring the subject lot as an institutional property.&nbsp; On the contrary, Engr. Hector S. Baltazar, the Municipal Planning and Development Officer of Muntilupa, testified that in declaring the subject property as institutional the municipality simply adopted the classification used in a zoning map purportedly submitted by ALI itself.&nbsp; In other words, the municipality was not asserting any interest or zoning purpose contrary to that of the subdivision developer in declaring the subject property as institutional.<br><br>It is therefore proper to reconcile the apparently conflicting rights of the parties herein pursuant to the aforementioned <i>Co</i> case.&nbsp; In <i>Co</i>, agricultural tenant Roaring, facing a demolition order, filed a complaint for maintenance of possession with the Court of Agrarian Relations of Quezon City. The landowner challenged the jurisdiction of the court arguing that the classification of the subject property therein from agricultural to a light industrial zone.&nbsp; This Court denied the applicability of the reclassification, and clarified <i>Ortigas</i>:<br><br><blockquote>This is not to suggest that a zoning ordinance cannot affect existing legal relationships for it is settled that it can legally do so, being an exercise of the police power. As such, it is superior to the impairment clause.&nbsp; In the case of <i>Ortigas &amp; Co. v. Feati Bank</i>, for example, we held that a municipal ordinance establishing a commercial zone could validly revoke an earlier stipulation in a contract of sale of land located in the area that it could be used for residential purposes only. In the case at bar, fortunately for the private respondent, no similar intention is clearly manifested. Accordingly, we affirm the view that the zoning ordinance in question, while valid as a police measure, was not intended to affect existing rights protected by the impairment clause.<br><br><b>It is always a wise policy to reconcile apparently conflicting rights under the Constitution and to preserve both instead of nullifying one against the other.</b>&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In <i>Presley</i>, the Deed of Restrictions of Bel-Air subdivision likewise restricted its use for a residential purpose. However, the area (Jupiter Street) where the lot was located was later reclassified into a high density commercial (C-3) zone.&nbsp; Bel-Air Village Association (BAVA) sought to enjoin petitioner therein from operating its Hot Pan de Sal Store, citing the Deed of Restrictions.&nbsp; We allowed the operation of the Hot Pan de Sal Store despite the Deed of Restrictions, but not without examining the surrounding area like what we did in <i>Ortigas</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Jupiter Street has been highly commercialized since the passage of Ordinance No. 81-01. The records indicate that commercial buildings, offices, restaurants, and stores have already sprouted in this area. We, therefore, see no reason why the petitioner should be singled out and prohibited from putting up her hot pan de sal store. Thus, in accordance with the ruling in the <i>Sangalang</i> case, the respondent court's decision has to be reversed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>Furthermore, we should also take note that in the case of <i>Presley</i>, there can be no reconciliation between the restriction to use of the property as a residential area and its reclassification as a high density commercial (C-3) zone wherein the use of the property for residential purposes is not one of the allowable uses.<br><br><i>Alleged estoppel on the part of AAVA from enforcing the Deed of Restrictions</i><br><br>TLC and the spouses Alfonso's main argument against the enforcement of the Deed of Restrictions on their property is the AAVA had allegedly abrogated said restrictions by its own acts.&nbsp; TLC and the spouses Alfonso proceeded to enumerate acts allegedly constituting a setting aside of said restrictions:<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; AAVA Village Manager Frank Roa admitted before the trial court that AAVA had previously approved the proposed construction of a school building with 24 classrooms, which approval is further evidenced by a stamp mark of AAVA on the Site Development Plan with the signature of Frank Roa himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>2.
