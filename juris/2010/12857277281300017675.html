The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), as insurer of the Boeing 737 that figured in the collision, intervened.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center></u><br>The trial court ruled that the proximate cause of the collision was the negligence of Alzola, Lim, and Linog, Jr., as ATO's traffic control supervisor, ground traffic controller, and air traffic controller, respectively, at the time of the collision. The trial court further held that the direct cause of the collision was the negligence of&nbsp; Casiño and Isaac, as the pilots of the Boeing 737 that collided with the Twin Otter. The decretal portion of the trial court's decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants Philippine Air Lines and its pilots, Rogelio Casiño and Ruel Isaac, and Air Transportation Office and its comptrollers, Danilo Alzola, Rogelio Lim and Ernesto Linog, Jr., jointly and severally, to pay:<br><br>a) Plaintiff Pacific Airways Corporation the amount of Php15,000,000.00 and the further amount of Php100,000.00 a day from April 2, 1996 until it is fully reimbursed for the value of its RP-C1154 plane, as actual damages, and the amount of Php3,000,000.00, as exemplary damages, and the amount of Php1,000,000.00, as and for attorney's fees and expenses of litigation;<br><br>b) Plaintiffs Ely B. Bongabong<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and Michael F. Galvez, the amount of Php5,000.00 each, as actual damages; the amount of Php500,000.00, as and for moral damages; Php500,000.00 as and for exemplary damages, and the amount of Php50,000.00, as and for attorney's fees;<br><br>c) Defendants are, likewise, ordered to pay, jointly and severally, to plaintiffs the costs of this suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><br>PAL, Casiño, Isaac, GSIS, ATO, Alzola, Lim, and Linog, Jr., all appealed the trial court's Decision to the Court of Appeals.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b><br></center></u><br>The Court of Appeals found that the trial court did not commit any reversible error. In its 28 October 2004 decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed <i>in toto</i> the decision of the trial court, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby DISMISSED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 112, Pasay City dated July 27, 2001 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><br>PAL, Casiño, Isaac, GSIS, ATO, Alzola, Lim, and Linog, Jr., filed their respective motions for reconsideration. The appellate court denied for lack of merit all the motions for reconsideration except the one filed by Linog, Jr.<br><br>The Court of Appeals gave weight to the 20 March 2003 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> on appeal of the RTC (Branch 108) of Pasay City in Criminal Case No. 02-1979 acquitting Linog, Jr., who was convicted in the original Decision together with Alzola and Lim, of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with serious and slight physical injuries in connection with the collision. Since Alzola and Lim did not appeal, the judgment of conviction against them became final. Alzola and Lim were&nbsp; sentenced to <i>arresto mayor</i> or imprisonment for two (2) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals reasoned that since the trial court in the criminal case has ruled that Linog, Jr. was not negligent, then the act from which the civil liability might arise did not exist. In its 15 November 2005 Resolution, the Court of Appeals decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision subject of the motions for reconsideration is MODIFIED in that the case against defendant-appellant ERNESTO LINOG, JR. is dismissed. The decision is AFFIRMED in all other respects.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, the instant consolidated petitions for review.<br><br>In G.R. No. 170418, petitioners PAL, Casiño, and Isaac argue that the Court of Appeals should have applied the emergency rule instead of the last clear chance doctrine. Petitioners claim that even if the PAL pilots were negligent, PAL had exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its pilots. Petitioners&nbsp; contend that the Court of Appeals awarded damages without any specific supporting proof as required by law. Petitioners also claim that the Court of Appeals should have awarded their counterclaim for damages.<br><br>In G.R. No. 170414, petitioner GSIS points out that PAC's pilots were the ones guilty of negligence as they violated the Rules of the Air, which provide that right of way belongs to the aircraft on take-off roll and the aircraft on the right side of another.&nbsp; GSIS stresses that such negligence was the proximate cause of the collision. GSIS posits that PAC, Bungabong, and Galvez should be held solidarily liable to pay GSIS the cost of repairing the insured aircraft.<br><br>In G.R. No. 170460, petitioners ATO, Alzola, and Lim call our attention to the fact that PAC was a mere lessee, not the owner of the Twin Otter.&nbsp; They argue that PAC, as mere lessee, was not the real party-in-interest in the complaint seeking recovery for damages sustained by the Twin Otter. Petitioners maintain that&nbsp; ground and air traffic clearances were the joint responsibility of ATO and the pilots-in-command.&nbsp; Petitioners aver that Bungabong and Galvez were negligent in&nbsp; asking for clearance to cross an active runway while still 350 meters away from the runway. Petitioners claim that PAL had the right of way and that PAC's pilots had the last clear chance to prevent the collision.<br><br><u><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center></u><br>The sole issue for resolution is who among the parties is liable for negligence under the circumstances.<br><br><u><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center></u><br>The petitions are meritorious.<br><br>In a petition for review under Rule 45, only questions of law may be raised. This rule, however, admits of certain exceptions as when the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts or the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>After thoroughly going over the evidence on record in this case, we are unable to sustain the finding of fact and legal conclusion of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>To ascertain who among the parties is liable for negligence, we must refer to the applicable rules governing the specific traffic management of aircrafts at an airport. The Rules of the Air<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the Air Transportation Office apply to all aircrafts registered in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The Boeing 737 and the Twin Otter in this case were both registered in the Philippines. Both are thus subject to the Rules of the Air. In case of danger of collision between two aircrafts, the Rules of the Air state:<br><br><blockquote>2.2.4.7 <i>Surface Movement of Aircraft</i>. In case of danger of collision between <b>two aircrafts taxiing</b> on the maneuvering area of an aerodrome, the following shall apply:<br><br>a) When two aircrafts are approaching head on, or approximately so, each shall stop or where practicable, alter its course to the right so as to keep well clear.<br><br>b) <b>When two aircrafts are on a converging course, the one which has the other on its right shall give way</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In this case, however, the Boeing 737 and the Twin Otter were not both taxiing at the time of the collision. Only the Twin Otter was taxiing. The Boeing 737 was already on take-off roll. The Rules of the Air provide:<br><br><blockquote>2.2.4.6 <i>Taking Off</i>. An aircraft taxiing on the maneuvering area of an aerodrome shall<b> give way to aircraft taking off or about to take off</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Therefore, PAL's aircraft had the right of way at the time of collision, not simply because it was on the right side of PAC's aircraft, but more significantly, because it was "<b>taking off or about to take off</b>."<br><br><u><center><b>PAC's Pilots</b><br></center></u><br>For disregarding PAL's right of way, PAC's pilots were grossly negligent. Gross negligence is one that is characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>We find it hard to believe that PAC's pilots did not see the Boeing 737 when they looked to the left and to the right before approaching the runway. It was a clear summer evening in April and the Boeing 737, only 200 meters away, had its inboard lights, outboard lights, taxi lights, and logo lights on before and during the actual take-off roll.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The only plausible explanation why PAC's pilots did not see the Boeing 737 was that they did not really look to the left and to the right before crossing the active runway.<br><br>Records show that PAC's pilots, while still 350 meters away, prematurely requested clearance to cross the active runway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; ATO points out that PAC's pilots should have made a full stop at the holding point to ask for updated clearance right before crossing the active runway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Had PAC's pilots done so, ATO would by then be in a position to determine if there was an aircraft on a take-off roll at the runway. The collision would not have happened.<br><br><center><u><b>ATO, Alzola, Lim, and Linog, Jr.</b></u><br></center><br>The Rules of Air Control govern airplane traffic management and clearance at the then Manila International Airport. It contains several provisions indicating that airplane traffic management and clearance are not the sole responsibility of ATO and its traffic controllers, but of the pilots-in-command of aircrafts as well. The Rules of Air Control state:<br><br><blockquote>1.3<b> The pilot-in-command of an aircraft</b> shall, whether manipulating the controls or not, be responsible for the operation of the aircraft in accordance with the rules of the air, except that he <b>may depart from these rules in circumstances that render such departure absolutely necessary in the interest of safety</b>.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>1.5&nbsp; <b>The pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall have final authority as to the disposition of the aircraft while he is in command</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>3.1&nbsp; <b>Clearances</b> are based solely on expediting and separating aircraft and <b>do not constitute authority to violate any applicable regulations for promoting safety</b> <b>of flight operations</b> or for any other purpose. (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>If an air traffic control clearance is not suitable to the pilot-in-command of an aircraft, he may request, and, if practicable, obtain an amended clearance</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>10.1.5 <b> Clearances</b> issued by controllers relate to traffic and aerodrome conditions only and <b>do not relieve a pilot of any responsibility whatsoever in connection with a possible violation of applicable rules and regulations</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Therefore, even if ATO gave both PAL's pilots and PAC's pilots clearance to take off and clearance to cross runway 13, respectively, it remained the primary responsibility of the pilots-in-command to see to it that the respective clearances given were suitable. Since the pilots-in-command have the <b>final authority</b> as to the disposition of the aircraft, they cannot, in case a collision occurs, pass the blame to ATO for issuing clearances that turn out to be unsuitable.<br><br>The clearance to cross runway 13, premature as it was, was not an absolute license for PAC's pilots to recklessly maneuver the Twin Otter across an active runway.&nbsp; PAC's pilots should have stopped first at the holding point to ask for clearance to cross the active runway. It was wrong for them to have relied on a prematurely requested clearance which was issued while they were still 350 meters away. Their defense, that it did not matter whether the clearance was premature or not as long as the clearance was actually granted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> only reveals their poor judgment and gross negligence in the performance of their duties.<br><br>On the other hand, evidence on record shows that the air traffic controller properly issued the clearance to take off to the Boeing 737. Nothing on record indicates any irregularity in the issuance of the clearance. In fact, the trial court, in the criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with serious and slight physical injuries in connection with the collision, ruled that air traffic controller Linog, Jr. was not negligent. The Court of Appeals, in its 15 November 2005 Resolution, absolved Linog, Jr. of civil liability for damages based on his acquittal in the criminal case.<br><br>While Alzola and Lim, as found by the trial court in the criminal case for reckless imprudence, may have been negligent in the performance of their functions, such negligence is only contributory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Their contributory negligence arises from their granting the premature request of PAC's pilots for clearance to cross runway 13 while the Twin Otter was still 350 meters away from runway 13. However, as explained earlier, the granting of their premature request for clearance did not relieve PAC's pilots from complying with the Rules of the Air.<br><br><center><u><b>PAL's Pilots</b></u><br></center><br>Records show that PAL's pilots timely requested clearance to take off. Linog, Jr., ATO's air traffic controller, duly issued the clearance to take off.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Under the Rules of the Air, PAL's aircraft being on take-off roll undisputedly had the right of way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Further, the Rules of Air Control provide:<br><br><blockquote>2.2.4.1 The aircraft that has the right of way <b>shall maintain its heading and speed</b>, x x x. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, even if Casiño noticed from the corner of his eye a small airplane taxiing on the left side and approaching halfway of fox 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> it was fairly reasonable for PAL's pilots to assume that they may proceed with the take-off because the taxiing aircraft would naturally respect their right of way and not venture to cross the active runway while the Boeing 737 was on take-off roll.<br><br>Applicable by analogy is the case of <i>Santos v. BLTB,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> where the Court applied the principle that a motorist who is properly proceeding on his own side of the highway, even after he sees an approaching motorist coming toward him on the wrong side, is generally entitled to assume that the other motorist will return to his proper lane of traffic.<br><br><center><u><b>Proximate Cause</b></u><br></center><br>After assiduously studying the records of this case and carefully weighing the arguments of the parties, we are convinced that the immediate and proximate case of the collision is the gross negligence of PAC's pilots. Proximate cause is defined as that cause, which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury, and without which the result would not have occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this case, the fact that PAC's pilots disregarded PAL's right of way and did not ask for updated clearance right before crossing an active runway was the proximate cause of the collision. Were it not for such gross negligence on the part of PAC's pilots, the collision would not have happened.<br><br>The Civil Code provides that when a plaintiff's own negligence is the immediate and proximate cause of his injury, he cannot recover damages.<br><br><blockquote><b> </b>Art. 2179. <b>When the plaintiff's own negligence was the immediate and proximate cause of his injury, he cannot recover damages.</b> But if his negligence was only contributory, the immediate and proximate cause of the injury being the defendant's lack of due care, the plaintiff may recover damages, but the courts shall mitigate the damages to be awarded. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Under the law and prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> PAC and its pilots, whose own gross negligence was the immediate and proximate cause of their own injuries, must bear the cost of such injuries. They cannot recover damages. Civil Case No. 96-0565 for sum of money and damages, which PAC, Bungabong, and Galvez filed against PAL, Casiño, Isaac, ATO, Alzola, Lim, and Linog, Jr. should have been dismissed for lack of legal basis.<br><br><u><center><b>PAL's Counterclaims</b><br></center></u><br>We find supported by law and evidence on record PAL's counterclaim for actual or compensatory damages but only in the amount of US$548,819.93<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> representing lease charges during the period the Boeing 737 was not flying. The said amount cannot be claimed against the insurance policy covering the Boeing 737. In this connection, the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 2207. If the plaintiff's property has been insured, and he has received indemnity from the insurance company for the injury or loss arising out of the wrong or breach of contract complained of, the insurance company shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured against the wrongdoer or the person who has violated the contract. <b>If the amount paid by the insurance company does not fully cover the injury or loss, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to recover the deficiency from the person causing the loss or injury</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Under the law, GSIS, as insurer subrogee of PAL's right to claim actual or compensatory damages in connection with the repair of the damaged Boeing 737, is entitled to reimbursement for the amount it advanced. GSIS claims reimbursement for the amount of US$2,775,366.84.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> In support of its claim, GSIS presented statements of account, check vouchers, and invoices<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> proving payment for the repair of&nbsp; the Boeing 737 in the total amount of US$2,775,366.84. We find the claim fully supported by evidence on record and thus we resolve to grant the same.<br><br>With regard to PAL's other counterclaims, settled is the rule that the award of moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees is discretionary based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The actual losses sustained by the aggrieved parties and the gravity of the injuries must be considered in arriving at reasonable levels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Understandably, Casiño and Isaac suffered sleepless nights and were temporarily unable to work after the collision. They are thus entitled to moral damages as well as exemplary damages considering that PAC's pilots acted with gross negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Attorney's fees are generally not recoverable except when exemplary damages are awarded<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> as in this case. We thus deem the amounts of P100,000 in moral damages, P100,000 in exemplary damages, and P50,000 in attorney's fees to be in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence and appropriate given the circumstances.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petitions.
