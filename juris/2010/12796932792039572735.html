				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Following her arrest during an alleged drug buy-bust operation conducted on June 25, 2004, Sapia Andongan y Sandigang (appellant) was charged for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila in Criminal Case No. 04-227859.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the June 29, 2004 Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed against appellant reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about June 25, 2004 in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to <u>sell</u>, trade, deliver, or give away to another any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly sell or offer for sale ZERO POINT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX <u>(0.146) grams of white crystalline substance known as "shabu"</u> placed in a transparent plastic sachet marked as "SSA" containing methylamphetamine hydrochloride, which is a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Culled from the evidence for the prosecution consisting, in the main, of the testimony of PO2 Elymar Garcia (PO2 Garcia), a police officer assigned at the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) Office of the Moriones, Tondo Police Station, is the following version:<br><br>On the information of a confidential informant, the SAID Office formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation against appellant for her alleged illegal drugs trade.&nbsp; With a P500.00 bill on which "RR," representing the initials of team leader SPO3 Rolando del Rosario (SPO3 del Rosario), was marked.&nbsp; The team, together with the confidential informant, met appellant at Abad Santos Avenue along Bambang Street at around 7:50 p.m. of June 25, 2004.<br><br>Informed that PO2 Garcia wanted to buy <i>shabu, </i>appellant inquired how much, to which PO2 Garcia replied P500.00 worth.&nbsp; As PO2 Garcia handed that amount to appellant, the latter drew from her pocket a plastic sachet of white crystalline substance which she gave to him.&nbsp; At that instant, PO2 Garcia introduced himself as a police officer, apprised appellant of her constitutional rights and, together with the team members, arrested her.<br><br>The seized item was submitted for laboratory examination and found positive for <i>shabu</i> (Exhibit "C"), hence, appellant's indictment.<br><br>At the Pre-trial, the defense counsel from the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) declared that it was interposing a negative defense and that it was not entering into any stipulation other than on the trial court's jurisdiction and appellant's identity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>During the trial, the parties stipulated on the qualification of forensic chemist, P/Insp. Elisa G. Reyes (Elisa), and on the genuineness and due execution of the documents brought over by her. The prosecution admitted though that Elisa had no personal knowledge as to the source of the specimen which she subjected to laboratory examination.&nbsp; Her testimony was thereupon dispensed with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>By Decision dated June 5, 2006, Branch 2 of the Manila RTC&nbsp; convicted appellant as charged, penalizing her with life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.&nbsp; Thus it disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding accused, Sapia Andongan y Sandigang, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, she is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.<br><br>The specimen is forfeited in favor of the government and the Branch Clerk of Court, accompanied by the Branch Sheriff, is directed to turn over with dispatch and upon receipt the said specimen to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for proper disposal in accordance with the law and rules.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of March 31, 2008, <i>affirmed </i>the trial court's decision and, by Resolution dated May 13, 2008, it elevated the case to this Court for further review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Both parties adopted their briefs filed before the appellate court as theirs before this Court.<br><br>Appellant, an <i>ukay-ukay</i> clothing vendor married to one Sammy Sapak who worked as a security guard, gave the following version:<br><br>At about 6:00 p.m. on the day she was arrested, she was at her husband's workplace along Bambang St., Tondo, Manila where she brought him dinner.&nbsp; After her husband partook of his dinner, six armed men suddenly arrived, apprehended her, and forced her to go along with them to the police precinct where the policemen emptied her bag and took her P600.00.<br><br>Assailing her conviction, on the basis of the testimony of the sole prosecution witness-PO2 Garcia, appellant questions why the buy-bust team leader, SPO3 del Rosario, was not presented to corroborate PO2 Garcia's testimony. Appellant goes on and argues:<br><br><blockquote>Granting arguendo that the accused-appellant was a drug pusher <b>peddling </b>along Bambang St., how come <u>only one (1) sachet containing 0.146 grams of shabu</u> was confiscated from her by the five (5) police officers who arrested her? If the accused-appellant was indeed caught in a legitimate entrapment operation, then the policemen had every right and all the opportunity to search her person, even including the premises. <u>The fact, however, is that the policemen could only present a single 0.146-gram sachet of shabu, the <b>source of which was not even clearly established</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Further, appellant questions the chain of custody of the <i>shabu</i> as not properly established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Court finds for appellant.<br><br>The following testimony of prosecution witness PO2 Garcia, upon which the prosecution mainly anchored its case and which both the trial and appellate courts accorded credence, sheds light on appellant's claim that the chain of custody of the 0.146 grams of <i>shabu </i>allegedly seized from her was not properly established.<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR YAP:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Upon receipt of the shabu, what did you do with that?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">WITNESS:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I introduced myself as (sic) police officer.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Now, tell us you said shabu, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how did you know that that it is shabu?</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">After </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">submitting it to the Crime Lab. for examination, sir</span>.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">At that time when you received the same, describe to us the physical appearance of what was given to you?
