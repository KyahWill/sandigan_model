				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Referred for appropriate action by the Office of the Ombudsman to this Court's Office of the Court Administrator is the verified May 13, 2005 Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> with enclosures of 3-D Industries, Inc. (3-D), and Smartnet Philippines, Inc. (Smartnet) represented by Gilbert Guy (Gilbert), against Court of Appeals (CA or appellate court) Associate Justices Juan Q. Enriquez, Jr. and Vicente Q. Roxas, <u>for violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <u>(R.A. 3019, as amended)</u> relative to the admission, by the Eighth Division of the CA, of which said Justices were members, of a Supplemental Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Second Supplemental Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in <u>CA-G.R. SP No. 87014</u>, "<i>Northern Islands Co., Inc., et al. v. Hon. Artemio S. Tipon, et al.</i>"<br><br>Culled from <i>Guy v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> decided by this Court on December 10, 2007, are the following antecedent facts:<br><br>Herein complainant Smartnet's representative Gilbert is the son of the spouses Francisco and Simny Guy.&nbsp; The spouses organized Northern Islands Co., Inc. (NICI) which is engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of various home appliances bearing the "3-D" trademark.&nbsp; The spouses also organized Lincoln Continental Development Corporation, Inc. (Lincoln Continental) as a holding company of 50% of the 20,160 shares of stock of NICI in trust for their three daughters Geraldine, Gladys and Grace-sisters of Gilbert.<br><br>Finding that their son Gilbert had been dissipating the assets of Lincoln Continental, the spouses Guy caused the registration of 50% of the 20,160 shares of stock of NICI in the names of their three daughters, thus enabling the latter to assume an active role in the management of NICI.<br><br>On March 18, 2004, Lincoln Continental filed a complaint at the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila against NICI and Gilbert's parents-the spouses Guy and three sisters (hereafter the Guy family), <u>for annulment of the transfer of the 50% NICI shares</u> of stock to Gilbert's sisters.&nbsp; The complaint, docketed] as Civil Case No. 04-109444, prayed for, among other things, the restoration of the management of NICI to Gilbert, and the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to prohibit Gilbert's sisters from exercising any right of ownership over the questioned shares.<br><br>Lincoln Continental later filed a Motion to Inhibit the Presiding Judge of Branch 24 of RTC Manila to which its complaint was raffled on the ground of partiality. The Motion was granted and the case was re-raffled to Branch 46 of the same court.<br><br>NICI and the Guy family challenged the inhibition of the Presiding Judge of Branch 24 via <i>Certiorari </i>and <i>Mandamus </i>before the CA in which they prayed for, among other things, the issuance of an order restraining the Presiding Judge of Branch 46 from further hearing Civil Case No. 04-109444.<br><br>In the meantime, Branch 46, acting on the prayer of Lincoln Continental, <u>issued on June 15, 2004 a TRO</u> restoring the management of NICI to Gilbert.&nbsp; Branch 46 subsequently <u>issued on October 13, 2004 writ of preliminary mandatory injunction</u> as prayed for by Lincoln Continental.<br><br>On account of the issuance by the Manila RTC Branch 46 of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction in favor of Lincoln Continental, the CA-Tenth Division, by Resolution of October 20, 2004, denied NICI's and the Guy family's petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and<i> Mandamus</i>.<br><br>NICI and the Guy family thereafter filed a <u>new</u> petition for <i>Certiorari </i>with<i> </i>application for TRO/preliminary injunction, <u>docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 87104</b></u><b></b>, praying for the nullification of the above-mentioned RTC Manila Branch 46's TRO dated June 15, 2004 and Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction dated October 13, 2004 and the restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i>.&nbsp; This new petition was raffled to the appellate court's Eighth Division.<br><br>Acting on NICI and the Guy family's <u>new</u> petition, the CA-Eighth Division issued on October 28, 2004 a TRO enjoining the implementation of the October 13, 2004 Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction issued by the Manila RTC Branch 46.<br><br>On November 2, 2004, NICI and the Guy family filed with the CA-Eighth Division an Urgent Omnibus Motion praying for the issuance of a Break-Open Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to implement the appellate court's October 28, 2004 TRO.&nbsp; The motion was granted by Resolution of November 4, 2004 pursuant to which the Guy family entered the NICI premises at No. 3 Mercury Avenue, Libis, Quezon City.<br><br>Herein Smartnet, one of the occupants of the NICI premises, filed on December 16, 2004 with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City a <b>complaint for forcible entry</b> against NICI and the Guy family, docketed as Civil Case No. 35-33937.<br><br>In the meantime, the CA-Eighth Division directed the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction prayed for by NICI and the Guy family in their <u>new</u> petition, <u>CA-G.R. SP No. 87104</u>, and a writ was accordingly issued on December 22, 2004.<br><br>Gilbert later filed a <b>complaint for replevin</b> <i><u>on behalf of 3-D</u></i>, docketed as Civil Case No. 70220, before the RTC of Pasig City.&nbsp; The complaint was given due course by Branch 71 of the RTC Pasig which issued on January 18, 2005 a writ of replevin in favor of 3-D, prompting the NICI and the Guy family to file on January 20, 2005 before the CA-Eighth Division a <i><u>Supplemental Petition</u></i> for Certiorari with Urgent Motion for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction to Include Supervening Events. The Supplemental Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <u>impleaded as additional respondents herein complainant 3-D</u>, Judges Celso D. Lavi√±a, Presiding Judge, RTC, Branch 71, Pasig City and Sheriff Cresencio Rabello, Jr., <u>alleging that Gilbert, in an attempt to circumvent the TROs and injunctive writ issued by the CA-Eighth Division, allowed himself to be used by 3-D by filing, on its behalf, a complaint for replevin.</u><br><br>By <b>Resolution of January 24, 2005</b>, the appellate court's Eighth Division issued the questioned Resolution <u>admitting</u> the <i>Supplemental Petition for Certiorari</i>.<br><br>Still later, NICI and the Guy family filed on April 15, 2005, before the CA-Eighth Division a <u><i>Second</i> <i>Supplemental Petition for</i> <i>Certiorari</i> and <i>Prohibition</i></u> with Urgent Motion for the Issuance of an <u>Expanded</u> Writ of Preliminary Injunction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <u>impleading as additional respondent herein complainant Smartnet</u>, among others.<br><br>In the <i>Second Supplemental Petition</i>, NICI and the Guy family raised, in the main, the allegedly continuing forum shopping of Gilbert by continuing to use Smartnet, <i>inter alia, </i>as alter ego and dummy to institute various cases in court to gain control of the properties of NICI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>By <b>Resolution of April 26, 2005</b>, the members of the appellate court's Eighth Division, which had segued to the Seventh Division including respondents, <u>admitted</u> the <i>Second Supplemental Petition for</i> <i>Certiorari </i>and <u>restrained the additionally impleaded respondents including Smartnet from disturbing the December 22, 2004 writ of preliminary injunction</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> issued by the Eighth Division of which respondents were members.<br><br>In the present administrative complaint, complainants allege that in issuing the assailed <b>Resolutions dated January 24, 2005</b> and <b>April 26, 2005</b>, respondents caused undue injury to them by, among other things, giving the petitioners (NICI and the Guy Family) in the new petition for <i>Certiorari</i> unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in the discharge of their judicial functions in violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Complainants likewise allege that respondents, in issuing the questioned Resolutions, had "maneuvered" the assignment to the Eighth Division of the "supplemental" petitions of NICI and the Guy family, which were, however, completely <i>different </i>from the new petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, for the purpose of assuring that those "supplemental" petitions would not be raffled or assigned to other possibly unsympathetic divisions of the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, complainants allege that the conclusory ruling in the questioned Resolutions was a "lame pretext" since the properties involved therein are not in <i>custodia legis,</i> and there was no factual basis that 3-D is a mere alter ego or dummy of Gilbert.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finally, complainants allege that the Divisions in which respondents were sitting had mutated into a "judicial vending machine," regularly dispensing TROs and injunctions at an "impressive maximum" of five days from the filing of the pleadings by the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>By Resolution of July 28, 2009, the Court required respondent Justice Enriquez to comment on the complaint and to show cause why he should not be suspended, disbarred or otherwise disciplinary sanctioned;&nbsp; and to refer the complaint against Justice Vicente Q. Roxas, who was already out of the service, to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>Respondent Justice Enriquez filed his Comment dated September 16, 2009, emphasizing that the questioned Resolution of April 26, 2007 was upheld by this Court in its Decision in G.R. No. 165849, <i>Guy v. Courts of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> hence, complainants' allegation of manifest partiality, evident bad faith, gross negligence, and derogation of established procedure is totally devoid of factual and legal basis.&nbsp; He informs that he was neither the <i>ponente</i> of this assailed Resolution nor the Senior Member of the now Seventh Division of the appellate court.<br><br>In compliance with this Court's Resolution of October 6, 2009, complainants filed a Reply dated December 4, 2009, laying emphasis on the fact that this Court's decision in <i>Guy v. Courts of Appeals</i> was completely silent on the issue of whether the CA-Eighth Division could expand the coverage of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction of December 22, 2004 restraining Manila RTC Branch 46 from implementing the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction which restored the management of NICI to Gilbert.<br><br>Complainants add that the appellate court's Eighth Division acted with undue haste in precipitately admitting the two Supplemental Petitions for <i>Certiorari </i>on the basis of the bare and unsubstantiated allegation that Gilbert was using herein complainants as his alter egos to wrest control and possession of the assets and properties of NICI.<br><br>Meanwhile, the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline endorsed back to the Office of the Bar Confidant on September 23, 2009 the complaint respecting Justice Roxas, in compliance with the September 5, 2006 Resolution of this Court in Bar Matter 1645.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The present complaint in so far as it involves complainant 3-D raises issues not passed upon by this Court in <i>Guy v. Courts of Appeals.</i>&nbsp; It bears noting that the complaint was indorsed by the Office of the Ombudsman to this Court specifically for a determination of whether respondents acted within their duties, pursuant to <i>Fuentes v. Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which ruled:<br><br><blockquote>. . . [I]t is the Supreme Court that is tasked to oversee the Judges and Court personnel and take the proper administrative action against them if they commit any violation of the laws of the land.<br></blockquote><br>The present complaint thus stemmed from the participation of respondents in the <u>issuance of the two assailed Resolutions dated January 24, 2005 and April 26, 2005, which admitted the Supplemental and Second Supplemental Petitions, respectively</u>, of NICI and the Guy family impleading herein complainants, among others, as additional respondents in CA-G.R. SP No. 87104, <u>thereby including them in the coverage of the injunctive writ issued therein</u> on December 22, 2004 enjoining the implementation of the Manila RTC Branch 46 Order which restored the management of NICI to Gilbert.&nbsp; Recall that complainants charge that by their questioned Resolutions, respondents violated Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 for allegedly giving unwarranted benefits to NICI and the Guy family.<br><br>There are two ways by which Section 3(e), R.A. No. 3019 may be violated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>viz</i>: 1) by giving undue injury to any party, including the Government, 2)&nbsp; <i>by causing any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; These acts must be committed with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross and inexcusable negligence.<br><br>Manifest partiality has been defined as "a clear, notorious or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side rather than the other."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Bad faith connotes not only bad judgment or negligence, but also a dishonest purpose, a conscious wrongdoing, or a breach of duty amounting to fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Gross negligence is the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to consequences as far as other persons are concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>That the assailed Resolutions issued by respondents favored NICI and the Guy family does not necessarily render respondents guilty of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, absent proven particular acts of manifest, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence, good faith and regularity being generally presumed in the performance of official duties by public officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>That is why administrative complaints against judges must always be examined with a discriminating eye for its consequential effects are, by their nature, highly penal, such that they stand to face the sanction of dismissal and/or disbarment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In order for this administrative offense to prosper, the subject order or actuation of the judge in the performance of his official duties must not only be contrary to existing law and jurisprudence but, more importantly, must be attended by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Since the impleading of additional parties, on motion of any party or <i>motu proprio</i> at any stage of the action and/or such times as are just is allowed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court finds that respondents' participation in the admission of the supplemental petitions impleading herein complainants as respondents in CA-G.R.SP No. 87104 does not render them administratively liable.<br><br>While respondents may have based the assailed Resolutions on mere allegations, thus disregarding what has been established in jurisprudence that "mere allegation that a corporation is the alter ego of the individual stockholders is insufficient,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this does not render them administratively liable because not every error or mistake that a judge commits in the performance of his duties renders him liable, unless he is shown to have acted in bad faith or with deliberate intent to do an injustice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which is not the case here.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the administrative complaint is <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b></b>WE CONCUR:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Leonardo-De Castro,&nbsp; Peralta,&nbsp; Bersamin, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Mendoza</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Sereno, JJ.</span>, concur,<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, J.</span>, on official leave.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, J.,</span> no part, acted on the matter as Court Administrator.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Section 3.
