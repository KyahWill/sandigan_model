				<H3>MANILA LUMBER, INCORPORATED, COMPLAINANT, VS. PABLO ORO, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J,:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The Manila Lumber, Incorporated, through
the manager thereof, W. A. Smith, filed charges of malpractice against
Attorney Pablo Oro for having collected from it allegedly exorbitant
fees amounting to P2,251.89, his services having consisted merely in
collecting from a judgment debtor 90 per cent of the sum of P5,004.20
or P4,503.78.
<div align="justify"><p> It appears from the facts stated in the pleadings of both the
complainant and the respondent that the former, as collection agent,
delivered to the latter for collection a bill held by Walter A. Smith
against Walter A. Smith &amp; Co., Inc., against which judgment had
been rendered in civil case No. 9885 of the Court of First Instance of
Iloilo entitled Pacific Commercial Co. vs. Walter A. Smith &amp; Co.,
Inc.</p>
<p> Thanks to the efforts exerted by the respondent, who filed a third
party claim, in said case in the name of the complainant which had been
promised a commission of 90 per cent if it succeeded in collecting the
sum in question, when the judgment rendered therein was being executed,
the provincial sheriff succeeded in collecting said sum of P5,004.20
which he later turned over to the respondent, alter deducting the
incidental expenses of execution and the fees which said officer was
entitled to collect under the law. The exact amount turned over by the
provincial sheriff to the respondent was P4,503.78. Once said sum was
in his possession, the respondent, desiring to have the amount of the
fees, which he was entitled to receive for his professional services as
attorney rendered to the complainant, determined, applied for that
purpose to the Court of First Instance which issued the writ of
execution, by filing a motion in the same case where said proceedings
took place, praying that the fees in question be fixed at 45 per cent
of said sum of P5,004.20, or one-half of P4,503.78. The complainant
then appeared in said case to oppose the respondent's motion and
maintained, as it again maintains now, that 45 per cent of P5,004.20,
or one-half of P4,503.78, which the respondent attempted to collect as
fees, was very excessive. The lower court, after hearing the parties
and passing upon the reasons alleged by both, decided the incident in
favor of the respondent by means of its order of January 20, 1937, the
dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Therefore, after considering the reasons stated by
both parties in their respective pleadings, and taking into account the
fact that it was due to the efforts exerted by the petitioner as
attorney that the Manila Lumber, Incorporated, succeeded in collecting
the sum of P5,004.20 representing its 90 per cent commission as
collection agent, the court is of the opinion and so holds that said
petitioner Mr. Oro is entitled to 45 per cent of the sum of P5,004.20,
which is one-half of the commission collected by the oppositor Manila
Lumber, Incorporated."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The complainant not only did not appeal from the order in question
but did not even except thereto. On the contrary, it accepted the other
45 per cent of the amount received by the respondent from the hands of
the provincial sheriff who served the writ of execution, by virtue of
the third party claim filed by the respondent.</p>
<p> The lower court undoubtedly had jurisdiction and authority to pass
upon the question then raised by the complainant in said civil case No.
9885 and likewise had jurisdiction and authority to decide whether or
not the respondent's act constituted malpractice. Inasmuch as the
complainant failed to appeal from the order of the lower court, the
incident must necessarily be considered as having been finally decided,
and it cannot again be raised in any other form in this or in any other
court. The collection made by the respondent was in good faith and
furthermore it merited the approval of the court. This being so, it
cannot constitute a ground for a proceeding for malpractice.</p>
<p> On the other hand, a collection made under the circumstances of the
present case can hardly be considered excessive. The complainant was
merely a collection agent. It received the bill, the collection of
which was entrusted by it to the respondent, in order to earn a
commission of 90 per cent if it succeeded in collecting the same, and
nothing if it failed to do so. It contributed nothing but the task (if
it may be called a task), of entrusting the case to the respondent. It
was the respondent who, making use of his knowledge of the law, did all
the work until it was finished, thereby benefiting the complainant
which, instead of earning nothing,—the bill belonging to another and
the condition being that it would earn the commission agreed upon
provided it succeeded in collecting something which, of course, could
be one hundred pesos, more or less—at least collects, and in fact has
already collected and received from the respondent before the
institution of this proceeding, the sum of P2,224.59. If the
complainant, in spite of the respondent's efforts, had succeeded in
collecting only one hundred pesos, the respondent would have had to be
contented with only forty-five pesos. If it had not succeeded in
collecting anything, it would have lost nothing; on the contrary, the
respondent would have lost time and energy, and he would have worked in
vain. A collection made under said circumstances is not excessive. For
all the foregoing, this court decides to reject and hereby rejects the
charges against the respondent, ordering the dismissal of this case. So
ordered.</p>
<p> Avaneema, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Laurel, and Conception, JJ., concur.</p></div>
