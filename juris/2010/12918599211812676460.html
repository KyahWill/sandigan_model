Robles, Jr. and Elizabeth R. Robles entered into a mortgage contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> with DBP in order to secure a loan from the said bank in the amount of P500,000.00.&nbsp; The properties mortgaged were a parcel of land situated in Tabunoc, Talisay, Cebu, which was then covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T- 47783 of the Register of Deeds of Cebu, together with all the existing improvements, and the commercial building to be constructed thereon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (subject properties).&nbsp; Upon completion, the commercial building was named the State Theatre Building.<br><br>On October 28, 1981, Rudy Robles executed a contract of lease in favor of petitioner Cebu Bionic Builders Supply, Inc.

Petitioners claimed that, at about 10:00 a.m. on December 3, 1990, they duly submitted to Atty. Apolinar Panal, Jr., Chief of the Acquired Assets of DBP, the following documents, namely:<br><br><blockquote>6.1 <b>Letter-offer form, offering to purchase the property advertised, for the price of P1,840,000,</b> which was higher than the starting price of P1,838,100.00 on <b>cash basis</b>. x x x;<br><br>6.2 Negotiated Sale Rules and Procedures, duly signed by plaintiff, x x x;<br><br>6.3 Manager's check for the amount of P184,000 representing 10% of the deposit dated December 3, 1990 and issued by Allied Banking Corp. in favor of the Development Bank of the Philippines. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Petitioners asserted that the above documents were initially accepted but later returned. DBP allegedly advised petitioners that "there was no urgent need for the same x x x, considering that the property will necessarily be sold to [Cebu Bionic] for the reasons that there was no other interested party and that [Cebu Bionic] was a preferred party being the lessee and present occupant of the property subject of the lease[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners then related that, without their knowledge, DBP sold the subject properties to respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila.&nbsp; The sale was claimed to be simulated and fictitious, as DBP still received rentals from petitioners until March 1991.&nbsp; By acquiring the subject properties, petitioners contended that DBP was deemed to have assumed the contract of lease executed between them and Rudy Robles.&nbsp; As such, DBP was bound by the provision of the lease contract, which stated that:<br><br><blockquote>9.&nbsp; Should the Lessor decide to sell the property during the term of this lease contract or immediately after the expiration of the lease, the Lessee shall have the first option to buy and shall match offers from outside parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners sought the rescission of the contract of sale between DBP and respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila.&nbsp; Petitioners also prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, restraining respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila from registering the Deed of Sale in the latter's favor and from undertaking the ejectment of petitioners from the subject properties.&nbsp; Likewise, petitioners entreated that DBP be ordered to execute a deed of sale covering the subject properties in their name and to pay damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>In its answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> DBP denied the existence of a contract of lease between itself and petitioners.&nbsp; DBP countered that the letter-offer of petitioners was actually not accepted as their offer to purchase was on a term basis, which therefore required a 20% deposit.&nbsp; The 10% deposit accompanying the petitioners' letter-offer was declared insufficient. DBP stated that the letter-offer form was not completely filled out as the "Term" and "Mode of Payment" fields were left blank.&nbsp; DBP then informed petitioner Lydia Sia of the inadequacy of her offer.&nbsp; After ascertaining that there was no other offeror as of that time, Lydia Sia allegedly summoned back her representative who did not leave a copy of the letter-offer and the attached documents. DBP maintained that petitioners' documents did not show that the same were received and approved by any approving authority of the bank.&nbsp; The letter-offer attached to the complaint, which indicated that the mode of payment was on a cash basis, was allegedly not the document shown to DBP.&nbsp; In addition, DBP argued that there was no assumption of the lease contract between Rudy Robles and petitioners since it acquired the subject properties through the involuntary mode of extrajudicial foreclosure and its request to petitioners to sign a new lease contract was simply ignored. DBP, therefore, insisted that petitioners' occupancy of the unit in the State Theatre Building was merely upon its acquiescence.&nbsp; The petitioners' payment of rentals on March 22, 1991 was supposedly made in bad faith as they were made to a mere teller who had no knowledge of the sale of the subject properties to respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila.&nbsp; DBP, thus, prayed for the dismissal of the complaint and, by way of counterclaim, asked that petitioners be ordered to pay damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>Respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila no longer filed a separate answer, adopting instead the answer of DBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated July 31, 1991, the RTC granted the prayer of petitioners for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On April 25, 1997, the RTC rendered judgment in Civil Case No. CEB-10104, finding meritorious the complaint of the petitioners.&nbsp; Explained the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>It is a fact on record that [petitioners] complied with the requirements of deposit and advance rental as conditions for constitution of lease between the parties.&nbsp; [Petitioners] in complying with the requirements, issued a time deposit in the amount of P11,395.64 and remitted faithfully its monthly rentals until April, 1991, which monthly rental was no longer accepted by the DBP. <b>Although there was no formal written contract executed between [respondent] DBP and the [petitioners], it is very clear that DBP opted to continue the old and previous contract including the terms thereon by accepting the requirements contained in paragraph 2 of its letter dated June 18, 1987</b>.&nbsp; It is also a fact on record that under the lease contract continued by the DBP on the [petitioners], it is provided in paragraph 9 thereof that the lessee shall have the first option to buy and shall match offers from outside parties. <b>And yet, [respondent] DBP never gave [petitioners] the first option to buy or to match offers from outside parties, more specifically [respondents] To Chip, Balila and Yap.</b>&nbsp; It is also a fact on record that [respondent] DBP in its letter dated June 18, 1987 to [petitioners] wrote in paragraph 3 thereof, "that in case there is better offer or if a property will be subject of purchase offer, within the term, the lessee is given the option of first refusal, otherwise, he has to vacate the premises within thirty (30) days".&nbsp; <b>Yet, [respondent] DBP never informed [petitioners] that there was an interested party to buy the property, meaning, [respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila], thus depriving [petitioners] of the opportunity of first refusal promised to them in its letter dated June 18, 1987</b>. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphases ours.)</blockquote><br>As regards the offer of petitioners to purchase the subject properties from DBP, the RTC gave more credence to the petitioners' version of the facts, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>It is also a fact on record that when [respondent] DBP offered the property for negotiated sale under the 15-day acceptance period[, which] ended at noon of December 3, 1991, [Cebu Bionic] submitted its offer, complete with [the required documents.] x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>These requirements, however, were unceremoniously returned by [respondent] bank with the assurance that since there was no other bidder of the said property, there was no urgency for the same and that [Cebu Bionic] also, in all events, is entitled to first option being the present lessee.<br><br>The declaration of Atty. Panal to the effect that Cebu Bionic wanted to buy the property on installment terms, such that the deposit of P184,000.00 was insufficient being only 10% of the offer, could not be given much credence as it is refuted by Exh. "H" which is the negotiated offer to purchase form under the 15-day acceptance period accomplished by [petitioners] which shows clearly the written word "Cash" after the printed words "Term" and "Mode of Payment", Exhibit "J", the Manager's check issued by Allied Banking Corporation dated December 3, 1990 in the amount of P184,000.00 representing 10% of the offer showing the mode of payment is for cash; Exhibit "K" which is the application for Manager's check in the amount of P184,000.00 dated December 3, 1990 showing the beneficiary as DBP.&nbsp; <b>If it is true that the offer of [petitioners] was for installment payments, then in the ordinary course of human behavior, it would not have wasted effort in securing a Manager's check in the amount of P184,000.00 which was insufficient for 20% deposit as required for installment payments.&nbsp; More credible is the explanation [given by] witness Judy Garces when she said that DBP through Atty.

Relevantly, the well-entrenched principle is that a lease from month-to-month is with a definite period and expires at the end of each month upon the demand to vacate by the lessor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; As held by the Court of Appeals in the assailed Amended Decision, the above-mentioned lease contract was duly terminated by DBP by virtue of its letter dated June 18, 1987.&nbsp; We reiterate that the letter explicitly directed the petitioners to come to the office of the DBP if they wished to enter into a new lease agreement with the said bank.&nbsp; Otherwise, if no contract of lease was executed within 30 days from the date of the letter, petitioners were to be considered uninterested in entering into a new contract and were thereby ordered to vacate the property.&nbsp; As no new contract was in fact executed between petitioners and DBP within the 30-day period, the directive to vacate, thus, took effect.&nbsp; DBP's letter dated June 18, 1987, therefore, constituted the written notice that was required to terminate the lease agreement between petitioners and Rudy Robles. From then on, the petitioners' continued possession of the subject property could be deemed to be without the consent of DBP.<br><br>Thusly, petitioners' assertion that Article 1670 of the Civil Code is not applicable to the instant case is correct.&nbsp; The reason, however, is not that the existing contract was continued by DBP, but because the lease was terminated by DBP, which termination was accompanied by a demand to petitioners to vacate the premises of the subject property.<br><br>Article 1670 states that "[i]f at the end of the contract the lessee should continue enjoying the thing leased for fifteen days with the acquiescence of the lessor, and unless a notice to the contrary by either party has previously been given, it is understood that there is an implied new lease, not for the period of the original contract, but for the time established in Articles 1682 and 1687.&nbsp; The other terms of the original contract shall be revived."&nbsp; In view of the order to vacate embodied in the letter of DBP dated June 18, 1987 in the event that no new lease contract is entered into, the petitioners' continued possession of the subject properties was without the acquiescence of DBP, thereby negating the constitution of an implied lease.<br><br>Contrary to the ruling of the RTC, DBP's acceptance of petitioners' rental payments of P5,000.00 for the period of November 1990 to March 1991 did not likewise give rise to an implied lease between petitioners and DBP. In <i>Tagbilaran Integrated Settlers Association (TISA) Incorporated v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> we held that "the subsequent acceptance by the lessor of rental payments does not, absent any circumstance that may dictate a contrary conclusion, legitimize the unlawful character of their possession." In the present case, the petitioners' rental payments to DBP were made in lump sum on March 22, 1991. Significantly, said payments were remitted only after petitioners were notified of the sale of the subject properties to respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila and after the petitioners were given a final demand to vacate the properties.&nbsp; These facts substantially weaken, if not controvert, the finding of the RTC and the argument of petitioners that the latter were faithfully remitting their rental payments to DBP until the year 1991.<br><br>Thus, having determined that the petitioners and DBP neither executed a new lease agreement, nor entered into an implied lease contract, it follows that petitioners' claim of entitlement to a right of first refusal has no leg to stand on.&nbsp; Furthermore, even if we were to grant, for the sake of argument, that an implied lease was constituted between petitioners and the DBP, the right of first refusal that was contained in the prior lease contract with Rudy Robles was not renewed therewith.&nbsp; This is in accordance with the ruling in <i>Dizon v. Magsaysay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> which involved the issue of whether a provision regarding a preferential right to purchase is revived in an implied lease under Article 1670, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>"[T]he other terms of the original contract" which are revived in the implied new lease under Article 1670 are only those terms which are germane to the lessee's right of continued enjoyment of the property leased. This is a reasonable construction of the provision, which is based on the presumption that when the lessor allows the lessee to continue enjoying possession of the property for fifteen days after the expiration of the contract he is willing that such enjoyment shall be for the entire period corresponding to the rent which is customarily paid - in this case up to the end of the month because the rent was paid monthly.&nbsp; Necessarily, if the presumed will of the parties refers to the enjoyment of possession the presumption covers the other terms of the contract related to such possession, such as the amount of rental, the date when it must be paid, the care of the property, the responsibility for repairs, etc.&nbsp; But no such presumption may be indulged in with respect to special agreements which by nature are foreign to the right of occupancy or enjoyment inherent in a contract of lease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br>DBP cannot, therefore, be accused of violating the rights of petitioners when it offered the subject properties for sale, and eventually sold the same to respondents To Chip, Yap and Balila, without first notifying petitioners.&nbsp; Neither were the said respondents bound by any right of first refusal in favor of petitioners.&nbsp; Consequently, the sale of the subject properties to respondents was valid. Petitioners' claim for rescission was properly dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Resolution dated February 5, 2002 and the Amended Decision dated July 5, 2002 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
