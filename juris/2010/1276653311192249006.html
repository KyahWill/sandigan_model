Moreover, the prosecution alleged that even assuming that the Information was deficient, it merely needed a formal amendment.<br><br>Petitioners opposed the prosecution's motion for reconsideration, contending, <i>inter alia</i>, that since venue is jurisdictional in criminal cases, any defect in an information for libel pertaining to jurisdiction is not a mere matter of form that may be cured by amendment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>By Order of March 8, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the public respondent granted the prosecution's motion for reconsideration and accordingly ordered the public prosecutor to "amend the Information to cure the defect of want of venue."<br><br>The prosecution thereupon moved to admit the Amended Information dated March 20, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 25<sup>th</sup> day of August 2005 in Makati City, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the trustees of Parents Enabling Parents Coalition and as such trustees they hold the legal title to the website <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.pepcoalition.com</span> which is of general circulation, and publication to the public conspiring, confederating together with John Does, <b style="text-decoration: underline;">whose true names, identities and present whereabouts are still unknown</b> and <b style="text-decoration: underline;">all of them</b> mutually helping <b style="text-decoration: underline;">and aiding</b> one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and publicly and maliciously with intention of attacking the honesty, virtue, honor and integrity, character and reputation of complainant Malayan Insurance Co.

NOT FINDING THAT THE ACTS ALLEGED IN THE INFORMATION ARE NOT PUNISHABLE BY LAW;<br><br></li><li>... ADMITTING AN AMENDED INFORMATION WHOSE JURISDICTIONAL ALLEGATIONS CONTINUES TO BE DEFICIENT; and<br><br></li><li>...NOT RULING THAT AN AMENDMENT IN THE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF CURING JURISDICTIONAL DEFECTS IS ILLEGAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>With the filing of Gimenez's Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to the petition, the issues are:  (1) whether petitioners violated the rule on hierarchy of courts to thus render the petition dismissible; and (2) whether grave abuse of discretion attended the public respondent's admission of the Amended Information.<br><br>The established policy of strict observance of the judicial hierarchy of courts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as a rule, requires that recourse must first be made to the lower-ranked court exercising concurrent jurisdiction with a higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> A regard for judicial hierarchy clearly indicates that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level courts should be filed in the RTC and those against the latter should be filed in the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The rule is not iron-clad, however, as it admits of certain exceptions.<br><br>Thus, a strict application of the rule is unnecessary when cases brought before the appellate courts do not involve factual but purely legal questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the substantive issue calls for the Court's exercise of its discretionary authority, by way of exception, in order to abbreviate the review process as petitioners raise a pure question of law involving jurisdiction in criminal complaints for libel under Article 360 of the RPC -whether the Amended Information is sufficient to sustain a charge for written defamation in light of the requirements under Article 360 of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 4363, reading:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 360. <i>Persons responsible</i>.— Any person who shall publish, exhibit or cause the publication or exhibition of any defamation in writing or by similar means, shall be responsible for the same.<br><br>The author or editor of a book or pamphlet, or the editor or business manager of a daily newspaper, magazine or serial publication, shall be responsible for the defamations contained therein to the same extent as if he were the author thereof.<br><br>The criminal action and civil action for damages in cases of written defamations, as provided for in this chapter shall be filed simultaneously or separately with the Court of First Instance of the <b>province or city where the libelous article is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">printed and first published</span></b> or where any of the offended parties actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense: <i>Provided, however,</i> That where one of the offended parties is a public officer whose office is in the City of Manila at the time of the commission of the offense, the action shall be filed in the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila or of the city or province where the libelous article is printed and first published, and in case such public officer does not hold office in the City of Manila, the action shall be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where he held office at the time of the commission of the offense or where the libelous article is printed and first published and in case one of the offended parties is a private individual, the action shall be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where he actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense or where the libelous matter is printed and first published x x x. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Venue is jurisdictional in criminal actions such that the place where the crime was committed determines not only the venue of the action but constitutes an essential element of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This principle acquires even greater import in libel cases, given that Article 360, as amended, specifically provides for the possible venues for the institution of the criminal and civil aspects of such cases.<br><br>In <i>Macasaet</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court reiterated its earlier pronouncements in <i>Agbayani v. Sayo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><i> </i>which laid out the rules on venue in libel cases, <i>viz</i>:<br><br>For the guidance, therefore, of both the bench and the bar, this Court finds it appropriate to reiterate our earlier pronouncement in the case of Agbayani, to wit:<br><br>In order to obviate controversies as to the venue of the criminal action for written defamation, the complaint or information should contain allegations as to whether, at the time the offense was committed, the offended party was a public officer or a private individual and <b>where he was actually residing at that time.</b> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whenever possible, the place where the written defamation was printed and first published should likewise be alleged. That allegation would be a </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">sine qua non</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> if the circumstance as to where the libel was printed and first published is used as the basis of the venue of the action</span>.</b> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>It becomes clear that the venue of libel cases where the complainant is a private individual is limited to only either of two places, namely: 1) where the complainant actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense; or 2) where the alleged defamatory article was printed and first published. The Amended Information in the present case opted to lay the venue by availing of the second.  Thus, it stated that the offending article "was first published and accessed by the private complainant in Makati City." In other words, it considered the phrase to be equivalent to the requisite allegation of printing and first publication.<br><br>The insufficiency of the allegations in the Amended Information to vest jurisdiction in Makati becomes pronounced upon an examination of the rationale for the amendment to Article 360 by RA No. 4363.  <i>Chavez v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> explained the nature of these changes:<br><br><blockquote><i>Agbayani </i>supplies a comprehensive restatement of the rules of
venue in actions for criminal libel, following the amendment by Rep.
Act No. 4363 of the Revised Penal Code:<br><br>"Article 360 in its original form provided that the venue of the criminal and civil actions for written defamations is the province wherein the libel was published, displayed or exhibited, regardless of the place where the same was written, printed or composed. Article 360 originally did not specify the public officers and the courts that may conduct the preliminary investigation of complaints for libel.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before article 360 was amended, the rule was that a criminal action for libel may be instituted in any jurisdiction where the libelous article was published or circulated, irrespective of where it was written or printed (</span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">People v. Borja,</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 43 Phil. 618). Under that rule, the criminal action is transitory and the injured party has a choice of venue.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Experience had shown that under that old rule the offended party could harass the accused in a libel case by laying the venue of the criminal action in a remote or distant place.</b><br><br>Thus, in connection with an article published in the Daily Mirror and the Philippine Free Press, Pio Pedrosa, Manuel V. Villareal and Joaquin Roces were charged with libel in the justice of the peace court of San Fabian, Pangasinan (<i>Amansec v. De Guzman</i>, 93 Phil. 933).<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">To forestall such harassment, Republic Act No. 4363 was enacted. It lays down specific rules as to the venue of the criminal action so as to prevent the offended party in written defamation cases from inconveniencing the accused by means of out-of-town libel suits, meaning complaints filed in remote municipal courts</b> (Explanatory Note for the bill which became Republic Act No. 4363, Congressional Record of May 20, 1965, pp. 424-5; <i>Time, Inc. v. Reyes</i>, L-28882, May 31, 1971, 39 SCRA 303, 311).<br><br>x x x x  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Clearly, the evil sought to be prevented by the amendment to Article 360 was the indiscriminate or arbitrary laying of the venue in libel cases in distant, isolated or far-flung areas, meant to accomplish nothing more than harass or intimidate an accused. The disparity or unevenness of the situation becomes even more acute where the offended party is a person of sufficient means or possesses influence, and is motivated by spite or the need for revenge.<br><br>If the circumstances as to where the libel was printed and first published are used by the offended party as basis for the venue in the criminal action, the Information must allege with particularity where the defamatory article was printed and first published, as evidenced or supported by, for instance, the address of their editorial or business offices in the case of newspapers, magazines or serial publications. This pre-condition becomes necessary in order to forestall any inclination to harass.<br><br>The same measure cannot be reasonably expected when it pertains to defamatory material appearing on a website on the internet as there would be no way of determining the <i>situs</i> of its printing and first publication. To credit Gimenez's premise of equating his first <i>access</i> to the defamatory article on petitioners' website in Makati with "printing and first publication" would spawn the very ills that the amendment to Article 360 of the RPC sought to discourage and prevent. It hardly requires much imagination to see the chaos that would ensue in situations where the website's author or writer, a blogger or anyone who posts messages therein could be sued for libel anywhere in the Philippines that the private complainant may have allegedly accessed the offending website.<br><br>For the Court to hold that the Amended Information sufficiently vested jurisdiction in the courts of Makati simply because the defamatory article was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accessed</span> therein would open the floodgates to the libel suit being filed in all other locations where the <i>pepcoalition</i> website is likewise accessed or capable of being accessed.<br><br>Respecting the contention that the venue requirements imposed by Article 360, as amended, are unduly oppressive, the Court's pronouncements in <i>Chavez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> are instructive:<br><br><blockquote>For us to grant the present petition, it would be necessary to abandon the <i>Agbayani</i> rule providing that a private person must file the complaint for libel either in the place of printing and first publication, or at the complainant's place of residence. We would also have to abandon the subsequent cases that reiterate this rule in <i>Agbayani</i>, such as <i>Soriano</i>, <i>Agustin</i>, and <i>Macasaet</i>. There is no convincing reason to resort to such a radical action. <b style="text-decoration: underline;">These limitations imposed on libel actions filed by private persons are hardly onerous, especially as they still allow such persons to file the civil or criminal complaint in their respective places of residence, in which situation there is no need to embark on a quest to determine with precision where the libelous matter was printed and first published. </b><br><br>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>IN FINE, the public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioners' motion to quash the Amended Information.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The assailed Order of April 22, 2008 and the Joint Resolution of August 12, 2008 are hereby SET ASIDE.
