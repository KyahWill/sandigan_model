Albao and Pablis brought Gurango to the guardhouse. Officer-in-charge Rommel M. Cordero (Cordero) locked the guardhouse, then ordered Albao and Pablis to continue hitting Gurango.&nbsp; Freddie Infuerto arrived at the guardhouse and asked the security guards to stop hitting Gurango.&nbsp; Gurango agreed to surrender the camera on the condition that the security guards would prepare a document acknowledging receipt of the camera.<br><br>Albao, on the other hand, alleged that he was on duty at the main entrance of the production area from 7 p.m. of 4 May 2003 to 7 a.m. of 5 May 2003.&nbsp; At 4:20 a.m., Gurango tried to enter the production area bringing a camera.&nbsp; Albao told Gurango that he could not bring the camera inside the production area.&nbsp; Gurango got mad and tried to grab Albao’s gun.&nbsp; Albao and Gurango engaged in a fistfight.&nbsp; Cordero, Pablis, and another security guard, Fredrick Lañada, arrived and stopped the fight.<br><br>On 5 May 2003, at 8:35 a.m., Gurango went to Dr. Homer L.

belongings (e.g., a camera), other than those required in the 
performance of one’s duty which disrupt/obstruct Company services and 
operations, except those authorized by higher authorities.&nbsp; (Table II, 
Serious, No. 10 of Code of Discipline); <br><br></li><li>Utter disregard for or refusal to submit to reasonable 
inspection connected within [sic] the Company premises by authorized 
Company security personnel in the conduct of their business. (Table IV, 
Minor,&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 1 of Code of Discipline); <br><br></li><li>Starting or provoking a fight, i.e., involvement in a fist fight

Discipline); and<br><br></li><li>Intentionally causing personal injury to another person (i.e., 
the security guard) within the Company premises. (Table I, Grave, No. 12

I am convinced Albao lied in his statement.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the present case, no solid cause exists to dismiss complainant from employment as to warrant a dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>BCPI and Hong appealed to the NLRC.<br><br><center><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The NLRC’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>In its 17 October 2005 Resolution, the NLRC affirmed in toto the Labor Arbiter’s 6 July 2004 Decision.&nbsp; The NLRC held that:<br><br><blockquote>Although fighting within company premises constitute serious misconduct, this however, does not apply in this case. Complainant did not start nor provoke the fight.&nbsp; It was precipitated, instead, by guard Albao when he tried to get the complainant’s camera for no valid reason.&nbsp; The statement of Albao that complainant tried to snatch his service firearm is not only unbelievable but is also exaggerated.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter is correct and we concur in his finding that the complainant was not foolish enough to try to snatch the gun of Albao.&nbsp; The camera is undisputably owned by complainant.&nbsp; Bringing it inside his workplace is not a crime.&nbsp; So why would he try to snatch a gun for a very trivial misunderstanding.&nbsp; What is clear is that the security guards over acted in the performance of their duty.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x&nbsp; The prohibition against the bringing of personal belongings in to the work station/area is qualified by a condition that such belongings will disrupt/obstruct company’s services and operations.&nbsp; That is why in the enumerations the following are included, radios, walkman, discman, make-up kits, ladies’ bag workers’ knapsacks and the like.&nbsp; An unloaded camera is not listed and we cannot imagine how such camera could “disrupt or obstruct company services and operations.<br><br>Moreover, even if we assume that the complainant indeed violated this Inter-Office Memorandum, still, this will not justify complainant’s dismissal because the penalty provided therein is only six (6) days suspension from work without pay, not dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>BCPI and Hong filed a motion for reconsideration, which the NLRC denied.&nbsp; BCPI and Hong filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court of Appeals’ Ruling</b>&nbsp; </u></center><br><br>In its 20 July 2006 Decision, the Court of Appeals set aside the 17 October 2005 and 24 January 2006 Resolutions of the NLRC.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that “private respondent engaged himself in a fistfight with the security guard”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and that engaging in a fistfight constituted serious misconduct.<br><br>Gurango filed a motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied in its 11 September 2006 Resolution.&nbsp; Hence, the present petition.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issue</b></u><br></center><br>Gurango raises as issue that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that he was legally dismissed.&nbsp; BCPI failed to prove that he engaged in a fistfight and that there was just cause for his dismissal.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>As a general rule, only questions of law may be raised in petitions for certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Section 1 of Rule 45 states that, “The petition shall raise only questions of law.” In <i>Triumph International (Phils.), Inc. v. Apostol</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court enumerated exceptions to the rule.&nbsp; Among the exceptions are when the findings of fact are conflicting and when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals conflict with the findings of fact of the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; Also, the finding of the Court of Appeals that Gurango engaged in a fistfight is a conclusion without citation of specific evidence on which it is based.<br><br>In termination cases, the employer has the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, that the dismissal is for just cause.&nbsp; If the employer fails to discharge the burden of proof, the dismissal is deemed illegal.&nbsp; In <i>AMA Computer College — East Rizal v. Ignacio</i>,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</span></sup> the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>In termination cases, the burden of proof rests on the employer to show that the dismissal is for just cause.&nbsp; When there is no showing of a clear, valid and legal cause for the termination of employment, the law considers the matter a case of illegal dismissal and the burden is on the employer to prove that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause.&nbsp; And the quantum of proof which the employer must discharge is substantial evidence. An employee’s dismissal due to serious misconduct must be supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds, equally reasonable, might conceivably opine otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>In the present case, aside from Albao’s statement, BCPI did not present any evidence to show that Gurango engaged in a fistfight. Moreover, there is no showing that Gurango’s actions were performed with wrongful intent.&nbsp; In <i>AMA Computer College – East Rizal</i>, the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>The Labor Code provides that an employer may terminate the services of an employee for a just cause.&nbsp; Among the just causes in the Labor Code is serious misconduct.&nbsp; Misconduct is improper or wrong conduct.&nbsp; It is the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment.&nbsp; The misconduct to be serious within the meaning of the Labor Code must be of such a grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial or unimportant. x x x<br><br>In <i>National Labor Relations Commission v. Salgarino</i>, the Court stressed that “[<b>i</b>]<b>n order to constitute serious misconduct which will warrant the dismissal of an employee under paragraph (a) of Article 282 of the Labor Code, it is not sufficient that the act or conduct complained of has violated some established rules or policies.&nbsp; It is equally important and required that the act or conduct must have been performed with wrongful intent</b>.”<br><br>After a thorough examination of the records of the case, however, the Court finds that petitioner AMACCI miserably failed to prove by substantial evidence its charges against respondent.&nbsp; There is no showing at all that respondent’s actions were motivated by a perverse and wrongful intent, as required by Article 282(a) of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The surrounding circumstances show that Gurango did not engage in a fistfight: (1) in his 9 May 2003 letter to BCPI, Juanitas corroborated Gurango’s version of the facts; (2) nobody corroborated Albao’s version of the facts; (3) in his medical report, Dr. Aguinaldo found that Gurango suffered physical injuries; (4) Gurango filed with the MCTC a complaint against Albao, Cordero and Pablis for slight physical injury; (5) the Labor Arbiter found Gurango’s statement credible and unblemished; (6) the Labor Arbiter found Albao’s statement contradictory; (7) the Labor Arbiter stated, “I am convinced Albao lied in his statement”; (8) the NLRC found that Gurango did not start a fight; (9) the NLRC found Albao’s statement unbelievable and exaggerated; and (10) the Court of Appeals’ reversal of the findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC is baseless.<br><br>In <i>Triumph International (Phils.), Inc.</i>, the Court held that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are accorded not only respect but finality when supported by susbstantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT </b>the petition.&nbsp; We <b>SET ASIDE</b> the&nbsp; 20 July 2006 Decision and 11 September 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
