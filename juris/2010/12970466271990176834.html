				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, assails the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; dated August 26, 2005 and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; dated June 13, 2006 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 74581.&nbsp; The CA reversed the February 5, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 38, which declared the marriage of petitioner Noel B. Baccay (Noel) and Maribel Calderon-Baccay (Maribel) void on the ground of psychological incapacity under Article 36<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; of the <u>Family Code of the Philippines</u>.<br><br>The undisputed factual antecedents of the case are as follows:<br><br>Noel and Maribel were schoolmates at the Mapua Institute of Technology where both took up Electronics and Communications Engineering. Sometime in 1990, they were introduced by a mutual friend and became close to one another. Noel courted Maribel, but it was only after years of continuous pursuit that Maribel accepted Noel's proposal and the two became sweethearts. Noel considered Maribel as the snobbish and hard-to-get type, which traits he found attractive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>Noel's family was aware of their relationship for he used to bring Maribel to their house. Noel observed that Maribel was inordinately shy when around his family so to bring her closer to them, he always invited Maribel to attend family gatherings and other festive occasions like birthdays, Christmas, and fiesta celebrations. Maribel, however, would try to avoid Noel's invitations and whenever she attended those occasions with Noel's family, he observed that Maribel was invariably aloof or snobbish. Not once did she try to get close to any of his family members. Noel would talk to Maribel about her attitude towards his family and she would promise to change, but she never did.<br><br>Around 1997, Noel decided to break up with Maribel because he was already involved with another woman.&nbsp; He tried to break up with Maribel, but Maribel refused and offered to accept Noel's relationship with the other woman so long as they would not sever their ties. To give Maribel some time to get over their relationship, they still continued to see each other albeit on a friendly basis.<br><br>Despite their efforts to keep their meetings strictly friendly, however, Noel and Maribel had several romantic moments together. Noel took these episodes of sexual contact casually since Maribel never demanded anything from him except his company. Then, sometime in November 1998, Maribel informed Noel that she was pregnant with his child. Upon advice of his mother, Noel grudgingly agreed to marry Maribel. Noel and Maribel were immediately wed on November 23, 1998 before Judge Gregorio Dayrit, the Presiding Judge of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City.<br><br>After the marriage ceremony, Noel and Maribel agreed to live with Noel's family in their house at Rosal, Pag-asa, Quezon City. During all the time she lived with Noel's family, Maribel remained aloof and did not go out of her way to endear herself to them. She would just come and go from the house as she pleased. Maribel never contributed to the family's coffer leaving Noel to shoulder all expenses for their support. Also, she refused to have any sexual contact with Noel.<br><br>Surprisingly, despite Maribel's claim of being pregnant, Noel never observed any symptoms of pregnancy in her. He asked Maribel's office mates whether she manifested any signs of pregnancy and they confirmed that she showed no such signs. Then, sometime in January 1999, Maribel did not go home for a day, and when she came home she announced to Noel and his family that she had a miscarriage and was confined at the Chinese General Hospital where her sister worked as a nurse.<br><br>Noel confronted her about her alleged miscarriage sometime in February 1999. The discussion escalated into an intense quarrel which woke up the whole household. Noel's mother tried to intervene but Maribel shouted "<i>Putang ina nyo, wag kayo makialam</i>" at her. Because of this, Noel's mother asked them to leave her house. Around 2:30 a.m., Maribel called her parents and asked them to pick her up. Maribel left Noel's house and did not come back anymore. Noel tried to communicate with Maribel but when he went to see her at her house nobody wanted to talk to him and she rejected his phone calls.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <br><br>On September 11, 2000 or after less than two years of marriage, Noel filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; for declaration of nullity of marriage with the RTC of Manila. Despite summons, Maribel did not participate in the proceedings. The trial proceeded after the public prosecutor manifested that no collusion existed between the parties. Despite a directive from the RTC, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) also did not submit a certification manifesting its agreement or opposition to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br>On February 5, 2002, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of Noel. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the marriage of the parties hereto celebrated on November 23, 1998 at the sala of Judge Gregorio Dayrit of the Metropolitan Trial Court in Quezon City as NULL and VOID.<br><br>The Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City and the Chief of the National Statistics Office are hereby directed to record and enter this decree into the marriage records of the parties in their respective marriage registers.<br><br>The absolute community property of the parties is hereby dissolved and, henceforth, they shall be governed by the property regime of complete separation of property.<br><br>With costs against respondent.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </blockquote><br>The RTC found that Maribel failed to perform the essential marital obligations of marriage, and such failure was due to a personality disorder called Narcissistic Personality Disorder characterized by juridical antecedence, gravity and incurability as determined by a clinical psychologist. The RTC cited the findings of Nedy L. Tayag, a clinical psychologist presented as witness by Noel, that Maribel was a very insecure person. She entered into the marriage not because of emotional desire for marriage but to prove something, and her attitude was exploitative particularly in terms of financial rewards. She was emotionally immature, and viewed marriage as a piece of paper and that she can easily get rid of her husband without any provocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br>On appeal by the OSG, the CA reversed the decision of the RTC, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila Branch 38 declaring as null and void the marriage between petitioner-appellee and respondent is hereby REVERSED. Accordingly, the instant Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage is hereby DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </blockquote><br>The appellate court held that Noel failed to establish that Maribel's supposed Narcissistic Personality Disorder was the psychological incapacity contemplated by law and that it was permanent and incurable. Maribel's attitudes were merely mild peculiarities in character or signs of ill-will and refusal or neglect to perform marital obligations which did not amount to psychological incapacity, said the appellate court.&nbsp; The CA noted that Maribel may have failed or refused to perform her marital obligations but such did not indicate incapacity. The CA stressed that the law requires nothing short of mental illness sufficient to render a person incapable of knowing the essential marital obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br>The CA further held that Maribel's refusal to have sexual intercourse with Noel did not constitute a ground to find her psychologically incapacitated under Article 36 of the Family Code. As Noel admitted, he had numerous sexual relations with Maribel before their marriage. Maribel therefore cannot be said to be incapacitated to perform this particular obligation and that such incapacity existed at the time of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>Incidentally, the CA held that the OSG erred in saying that what Noel should have filed was an action to annul the marriage under Article 45 (3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; of the <u>Family Code</u>. According to the CA, Article 45 (3) involving consent to marriage vitiated by fraud is limited to the instances enumerated under Article 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; of the <u>Family Code</u>. Maribel's misrepresentation that she was pregnant to induce Noel to marry her was not the fraud contemplated under Article 45 (3) as it was not among the instances enumerated under Article 46.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <br><br>On June 13, 2006, the CA denied Noel's motion for reconsideration. It held that Maribel's personality disorder is not the psychological incapacity contemplated by law. Her refusal to perform the essential marital obligations may be attributed merely to her stubborn refusal to do so. Also, the manifestations of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder had no connection with Maribel's failure to perform her marital obligations. Noel having failed to prove Maribel's alleged psychological incapacity, any doubts should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <br><br>Hence, the present petition raising the following assignment of errors:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN HOLDING THAT THE CASE OF CHI MING TSOI vs. COURT OF APPEALS DOES NOT FIND APPLICATION IN THE INSTANT CASE.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN HOLDING THAT THE RESPONDENT IS NOT SUFFERING FROM NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER; AND THAT HER FAILURE TO PERFORM HER ESSENTIAL MARITAL OBLIGATIONS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote><br>The issue to be resolved is whether the marriage between the parties is null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code.<br><br>Petitioner Noel contends that the CA failed to consider Maribel's refusal to procreate as psychological incapacity. Insofar as he was concerned, the last time he had sexual intercourse with Maribel was before the marriage when she was drunk. They never had any sexual intimacy during their marriage. Noel claims that if a spouse senselessly and constantly refuses to perform his or her marital obligations, Catholic marriage tribunals attribute the causes to psychological incapacity rather than to stubborn refusal. He insists that the CA should not have considered the pre-marital sexual encounters between him and Maribel in finding that the latter was not psychologically incapacitated to procreate through marital sexual cooperation.&nbsp; He argues that making love for procreation and consummation of the marriage for the start of family life is different from "plain, simple and casual sex."&nbsp; He further stresses that Maribel railroaded him into marrying her by seducing him and later claiming that she was pregnant with his child. But after their marriage, Maribel refused to consummate their marriage as she would not be sexually intimate with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br>Noel further claims that there were other indicia of Maribel's psychological incapacity and that she consistently exhibited several traits typical of a person suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder before and during their marriage. He points out that Maribel would only mingle with a few individuals and never with Noel's family even if they lived under one (1) roof. Maribel was also arrogant and haughty. She was rude and disrespectful to his mother and was also "interpersonally exploitative" as shown by her misrepresentation of pregnancy to force Noel to marry her. After marriage, Maribel never showed respect and love to Noel and his family. She displayed indifference to his emotional and sexual needs, but before the marriage she would display unfounded jealousy when Noel was visited by his friends. This same jealousy motivated her to deceive him into marrying her.<br><br>Lastly, he points out that Maribel's psychological incapacity was proven to be permanent and incurable with the root cause existing before the marriage. The psychologist testified that persons suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder were unmotivated to participate in therapy session and would reject any form of psychological help rendering their condition long lasting if not incurable. Such persons would not admit that their behavioral manifestations connote pathology or abnormality. The psychologist added that Maribel's psychological incapacity was deeply rooted within her adaptive system since early childhood and manifested during adult life. Maribel was closely attached to her parents and mingled with only a few close individuals.&nbsp; Her close attachment to her parents and their over-protection of her turned her into a self-centered, self-absorbed individual who was insensitive to the needs of others.&nbsp; She developed the tendency not to accept rejection or failure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <br><br>On the other hand, the OSG maintains that Maribel's refusal to have sexual intercourse with Noel did not constitute psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the <u>Family Code</u> as her traits were merely mild peculiarities in her character or signs of ill-will and refusal or neglect to perform her marital obligations. The psychologist even admitted that Maribel was capable of entering into marriage except that it would be difficult for her to sustain one.&nbsp; Also, it was established that Noel and Maribel had sexual relations prior to their marriage. The OSG further pointed out that the psychologist was vague as to how Maribel's refusal to have sexual intercourse with Noel constituted Narcissistic Personality Disorder.<br><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Article 36 of the <u>Family Code</u> provides:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.</blockquote><br>The Court held in <i>Santos v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; that the phrase "psychological incapacity" is not meant to comprehend all possible cases of psychoses. It refers to no less than a mental (not physical) incapacity that causes a party to be truly noncognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage which, as expressed by Article 68<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; of the <u>Family Code</u>, include their mutual obligations to live together, observe love, respect and fidelity and render help and support. The intendment of the law has been to confine it to the most serious of cases of personality disorders clearly demonstrative of an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage.<br><br>In <i>Republic of the Phils. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; the Court laid down the guidelines in resolving petitions for declaration of nullity of marriage, based on Article 36 of the <u>Family Code</u>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>(1) <b>The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity</b>. This is rooted in the fact that both our Constitution and our laws cherish the validity of marriage and unity of the family. Thus, our Constitution devotes an entire Article on the Family, recognizing it "as the foundation of the nation." It decrees marriage as legally "inviolable," thereby protecting it from dissolution at the whim of the parties. Both the family and marriage are to be "protected" by the state.<br><br>The Family Code echoes this constitutional edict on marriage and the family and emphasizes their <i>permanence</i>, <i>inviolability</i> and <i>solidarity</i>.<br><br>(2) The <i>root cause</i> of the psychological incapacity must be (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) <b>alleged in the complaint</b>, (c) sufficiently proven by experts and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological - not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties, or one of them, was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that <b>the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof.</b> Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.<br><br>(3) The incapacity must be <b>proven to be existing at "the time of the celebration" of the marriage</b>. The evidence must show that the illness was existing when the parties exchanged their "I do's." The manifestation of the illness need not be perceivable at such time, but the illness itself must have attached at such moment, or prior thereto.<br><br>(4) Such <b>incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or <i>incurable</i></b>. Such incurability may be absolute or even relative only in regard to the other spouse, not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same sex. Furthermore, <b>such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption of marriage obligations, not necessarily to those not related to marriage, like the exercise of a profession or employment in a job</b>. Hence, a pediatrician may be effective in diagnosing illnesses of children and prescribing medicine to cure them but may not be psychologically capacitated to procreate, bear and raise his/her own children as an essential obligation of marriage.<br><br>(5) Such illness must be <b><i>grave</i></b> enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Thus, "mild characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts" cannot be accepted as <i>root</i> causes. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, there is a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.<br><br>(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.<br><br>(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(8)&nbsp; The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal and the Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the state.&nbsp; No decision shall be handed down unless the Solicitor General issues a certification, which will be quoted in the decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement or opposition, as the case may be, to the petition.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, along with the prosecuting attorney, shall submit to the court such certification within fifteen (15) days from the date the case is deemed submitted for resolution of the court.&nbsp; The Solicitor General shall discharge the equivalent function of the <i>defensor vinculi </i>contemplated under Canon 1095. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>In this case, the totality of evidence presented by Noel was not sufficient to sustain a finding that Maribel was psychologically incapacitated. Noel's evidence merely established that Maribel refused to have sexual intercourse with him after their marriage, and that she left him after their quarrel when he confronted her about her alleged miscarriage.&nbsp; He failed to prove the root cause of the alleged psychological incapacity and establish the requirements of gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability. As correctly observed by the CA, the report of the psychologist, who concluded that Maribel was suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder traceable to her experiences during childhood, did not establish how the personality disorder incapacitated Maribel from validly assuming the essential obligations of the marriage.&nbsp; Indeed, the same psychologist even testified that Maribel was capable of entering into a marriage except that it would be difficult for her to sustain one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Mere difficulty, it must be stressed, is not the incapacity contemplated by law.<br><br>The Court emphasizes that the burden falls upon petitioner, not just to prove that private respondent suffers from a psychological disorder, but also that such psychological disorder renders her "truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Psychological incapacity must be more than just a "difficulty," a "refusal," or a "neglect" in the performance of some marital obligations. An unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage. As we stated in <i>Marcos v. Marcos</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <br><br><blockquote>Article 36 of the Family Code, we stress, is not to be confused with a divorce law that cuts the marital bond at the time the causes therefor manifest themselves. It refers to a serious psychological illness afflicting a party even before the celebration of the marriage. It is a malady so grave and so permanent as to deprive one of awareness of the duties and responsibilities of the matrimonial bond one is about to assume. x x x.</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

While admitting that he and Maribel had several sexual encounters before their marriage, Noel narrated that after getting married, Maribel senselessly and constantly refused to have any sexual relations with him. He asserted that Maribel's unreasonable refusal amounted to a psychological incapacity to comply with the essential marital obligations.<br><br>Noel further pointed to several traits of Maribel that negatively affected their marital relationship. Maribel was described as arrogant, haughty, rude, and disrespectful; she mingled only with a few individuals and failed to endear herself to Noel's family, even if they lived with them under the same roof. She was also "interpersonally exploitative," as shown by her misrepresentation of pregnancy to force Noel to marry her. All of these, Noel contended, are manifestations of a Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), which clinical psychologist Nedy Tayag diagnosed Maribel to be suffering from. Accordingly, Noel petitioned the Court to review the Court of Appeals' decision that reversed and set aside the Regional Trial Court's decision granting his petition for declaration of nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Article 36 refers to the Incapacity to <br>Fulfill Essential Marital Obligations<br> due to a Psychological Condition</span><br><br>Article 36 of the Family Code states that -<br><br><blockquote>A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.<br></blockquote><br>Dissecting the terms of the provision, we list down its elements:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>a celebration of marriage; </li><li>non-performance of marital obligations;</li><li><b>3. the marital obligations which are not performed are essential obligations; <br></b></li><li><b>non-performance is due to causes psychological in nature and it is chronic: constant and habitual;</b> </li><li>the cause/s are present during the celebration of marriage although they may not be manifest or evident at that point; and </li><li>the cause/s surface after the celebration of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the psychological incapacity relate to the essential obligations of marriage, <i>i.e.</i>, "it is the non-performance of this class of obligations which will lead to a declaration of nullity of marriage due to psychological incapacity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Corollarily, "the non-compliance with these non-essential marital obligations has no effect on the validity of the marriage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The essential marital obligations under the Family Code are found in Articles 68 to 71,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 220, 221, and 225.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Notably, these <i>essential</i> marital obligations refer primarily to obligations of spouses towards each other and towards their children.&nbsp; While a harmonious relationship with the in-laws is ideal, particularly in this country's cultural set-up, it appears that the law does not consider it an essential obligation of either spouse to maintain one. The "incapacity should make the party disabled from rendering what is due in the marriage, within the context of justice, not merely in the sphere of good will."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Maribel's failure to socialize, interact, and endear herself to Noel's family, as far as our family laws are concerned, is, thus, not considered a non-fulfillment of an essential marital obligation. If at all, Maribel has failed to meet her husband Noel's expectations of how she should conduct herself with and relate to his family, a matter not dealt with by Article 36.<br><br>The consummation of the marriage, on the other hand, is an essential marital obligation. Marriage is entered into for the establishment of conjugal and family life;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> its consummation is not only an expression of the couple's love for each other,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> but is also a means for procreation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> That the Court nullified a marriage due to the husband's obstinate and unjustified refusal to have intimate sexual relations with his wife indicates that the consummation of the marriage is considered an essential marital obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The failure to consummate the marriage by itself, however, does not constitute as a ground to nullify the marriage. The spouse's refusal to have intimate sexual relations must be due to causes psychological in nature, <i>i.e.</i>, the psychological condition of the spouse renders him/her incapable of having intimate sexual relations with the other. This crucial nexus between the non-fulfilled essential marital obligation and the psychological condition was what Noel failed to allege and prove; Maribel's refusal to satisfy Noel's sexual needs during their marriage was never proven to have been due to some psychological condition. The evidence did not rule out the possibility that the refusal could be caused by other factors not related to Maribel's psychological make-up; the refusal could very well be attributed to Maribel's pregnancy and her subsequent miscarriage (assuming these were true). That Maribel's refusal to have intimate sexual relations with Noel had more to do with the stresses brought on by married life than her actual psychological condition is validated by Noel's statement that prior to marriage, they have had several sexual encounters. The connection between the psychologist's finding that Maribel was supposedly suffering from NPD and her refusal to have intimate sexual relations was similarly not established.<br><br>Even supposing that a spouse's refusal to have intimate sexual relations with the other spouse may be reasonably inferred from or connected with the traditional signs and symptoms associated with NPD,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> I have difficulty finding credible the psychologist's diagnosis of Maribel's psychological condition.<br><br>The narration of facts declared that Maribel never participated in the proceedings below, and indicated that the psychologist's evaluation of Maribel was based mainly on Noel's testimony. As the petitioning spouse, Noel's description of Maribel's nature would certainly be biased, and a psychological evaluation based on this one-sided description can hardly be considered as credible. In <i>Suazo v. Suazo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; the Court declared that -<br><br><blockquote>Based on her declarations in open court, the psychologist [Nedy Tayag, who incidentally is the same psychologist in the present case] evaluated [the husband's] psychological condition only in an indirect manner - she derived all her conclusions from information coming from [the wife] whose bias for her cause cannot of course be doubted. <i>Given the source of the information upon which the psychologist heavily relied upon, the court must evaluate the evidentiary worth of the opinion with due care and with the application of the more rigid and stringent set of standards</i> outlined above, <i>i.e.</i>, that there must be a thorough and in-depth assessment of the parties by the psychologist or expert, for a conclusive diagnosis of a psychological incapacity that is grave, severe and incurable.<br></blockquote><br>The Court's statement above should not be read as making mandatory the personal examination by the psychologist or expert of the spouse alleged to be psychologically incapacitated. We have already stated in <i>Marcos v. Marcos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that there is no requirement that the defendant/respondent spouse should be personally examined by a physician or psychologist to establish the former's psychological incapacity. Subsequently after the <i>Marcos</i> case, the Court promulgated the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, which stated that "[t]he complete facts should allege the physical manifestations, if any, as are indicative of psychological incapacity at the time of the celebration of the marriage but expert opinion need not be alleged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>To balance, however, the need for an objective evaluation of the psychological condition of the spouses alleged to be psychologically incapacitated and the non-necessity of an expert's opinion, we refer again to the Court's ruling in <i>Suazo</i>, which declared that -<br><br><blockquote><b>[F]or a determination x x x of a party's complete personality profile, information coming from persons intimately related to [him/her] (such as the party's close relatives and friends) may be helpful.</b> This is an approach in the application of Article 36 that allows flexibility, at the same time that it avoids, if not totally obliterate, the credibility gaps spawned by supposedly expert opinion based entirely on doubtful sources of information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It did not help that Noel's case was based entirely on his testimony and that of the psychologist, whose findings, in turn, were also based on Noel's description of Maribel.&nbsp; Apart from these biased testimonies, there was no other evidence presented by which the Court could objectively evaluate Maribel's psychological condition.<br><br><b><i>Psychological incapacity, by its<br> nature, refers only to the most serious <br>cases and is the root cause of the failure<br> to fulfill the essential marital obligations</i></b><br><br>Noel enumerated other negative traits of Maribel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that he claimed were indicative of a psychological illness, specifically, that of NPD. But not all negative traits exhibited by a person are rooted in some psychological illness or disorder; these may simply be a character flaw or a bad habit that the person has developed over the years.&nbsp; It has been said that "[a] deeply ingrained bad habit does not qualify as a source of x x x incapacity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Slight character flaws also do not make a person incapable of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Assuming that these negative traits were indeed manifestations of NPD or some other psychological illness, jurisprudence has declared that <i>not every psychological illness/disorder/condition is a ground for declaring the marriage a nullity under Article 36.</i> "[T]he meaning of 'psychological incapacity' [is confined] to the <b>most serious cases</b> of personality disorders clearly demonstrative of an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The psychologist testified that persons suffering from NPD were unmotivated to participate in therapy sessions and would reject any form of psychological help, rendering their condition long lasting, if not incurable, perhaps in an attempt to define the gravity and extent of Maribel's NPD. This, however, is but a general description of on persons with personality disorders,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; as the term is clinically defined; NPD is just one of the kinds of personality disorders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The testimony did not specifically refer to Maribel and did not paint a clear picture of the seriousness of her NPD.<br><br>Furthermore, the <i>petitioning spouse must also allege and prove that the psychological illness/disorder/condition is the <b>root cause</b> of the respondent spouse's incapacity or inability to fulfill any, some, or all of the essential obligations of marriage</i>. Noel attempted to establish this link by alleging that Maribel's NPD has made her view marriage simply as a piece of paper and made her believe that she can easily get rid of her husband without any provocation. He claimed that she entered marriage not because of an emotional desire for it, but to prove something.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Rather than establishing Maribel's incapacity to fulfill the essential marital obligations, Noel's contentions seem to indicate that Maribel was utterly unaware of the nature of marriage and its consequent obligations.&nbsp; There is, however, a significant difference between <i>lack of awareness or understanding of marriage and its obligations, and lack of capacity to fulfill these marital obligations</i>. A spouse's lack of awareness or understanding of marriage and its obligation is an irrelevant consideration for a petition filed under Article 36 of the Family Code.<br><br><b><i>Article 36 of the Family Code refers <br>to psychological incapacity <u>to fulfill</u> <br>essential marital obligations, not <br><u>to understand or appreciate</u> what these<br> essential marital obligations are</i></b><br><br>Article 36 of the Family Code was based on Canon 1095 of the New Canon Law of the Catholic Church.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Canon 1095 states that-<br><br><blockquote>[t]he following are incapable of contracting marriage:<br><br><ol><li>Those who lack sufficient use of reason; </li><li>Those who suffer from a grave lack of discretionary judgment concerning the essential matrimonial rights and obligations to be mutually given and accepted; </li><li> <b>Those who, because of causes of a psychological nature, are unable to assume the essential obligations of marriage</b>.</li></ol> </blockquote><br>Specifically, it is the third paragraph of Canon 1095 that provided for the model for what is now Article 36 of the Family Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The third paragraph of Canon 1095 does not refer to a defect in the consent of one of the contracting parties to the marriage; in fact, it recognizes the existence of a valid consent.&nbsp; Rather, the third paragraph of Canon 1095 refers to the incapacity to assume essential marital obligations.&nbsp; Church decisions "held that a person may appear to enjoy full use of his faculties, but because of some psychiatric defect, he/she may be incapable of assuming the obligations of marriage, <i>although he/she may have a conceptual understanding of such obligation.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, <b>a person's ability to give a valid consent can be equated to his/her ability to know and understand the essential marital obligations, but this does not necessarily equate to a similar ability or capacity to actually fulfill them</b>.&nbsp; The spouse "may very well know what are the substantive imperatives of marriage, and [he/she] may also very much want to observe these unconditionally, but at the same time [he/she] simply cannot do so for a given psychical causal factor that gravely lessens or seriously undermines their self-dominion in terms of dysfunctional volitive faculty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This situation was exemplified by Adolfo Dacanay, S.J., in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>The evidence from the empirical sciences is abundant that there are certain anomalies of a sexual nature which may impel a person towards sexual activities which are not normal, either with respect to its frequency [nymphomania, satyriasis] or to the nature of the activity itself [sadism, masochism, homosexuality]. However, t<b>hese anomalies notwithstanding, it is altogether possible that the higher faculties remain intact such that a person so afflicted continues to have an adequate understanding of what marriage is and of the gravity of its responsibilities</b>. In fact, he can choose marriage freely. <i><b>The question though is whether such a person can assume those responsibilities which he cannot fulfill, although he may be able to understand them</b></i>.&nbsp; In this latter hypothesis, the incapacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage issues from the incapacity to posit the object of consent, rather than the incapacity to posit consent itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the same manner that the Chuich has limited the third paragraph of Canon 1095 to refer only to lack of capacity to fulfill essential marital obligations (lack of due capacity), Article 36 of the Family Code should also be interpreted as limited only to this kind of incapacity. The framers of Article 36 of the Family Code intended that "jurisprudence under Canon Law prevailing at the time of the code's enactment x x x cannot be dismissed as impertinent for its value as an aid x x x to the interpretation and construction of the codal provision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the incapacity that Article 36 speaks of is not the incapacity to know and understand marriage and its concomitant obligations (lack of due discretion), but the incapacity to fulfill these obligations for some psychological reason (lack of due capacity). A party may be considered as incapable of assuming the essential obligations of marriage even though he may have sufficient use of reason plus due discretion in judgment. The lack of due discretion, on the other hand, <i>may be</i> indicative of vitiated consent, but this is not the concern of Article 36 of the Family Code. Noel's assertion of Maribel's failure to appreciate marriage and its obligations was, therefore, an irrelevant allegation insofar as his Article 36 petition was concerned.<br><br><i><b>Republic v. CA and Molina did not<br> set forth guidelines beyond those <br>contemplated by the framers of <br>Article 36 of the Family Code</b></i><br><br>Lately, the <i>Molina</i> case has been receiving flaks because, apparently, the guidelines it has established created a straitjacket that unduly limited the application of Article 36 of the Family Code.&nbsp; The case of <i>Ngo-Te v.</i> Te said that "[t]he resiliency with which the concept [of psychological incapacity] should be applied and the case-to-case basis by which the provision should be interpreted, as so intended by its framers, had, somehow, been rendered ineffectual by the imposition of a set of strict standards in Molina."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>Ngo-Te v.</i> Te found it erroneous for courts to apply the rigid set of rules laid down by Molina, without regard to the law's clear intent to treat each Article 36 case separately.&nbsp; As a consequence, "the Court, in conveniently applying Molina, has allowed diagnosed sociopaths, schizophrenics, nymphomaniacs, narcissists and the like, to continuously debase and pervert the sanctity of marriage. Ironically, the Roman Rota has annulled marriages on account of the personality disorders of the said individuals."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>I find <i>Ngo-Te's</i> argument contradictory. It advocates a case-to-case approach in resolving psychological incapacity cases, yet, at the same time, implies that since the Church has already annulled marriages on account of the enumerated personality disorders, the courts should declare the marriage's nullity if these were alleged and proved in the case.<br><br>Surprisingly enough, <i>Ngo-Te</i> backtracked on its criticism of Molina a month later by saying in the case of <i>Ting v. Velez-Ting</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that <i>Ngo-Te</i> did not abandon <i>Molina</i>. Far from abandoning <i>Molina, Ting</i> explains the <i>Ngo-Te</i> simply suggested a relaxation of the stringent requirements set forth in <i>Molina</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>At any rate, whatever conflict and confusion that might have surfaced because of <i>Ngo-Te's</i> attack against <i>Molina</i>, the Court reconciled these in <i>Suazo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> saying that "[<i>Ngo-Te</i>] x x x merely [stood] for a more flexible approach in considering petitions for declaration of nullity of marriages based on psychological incapacity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It noted <i>Ngo-Te</i> for the new evidentiary approach it directed the courts to adopt - to consider as decisive evidence the expert opinion on the psychological and mental temperaments of the parties.<br><br>The guidelines listed in Molina are but expositions of what the Court has determined in <i>Santos v. Bedia-Santos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> as characteristics of the psychological incapacity that render a marriage void under Article 36 of the Family Code; these guidelines merely incorporated the basic requirements of gravity, juridical antecedence and incurability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <i>Molina</i> did not create new rules, but simply identified and consolidated the legislative intent behind Article 36 of the Family Code.&nbsp; A majority of the guidelines listed corresponds to and is consistent with the concept of psychological incapacity that the members of the Family Code Revision Committee had in mind, the interpretation of Canon 1095 from which the provision was modeled after, and the existing laws, both procedural and substantive. The guidelines in <i>Molina</i> were never intended to remove the resiliency and flexibility envisioned by the framers in the application and interpretation of Article 36 of the Family Code. The resiliency and flexibility, however, are not a license to interpret Article 36 of the Family Code as allowing any and every assertion of psychological incapacity to merit a declaration of nullity of marriage. The Court remains bound to interpret the provision in a manner consistent with the Constitution and relevant family laws. For now, Article 36 of the Family Code will remain to be a limited remedy, addressing only a specific situation - a relationship where no marriage could have been validly concluded because the parties, or one of them, by reason of grave and incurable psychological illness existing at the time when the marriage was celebrated, was incapacitated to fulfill the essential marital obligations and, thus, could not have validly entered into a marriage.

Article 36 of the Family Code was taken from paragraph 3 of Canon 1095 of the New Code of Canon Law which took effect on 27 November 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Court at one time explained the essence of "psychological incapacity" under the Family Code by referring to Canon Law discussions comparing marriage in the context of the psychological incapacity of one of the parties to a contract between the parties to sell a house, which, unknown to both, had already burned down.&nbsp; In such a case, "the consent may indeed be free, but is juridically ineffective because the party is consenting to an object that he cannot deliver.&nbsp; The house he is selling was gutted down by fire."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Refining the concept, we held in <i>Santos v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> that psychological incapacity must be characterized by (a) gravity - the incapacity must be grave or serious, such that the party would be incapable of carrying out the ordinary duties required in marriage; (b) juridical antecedence - it must be rooted in the party's history antedating the marriage, although overt manifestations may emerge only after the marriage; and (c) incurability - it must be incurable or, even if it were otherwise, the cure must be beyond the means of the party involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After observing that Article 36 was being abused as a convenient divorce law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Court laid down the procedural requirements for its interpretation and application in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; While a majority concurred in the decision, three justices concurred only "in the result" and another three rendered their individual Separate Opinions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Justice Padilla warned that "each case must be judged, not on the basis of a priori assumptions, predilections or generalizations but according to its own facts." Justice Vitug preferred the earlier simpler legal standard set in <i>Santos v. Court of Appeals.</i><br><br>In <i>Antonio v. Reyes,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court reinstated the trial court's declaration of nullity of the subject marriage based on "the totality of the evidence," with the caveat that "<i>Molina</i> is not set in stone, and that the interpretation of Article 36 relies heavily on a case-to-case perception." We held that granting a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage based on Article 36 is not incompatible with the Constitution's recognition of the sanctity of the family.&nbsp; Rather, it "should be deemed as an implement of this constitutional protection of marriage.&nbsp; Given the avowed State interest in promoting marriage as the foundation of the family, which in turn serves as the foundation of the nation, there is a corresponding interest for the State to defend against marriages ill-equipped to promote family life."<br><br>In Ngo Te v. Yu-Te,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> after tracing the origin and development of jurisprudence relating to Article 36, the Court noted that "(t)he resiliency with which the concept should be applied and the case-to-case basis by which the provision should be interpreted, as so intended by its framers, had, somehow, been rendered ineffectual by the imposition of a set of strict standards in <i>Molina.</i> ... Far from what was intended by the Court, <i>Molina</i> has become a strait-jacket, forcing all sizes to fit into and be bound by it. Wittingly or unwittingly, the Court, in conveniently applying Molina, has allowed diagnosed sociopaths, schizophrenics, nymphomaniacs, narcissists and the like, to continuously debase and pervert the sanctity of marriage. ... The Court need not worry about the possible abuse of the remedy provided by Article 36, for there are ample safeguards against this contingency .... The Court should rather be alarmed by the rising number of cases involving marital abuse, child abuse, domestic violence and incestuous rape."<br><br>In <i>Ting v. Velez-Ting,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court clarified that "(f)ar from abandoning Molina, we simply suggested the relaxation of the stringent requirements set forth therein." Requiring petitioner to allege in the petition the particular root cause of the psychological incapacity and to attach thereto the verified written report of the accredited psychologist or psychiatrist proved to be too expensive and adversely affected poor litigants' access to justice. This was the finding of the Committee on the Revision of the Rules on the rationale of the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC).<br><br>In <i>Azcueta v. Republic of the Philippines and Court of Appeals</i>, we then concluded that "(w)ith the advent of Te v. Te, the Court encourages a reexamination of jurisprudential trends on the interpretation of Article 36, although there has been no major deviation or paradigm shift from the Molina doctrine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In this instance, whether we apply the Molina standard or a more relaxed interpretation and application of Article 36, petitioner was unable to prove his case with preponderant evidence.&nbsp; Since the presumption in favor of the validity of marriage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> was not ably rebutted, this presumption prevails. 1 therefore concur in the Decision denying the Petition, but I reach this conclusion based solely on the insufficiency of the evidence presented by petitioner. However, I disagree with the import this Decision conveys that <i>Molina</i>, in its undiluted form, should be reiterated and emphasized in this case.&nbsp; Had the case gone forward to a choice between the strict application of Molina and the more recent decisions cited, I would have submitted that a second hard look at <i>Molina</i> is warranted.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Proceedings of the Public Hearing on the Family Code, 3 February 1988. p. 7. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Justice Alicia Sempio-Diy, Handbook on the Family Code of the Philippines (1997).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Edward Kenneth Ngo Te vs. Rowena Gutierrez Yu-Te</i>, GR.
