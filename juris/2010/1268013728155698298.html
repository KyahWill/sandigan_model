[F]rom the aforequoted annotation, the OSG's assertion that there was no competent evidence that would clearly show the subject land was released as alienable and disposable land is unavailing. On the contrary, We HOLD that the <u>said annotation would suffice to comply with the requirement of certification as the same is competent enough to show that the disputed land or the parcels of land</u> (now Lot Nos. 249-A, Cad-866 and 249-B Cad-866, respectively) <u>applied for by the applicants (Cayetano and Alaan) were <b>already reclassified as alienable and disposable as early as 18 July 1925</b></u><b>, </b>under Project No. 5, L.C. Map No. 550.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Records show that the subject land was first owned and possessed by Lazaro Rañada and the same was sold to Julian Ydulzura per untitled document executed on 15 May 1917. On 3 September 1923, Ydulzura sold the subject land for one hundred fifty pesos (Php150.00) to Simeon M. Serrano per untitled document, father of Cayetano. Simeon M. Serrano then had the subject land tax declared in his name in 1924 per <i>Declaration of Real Property (Urban) No. 18,587</i>. Upon the demise of Simeon Serrano on 9 January 1931, his heirs, including herein applicant Cayetano, partitioned by way of an <i>Agreement</i> on 16 June 1951 the properties of their deceased father. On 24 August 1988, the heirs of Simeon M. Serrano executed a <i>Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement</i> confirming further the <i>Agreement </i>executed on 16 June 1954 (sic). <b><u>It is worth noting that from 1955 up to the filing of the <i>Application for Registration</i> in 21 June 1988 and until 1997, Cayetano religiously paid the real estate taxes of the said subject property. As held in a long line of cases, <i>tax declarations or realty tax payments of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, nevertheless, they are good indicia of possession in the concept of owner.</i></u></b> Undoubtedly, applicant Cayetano, through his predecessors-in-interest, having been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation over the subject property under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier had met the requirements set forth in Section 14(1) of the <i>Property Registration Decree.</i><br><br>In fine, We FIND and so HOLD that applicant Cayetano L. Serrano and intervenor-appellee heirs of Catalino M. Alaan, have <u>registrable title to the aforesaid subject lands</u>, Lot 249-B, Csd-13-000443-D and Lot 249-A, Csd-1-000443-D, respectively, <u>as they were able to prove that they are qualified and had complied with the requirements</u> set forth by the provisions of <i>P.D. No. 1529</i> which amended <i>Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended</i> and <i>Presidential Decree No. 1073,</i> which to Our mind merited the allowance of the application for registration of the said property by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  (italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Hence, the present petition which raises the same grounds as those raised by petitioner before the appellate court.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>The requisites for the filing of an application for registration of title under Section 14(1) of the <i>Property Registration Decree</i> are:  that the property is alienable and disposable land of the public domain; that the applicants by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation thereof; and that such possession is under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Court reiterates the doctrine which more accurately construes Section 14(1) in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals and Naguit</i>,<i><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></b></i> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>. . . the more reasonable interpretation of Section 14(1) is that <b><u>it merely requires the property sought to be registered as already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration of title is filed.</u></b> If the State, at the time the application is made, has not yet deemed it proper to release the property for alienation or disposition, the presumption is that the government is still reserving the right to utilize the property; hence, the need to preserve its ownership in the State irrespective of the length of adverse possession even if in good faith. However<b>, <u>if the property has already been classified as alienable and disposable, as it is in this case, then there is already an intention on the part of the State to abdicate its exclusive prerogative over the property.</u> </b><br><br>This reading aligns conformably with our holding in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>. Therein, the Court noted that "to prove that the land subject of an application for registration is alienable, an applicant must establish the existence of a positive act of the government such as a presidential proclamation or an executive order; an administrative action; investigation reports of Bureau of Lands investigators; and a legislative act or a statute."  <b><u>In that case, the subject land had been certified by the DENR as alienable and disposable in 1980, thus the Court concluded that the alienable status of the land, compounded by the established fact that therein respondents had occupied the land even before 1927, sufficed to allow the application for registration of the said property. In the case at bar, even the petitioner admits that the subject property was released and certified as within alienable and disposable zone in 1980 by the DENR</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>While Cayetano failed to submit any certification which would formally attest to the alienable and disposable character of the land applied for, the Certification by DENR Regional Technical Director Celso V. Loriega, Jr., as annotated on the subdivision plan submitted in evidence by Paulita, constitutes substantial compliance with the legal requirement. <u>It clearly indicates that Lot 249 had been verified as belonging to the alienable and disposable area as early as <b>July 18, 1925</b></u>.<br><br>The DENR certification enjoys the presumption of regularity absent any evidence to the contrary.  It bears noting that no opposition was filed or registered by the Land Registration Authority or the DENR to contest respondents' applications on the ground that their respective shares of the lot are inalienable.  There being no substantive rights which stand to be prejudiced, the benefit of the Certification may thus be equitably extended in favor of respondents.<br><br>Petitioner's contention that respondents failed to adduce sufficient proof of possession and occupation as required under Section 14(1) of the <i>Property Registration Decree </i>does not lie.<br><br>Undeniably, respondents and/or their predecessors-in-interest must be shown to have exercised acts of dominion over the lot under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier.  On what constitutes open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation as required by statute, <i>Republic v. Alconaba</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  teaches:<br><br><blockquote>The law speaks of possession and occupation. Since these words are separated by the conjunction and, the clear intention of the law is not to make one synonymous with the other. Possession is broader than occupation because it includes constructive possession. When, therefore, the law adds the word occupation, it seeks to delimit the all encompassing effect of constructive possession. <b><u>Taken together with the words open, continuous, exclusive and notorious, the word occupation serves to highlight the fact that for an applicant to qualify, his possession must not be a mere fiction. Actual possession of a land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as a party would naturally exercise over his own property</u></b>. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Leonardo clearly established the character of the possession of Cayetano and his predecessors-in-interest over the lot.  Thus he declared that the lot was first owned by Lazaro Rañada who sold the same to Julian Ydulzura in 1917 who in turn sold it to his and Cayetano's father Simeon in 1923; that Simeon built a house thereon after its acquisition, which fact is buttressed by entries in Tax Declaration No. 18,587 in the name of Simeon for the year 1924 indicating the existence of a 40-sq. meter residential structure made of <i>nipa</i> and mixed materials, and of coconut trees planted thereon; and that after Simeon's demise in 1931, Cayetano built his own house beside the old <i>nipa</i> house before the war, and a <i>bodega</i> after the war, which claims find support in Tax Declarations made in 1948-1958.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>When pressed during the request for written interrogatories if Leonardo had any other pre-war tax declarations aside from Tax Declaration No. 18,587, he explained that all available records may have been destroyed or lost during the last war but that after the war, the lot was reassessed in his father's name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  The Court finds Leonardo's explanation plausible and there is nothing in the records that detracts from its probative value.<br><br>Finally, the official receipts of realty tax payments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> religiously made by Cayetano from 1948 to 1997 further serve as credible indicia that Cayetano, after his father's death in 1931, continued to exercise acts of dominion over the lot.<br><br>The totality of the evidence thus points to the unbroken chain of acts exercised by Cayetano to demonstrate his occupation and possession of the land in the concept of owner, to the exclusion of all others.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J.,&nbsp; (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Also referred to in the records as Cayetano L.
