Also, the termination of respondents in the middle of the school year might result in compromising the education of the students as well as the school operation.&nbsp; Petitioner further argues that it cannot hire respondents for the period covering only June to September as it would contravene the DECS's policy requiring written contracts of at least one year's duration for teachers.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is devoid of merit.<br><br><i>The dismissal of Teresita Palacio, Calibod, Laquio, Santander, and Montederamos was premature and defeated their right to security of tenure.

<i>Inhibition Against the Practice of the Teaching Profession. </i>- Except as otherwise allowed under this Act, no person shall practice or offer to practice the teaching profession in the Philippines or be appointed as teacher to any position without having previously obtained a valid certificate of registration and a valid professional license from the Commission.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 31.&nbsp; <i>Transitory Provision. - </i>All incumbent teachers in both the public and private sector not otherwise certified as professional teachers by virtue of this Act, shall be given five (5) years temporary certificates from the time the Board for Professional Teachers is organized within which to qualify as required by this Act and be included in the roster of professionals.</blockquote><br>Pursuant to RA 7836, the PRC formulated certain rules and regulations relative to the registration of teachers and their continued practice of the teaching profession.&nbsp; Specific periods and deadlines were fixed within which incumbent teachers must register as professional teachers in consonance with the essential purpose of the law in promoting good quality education by ensuring that those who practice the teaching profession are duly licensed and are registered as professional teachers.<br><br>Under DECS Memorandum No. 10, S. 1998, the Board for Professional Teachers (BPT), created under the general supervision and administrative control of the PRC, was organized on September 20, 1995 so that, in the implementation of Sections 26, 27 and 31 of RA 7836, incumbent teachers as of December 16, 1994 have until September 19, 1997 to register as professional teachers.&nbsp; The Memorandum further stated that a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was subsequently entered into by the PRC, Civil Service Commission (CSC) and DECS to further allow those teachers who failed to register by September 19, 1997 to continue their service and register.&nbsp; BPT Resolution No. 600, s. 1997 was thereafter passed to provide the guidelines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to govern teacher registration beyond September 19, 1997.&nbsp; Consequently, the deadline was moved to September 19, 2000.<br><br>Pursuant to the aforestated law, resolution and memorandum, effective September 20, 2000, only holders of valid certificates of registration, valid professional licenses and valid special/temporary permits can engage in teaching in both public and private schools.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, respondents, in the case at bar, had until September 19, 2000 to comply with the mandatory requirement to register as professional teachers.&nbsp; As respondents are categorized as those not qualified to register without examination, the law requires them to register by taking and passing the licensure examination.<br><br>It is undisputed that respondents were all non-board passers when they were dismissed by petitioner on March 31, 2000.&nbsp; Based on the certification issued by the PRC on October 23, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> only respondent Santander passed the LET but only for the elementary level.&nbsp; Thus, she is still unqualified to teach in the high school level.&nbsp; All the others, except respondent Saile who is not qualified to take the LET, failed the examination.&nbsp; Petitioner harps on the fact that even if respondents were to take the LET in August of 2000, the results could not be known in time to meet the September 19, 2000 deadline.&nbsp; However, it is to be noted that the law still allows those who failed the licensure examination between 1996 and 2000 to continue teaching if they obtain temporary or special permits as para-teachers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In other words, as the law has provided a specific timeframe within which respondents could comply, petitioner has no right to deny them of this privilege accorded to them by law.&nbsp; As correctly pointed out by the Labor Arbiter and affirmed by the NLRC and the CA, the dismissal from service of respondents Palacio, Calibod, Laquio, Santander and Montederamos on March 31, 2000 was quite premature.<br><br>Petitioner claims that it terminated respondents' employment as early as March 2000 because it would be highly difficult to hire professional teachers in the middle of the school year as replacements for respondents without compromising the operation of the school and education of the students.&nbsp; Also, petitioner reasons out that it could not enter into written contracts with respondents for the period June 2000 to September 19, 2000 without violating the DECS's policy requiring contracts of yearly duration for elementary and high school teachers.<br><br>Petitioner's contentions are not tenable.&nbsp; First, even if respondents' contracts stipulate for a period of one year in compliance with DECS's directive, such stipulation could not be given effect for being violative of the law.&nbsp; Provisions in a contract must be read in conjunction with statutory and administrative regulations.&nbsp; This finds basis on the principle "that an existing law enters into and forms part of a valid contract without the need for the parties expressly making reference to it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Settled is the rule that stipulations made upon the convenience of the parties are valid only if they are not contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Hence, mere reliance on the policy of DECS requiring yearly contracts for teachers should not prevent petitioner from retaining the services of respondents until and unless the law provides for cause for respondents' dismissal.<br><br>Petitioner's intention and desire not to put the students' education and school operation in jeopardy is neither a decisive consideration for respondents' termination prior to the deadline set by law.&nbsp; Again, by setting a deadline for registration as professional teachers, the law has allowed incumbent teachers to practice their teaching profession until September 19, 2000, despite being unregistered and unlicensed.&nbsp; The prejudice that respondents' retention would cause to the school's operation is only trivial if not speculative as compared to the consequences of respondents' unemployment.&nbsp; Because of petitioner's predicament, it should have adopted measures to protect the interest of its teachers as regular employees.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the CA, petitioner should have earlier drawn a contingency plan in the event there is need to terminate respondents' services in the middle of the school year.&nbsp; Incidentally, petitioner did not dispute that it hired and retained other teachers who do not likewise possess the qualification and eligibility and even allowed them to teach during the school year 2000-2001.&nbsp; This indicates petitioner's ulterior motive in hastily dismissing respondents.<br><br>It is incumbent upon this Court to afford full protection to labor.&nbsp; Thus, while we take cognizance of the employer's right to protect its interest, the same should be exercised in a manner which does not infringe on the workers' right to security of tenure.&nbsp; "Under the policy of social justice, the law bends over backward to accommodate the interests of the working class on the humane justification that those with less privilege in life should have more in law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, this Court will not hesitate to defend respondents' right to security of tenure.&nbsp; The premature dismissal from the service of respondents Palacio, Calibod, Laquio, Santander and Montederamos is unwarranted. However, we take exception to the case of respondent Saile who, as alleged by petitioner, was not qualified to take the LET as she only had three out of the minimum 10 required educational units to be admitted to take the LET pursuant to Section 15 of RA 7836,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which fact respondent Saile did not refute.&nbsp; Not being qualified to take the examination to become a duly licensed professional teacher, petitioner cannot be compelled to retain her services as she cannot possibly obtain the needed prerequisite to allow her to continue practicing the teaching profession. Thus, we find her termination just and legal.<br><br><i>Limited backwages computed from <br>March 31, 2000 to September 30, 2000 <br>awarded in favor of Palacio, Calibod,<br>Laquio, Santander and Montederamos <br>are sustained.&nbsp; </i><br><br>Petitioner questions the amount of separation pay awarded to respondents contending that assuming respondents were illegally dismissed, they are only entitled to an amount computed from the time of dismissal up to September 19, 2000 only. After September 19, 2000, respondents, according to petitioner, are already dismissible for cause for lack of the necessary license to teach.<br><br>This contention deserves no merit. Petitioner cannot possibly presume that respondents could not timely comply with the requirements of the law. At any rate, we note that petitioner only assailed the amount of backwages for the first time in its motion for reconsideration of the Decision of the CA.&nbsp; Thus, the Court cannot entertain the issue for being belatedly raised.&nbsp; Hence, the award of limited backwages covering the period from March 31, 2000 to September 30, 2000 as ruled by the Labor Arbiter and affirmed by both the NLRC and CA is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>partially GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated September 24, 2003 in CA-G.R. SP No. 67691 finding respondents Teresita Palacio, Marigen Calibod, Levie Laquio, Elaine Marie Santander and Ma. Dolores Montederamos to have been illegally dismissed and awarding them separation pay and limited backwages is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.&nbsp; As regards respondent Eliza Saile, we find her termination valid and legal. Consequently, the awards of separation pay and limited backwages in her favor are <b>DELETED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 10-35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 36-47; penned by Associate Justice Hakim S.
