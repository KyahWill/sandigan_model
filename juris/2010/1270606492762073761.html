The Sandiganbayan held that:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant PCGG's Motion for Reconsideration, the PCGG claims that not only 51% but 100% of 25,249 shares of Silangan in [Oceanic] is being claimed by the Government. The same has no basis.  It was the 51% equity of Roberto S. Benedicto in Silangan that was ceded by the latter to the Government.<br><br>The 51% equity of Roberto S. Benedicto is in Silangan and not in [Oceanic].  By virtue thereof, the Government took over from Roberto S. Benedicto and became one of the stockholders of Silangan owning 51% shares of stock.  The government became a stockholder of [Oceanic] only to the extent of the 115 shares of stocks [sic] of Roberto S. Benedicto in [Oceanic].<br><br>Only the stockholders of [Oceanic] are entitled to the cash dividends declared by the said corporation.  Silangan, being one of the stockholders of [Oceanic] is entitled to the cash dividends due to its [sic] equivalent to 40% of the total cash dividends or in the amount of P54,337,852.61.<br><br>Clearly, the Government's claim on the cash dividends declared by [Oceanic] in favor of Silangan is pre-mature. The government will only be entitled to cash dividends received by Silangan from [Oceanic] only if Silangan will declare cash dividends to its stockholders, the Government being just one of its stockholders.<br><br>It was Silangan, as a corporation with separate and distinct personality from its stockholders that engaged the services of M.M. Lazaro and Associates with attorney's fees on a contingent basis of 20%, which was reduced to 15% of whatever amount that maybe recovered or collected by Silangan.<br><br>It was the law firm M.M. Lazaro and Associates which filed Civil Case No. 0127, entitled "Jose L. Africa, et al. vs. PCGG, et al." for Certiorari and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order on August 1, 1991.  It was by reason of this case that the writs of sequestration against [Oceanic], Silangan and other majority stockholders of [Oceanic] were lifted and set aside.  The writs of sequestration having been lifted, [Oceanic] declared cash dividends to its stockholders.  Considering that the Omnibus Motion praying for the payment of attorney's fees of M.M. Lazaro and Associates is with the conformity of Silangan thru [sic] its President Manuel H. Nieto, Jr., the Court may act on it and grants the same in the interest of justice.<br><br>The Motion for Reconsideration dated July 7, 2004 filed by the PCGG, which is intertwined with the instant Omnibus Motion is for the same reasons, denied.<br><br><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>,<br><br>1. The PCGG's Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>2. The Silangan's Omnibus Motion is hereby GRANTED.<br><br>The Land Bank of the Philippines, COA Branch, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City is ordered to release and pay to Silangan Investors and Managers, Inc. the entire cash dividends, including interest earned in the amount of P54,337,852.61, declared by [Oceanic] due to Silangan Investors and Managers, Inc. and deposited in the Escrow accounts of Civil Case No. 0009 entitled, "Republic of the Philippines vs. Jose L.

The Sandiganbayan held that:<br><br><blockquote>The sequestration of the [Oceanic] shares of Polygon Aerocom, Silangan, Belgor, Jose L. Africa and Victor A. Africa were [sic] declared null and void in the decision issued in this case dated April 25, 1994 x x x.<br><br>On September 21, 2001, the Supreme Court affirmed <i>in toto</i> the Sandiganbayan decision dated April 25, 1994 which lifted among others the sequestration against Polygon et al.

Thus, the Sandiganbayan issued a writ of execution dated September 30, 2003 to implement its decision dated April 25, 1994, as affirmed by the Supreme Court.  The writ of execution was implemented and the records and documents and management of [Oceanic] were turned over to the new management of Africa-Nieto group.<br><br>Thus, the release of dividends including the interest earned declared by [Oceanic] and due to Polygon Investors and Managers, Inc. is in order.<br><br>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court grants the Motion and orders the Land Bank of the Philippines, COA Branch, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City to release and pay to Polygon Investors and Managers, Inc. the amount of P25,786,357.59 equivalent to 19.977% of the total dividends declared by [Oceanic] for Class "A" shares, together with accrued interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>PCGG filed a motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> for reconsideration, dated 20 July 2005, raising as issue that "the dividends sought to be released by Polygon are held in <i>custodia</i><i> legis </i>by the Sandiganbayan (Fourth Division) in favor of whoever will eventually be held the rightful owner thereof in the principal case, Civil Case No. 0009."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In its 25 October 2005 Resolution, the Sandiganbayan denied PCGG's 20 July 2005 motion for reconsideration.

The Court stated:<br><br><blockquote>During the pendency of Civil Case No. 0044, Aerocom filed on July 5, 1995 a Manifestation and Motion praying that the Sandiganbayan direct the PCGG to release and distribute the dividends pertaining to the shares of Aerocom in all corporations where it owns shares of stock.  x x x<br><br>The Sandiganbayan in its Resolution promulgated on January 31, 1996 acted favorably on Aerocom's Manifestation and Motion and thus ordered the PCGG to release the dividends pertaining to Aerocom except the dividends on the sequestered shares of stock registered in the names of Manuel Nieto and Jose Africa in POTC, ETPI and Aerocom x x x.<br><br>After a motion for reconsideration thereof was denied by the Sandiganbayan per Resolution promulgated on May 7, 1996, the PCGG filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i> on August 16, 1996 assailing the Sandiganbayan order for the release of the dividends as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion.  x x x<br><br>The petition must fail.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x  A writ of sequestration x x x runs the risk of being struck down as invalid if and when the twin requirements of issuance and service are not satisfied within the deadline.<br><br>Such is the fate of the subject writ of sequestration, unfortunately.  Whether the 18-month period expired on July 26, 1988 (as claimed by Aerocom, in line with the computation of time under Article 13 of the Civil Code and the ruling in "<i>National Marketing Corp. v. Tecson</i>," 29 SCRA 70) or on August 2, 1988 (the PCGG's position), the fact remains that service of the writ on Aerocom on August 3, 1988 was made beyond these dates.  x x x<br><br>x x x  The PCGG cannot justify its failure, as found by the Sandiganbayan, to file the corresponding judicial action against Aerocom within the six (6)-month period as provided for under the same constitutional provision in focus (Section 26, Article XVIII, second paragraph) by the fact that Aerocom was mentioned in the complaint of the PCGG in Civil Case No. 0009 (the Nieto, Africa, et al. case) and in Annex "A" thereof notwithstanding that <b>Aerocom</b><b> was not impleaded as party-defendant</b>, and on the argument that the filing of Civil Case No. 0009 against the "Nieto, Africa, et al. group" is enough compliance with the "judicial action" requirement.  x x x<br><br><b>There is no existing sequestration to talk about in this case, as the writ issued against Aerocom, to repeat, is invalid</b> for reasons hereinbefore stated.  <i>Ergo</i>, the suit in Civil Case No. 0009 against Mr. Nieto and Mr. Africa as shareholders in Aerocom is not and cannot <i>ipso facto</i> be a suit against the unimpleaded Aerocom itself without violating the fundamental principle that a corporation has a legal personality distinct and separate from its stockholders.  Such is the ruling laid down in <i>PCGG v. Interco</i> reiterated anew in a case of more recent vintage -- <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan,</i> <i>Sipalay</i><i> Trading Corp. and Allied Banking Corp.</i> where this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Ricardo J. Francisco, hewed to the lone dissent of Mr. Justice Teodoro R. Padilla in the very same <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i> case herein invoked by the PCGG, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x failure to implead these corporations as defendants and merely annexing a list of such corporations to the complaints is a violation of their right to due process for it would in effect be disregarding their distinct and separate personality without a hearing.<br><br>"In cases where stocks of a corporation were allegedly the fruits of ill-gotten wealth, it should be remembered that in most of these cases the stocks involved constitute a substantial if not controlling interest in the corporations.  The basic tenets of fair play demand that these corporations be impleaded as defendants since a judgment in favor of the government will undoubtedly substantially and decisively affect the corporations as distinct entities.  The judgment could strip them of everything without being previously heard as they are not parties to the action in which judgment is rendered.<br><br>"x x x.  Holding that the `corresponding judicial action or proceeding' contemplated by the Constitution is any action concerning or involving the corporation under sequestration is oversimplifying the solution, the rsult of which is antagonistic to the principles of justice and fair play.<br><br>"x x x <i>the actions contemplated by the Constitution should be those which include the corporation not as a mere annex to the complaint but as defendant. This is the minimum requirement of the due process guarantee.</i> Short of being impleaded, the corporation has no standing in the judicial action.  It cannot adequately defend itself.  It may not even be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>PCGG claims that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion when it ordered the release of the cash dividends, with interest, to Silangan and Polygon because the acts of PCGG in managing Oceanic -- including the declaration of cash dividends -- were void.  PCGG states that:<br><br><blockquote>In PCGG, et al. v. Sandiganbayan, et al., 365 SCRA 538, 549 (2001), this Honorable Court affirmed respondent Court's declaration that all actions of the PCGG-constituted [Oceanic] Board are null and void.  Such actions include the aforesaid declaration of dividends.  Therefore, private [respondents have] no legal basis to claim the dividends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court is not impressed. Again, PCGG failed to show that the Sandiganbayan acted with grave abuse of discretion. The Sandiganbayan correctly held that Silangan and Polygon were entitled to their Oceanic cash dividends, with interest, because the declaration of cash dividends was valid.  PCGG declared the cash dividends before the Sandiganbayan's 25 April 1994 Decision came out.  At that time, the 11 April 1986 and 15 June 1988 writs of sequestration were presumed valid.<br><br>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the Court held that PCGG's act of voting the shares of stock in the names of Victor, Aerocom and Polygon was valid because, at that time, the shares of stock were presumed to have been validly sequestered.  The Court stated:<br><br><blockquote>FINALLY, the question on the validity of the PCGG's voting the Class "A" shares to increase the authorized capital stock of ETPI.<br><br>In his petition in G.R. No. 147214, Africa faults the Sandiganbayan for failing to acknowledge, in its Resolution of February 16, 2001, the Decisions of this Court declaring that his shares in ETPI and those of AEROCOM and POLYGON (Polygon Investors &amp; Managers, Inc.) were not sequestered.  Hence, so he contends, they, and not the PCGG, should have been allowed to vote their respective shares during the meeting.<br><br>x x x  [<b>T</b>]<b>hat this Court rendered decisions holding that the shares of Africa, AEROCOM and POLYGON are not or no longer sequestered is of little consequence since the decisions were promulgated <i>after</i> the Sandiganbayan issued its resolution granting the PCGG authority to call and hold the stockholders meeting to increase the authorized capital stock.  At that time, the shares were presumed to have been regularly sequestered</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>DISMISSED</b>.
