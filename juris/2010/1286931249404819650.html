Mateo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> allowing an intermediate review by the Court of Appeals of cases where the penalty imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> life imprisonment, or death.<br><br>On 30 August 2007, the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> of the trial court was AFFIRMED by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00530 with the MODIFICATION that the penalty of death in each of the cases should be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in accordance with the law prohibiting the imposition of death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>On 14 July 2008, the Court of Appeals gave due course to the appellant's notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; This Court required the parties to simultaneously file their respective supplemental briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; Only the appellant opted to submit his supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>We uphold the conviction of the appellant.<br><br>The well-entrenched principles in the determination of the innocence or guilt of the accused in rape cases are, once again, seriously considered in the evaluation of this case.&nbsp; The three principles are:<br><br><blockquote>(1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></blockquote><br>Due to the nature of the commission of the crime of rape, the testimony of the victim may be sufficient to convict the accused, provided that such testimony is "credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, in <i>People v. Leonardo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> we stated the evidentiary value of the testimony of the rape victim:<br><br><blockquote>Credible witness and credible testimony are the two essential elements for the determination of the weight of a particular testimony. This principle could not ring any truer where the prosecution relies mainly on the testimony of the complainant, corroborated by the medico-legal findings of a physician. Be that as it may, the accused may be convicted on the basis of the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim, provided that her testimony is clear, convincing and otherwise consistent with human nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Upon these considerations, we have ascertained that the prosecution has sufficiently established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><u><center><i>Credibility of the Witnesses for the Prosecution</i><br></center></u><br>The trial court categorically stated that AAA and BBB "were straightforward and coherent, further made believable by their display of candor and naivete."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The appellate court, in turn, applied the settled policy that "the finding of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses deserve[s] a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Before us, appellant now posits that the instant case falls within the established exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> finding refuge in our ruling in <i>People v. Guittap</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>While it is our policy to accord proper deference to the factual findings of the trial court, owing to their unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grueling examination, where there exist facts or circumstances of weight and influence which have been ignored or misconstrued, or where the trial court acted arbitrarily in its appreciation of facts, we may disregard its findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></blockquote><br>We find the exception to the rule inapplicable in this case.<br><br><i>No material inconsistencies in the testimony of AAA </i><br><br>In his Supplemental Brief dated 5 March 2009, appellant points out that there were material inconsistencies in the testimony of AAA that cannot be considered insignificant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>&nbsp; Specifically, it was revealed on cross examination that her grandmother was also staying in the house and sleeping thereat at the time of the rape incident. This, he argues, affects the likelihood of the consummation of rape because AAA's grandmother would definitely have noticed the untoward incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>We are not convinced. Time and again, we reiterate that <i>lust is no respecter of time and place</i>.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>People v. Anguac</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> we rejected appellant's claim that it is impossible for the victim's siblings, who were sleeping with her, not to be awakened during the rape incident because, in numerous cases, this Court has found that rape could indeed be committed in the same room where other family members are sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Even assuming for the sake of argument that the prosecution failed to reconcile AAA's statements as to the dates when her grandmother lived with them, we consider such to be trivial a matter to impair AAA's credibility.&nbsp; Such would not diminish the value of the testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>&nbsp; On the contrary, it would strengthen the credibility of the testimony because it erases any suspicion of a coached or rehearsed witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Appellant further contends that the inconsistent testimony on AAA's attempt to wake BBB up is likewise material because the act could not have been consummated if, indeed, BBB was roused from her sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>This is likewise unmeritorious.&nbsp; It should be noted that BBB, the supposed witness to the incident, is a mere child, who could be cowed into silence by a person exercising moral ascendancy and influence over her.&nbsp; Granting that appellant could have discontinued his bestial act, if and when there was a witness to the commission of the crime, it was clear in the testimony of AAA that appellant was not aware that BBB was then already awake.<br><br><blockquote>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And [BBB] was awaken[ed] while your father was doing this thing to you?<br>A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did [BBB] do?<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did not do anything.<br></blockquote><br>Neither can we sustain the appellant's contention that AAA was in Manila when some of the rape incidents were allegedly committed.&nbsp; The source of the information is a third person<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> who was not presented in court.&nbsp; Sans any validation, the allegation remains to be hearsay. Further, a thorough examination of the testimony of AAA would show that she left for Manila only once<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> sometime after 19 April 2003 after the last rape incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; We confirm the observation of the trial court that her entire testimony was clear, consistent, and convincing.<br><br><i>Failure to immediately report the rape incidents was reasonable </i><br><br>Applying <i>People v. Romero, Jr.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> where this Court doubted the credibility of the seventeen-year-old complainant because she failed to "come out in the open and bring her abuser[-compadre of her aunt] to justice" in a span of eight months,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> appellant argues that the failure of AAA and BBB to immediately report the rape incidents significantly affects their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> <i>Romero</i>, however, is not on all fours with the prevailing circumstances of this case.&nbsp; The flaws and inconsistencies in the testimony of the complaining witness in that case were so material that it seriously impaired the witness'credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>In the recent case of <i>People v. Alarcon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> this Court well explained the reason why the failure of a victim to immediately report the rape does not essentially weaken the case against an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The charge of rape is rendered doubtful only if the delay was unreasonable and unexplained. In this case, AAA did not report what her father did to her because she was terribly afraid that he would harm her. This is a normal reaction by minors - to hide the truth because they are easily intimidated by threats on their person and other members of the family. xxx The only time she felt safe was after they had moved out of their father's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> As written in <i>People vs. Macapanas</i>,<br><br><blockquote>x x x. How the victim comforted herself after the incident was not significant as it had nothing to do with the elements of the crime of rape. Not all rape victims can be expected to act conformably to the usual expectations of everyone. Different and varying degrees of behavioral responses are expected in the proximity of, or in confronting, an aberrant episode.
