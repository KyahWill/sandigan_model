The salient terms and conditions of said agreement are as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="i"><li>Lump sum price--------PHP1,150,000.00;<br><br></li><li>50% downpayment---upon submission of surety bond in an equivalent amount and performance bond equivalent to 30 % of contract amount;<br><br></li><li>Completion date-----60 calendar days;<br><br></li><li>Penalty----2/10 of 1% of total contract amount for every day of delay;<br><br></li><li>Terms---50% down payment to be released after submission of bonds;<br><br></li><li>Retention--Subject to 10% retention to be released after the project is accepted by the owner;<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>To guarantee faithful compliance with their agreement, Lucky Star engaged respondent Stronghold which issued two (2) bonds in favor of petitioner. The first, SURETY BOND G(16) No. 141558, dated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May 9, 2006, covers the sum of P575,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> or the required downpayment for the drilling work.

Lucky Star, thereafter, commenced the drilling work.&nbsp; By July 18, 2006, just a few days before the agreed completion date of 60 calendar days, Lucky Star managed to accomplish only ten (10) % of the drilling work.&nbsp; On the same date, petitioner sent a demand letter to Lucky Star for the immediate completion of the drilling work<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with a threat to cancel the agreement and forfeit the bonds should it still fail to complete said project within the agreed period.<br><br>On August 3, 2006, ABC sent a Notice of Rescission of Contract with Demand for Damages to Lucky Star.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Pertinent portions of said notice read:<br><br><blockquote>Pursuant to paragraph 1 of the Terms and Conditions of the service contract, notice is hereby made on you of the rescission of the contract and accordingly demand is hereby made on you, within seven (7) days from receipt hereof:<br><br>(1) to refund the down payment of PHP563,500.00, plus legal interest thereon;<br><br>(2) to pay liquidated damages equivalent to 2/10 of 1% of the contract price for every day of delay, or a total of PHP138,000.00;<br><br>(3) to pay the amount guaranteed by your performance bond in the amount of PHP345,000.00;<br><br>(4) to pay PHP150,000.00 in other consequential damages;<br><br>(5) to pay exemplary damages in the amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

to make good its obligation under its bonds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Despite notice, ABC did not receive any reply either from Lucky Star or Stronghold, prompting it to file its Complaint for Rescission with Damages against both before the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on November 21, 2006.<br><br>In its "Answer (with Complusory Counterclaim and Cross-Claim)," dated January 24, 2007, Stronghold denied any liability arguing that ABC had not shown any proof that it made an advance payment of 50% of the contract price of the project.&nbsp; It further averred that ABC's rescission of its contract with Lucky Star virtually revoked the claims against the two bonds and absolved them from further liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Lucky Star, on the other hand, failed to file a responsive pleading within the prescribed period and, thus, was declared in default by the RTC in its Order dated August 24, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On February 27, 2009, the RTC rendered the assailed decision ordering Lucky Star to pay ABC but absolving Stronghold from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Relevant parts of the decision, including the decretal portion, read:<br><br><blockquote>On the liability of defendant Stronghold Insurance, the Court rules on the negative.<br><br>The surety bond and performance bond executed by defendants Lucky Star and Stronghold Insurance are in the nature of accessory contracts which depend for its existence upon another contract. Thus, when the agreement (Exhibit `A') between the plaintiff and defendant Asset Builders was rescinded, the surety and performance bond were automatically cancelled.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against defendant Lucky Star Drilling &amp; Construction, ordering the latter as follows:<br><br><ol><li>to pay plaintiff in the amount of PHP575,000.00 as actual damages plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint;<br><br></li><li>to pay plaintiff in the amount of PHP100,000.00 as liquidated damages;<br><br></li><li>to pay plaintiff in the amount of PHP50,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br><br></li><li>to pay plaintiff in the amount of PHP 50,000.00 as attorney's fees;<br><br></li><li>to pay the costs of the suit.</li></ol><br>Defendant Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc.'s compulsory counterclaim and cross-claim are dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner ABC prays for the reversal of the challenged decision based on the following<br><br><blockquote><center><b>GROUNDS</b><br></center><br><b> A. The Lower Court seriously <i>erred</i> and unjustly <i>ACTED ARBITRARILY</i> with manifest <u>bias</u> and <u>grave abuse</u> of discretion, <i>CONTRARY</i> to <u>applicable laws</u> and <u>established jurisprudence</u> in declaring the "<i>automatic</i> <i>CANCELLATION</i>" of respondent Stronghold's Surety Bond and Performance Bond, because:</b><br><br><blockquote><b>(a) Despite rescission, there exists a continuing <i>VALID PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION</i> guaranteed by Respondent's Bonds, arising out of the Contractor's <i>DEFAULT</i> and <i>Non-performance</i>.</b><br><br><b>(b) Upon breach by its Principal/contractor, the <i>LIABILITIES</i> of Respondent's bonds had already <i>ACCRUED</i>, automatically attached, and had become already <i>DIRECT, PRIMARY</i> and <i>ABSOLUTE,</i> <u>even before</u> Petitioner's legitimate exercise of its <i>option</i> under Art. 1191 of the New Civil Code.</b><br><br><b>(c) Rescission does NOT <i>AFFECT</i> the liabilities of the Respondent Stronghold as its <i>LIABILITIES</i> on its subject bonds have already become <i>INTERWOVEN</i> and <i>INSEPARABLE</i> with the liabilities of its Principal, the Contractor Lucky Star.</b></blockquote><br><b>B. With the Lower Court's <u>completely erroneous ruling</u> on the liabilities of Respondent's bonds, the Lower Court <i>equally ERRED</i> with manifest bias and grave abuse, in its <i>FAILURE</i> to comply with the "duty of court" to make a finding of "unreasonable denial or withholding" by Respondent Stronghold or Petitioner's claims and impose upon the Respondent the <u>penalties</u> provided for under Section 241 and 244 of the Insurance Code</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>Essentially, the primary issue is whether or not respondent insurance company, as surety, can be held liable under its bonds.<br><br>The Court rules in the affirmative.<br><br>Respondent, along with its principal, Lucky Star, bound itself to the petitioner when it executed in its favor surety and performance bonds.&nbsp; The contents of the said contracts clearly establish that the parties entered into a surety agreement as defined under <i>Article 2047 of the New Civil Code.</i> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 2047. By guaranty a person, called the guarantor, binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the principal debtor in case the latter should fail to do so.<br><br>If a person binds himself solidarily with the principal debtor, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this Book shall be observed. <b>In such case the contract is called a suretyship</b>. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>As provided in Article 2047, the surety undertakes to be bound solidarily with the principal obligor. That undertaking makes a surety agreement an ancillary contract as it presupposes the existence of a principal contract.&nbsp; Although the contract of a surety is in essence secondary only to a valid principal obligation, the surety becomes liable for the debt or duty of another although it possesses no direct or personal interest over the obligations nor does it receive any benefit therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Let it be stressed that notwithstanding the fact that the surety contract is secondary to the principal obligation, the surety assumes liability as a regular party to the undertaking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><i>Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc. v. Republic-Asahi Glass Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> reiterating the ruling in <i>Garcia v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> expounds on the nature of the surety's liability:<br><br><blockquote>X x x. The surety's obligation is not an original and direct one for the performance of his own act, but merely accessory or collateral to the obligation contracted by the principal.&nbsp; <b>Nevertheless,</b> although the contract of a surety is in essence secondary only to a valid principal obligation, <b>his liability to the creditor or promisee of the principal is said to be direct, primary and absolute; in other words, he is&nbsp; directly and equally bound with the principal.</b></blockquote><br>Suretyship, in essence, contains two types of relationship - the principal relationship between the obligee <i>(petitioner)</i> and the obligor <i>(Lucky Star),</i> and the accessory surety relationship between the principal <i>(Lucky Star) </i>and the surety <i>(respondent).</i>&nbsp; In this arrangement, the obligee accepts the surety's solidary undertaking to pay if the obligor does not pay.&nbsp; Such acceptance, however, does not change in any material way the obligee's relationship with the principal obligor. Neither does it make the surety an active party to the principal obligee-obligor relationship.&nbsp; Thus, the acceptance does not give the surety the right to intervene in the principal contract.&nbsp; The surety's role arises only upon the obligor's default, at which time, it can be directly held liable by the obligee for payment as a solidary obligor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, when Lucky Star failed to finish the drilling work within the agreed time frame despite petitioner's demand for completion, it was already in delay. Due to this default, Lucky Star's liability attached and, as a necessary consequence, respondent's liability under the surety agreement arose.<br><br>Undeniably, when Lucky Star reneged on its undertaking with the petitioner and further failed to return the P575,000.00 downpayment that was already advanced to it, respondent, as surety, became solidarily bound with Lucky Star for the repayment of the said amount to petitioner. The clause, "this bond is callable on demand," strongly speaks of respondent's primary and direct responsibility to the petitioner.<br><br>Accordingly, after liability has attached to the principal, the obligee or, in this case, the petitioner, can exercise the right to proceed against Lucky Star or respondent or both.&nbsp; <i>Article 1216 of the New Civil Code</i> states:<br><br><blockquote>The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously.&nbsp; The demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to those which may subsequently be directed against the others, so long as the debt has not been fully collected.</blockquote><br>Contrary to the trial court's ruling, respondent insurance company was not automatically released from any liability when petitioner resorted to the rescission of the principal contract for failure of the other party to perform its undertaking.&nbsp; Precisely, the liability of the surety arising from the surety contracts comes to life upon the solidary obligor's default.&nbsp; It should be emphasized that petitioner had to choose rescission in order to prevent further loss that may arise from the delay of the progress of the project.&nbsp; Without a doubt, Lucky Star's unsatisfactory progress in the drilling work and its failure to complete it in due time amount to non-performance of its obligation.<br><br>In fine, respondent should be answerable to petitioner on account of Lucky Star's non-performance of its obligation as guaranteed by the performance bond.<br><br>Finally, Article<i> 1217</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the New Civil Code acknowledges the right of reimbursement from a co-debtor <i>(the principal co-debtor, in case of suretyship)</i> in favor of the one who paid <i>(the surety).</i>&nbsp; Thus, respondent is entitled to reimbursement from Lucky Star for the amount it may be required to pay petitioner arising from its bonds.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the February 27, 2009 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, Branch 71, is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with <b>MODIFICATION.&nbsp; </b>Respondent Stronghold Insurance is hereby declared jointly and severally liable with Lucky Star for the payment of P575,000.00 and the payment of P345,000.00 on the basis of its performance bond.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Nachura,&nbsp; Leonardo-De Castro,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Peralta, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated as an additional member in lieu of Justice Roberto A.
