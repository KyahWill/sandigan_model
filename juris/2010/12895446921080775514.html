Bayerphil replied, reminding that Calibre owed it P1,272,103.07 as of December 31, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accusing Bayerphil of maliciously breaching the distributorship agreement by manipulating Calibre's accounts, withholding discounts and rebates due it, charging unwarranted penalties, refusing to supply goods, and favoring the new distributors/dealers to drive it out of business, Calibre, on March 14, 1990, filed a suit for damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 59258, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Calibre prayed for P8,000,000.00 actual damages, representing alleged actual losses and profits;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> P2,000,000.00 award as alleged damage to its goodwill and business reputation; P3,500,000.00 as exemplary damages; and, attorney's fees of P1,500,000.00.<br><br>In its Answer with Counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Bayerphil denied its alleged wanton appointment of other distributors, reasoning that it could not be faulted for a difference in treatment between a paying dealer and a non-paying one.&nbsp; It maintained that Calibre filed the damage suit to avoid paying its overdue accounts.&nbsp; Considering that those purchased on credit remained unpaid, Bayerphil had to refuse to further supply Calibre with its products.<br><br>Bayerphil also averred that the dealership agreement provides that rebates and discounts would only be granted if the previous purchases had been first fully paid.&nbsp; It denied that it failed to reconcile Calibre's accounts since it conferred with Calibre, and even acceded to a number of deductions demanded by Calibre subject to the latter's settlement of accounts.&nbsp; Bayerphil thus prayed for the collection of P1,272,103.07, with interest of 14% per annum accruing daily and compounded monthly from the date of default (as provided in the dealership agreement); P1,000,000.00 exemplary damages; and, P200,000.00 attorney's fees and costs of suit.<br><br>Bayerphil also moved that Mario Sebastian and his wife Minda (Sebastians) be impleaded as co-defendants, considering that the Sebastians bound themselves as solidary debtors under the distributorship/dealership agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Calibre opposed Bayerphil's motion to implead the Sebastians and moved to strike out the counterclaim, reasoning that the spouses are not parties in its suit against Bayerphil and thus are not the proper parties to the counterclaim.&nbsp; It stressed that the issues between the damages suit it filed and Bayerphil's counterclaim for collection of money are totally unrelated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Bayerphil contended that both causes of action arose from the same contract of distributorship, and that the Sebastians' inclusion is necessary for a full adjudication of Bayerphil's counterclaim to avoid duplication of suits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In its October 24, 1990 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the trial court rejected Calibre's arguments and granted the motion to implead the Sebastians as co-defendants in the counterclaim. The spouses then filed their answer to Bayerphil's counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> adopting all the allegations and defenses of Calibre.&nbsp; They raised the issue that the counterclaim against them is permissive, and since Bayerphil failed to pay the required docket fees, the trial court has no jurisdiction over the counterclaim.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On December 6, 1993, the trial court rendered judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> favoring Calibre.&nbsp; It held that Calibre was justified in withholding payment because there was deliberate inaction/employment of dilatory tactics on the part of Bayerphil to reconcile accounts making it liable for damages for `abuse of rights' and `unfair competition' under Articles 19, 20, and 28 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It opined that Bayerphil unfairly favored other dealers and deliberately refused to supply the plaintiff with its products to drive it out of business.&nbsp; As for Bayerphil's counterclaim, the court <i>a quo</i> adjudged that aside from being unmeritorious for lack of valid demand, the counterclaim was permissive in character.&nbsp; Therefore, it must be dismissed for Bayerphil's failure to pay the required docket fees.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Decision states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant Bayer Philippines, Inc., ordering said defendant to pay to plaintiff the amounts of P8,000,000.00 as actual damages, plus P80,000.00 as attorney's fees, plus costs.<br><br>The "Counter-Complaint" of defendant against the spouses Mario and Minda Sebastian is DISMISSED, for defendant's failure to pay the required docket and filing fees, considering that the counterclaim is permissive in character, and not compulsory. Defendant's counterclaim is likewise DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>The CA reversed the trial court's factual findings. In its July 31, 2002 Decision, the CA found no reason to award Calibre anything as it has no cause of action against Bayerphil. The CA said:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with the appellant that nothing in the evidence suggests that it deliberately and maliciously withheld approval of Calibre's claims.&nbsp; Indeed, the correspondences between the parties show that either there was an honest difference in the computation of the amount, and/or a variance in opinion as to the validity of the claims.&nbsp; There is abundant evidence that Bayer actually examined its records so much so that through a letter dated November 10, 1989, it gave its explanation why it was denying certain claims.&nbsp; Bayer sent its representatives to discuss the matter with Calibre's General Manager Mario Sebastian.&nbsp; Bayer exerted efforts to arrive at a compromise with Calibre, and expressed its willingness to grant several concessions to plaintiff-appellee (Exhibit "N", Record, pp. 256-257)<br><br>Parenthetically, Bayer's offer of compromise cannot be taken as an admission of liability on its part for the entire claim of appellee Calibre.&nbsp; In civil cases, an offer of compromise is not an admission of any liability.&nbsp; The compromise settlement of a claim or cause of action is not an admission that the claim is valid, but merely admits that there is a dispute, and that the amount is being paid just to buy peace.&nbsp; (Servicewide Specialists, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 117728, June 26, 1996, 257 SCRA 643) After all, it is the policy of the law to encourage compromises.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It must also be noted that plaintiff-appellee was not entitled to be the sole distributor within its area of coverage for Bayer.&nbsp; Under number 3, Part III of the latest Distributorship/Dealership Agreement (p. 231, Record) between the parties, it was stipulated that unless otherwise agreed upon, formally and in writing, plaintiff-appellee's appointment as distributor/dealer <b><i>was to be on a non-exclusive basis.&nbsp; The agreement expressly reserved Bayer's right to appoint other distributors and/or dealers, in any number desired and anywhere in the appointed area.</i></b>&nbsp; There is no evidence of a formal and written agreement appointing plaintiff-appellee as sole distributor in Pangasinan and Tarlac.&nbsp; Hence, it cannot validly claim that Bayer caused its business injury by appointing other dealers and distributors within its area.<br><br>Significantly, the Distributorship/Dealership Agreement also reserved to both parties the right to cancel the agreement at any time.&nbsp; Under the circumstances obtaining, Bayer was justified, in the exercise of sound business decision, to stop supplying goods to plaintiff-appellee until the latter's outstanding account had been finally settled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Furthermore, the CA favored Bayerphil's counterclaim. It ruled that Bayerphil's counterclaim was compulsory hence it need not pay the docket and filing fees.&nbsp; It noted that it arose out of the same dealership agreement from which the claims of Calibre in its complaint were likewise based.&nbsp; Finding that Calibre never denied that it owes Bayerphil, and that the evidence of Bayerphil regarding the amount owed by Calibre was unrebutted, the CA deemed justified the award of actual damages.&nbsp; Hence:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the lower court is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one is entered ordering plaintiff-appellee Calibre Traders and/or Mario Sison Sebastian and Minda Blanco Sebastian to pay defendant-appellant the amount of One Million Two Hundred Seventy-Two Thousand One Hundred Three Pesos and Seven Centavos (P1,272,103.07) with interest thereon at the rate of 14% per annum compounded from December 31, 1989 until fully paid.<br><br>Without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In its December 19, 2003 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the CA denied the motion for reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Issues</b><br></div><br>Based on the parties' contentions, the Court should now resolve the following issues: a) Calibre's entitlement to an award of damages; and, b) the propriety of granting relief to Bayerphil's counterclaim.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br><i>No form of damages can be awarded to Calibre for it miserably failed to prove its right to the reliefs it sought.</i><br><br>While only questions of law are reviewed in petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i>, the Court shall delve into the factual milieu of this case in view of the conflicting findings of facts by the trial court and the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The question arises whether Calibre has a cause of action against Bayerphil.&nbsp; The records before us though, highlight the lack of it.<br><br>The lower court's ruling against the latter is premised on a finding of malice or bad faith, <i>i.e.,</i> a finding of an abuse of right on Bayerphil's part in exercising inimical acts that prejudiced Calibre's business.&nbsp; However, we agree with the CA's conclusion that there is no adequate proof that Bayerphil was guilty of abusing its rights.

It wrote a letter answering point-by-point why some demands for discounts and rebates had to be refused. Bayerphil's second letter, wherein some claims were additionally granted, was on Bayerphil's part an act of concession in its desire to be paid since Calibre remained adamant in not paying its accounts.&nbsp; If ever Calibre found the second letter to be apparently inconsistent with the first letter, bad faith cannot be immediately imputed to Bayerphil since the latter is not precluded from making prompt corrections in its computations.<br><br>We cannot subscribe to the accusation of accounts manipulation.&nbsp; As the CA had found, this matter involves an "honest difference in the computation of the amount, and/or a variance in opinion as to the validity of the claims."&nbsp; Moreover, Bayerphil could not be blamed for disallowing some of the claimed discounts and rebates.&nbsp; Under the latest dealership agreement and the volume rebate agreement executed, payment is a precondition for the discounts and rebates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Bayerphil, to minimize further losses, was justified in stopping the supply of its products when its dealer still had outstanding accounts.&nbsp; Lastly, Calibre did not specify during the trial the unwarranted penalties Bayerphil had allegedly imposed.<br><br>Neither do we find any abuse in Bayerphil's exercise of appointing other distributors within Calibre's area.&nbsp; The fact that the distributors appointed were Calibre's former customers or salesmen or their relatives does not prove any ill intention to drive Calibre out of business. Notably, the distributorship/dealership agreement was on a non-exclusive basis.&nbsp; Bayerphil merely accorded the same business opportunities to others to better themselves.&nbsp; Naturally, an increase in the number of distributors in an area will entail corresponding decline in volume sales of the individual distributors.

The counterclaim for collection of money is not intertwined with or contingent on Calibre's own claim for damages, which was based on the principle of abuse of rights.&nbsp; Both actions involve the presentation of different pieces of evidence.&nbsp; Calibre's suit had to present evidence of malicious intent, while Bayerphil's objective was to prove nonpayment of purchases.

Thus:<br><br><blockquote>With respect to the motion to strike out the counterclaim, the Rejoinder and Reply of CALIBRE mentioned two reasons to support it.

However, if the lower court had jurisdiction, and the case was heard and decided upon a given theory, such, for instance, as that the court had no jurisdiction, the party who induced it to adopt such theory will not be permitted, on appeal, to assume an inconsistent position - that the lower court had jurisdiction.&nbsp; Here, the principle of estoppel applies.&nbsp; The rule that jurisdiction is conferred by law, and does not depend upon the will of the parties, has no bearing thereon."<br><br>In this case, the trial court had jurisdiction over the counterclaim although it erroneously ordered its automatic dismissal.&nbsp; As already discussed, the trial court should have instead directed Bayerphil to pay the required docket fees within a reasonable time.&nbsp; Even then, records show that the trial court heard the counterclaim although it again erroneously found the same to be unmeritorious.&nbsp; Besides, it must also be mentioned that Bayerphil was lulled into believing that its counterclaim was indeed compulsory and thus there was no need to pay docket fees by virtue of Judge Claravall's October 24, 1990 Resolution.&nbsp; Petitioners also actively participated in the adjudication of the counterclaim which the trial court adjudge to be unmeritorious.<br><br>However, we are more inclined to affirm the CA's ruling anent Bayerphil's counterclaim.&nbsp; It held thus:<br><br><blockquote>What remains to be determined now is whether or not defendant-appellant is entitled to its counterclaim.&nbsp; On this score, We note that plaintiff-appellee never denied that it still owes defendant-appellant for purchases it had made.&nbsp; Bayer had already recognized that Calibre was entitled to a volume rebate for the years 1988-1989 in the amount of P320,849.42 on paid purchases, and a 5% prompt payment rebate of P63,196.06 in view of the application of the volume rebate to Calibre's outstanding balance, or a total of P384,045.48, as stated in Bayer's letter dated November 10, 1989 (Exhibit "10", Record, pp. 373-375) earlier quoted.<br><br>Since no evidence was presented by plaintiff-appellee to rebut the correctness of Bayer's computation. We therefore assume it to be correct.&nbsp; Moreover, We note that the stocks Bayer had withdrawn per plaintiff-appellee's request under Claims 10 and 11 amounting to P124,493.28 had been credited to plaintiff-appellee as shown by the Statement of Account (Exhibit "4", Record, pp. 366-367) which shows that Calibre's outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 1989 was One million Two Hundred Seventy-Two Thousand, One Hundred Three Pesos and Seventeen Centavos (P1,272,103.17) (Exhibit "4-E", p. 367).&nbsp; We also note that the Distributorship/Dealership Agreement entered into by the parties provides that default in payment on any account by the DISTRIBUTOR/DEALER when and as they fall due shall entitle BAYERPHIL to interests thereon at the then maximum lawful interest rates which in no case shall be lower than twelve per cent (12%) per annum for accounts fully secured by a mortgage on realty or fourteen per cent (14%) per annum when otherwise unsecured.
