				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This administrative case stems from an audit conducted by the Financial Audit Team, Office of the Court Administrator (FAT-OCA) in the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Paete-Pakil-Pangil, Laguna on April 4, 2002 during the incumbency of respondent Marina Garcia Pacheco, Clerk of Court II therein.<br><br>The audit was prompted by a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> from Christopher M.

She declared that she was able to transfer the court funds to LBP only on May 25, 2002 due to heavy workload.<br><br>Respondent blamed the bank for the inconsistency between the total amount of deposits and total amount of withdrawals. Respondent admitted that she tampered with the duplicate and triplicate copies of the receipts she issued. However, she alleged that the money derived from the tampered receipts was spent for the court's renovation. She stressed that she did not use court funds for her personal gain, and that she even used her personal money to pay for the renovation.<br><br>Lastly, respondent maintained that she issued receipts for forfeited cash bonds and fines.

Thus, the OCA recommended respondent's dismissal from service.<br><br>On June 10, 2009, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> denying respondent's motion for recomputation and plea for additional time. The parties were asked to manifest if they were willing to submit the matter for resolution based on pleadings and documents on record. On June 17, 2009, respondent submitted her Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> expressing her willingness to submit the matter for resolution based on pleadings filed.<br><br>The Court agrees with the OCA that respondent should be dismissed from the service.<br><br>No position demands greater moral righteousness and uprightness from its holder than a judicial office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Those connected with the dispensation of justice, from the highest official to the lowliest clerk, carry a heavy burden of responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; As front liners in the administration of justice, they should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The Court has been tireless in reminding employees involved in the administration of justice to faithfully adhere to their mandated duties and responsibilities. Whether committed by the highest judicial official or by the lowest member of the workforce, any act of impropriety can seriously erode the people's confidence in the Judiciary. As such, failure to live up to their avowed duty constitutes a transgression of the trust reposed on them as court officers and inevitably leads to the exercise of disciplinary authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>By these standards, respondent was found wanting, and her admission to tampering the duplicate and triplicate copies of the court's official receipts shows her&nbsp; blatant disregard for her responsibilities as an officer of the court.<br><br>She violated OCA Circular No. 22-94, which provides that the DUPLICATE and TRIPLICATE copies of court receipt must be carbon reproductions in all respects of whatever may have been written in the ORIGINAL.<br><br>Respondent's unsubstantiated explanation that she spent the money derived from the tampered receipts for renovations in the court, is unconvincing. The investigation and examination conducted by the OCA revealed the contrary, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>"Interview however with MCTC Paete employees proved that expenses for the court's renovation came from local funds and not from court collections. Ms. Pacheco's claim that she made a timely correction as to the collected fines/bonds covered by tampered receipts is also not true. Although, she issued another set of receipts (14925601 - 14925607) in lieu of the tampered receipts (10514485, 10514483, 10514597, 10514531, 10514591 and 10514543), she however made it appear that only the two (2) sets of receipts were issued on the same day by placing an identical date. As evidence, a set of Official Receipts issued by the Property Division, Office of the Court Administrator on July 12, 2001 was used by Ms. Pacheco in lieu of the tampered receipts which were all issued in CY 2000."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>If her allegations were indeed true, she should have submitted the corresponding disbursement vouchers for labor and purchase receipts of&nbsp; materials utilized in the court's renovation instead of the supposedly corrected receipts. As aptly stated by the OCA, her justification was a lame and desperate attempt to disguise the fact of malversation of the court`s collections. In so doing, she was able to siphon off P10,780.00 from the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) of the MCTC in the year 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; This amount forms part of the P18,269.00 under-remittances discovered in the MCTC's JDF during respondent clerk of court's tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Respondent also incurred cash shortages in the Clerk of Court General Fund (COGF) amounting to P80.00 for the period October 1995 to August 31, 2002, and P206,529.58 in the Fiduciary Fund from April 1994 to August 31, 2002. Her failure to remit these amounts upon demand by the auditing team&nbsp; and&nbsp; by&nbsp; this Court, in our Resolution dated October 20, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> constitutes<br><br><i>prima facie</i> evidence that she had, indeed, put such missing funds to personal use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Corroboratively, nine months after having been placed on preventive suspension, respondent deposited P55,000.00 in the MCTC's fiduciary fund.<br><br>The fact that respondent is willing to pay her shortages does not free her from the consequences of her wrongdoing. As Clerk of Court, respondent is entrusted with delicate functions in the collection of legal fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; She acts as cashier and disbursement officer of the court; and is tasked to collect and receive all monies paid as legal fees, deposits, fines and dues, and controls the disbursement of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> She is designated as custodian of the court's funds and revenues, records, properties and premises, and shall be liable for any loss or shortage thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, even when there is restitution of funds, unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction, and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Her failure to account for the shortage in the funds she was handling, to turn over money deposited with her, and to explain and present evidence thereon constitute gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; These grave offenses are punishable by dismissal under Rule IV, Section 52 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Her acts may, moreover, subject her to criminal liability.<br><br>As custodian of court funds and revenues, it was also her duty to immediately deposit the funds received by her with the authorized government depositories and not to keep the same in her custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Supreme Court Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93 provide the guidelines for the proper administration of court funds.&nbsp; SC Circular No. 13-92 directs that all fiduciary collections be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized depository bank.&nbsp; Per SC Circular No. 5-93, LBP is designated as the authorized government depository.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The records show, however, that respondent deposited the court's collections from 1998 to 2002 with the Rural Bank of Paete instead of the LBP. Respondent cannot claim that she was informed of the foregoing rules on deposit only in 2002. SC Circular Nos. 5-93 and 13-92 were issued on April 30, 1993 and July 9, 1993, respectively. When she assumed her post as Clerk of Court II of the MCTC in 1998, it was her duty to know the rules and regulations relative to her official tasks.<br><br>Her explanation that the transfer of the court's collections to the LBP only on May 5, 2002 was due to heavy workload, is unsatisfactory. As the chief administrative officer of the MCTC, respondent clerk of court is expected to develop a system to efficiently attend to all her tasks. It is the duty of clerks of court to perform their responsibilities faithfully, so that they can fully comply with circulars on deposits of collections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Respondent's continuous violation of the aforesaid circulars only shows that she was grossly negligent in the performance of her duties. This negligence is further compounded by her failure to locate and present the 16 missing official receipts allocated for the Fiduciary Fund.
