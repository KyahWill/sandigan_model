Petitioner also indicated in its 2001 ITR its option to carry-over as tax credit next year/quarter the overpayment of P6,473,959.00.<br><br>On 9 April 2002, petitioner filed with the Revenue District Office&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 52, BIR Region VIII, a request for refund in the amount of P18,477,144.00, allegedly representing partial excess creditable tax withheld for the year 2001. Petitioner claimed that it is entitled to the refund of its unapplied creditable withholding taxes.<br><br>On 12 April 2002, before&nbsp; the BIR Revenue District Office could act on petitioner's claim for refund, petitioner filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Tax Appeals to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period provided under Section 229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the National Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; (NIRC) of 1997.<br><br>In its Decision dated 11 September 2003, the Court of Tax Appeals denied the petition for lack of merit. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which the Court of Tax Appeals denied in its Resolution dated 17 December 2003. In denying the petition, the Court of Tax Appeals explained:<br><br><blockquote>While we agree with the findings of the commissioned independent CPA that petitioner has unapplied creditable withholding taxes at source as of December 31, 2001, still the excess income tax payment cannot be refunded.<br><br>Upon scrutiny of the records of the case, this court noted that the amount sought to be refunded of&nbsp; P18,477,144.00 actually represents petitioner's excess creditable withholding taxes <i>for the year 1999</i> which petitioner opted to apply as tax credit to the succeeding taxable year as evidenced by its 1999 income tax return <i>(Exhibit K)</i>. Under Section 76 of the Tax Code, petitioner is precluded to claim the refund or credit of the excess income tax payment once it has chosen the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals.<br><br><center><u><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></center><br>The Court of Appeals held that under Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997, when the income tax payment is in excess of the total tax due for the entire taxable income of the year, a corporate taxpayer may either carry-over the excess credit to the succeeding taxable years or ask for tax credit or refund of the excess income taxes paid. Section 76 explicitly provides that once the option to carry-over is chosen, such option is irrevocable for that taxable period and the taxpayer is no longer allowed to apply for cash refund or tax credit. In this case, petitioner chose to carry-over the excess tax payment it had made in the taxable year 1999 to be applied to the taxes due for the succeeding taxable years. The Court of Appeals ruled that petitioner's choice to carry-over its tax credits for the taxable year 1999 to be applied to its tax liabilities for the succeeding taxable years is irrevocable and petitioner is not allowed to change its choice in the following year. The carry-over of petitioner's tax credits is not limited only to the following year of 2000 but should be carried-over to the succeeding years until the whole amount has been fully applied.<br><br>On 27 April 2006, petitioner filed a petition for review with this Court.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issue</b><br></u></center><br>The primary issue in this case is whether the exercise of the option to carry-over the excess income tax credit, which shall be applied against the tax due in the succeeding taxable years, prohibits a claim for refund in the subsequent taxable years for the unused portion of the excess tax credits carried over.<br><br><center><u><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></u><br></center><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>The resolution of the case involves the interpretation of Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 76. <i>Final Adjustment Return</i>. - Every corporation liable to tax under Section 27 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable income of that year, the corporation shall either:<br><br><blockquote>(A) Pay the balance of tax still due; or<br>(B) Carry-over the excess credit; or<br>(C) Be credited or refunded with the excess amount paid, as the case may be.<br></blockquote><br><b>In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefore. </b>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The confusion lies in the interpretation of the last sentence of the provision which imposes the irrevocability rule.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against the income tax due in the succeeding taxable years is irrevocable only for the next taxable period when the excess payment was carried over. Thus, petitioner posits that the option to carry-over its 1999 excess income tax payment is&nbsp; irrevocable only for the succeeding taxable year 2000 and that for the taxable year 2001, petitioner is not barred from seeking a refund of the unused tax credits carried over from year 1999.<br><br>The Court cannot subscribe to petitioner's view. Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997 clearly states: "Once the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the <b>succeeding taxable years </b>has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for <b>that taxable period </b>and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefore."&nbsp; Section 76 expressly states that "the option shall be considered&nbsp; irrevocable for <b>that taxable period</b>" - referring to the period comprising the "<b>succeeding taxable years</b>." Section 76 further states that "no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed <b>therefore</b>" - referring to "that taxable period" comprising the "succeeding taxable years."<br><br>Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997 is different from the old provision, Section 69 of the 1977 NIRC, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 69. <i>Final Adjustment Return</i>. - Every corporation liable to tax under Section 24 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total net income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable net income of that year the corporation shall either:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Pay the excess tax still due; or<br>(b) Be refunded the excess amount paid, as the case may be.</blockquote><br>In&nbsp; case the corporation is entitled to a refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the refundable amount shown on its final adjustment return may be credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the <b>succeeding taxable year</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Under this old provision, the option to carry-over the excess or overpaid income tax for a given taxable year is limited to the immediately succeeding taxable year only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In contrast, under Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997, the application of the option to carry-over the excess creditable tax is not limited only to the immediately following taxable year but extends to the next succeeding taxable years. The clear intent in the amendment under Section 76 is to make the option, once exercised, irrevocable for the "succeeding taxable years."<br><br>Thus, once the taxpayer opts to carry-over&nbsp; the excess income tax against the taxes due for the succeeding&nbsp; taxable years, such option is irrevocable for the whole amount of the excess income tax, thus, prohibiting the taxpayer from applying for a refund for that same excess income tax in the next succeeding taxable years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The unutilized excess tax credits will remain in the taxpayer's account and will be carried over and applied against&nbsp; the taxpayer's income tax liabilities&nbsp; in the succeeding taxable years until fully utilized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner opted to&nbsp; carry-over its 1999 excess income tax as tax credit for the succeeding taxable years. As correctly held by the Court of Appeals, such option to carry-over is not limited to the following taxable year 2000, but should apply to the succeeding taxable years until the whole amount of the 1999 creditable withholding tax would be fully utilized.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY </b>the petition.
