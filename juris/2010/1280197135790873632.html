				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">By Amended Information of February 9, 1998, appellants Jerry R. Pepino (Pepino) and Daisy M. Balaan (Daisy), along with Alfredo R. Pelenio (Pelenio),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> were indicted before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) for Kidnapping for Ransom with Serious Illegal Detention, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> allegedly committed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about October 18, 1997 in Quezon City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnap ANITA D. CHING, a businesswoman, and brought her to a safehouse for the purpose of demanding ransom in the amount of P500,000.00 thereby detaining her and depriving her of personal liberty from October 18 to November 6, 1997, until the said amount was paid.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Culled from the evidence is the following version of the prosecution:<br><br>At 10:00 p.m. of October 18, 1997, Anita Ching (the victim) left her Goldline Tours office in Quezon City on board her car driven by Alejandro Soriano, together with her other employees Policarpio Guinto (Guinto) and Eva Guinto.&nbsp; The victim and company had barely left the office when they were blocked by a vehicle from which alighted four armed men who poked their firearms at them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The armed men, two of whom â”€ Pepino and Pelenio â”€ were recognized by the victim and Guinto, forcibly took the victim and boarded her on their vehicle. The victim was 30 minutes later transferred to another vehicle and taken to a safehouse where she was to be detained for 19 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>During the victim's captivity, ten persons alternately guarded her.&nbsp; Daisy, one of two female cohorts of the group, warned her not to escape, otherwise, she would be hanged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; The group initially asked for a P30 million ransom but the amount was eventually negotiated down to P500,000.00 which was paid to the group.<br><br>The victim was on November 6, 1997 released and dropped near a drugstore along Bonifacio Avenue in Quezon City by Pelenio and Daisy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Pelenio escaped from detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; He was eventually recaptured in Cebu City but was killed in a shootout with the police on February 3, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Before his death, however, Pelenio sent a letter to the presiding judge of the trial court asking for forgiveness for his escape and admitting his complicity with Pepino in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Sr./Insp. Vicente Arnado, who was called as a hostile witness for the defense, identified Pepino as the leader of a notorious kidnap-for-ransom group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Without presenting evidence, Pepino merely challenged his warrantless arrest for kidnapping as illegal, insisting that he was arrested not for said crime but as an incident of his arrest for illegal possession of firearms.<br><br>As for Daisy who claimed to have been arrested on December 6, 1997 with her uncle Pelenio, she denied having met the victim at the safehouse, alleging that it was only on December 18, 1997 when she was presented at the Department of Justice that she met the victim for the first time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Branch 86 of the Quezon City RTC, by Decision of October 9, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> found Pepino and Daisy guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal and accomplice, respectively, of the crime charged, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, JUDGMENT is hereby rendered finding the accused <b><u>Jerry Pepino</u> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime </b>of kidnapping for ransom with serious illegal detention and hereby sentences him <b><u>to suffer the supreme penalty of death</u></b> and to indemnify the private complainant actual damages in the amount of P500,000.00 and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00, plus costs.<br><br>Accused <b><u>Daisy Balaan is hereby found guilty as an accomplice in the crime</u></b> of kidnapping for ransom with serious illegal detention and the Court hereby sentences her to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six years and one day of prision mayor to twelve years and one day of reclusion temporal, and to indemnify the private complainant, jointly and severally, with Jerry Pepino to the extent of one-third, the amounts mentioned above.<br><br>The case against <b><u>Alfredo Pelinio</u>, who appears to have died during the pendency of this case</b>, <b>is hereby considered <u>closed</u></b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Daisy having failed to attend the promulgation of judgment, a warrant for her arrest was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; It appears that she has remained at-large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Despite her flight, she moved for reconsideration of the decision which the trial court, by Order of January 9, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> denied.&nbsp; She thereafter filed a notice of appeal which was given due course by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In view of the imposition of the death penalty on Pepino, the case was brought to the Court for automatic review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; By Resolution of February 1, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court referred the case to the Court of Appeals for action and disposition pursuant to <i>People v. Mateo.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><i> </i>It appears that Pepino's appeal was consolidated with that of Daisy's.<br><br>By Decision of May 29, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision, noting that<br><br><blockquote><b><u>Pepino did not testify, and for that matter presented no evidence to defeat or attenuate the charge or evidence brought against him</u></b>.&nbsp; All he did in his defense was to raise the constitutional presumption of innocence, and to present his kins Renato Pepino, Larex Pepino [and] Zeny Pepino to testify that they and Pepino were illegally arrested in the latter's house in Lahug, Cebu City on December 7, 1997.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Just like Pepino, [Daisy] claims that the evidence against her did not prove her guilt and overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.&nbsp; But as said, <b><u>the prosecution evidence was ample and clear and established her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</u> </b> Clearly Anita [Ching] was cited out of context.&nbsp; The kidnapping covered a period of nineteen (19) days and what she said obviously referred to Day One when she was abducted by four (4) armed men.&nbsp; The testimony of a witness must be considered and calibrated in its entirety and not by truncated portions thereof or isolated passages therein (citation omitted).&nbsp; <b>Thus it must be considered too that Anita [Ching] said [Daisy] was among the persons she had seen in her place of captivity and had even warned her that she would be hanged if she tried to escape.&nbsp; She said too that after ransom was paid, [Daisy] was one of two who brought her to a place and released her.</b>&nbsp; These proved that <b>[Daisy] </b>was one of those in conspiracy to commit the felony, and hers was not a mere passive and innocuous hovering presence while Anita [Ching] was in captivity.<br><br>x x x x (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The appellate court having denied the motions for reconsideration of Pepino and Daisy by Resolution of October 9, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> their cases were brought to the Court.<br><br>Pepino assails his conviction on, in the main, the following grounds:&nbsp; lack of positive proof that he actually participated in the crime; error in appreciating against him the alleged confession-letter of the now deceased Pelinio; and the illegality of his arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Daisy, for her part, contends, in the main, that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Appellants' separate appeals fail.<br><br>Since Daisy, without proferring any justifiable cause, failed to attend the promulgation of judgment and continues to be a fugitive from justice to date, her appeal must be dismissed. So Section 6 of Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Court instructs:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 6. Promulgation of judgment.--The judgment is promulgated by reading it in the presence of the accused and any judge of the court in which it was rendered.&nbsp; However, if the conviction is for a light offense, the judgment may be pronounced in the presence of his counsel or representative.&nbsp; When the judge is absent or outside the province or city, the judgment may be promulgated by the clerk of court.<br><br><center>x x x x.<br></center><br><b><u>If the judgment is for conviction and the failure of the accused to appear was without justifiable cause, he shall lose the remedies available in these Rule</u></b>s <b>against the judgment and the court shall order his arrest.</b>&nbsp; Within fifteen (15) days from promulgation of judgment, however, the accused may surrender and file a motion for leave of court to avail of these remedies.&nbsp; He shall state the reasons for his absence at the scheduled promulgation and if he proves that his absence was for a justifiable cause, he shall be allowed to avail of said remedies within fifteen (15) days from notice.&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>On to the appeal of Pepino.
