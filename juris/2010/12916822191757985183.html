				<BR><STRONG>NACHURA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the August 23, 2007 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 29937, which affirmed with modification the June 14, 2005 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 81, finding petitioner Romeo Ilisan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide.<br><br>The RTC and the CA similarly arrived at the following factual findings:<br><br>On February 3, 2002, a baptismal celebration was held at the residence of Ricky Silva in Barangay Nagkaisang Nayon, Novaliches, Quezon City. Among those who attended were petitioner and one Joey Gaton (Gaton). They belonged to different groups of guests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>While Gaton and petitioner were having a drinking spree with their respective groups, one of petitioner's companions apparently got irked by the way Gaton looked at him. This prompted petitioner and his companions to maul Gaton. A melee then ensued; in the course of which, petitioner shot Gaton at the abdomen, causing the latter's instantaneous death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The gun used by petitioner was a .45 caliber pistol.<br><br>On February 7, 2002, an Information for murder was filed against petitioner with the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 81, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>That on or about 3<sup>rd</sup> day of February, 2002, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to kill, and with treachery&nbsp; and evident premeditation and with use of superior strength assault, attack and employ personal violence upon the person of one JOEY GATON Y GARALDE, by then and there shooting him with a gun hitting him on his trunk, thereby inflicting upon him serious and grave wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of JOEY GATON Y GARALDE.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>When arraigned on March 18, 2002, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Evidence for the prosecution consisted mainly of the testimonies of Gabriel Gaton, the victim's brother, Marlon Dellamas, and Edgardo Dag-um, both neighbors of the victim, who all positively identified petitioner as the gunman. Gabriel Gaton was summoned to the place of the incident while his brother was being mauled; Marlon Dellamas went to the scene of the incident to look for his brother Jojo; and Edgardo Dag-um was at the place where the mauling and shooting transpired.<br><br>In his defense, petitioner and his witnesses, Jomarie Ilisan and Jaime Escasinas, petitioner's brother and cousin, respectively, claimed that another guest, Chito Partisala, a jail guard in Bicutan, was the assailant. The defense also presented Engineer Leonard Jabonillo, Forensic Chemist of the Central Police District Crime Laboratory, who testified that petitioner tested negative for gunpowder residue when paraffin tests were conducted on him a day after the incident.<br><br>In its June 14, 2005 decision, the RTC accorded more weight to the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses over the declarations of the defense. There being no adequate proof that treachery and evident premeditation qualified the killing of Gaton, the RTC convicted petitioner of homicide, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the Court finds accused ROMEO ILISAN y PIABOL guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide punishable under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. Applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the accused is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a term ranging from eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum to fourteen years and eight months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amounts of P75,000.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 for the death of the victim and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>The period during which said accused was under detention should be deducted from the service of his sentence. Let a mittimus order be issued for service of sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>On appeal to the CA, petitioner questioned the credibility of the prosecution witnesses who allegedly harbored ill motive against him because they were either related to the victim or to one of the participants in the commotion. Petitioner also argued that the negative results of the paraffin residue test conducted on him strongly indicate his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In a Decision dated August 23, 2007, the CA affirmed the RTC's finding of guilt, but modified the amount of actual damages awarded and the maximum period of the penalty imposed by adding one (1) more day thereto, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's Decision dated June 14, 2005 is affirmed, subject to the modification of the maximum period of the indeterminate sentence to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal medium, and the reduction of the award of actual damages to P58,520.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, the present petition wherein petitioner reiterates the issues he raised before the CA.<br><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>The Court generally defers to the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witness and their testimonies, for it is in a better position to decide questions of credibility, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their attitude and deportment during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances which would alter a conviction, we are doctrinally bound by the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The application of this rule becomes even more stringent when such findings are sustained by the appellate court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> as in the present case.<br><br>We see no misappreciation of facts committed by the courts <i>a quo</i>, which were uniform in their reliance on the prosecution's version. Both were correct in concluding that the identity of petitioner and his actual shooting of Gaton were established beyond moral certainty through the testimonies of three (3) witnesses, namely: (i) Gabriel Gaton, who was summoned to the place of the incident while his brother Gaton was being mauled; (ii) Marlon Dellamas, who went to the scene of the incident to look for his brother; and (iii) Edgardo Dag-um, who was in the vicinity when the shooting transpired. Their ensuing testimonies are notable:<br><br><blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><table Â ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><u>Gabriel Gaton</u>:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">When Helen Dellamas went to your house and told you that your brother was being mauled, what did you do, if you did anything?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We went to the place and we saw a person holding a gun.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">You said that you went to the place, where was this place located?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Near our house, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, you said that you saw a man when you went there, what else did you see?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I saw him pointing a gun at my brother Joey.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">How far were you when you saw that man who was pointing a gun at your brother Joey?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(Witness indicating a distance of 10 meters more or less.)<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And how far was the man with a gun from your brother Joey?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(Witness indicating a distance of 2 meters.)<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What was the position of your brother Joey when the man was pointing his gun to your brother Joey?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Sidewise, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened after you saw the man pointing a gun at your brother?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I shouted: Don't (Huwag naman) but he ignored me and then the gun went off.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened after the gun went off?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">After firing the gun, he pointed the gun to the bystanders.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened to your brother?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He fell down, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]<br><br></sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><u>Marlon Dellamas:<br><br></u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Please tell this Honorable Court what [you were] doing [at] that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I was looking for my brother Joey Dellamas.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">If you can remember, were there many people on that alley?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And what was the [lighting] condition of that alley at that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">It was very bright at that time.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">At that time and place, was there any unusual incident that transpired on that place?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes ma'am, there was.

Relationship by itself does not give rise to a presumption of bias or ulterior motive, nor does it <i>ipso facto</i> diminish the credibility or tarnish the testimony of a witness. On the contrary, a witness' relationship to a victim of a crime would even make his or her testimony more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime to accuse somebody other than the culprit. The natural interest of witnesses, who are relatives of the victim, in securing the conviction of the guilty would actually deter them from implicating persons other than the true culprits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>There is likewise no indication that Marlon Dellamas and Edgardo Dag-um were improperly motivated when they testified against petitioner. As aptly observed by the Office of the Solicitor General in its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> aside from the prosecution witnesses' relationship with the other participants in the fight, petitioner failed to show any other basis for the ill motive he imputes against them. As a rule, absent any evidence showing any reason or motive for prosecution witnesses to perjure, the logical conclusion is that no such improper motive exists, and their testimonies are thus worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's reliance on the negative results of the paraffin test conducted on him the day after the fateful event must fail. Our ruling in <i>People v. Manalo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; is <i>apropos: </i><br><br><blockquote>[E]ven if he were subjected to a paraffin test and the same yields a negative finding, it cannot be definitely concluded that he had not fired a gun as it is possible for one to fire a gun and yet be negative for the presence of nitrates as when the hands are washed before the test. The Court has even recognized the great possibility that there will be no paraffin traces on the hand if, as in the instant case, the bullet was fired from a .45 Caliber pistol.</blockquote><br>Indeed, paraffin tests, in general, have been rendered inconclusive by this Court. Scientific experts concur in the view that the paraffin test has proved extremely unreliable. It can only establish the presence or absence of nitrates or nitrites on the hand; still, the test alone cannot determine whether the source of the nitrates or nitrites was the discharge of a firearm. The presence of nitrates should be taken only as an indication of a possibility or even of a probability but not of infallibility that a person has fired a gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Conversely, the absence of gunpowder nitrates on petitioner's hands, the day after the incident, does not conclusively establish that he did not fire a gun; neither are the negative results yielded by the paraffin test an insurmountable proof of his innocence.<br><br>The courts <i>a quo</i> also correctly rejected the version of the defense as a mere afterthought intended to exculpate petitioner, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>If it is true that they saw Chito Partisala sh[o]ot Joey, why they did not tell the policeman who arrived at the crime scene immediately that Partisala was the gunman. Why did Jomarie wait until somebody pointed to the accused as the gunman before he told them that it [was] Partisala who shot the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the positive, clear, and categorical testimonies of the three eyewitnesses to the crime deserve full merit in both probative weight and credibility over the negative results of the paraffin test conducted on petitioner and his witnesses' anomalous claims.<br><br>We now go to the penalty imposed. Homicide is punishable by <i>reclusion temporal.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance proven in the case at bar, the penalty should be applied in its medium period of fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum penalty will be selected from the above range, with the minimum penalty being selected from the range of the penalty one degree lower than <i>reclusion temporal</i>, which is <i>prision mayor</i> (six <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> years and one <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> day to twelve (12) years).Hence, the indeterminate sentence of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum, imposed by the RTC, and affirmed with modification by the CA, is correct.<br><br>The civil indemnity and moral damages awarded by the RTC and the CA were also in order and consistent with current jurisprudence.<br><br>Civil indemnity is mandatory and granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Under prevailing jurisprudence,<sup> </sup>the award of P50,000.00 to the heirs of the victim as civil indemnity is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Moral damages must also be awarded because these are mandatory in cases of homicide, without need of allegation and proof other than the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The award of P50,000.00 as moral damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> is correct.<br><br>We must, however, modify the actual damages awarded by the CA. Actual damages pertain to the actual expenses incurred by the victim's heirs in relation to his death, <i>i.e</i>., burial and funeral expenses. To justify an award therefor, it is necessary for a party to produce competent proof or the best evidence obtainable, such as receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In this case, the actual expenses incurred for the wake and burial of the victim were duly shown by receipts marked as Exhibits "K," "L," "M," and "M-1"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in the aggregate amount of P88,520.00. But the CA awarded only P58,520.00, which, after a perusal of the records, appears to have been caused by the non-inclusion of Exhibit "L," a receipt for P30,000.00 paid by the victim's wife to La Funeraria Novaliches for the deceased's autopsy and embalming treatment, and use of mortuary equipment for the interment. Having convincingly proved the nature of the expense in the amount of P30,000.00 in Exhibit "L," it is only right to increase the actual damages awarded to the victim's heirs to P88,520.00.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
