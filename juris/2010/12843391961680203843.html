Pilar Santiago and Clemente Santiago as executrix and administrator, respectively, of the estate of the deceased particularly of those properties which were prohibited by the testator to be partitioned within 20 years from his death.&nbsp; Since then up to the present, Ma. Pilar Santiago and Clemente Santiago remain the executor and administrator of the estate of the deceased and as such, they are required by law to render an accounting thereof from August 14, 1978 up to the present; there is also now a need to partition and distribute the aforesaid properties as the prohibition period to do so has elapsed.

PILAR, RICARDO, CIPRIANO FELICIDAD, EUGENIA, CLEMENTE AND CLEOTILDE, ALL SURNAMED SANTIAGO."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Petitioners' argument that the decision of the appellate court in the earlier CA-G.R. NO. 45801 (upheld by this Court in G.R. No. 155606) constitutes <i>res judicata</i> to the subsequent CA G.R. No. 83094 (the subject of the present petition for review) fails.<br><br><i>Res judicata</i> has two aspects, which are embodied in Sections 47 (b) and 47 (c) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The first, known as "bar by prior judgment," proscribes the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand or cause of action already settled in a prior action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The second, known as "conclusiveness of judgment," ordains that issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties involving a different cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Both aspects of <i>res judicata</i>, however, do not find application in the present case. The final judgment regarding oppositors' complaint on the reduction of their legitime in CA-G.R. NO. 45801 does not dent the present petition, which solely tackles the propriety of the termination of administration, accounting and transfer of titles in the names of the legatees-heirs of the <i>second </i>and <i>third </i>marriages.&nbsp; There is clearly no similarity of claim, demand or cause of action between the present petition and G.R. No. 155606.<br><br>While as between the two cases there is identity of parties, "conclusiveness of judgment" cannot likewise be invoked.&nbsp; Again, the judgment in G.R. No. 155606 would only serve as an estoppel as regards the issue on oppositors' supposed preterition and reduction of legitime, which issue is not even a subject, or at the very least even invoked, in the present petition.<br><br>What is clear is that <u>petitioners can invoke <i>res judicata </i>insofar as the judgment in G.R. No. 155606 is concerned <b>against the oppositors only</b></u><b></b>.&nbsp; The records reveal, however, that the oppositors did not appeal the decision of the appellate court in this case and were only impleaded <i>pro forma</i> parties.<br><br>Apparently, petitioners emphasize on the directive of the appellate court in CA G.R. No. 45801 that the decree of distribution of the estate of Basilio should remain undisturbed.&nbsp; But this directive goes only so far as to prohibit the interference of the oppositors in the distribution of Basilio's estate and does not pertain to respondents' <i>supervening</i> right to demand the termination of administration, accounting and transfer of titles in their names.<br><br>Thus, the Order of September 5, 2003 by the probate court granting respondents' Motion for Termination of Administration, for Accounting, and for Transfer of Titles in the Names of the Legatees is a proper and necessary continuation of the August 14, 1978 Order that approved the accounting, partition and distribution of Basilio's estate.&nbsp; As did the appellate court, the Court notes that the August 14, 1978 Order was yet to become final pending the whole settlement of the estate.&nbsp; And final settlement of the estate, in this case, would culminate after 20 years or on September 16, 1993, when the prohibition to partition the properties of the decedent would be lifted.<br><br>Finally, petitioners object to the inclusion of the house and lot in Manila, covered by TCT No. 131044, among those to be transferred to the legatees-heirs as it would contravene the testator's intent that no one is to own the same.<br><br>The Court is not persuaded.&nbsp; It is clear from Basilio's will that he intended the house and lot in Manila to be transferred in petitioners' names for administration purposes only, and that the property be owned by the heirs in common, thus:<br><br><blockquote>e)&nbsp; Ang lupa't bahay sa Lunsod ng Maynila na nasasaysay sa itaas na 2(c) ay ililipat at ilalagay sa pangalan nila Ma. Pilar at Clemente <b>hindi bilang pamana ko sa kanila kundi upang pamahalaan at pangalagaan lamang nila</b> at nang ang sinoman sa aking mga anak sampu ng apo at kaapuapuhan ko sa habang panahon ay may tutuluyan kung magnanais na mag-aral sa Maynila o kalapit na mga lunsod sa medaling salita, <b><u>ang bahay at lupang ito'y walang magmamay-ari</u></b> bagkus ay gagamitin habang panahon ng sinomang magnanais sa aking kaapuapuhan na tumuklas ng karunungan sa paaralan sa Maynila at katabing mga lunsod x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>But the condition set by the decedent on the property's indivisibility is subject to a statutory limitation.&nbsp; On this point, the Court agrees with the ruling of the appellate court, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>For this Court to sustain without qualification, [petitioners]'s contention, is to go against the provisions of law, particularly Articles 494, 870, and 1083 of <b><u>the Civil Code, which provide that the prohibition to divide a property in a co-ownership can only last for twenty (20) years</u> </b>x x x x<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>x x x x Although&nbsp; the Civil Code is silent as to the effect of the indivision of a property for more than twenty years, it would be contrary to public policy to sanction co-ownership beyond the period expressly mandated by the Civil Code x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, Del Castillo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Abad,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>Additional member per Special Order No. 875 dated August 2, 2010 in view of the sick leave of absence of Associate Justice Arturo D.
