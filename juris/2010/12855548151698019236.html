SP No. 71612. While in G.R. No. 166436, petitioner is assailing the Amended Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 7, 2004, rendered by the CA in the same case in favor of respondent Philips Semiconductors, Philippines, Inc. (PSPI) and against the petitioner.<br><br>The procedural and factual antecedents are as follows:<br><br><b><u>G.R. No 166436</u></b><br><br>Signetics Corporation, U.S.A. (SIGCOR), was organized under the laws of the United States of America with Signetics Filipinas Corporation (SIGFIL) as its wholly-owned local subsidiary here in the Philippines.&nbsp; Sometime in 1978, SIGCOR entered into a contract of lease over a piece of land consisting of 12,727 square meters, situated along the corner of Dimasalang and Laong-Laan Streets, Pasig, Metro Manila, with petitioner, through its president, Antonio Litonjua.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On March 15, 1990, petitioner filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against SIGCOR for damages, accounting or return of certain machineries, equipment and accessories, including the transfer of title and surrender of possession of the buildings, installations and improvements on the leased land, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig, Metro Manila, which was raffled to Branch 156 and docketed as Civil Case No. 59264.<br><br>In its Complaint, petitioner alleged, among other things, that SIGCOR transferred all its shares of stocks from SIGFIL to TEAM Holdings Limited (TEAM Holdings), a foreign corporation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Island.&nbsp; The new owner then dropped the name SIGFIL and changed its corporate name to Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation (TEAM Pacific). Consequently, service of summons was made on SIGCOR through TEAM Pacific.<br><br>On October 31, 1996, the court rendered default judgment against SIGCOR, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendant and/or its local subsidiary:<br><br><ol><li>To account for and return the machineries, equipment and accessories removed by defendant and/or its local subsidiary from the leased premises;<br><br></li><li>To formally transfer title to and surrender the possession of the lot subject of the lease contract to the plaintiff together with the buildings, machineries, installations and improvements on it;<br><br></li><li>To pay plaintiff the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) as moral damages for the injury to plaintiff's business standing and commercial credit; One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) as exemplary damages; Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) as and for attorney's fees and to pay the costs of the suit.</li></ol><br>Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the defendant at c/o Sycip, Salazar, Hernandez &amp; Gatmaitan, 4<sup>th</sup> Floor Sycip Law - All Asia Center, 105 Paseo de Roxas, Makati City; at Philips Electrical Lamps, Inc., Las Piñas, Metro Manila and at Technology Electronics Assembly and Management (TEAM) Pacific Corporation, Electronics Avenue, FTI Complex, Taguig, Metro Manila.<br><br>SO ORDERED<b>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On motion for partial reconsideration, the trial court amended its decision to include an order for the return of the corresponding value of the machineries, equipments and accessories removed by SIGCOR, and likewise canceling the annotation of the Contract of Lease on petitioner's property covered by TCT Nos. 11548, 11549, 11550, 11551, 11552, 11553, 11554, 11555 and 11937.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Again, on motion of petitioner, the trial court issued an Order dated April 27, 1997 clarifying its previous decision by ordering the Register of Deeds to cancel the annotation of the lease contracts over the titles above-mentioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Copies of the decision, including the amendments dated January 27 and April 27, 1997, respectively, were both served on TEAM Pacific at its office in Pamplona, Las Piñas City, and on its retained counsel, the Sycip Salazar Hernandez &amp; Gatmaitan Law Office (Sycip Law Office).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On May 21, 2001, petitioner filed a Motion for Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the RTC decision.&nbsp; In said motion, petitioner sought to enforce the judgment of the RTC against SIGCOR through the respondent. Petitioner alleged that SIGFIL was the alter ego of SIGCOR; that SIGFIL became TEAM Pacific; and that, SIGCOR was, subsequently, renamed as Philips Semiconductors.<br><br>On August 9, 2001, petitioner filed an Urgent <i>E</i><i>x-parte</i> Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to serve notice of hearing of its motion for execution to SIGCOR or its predecessor and its counsel through special service. The motion was grounded on the fact that SIGCOR had transferred its principal place of business from Philips Electric Lamps, Inc. in Las Piñas, Metro Manila to Philips Semiconductors Philippines, Inc. at Philips Avenue, SEPZ, LISP, Cabuyao, Laguna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On October 17, 2001, respondent PSPI filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> denying that SIGCOR holds office in the said address. It contended further that at no time was respondent ever known as Signetics Corporation, and its original corporate name was Philips Components (Philippines), Inc. before it changed its name to PSPI.&nbsp; Hence, it returned the copy of the court's September 27, 2001 order as well as petitioner's motion for execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent also specified that it was engaging the services of its counsel only for the limited purpose of making the said manifestation.<br><br>On December 14, 2001, respondent filed another Manifestation reiterating that respondent and SIGCOR or its predecessors are not one and the same entity, and that SIGCOR or its predecessors have assets that are in the possession of respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On January 21, 2002, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> denying the motion for execution quoted as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, under the circumstances herein obtaining, absent showing that the judgment rendered in this case has become final and executory, the Motion for Execution filed by plaintiff, thru counsel, would have to be, as it is hereby DENIED for having been prematurely filed.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The court anchored its Order on the lack of proof that SIGCOR or its alleged subsidiary was notified and/or served with a copy of the Decision sought to be executed.&nbsp; Hence, the definite reckoning period for purposes of computing when the judgment became final is yet to be determined. As such, the motion was prematurely filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On February 13, 2002, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration and Clarification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner argued that granting that SIGCOR was not properly served with a copy of the Decision, nonetheless, prior to the hearing of the motion for execution, certified copies of the Decision, as well as of the Orders amending it, were duly served on the respondent, the latter being SIGCOR's local subsidiary.&nbsp; It went on to say that while respondent was not named in the caption of the case, yet, in the body of the Decision, there was a factual finding to the effect that it is the present local subsidiary of SIGCOR. As such, the Decision can be properly enforced against it, considering the clear wording of the dispositive portion of the decision that it may be enforced through SIGCOR's "local subsidiary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On May 21, 2002, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> denying the motion.<br><br>On July 12, 2002, petitioner filed before the CA a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Mandamus<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> assailing the Order of the RTC, denying its motion for reconsideration and clarification. The case was docketed as CA-G.R.
