				<H3>JOSE PNCE DE LEON, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. SANTIAGO SYJUCO, INC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT, PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The plaintiff obtained from, defendant
Syjuco on May 5, 1944, a loan of P200,000 and on July 31, 1944, another
loan of P16,000, payable "within one year from May 5, 1948." On
November 15, 1944, the plaintiff offered to pay the entire indebtedness
plus all the interest up to the date of maturity. Upon Syjuco's refusal
to accept the tendered payment, the plaintiff deposited the amount with
the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila and instituted the
present action .to compel Syjuco to accept payment. The records of the
case were destroyed during the war, but they were duly reconstituted
after the liberation. The trial court sentenced the plaintiff to pay to
Syjuco the total sum of P23,130, representing the whole indebtedness
plus interest from August 6, 1944, to May 5, 1949, computed according
bo the Ballantyne scale of values. From this judgment Syjuco has
appealed, claiming the right to be paid the sum of P216,000, actual
Philippine currency, plus P200,000 as penalty agreed upon in the
contract. The majority of this Court sustains Syjuco1s claim for
P216,000.
<div align="justify"><p> As the same questions have been resolved in Ilusorio <em>vs.</em> Busuego, G. R. No. L-822, September 30, 1949,<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez, May 31, 1949,<sup><span style="color: red;">[2]</span></sup> 46 O. G., Supp. to No. 11, p. 339, and Gomez <em>vs.</em> Tabia, August 5, 1949,<sup><span style="color: red;">[3]</span></sup> 47 O. G. 644, in which I dissented, I have to disagree with the majority in the case at bar. </p>
<p> On the question whether a debtor can pay an indebtedness before the
date of maturity provided corresponding interest is paid, I said the
following in Ilusorio <em>vs.</em> Busuego . </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In other words, I hold that the mortgagor has the
right to pay the indebtedness at any time within three years provided
that, as in this case, he pays the interest for the whole term of the
mortgage. In the ordinary course of things, a loan is granted in
consideration of interest, and if by the early payment of the
obligation, the creditor would not lose any part of the stipulated
interest, both paragraphs 3 and 4 would practically be enforced. It
cannot be alleged that the creditor herein, in addition to interest,
wanted to have his money in the safekeeping of the debtor, because the
contract is one 6f loan and not of deposit. It is to be remembered,
moreover, that the debt was being paid in the same currency loaned
(Japanese money). The effect of inflation is one.of the risks naturally
incident to the money-lending business, and the lender should protect
himself against it by plain covenants." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> On the matter of requiring a loan obtained in Japanese war notes to
be paid after the liberation in equivalent Philippine currency, I am
hereinbelow reproducing at length what I stated in Bofio <em>vs.</em>
Gomez which should have greater application and force, because while in
the Bono case the amount of the loan is only 54,000, in the case at
bar.the debtor is being ordered to pay the large sum of P216,000: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The principal defense set up by Bono is that the
note is contrary to law, morals or public order. This defense was
flatly overruled in the court of origin,seconded by the Court of
Appeals. The judgment of the latter court is now before us upon appeal
by certiorari of Cristobal Bono. </p>
  <p> "The situation is one in
which a borrower of. P4,000.00 in Japanese war notes is made to pay the
same amount in currency of the present Philippine Republic. In other
words, the borrower of P4,000 during the latter part of the Japanese
military occupation whichf in ordinary practical terms, could hardly
purchase a cavan of riffie, is now compelled no pay &amp;4,000.00 in
actual Philippine currency which, In the same ordinary practical terms,
may be held equivalent to at least 100 cavanes of riee. Said borrower
is compelled to do so, merely because in his promissory note he agreed
to pay after one year in pesos of the Philippine currency, and
expressly waived any postwar arrangement devaluating the amount
borrowed in October, 1944. </p>
  <p> "The Court of Appeals held that
the commitment of Cristobal RoSo to settle his indebtedness in the
legal tender at the time of payment is not against the law, morals or
public order. We readily acquiesce in the proposition that the contract
is not contrary to law or public order, for we are aware of no statute
or public policy which prohibits a person from bringing about or
causing his own financial reverses. But we are of the opinion that, if
enforced to the letter, it is against morals. If the contract was
entered into in times of peace, its obligations should have i»he force
of law between the parties and must be performed in accordance with
their stipulations (Art. 1091, Civil Code). But when as in the case.at
bar, the borrower had to obtain a loan during war time, when living
conditions were abnormal and oppressive, everything was uncertain, and
everybody was fighting for his survival, our conscience and common
sense demand that his acts be judged by.compatible standards.</p>
  <p>"The
Court of Appeals found that everybody was aware of the developments of
the war outside of official propaganda and that, in so far as knowledge
of war events is concerned, Roño was more or less on an equal footing
with Gomez. This means that all knew the bombings by the American air
forces of various parts of the Islands in September, 1944, and of the
decisive defeats of the Axis powers in Europe, and that the mighty
forces of the Allies would soon, as in fact they did, concentrate on
and crush Japan, with the result that the Japanese war notes would
accordingly become worthless. It m»y of course . be supposed that Roño
knowingly bound himself to his pact. But this is true merely in theory.
Although, as found also by the Court of Appeals, Roño was not entirely
an ignorant man because he is a mechanic and knows English, the fact
nevertheless remains that the lender, Jose L. Gomez, was a lawyer, and
the exaggerated way the promissory note is worded plainly shows that
the latter must have thoroughly studied the transaction with Roño and
imposed the conditions evidenced therein to his one-sided advantage. It
is'needless to say that borrowers are always at the mercy of
unscrupulous money lenders. 'Neeessitous men are not, truly speafcing,
free'men; but, to answer a'present emergency, will submit to any terms
that the crafty may impose upon them.' (Marquez et al. <em>vs.</em> Valencia, 44 O. G. p. 895, 897<sup><span style="color: red;">[*]</span></sup>, quoting Villa <em>vs.</em>
Santiago, 38 Phil. 157, 164). We cannot believe, as intimated in the
testimony of Sinforosa A. de Gomez (wife of Jose L. Gomez), that Roño
informed them that he would use the money to purchase a jitney, for the
simple reason that, in view of the inflated value of the Japanese war
notes in October, 1944, the amount of P4,000 could not possibly
purchase a jitney. At any rate, even accepting the conjecture that said
amount was invested by Roño in his business, the circumstance still
makes him a necessitous man that had to submit to the terms of his
lender. That a contract like the one in question is shocking to the
conscience and therefore immoral becoxaes patent When we resort to the
example of a borrower of P2,000.00 just before the liberation, when a
kilo of sugar already cost 1P2,000.00, being compelled! to pay the same
in Philippine currency now when a kilo of sugar hardly costs P0.50.
Yfhere is the conscience of anyone who will collect P2,000,00 for a
loan of virtually fifty centavos?</p>
  <p>"The Court of Appeals
argued that the parties took equal risks, since it was impossible to
predict the exact time at which the Philippines would be liberated and
that, supposing that the liberation had been delayed for more than one
year, Gomez might have been the loser and Roño the winner, for the
Japanese currency might have further diminished in value. To this we
would answer that Gomez would then be paid in the same currency that
was borrowed and during the same war time when the loan was extended.
This would not be unusual, as the parties are still under the very
environment's that surrounded the execution of the contract."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> I may add the following observations contained in my dissenting opinion in Gomez <em>vs.</em> Tabia:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The majority also hold that the contract here in
question is aleatory. This is open to doubt. Aleatory contracts, or
those depending on chance, are covered by Title HI, Book IV, of the
Civil Code. It is to be noted that, under article 1790, an aleatory
contract involves the occurrence of an event which is uncertain or will
happen at an indeterminate time. Moreover, the contracts
contemplated'by the Code as being aleatory, are grouped under
insurance, contracts, gambling and betting, and life annuities. It
follows that the contract now under consideration, which is one of
loan, does not fall under any of those groups of aleatory contracts. At
any rate, the contract of loan herein involved is clearly not dependent
upon any uncertain event. The loan was granted on a definite date and
has to be paid on a definite date. Both dates are certain. The payment
of the loan has to be effected regardless of the result of the war.</p>
  <p>
"As the contract in question contemplated that the payment is to be
made in the same currency that was loaned, and the parties are presumed
never to have intended that said payment would be made in what has
become valueless money, justice demands that the indebtedness be paid
in actual Philippine currency at an equivalent amount determined in the
Ballantyne schedule, in the absence of evidence as to such value. The
exceptions mentioned in the Ballantyne schedule refer to contracts in
which the obligation is payable by something other than legal tender.
Indeed, the majority in Hilado <em>vs.</em> De la Costa et al.,<sup><span style="color: red;">[*]</span></sup>
G. R. No. L-150, decided on April 30, 1949, held that 'what the debtor
should pay is the value of the Japanese war notes in relation to the
peso of Philippine currency obtaining on the date when and at the place
where the obligation was incurred, unless <em>the parties had agreed otherwise.' </em>This
underscored clause undoubtedly contemplates an agreement to pay in a
consideration other than legal tender of the Philippine, such as gold
doilars, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, or the like. It cannot be
otherwise, since if the intention is merely to pay in legal tender, no
express stipulation is necessary, because under section 1612 of the
Revised Administrative Code, the Philippine currency is the legal
tender for all debts.</p>
  <p> "In reiteration of my stand in the case of Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez, <em>supra</em>,
I wish to emphazise that to require the herein respondent to pay the
sum of P5,000.00, actual Philippine currency, in return for an
indebtedness obtained in Japanese military notes equivalent in actual
Philippine currency according to the Ballantyne schedule, to only
P790.26 as found by the Court of Appeals, is unconscionable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In my considered opinion, the appealed judgment snould at most be affirmed.<br>
