CV No. 66672.  The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of Branch 121 of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, National Capital Region (trial court) by  declaring void the questioned extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage for non-compliance with the statutory requirement of publication of the notice of sale.<br><br><center><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></center><br>On 9 February 1995, respondents Spouses Dionisio and Caridad Geronimo (respondents) obtained a loan from petitioner Philippine Savings Bank (petitioner) in the amount of P3,082,000, secured by a mortgage on respondents' land situated in Barrio Talipapa, Caloocan City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. C-50575.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Respondents defaulted on their loan, prompting petitioner to initiate the extra-judicial foreclosure of the real estate mortgage.  At the auction sale conducted on 29 March 1996, the mortgaged property was sold to petitioner,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> being the highest bidder, for P3,000,000.  Consequently, a Certificate of Sale was issued in favor of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Claiming that the extrajudicial foreclosure was void for non-compliance with the law, particularly the publication requirement, respondents filed with the trial court a complaint for the annulment of the extrajudicial foreclosure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The trial court sustained the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure, and disposed of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Complaint for Annulment of Foreclosure of Mortgage and Damages is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals held:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the assailed decision dated 26 November 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage conducted on 29 March 1996 is declared NULL and VOID.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center></u><br>The trial court held that "personal notice on the mortgagor is not required under Act No. 3135."  All that is required is "the posting of the notices of sale for not less than 20 days in at least three public places in the municipality or city where the property is situated, and publication once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city, if the property is worth more than four hundred pesos."<br><br>The trial court further ruled there was compliance with the statutory publication requirement. Since the affidavit of publication was excluded as petitioner's evidence, the trial court relied instead on the positive testimony of Deputy Sheriff Alberto Castillo, that he caused the publication of the Notice of Sale, in holding there was publication of the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation. In relation to this, the trial court cited the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty. The trial court found that respondents, as plaintiffs, failed to discharge their burden of proving petitioner's alleged non-compliance with the requisite publication.  The trial court stated that the testimony of respondents' witness, a newsstand owner, "that he has never sold <i>Ang Pinoy</i> newspaper can never lead to the conclusion that such publication does not exist."<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b><br></center></u><br>The Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the trial court.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found  no sufficient evidence to prove that<i> Ang Pinoy</i> is a newspaper of general circulation in Caloocan City.  In a Resolution dated 2 February 2005, the Court of Appeals required the then Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City to inform the appellate court of the following facts:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> If Ang Pinoy newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation particularly for the years 1995 and 1996; and<br><br></li><li>If there was compliance with Sec. 2 of P.D.

Therefore, the extrajudicial foreclosure is void for non-compliance with the requirement of the publication of the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issue</b></u><br></center><br>Basically, the issue in this case is whether the extra-judicial foreclosure is void for non-compliance with the publication requirement under Act No. 3135.<br><br><center><u><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></u><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Section 3 of Act No. 3135<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 3.

Assuming that the notice of sale was published, respondents contend that <i>Ang Pinoy</i>, where it was published, is not a newspaper of general circulation.  To bolster their claim of non-publication, respondents offered the testimony of Danilo Magistrado, a newsstand owner, which pertinently states:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

At any rate, the accreditation by the Executive Judge is not decisive of whether a newspaper is of general circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>It is settled that for the purpose of extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage, the party alleging non-compliance with the requisite publication has the burden of proving the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  In this case, respondents presented the testimony of a newsstand owner to prove that <i>Ang Pinoy</i> is not a newspaper of general circulation. However, this particular evidence is unreliable, as the same witness testified that he sells newspapers in Quezon City, not in Caloocan  City, and that he is unaware of <i>Ang Pinoy</i> newspaper simply because he is not selling the same and he had not heard of it.   His testimony states:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Where is this place that you traditionally or usually sell newspaper?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Corner of A.

In <i>Spouses Pulido v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>While it may be true that the party alleging non-compliance with the requisite publication has the burden of proof, still negative allegations need not be proved even if essential to one's cause of action or defense if they constitute a denial of the existence of a document the custody of which belongs to the other party.</blockquote><br>In relation to the evidentiary weight of the affidavit of publication, the Court ruled in <i>China Banking Corporation v. Spouses Martir</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that the affidavit of publication executed by the account executive of the newspaper is <i>prima facie</i> proof that the newspaper is generally circulated in the place where the properties are located.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Affidavit of Publication or Exhibit "8," although formally offered by petitioner, was excluded by the trial court for being hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Petitioner never challenged the exclusion of the affidavit of publication. Instead, petitioner relies solely on the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Alberto Castillo to prove compliance with the publication requirement under Section 3 of Act No. 3135.  However, there is nothing in such testimony to clearly and convincingly prove that petitioner complied with the mandatory requirement of publication.  When Sheriff Castillo was asked how he knew that the notice of sale was published, he simply replied that "during the auction sale the mortgagee bank presented the affidavit of publication."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Evidently, such an answer does not suffice to establish petitioner's claim of compliance with the statutory requirement of publication. On the contrary, Sheriff Castillo's testimony reveals that he had no personal knowledge of the actual publication of the notice of sale, much less the extent of the circulation of <i>Ang Pinoy</i>.<br><br>Moreover, the Court notes that <i>Ang Pinoy</i> is a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in Manila, not in Caloocan City where the mortgaged property is located, as indicated in the excluded Affidavit of Publication.  This is contrary to the requirement under Section 3 of Act No. 3135 pertaining to the publication of the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the city where the property is situated.  Hence, even if the Affidavit of Publication was admitted as part of petitioner's evidence, it would not support petitioner's case as it does not clearly prove petitioner's compliance with the publication requirement.<br><br>Petitioner's invocation of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty on the part of Sheriff Castillo is misplaced.  While posting the notice of sale is part of a sheriff's official functions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the actual publication of the notice of sale cannot be considered as such, since this concerns the publisher's business. Simply put, the sheriff is incompetent to prove that the notice of sale was actually published in a newspaper of general circulation.<br><br>The Court further notes that the Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> prepared and posted by Sheriff Castillo, does not indicate the newspaper where such notice would be published.  The space provided where the name of the newspaper should be was left blank, with only the dates of publication clearly written. This omission raises serious doubts as to whether there was indeed publication of the notice of sale.<br><br>Once again, the Court stresses the importance of the notice requirement, as enunciated in <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. v. Peñafiel</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote><br>The object of a notice of sale is to inform the public of the nature and condition of the property to be sold, and of the time, place and terms of the sale. Notices are given for the purpose of securing bidders and to prevent a sacrifice [sale] of the property. The goal of the notice requirement is to achieve a "reasonably wide publicity" of the auction sale. This is why publication in a newspaper of general circulation is required. The Court has previously taken judicial notice of the "far-reaching effects" of publishing the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation.</blockquote><br>In addition, the Court reminds mortgagees of their duty to comply faithfully with the statutory requirements of foreclosure. In <i>Metropolitan Bank v. Wong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court declared:<br><br><blockquote>While the law recognizes the right of a bank to foreclose a mortgage upon the mortgagor's failure to pay his obligation, it is imperative that such right be exercised according to its clear mandate. Each and every requirement of the law must be complied with, lest, the valid exercise of the right would end. It must be remembered that the exercise of a right ends when the right disappears, and it disappears when it is abused especially to the prejudice of others.</blockquote><br>In sum, petitioner failed to establish its compliance with the publication requirement under Section 3 of Act No. 3135. Consequently, the questioned extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage and sale are void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
