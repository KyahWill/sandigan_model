				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the August 29, 2006 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00964, which held appellant Leonito Amatorio (Amatorio) guilty of five counts of rape.

She narrated that she received a letter from AAA when the latter was working in Lipa City. Through the said letter, BBB came to know that AAA had hard feelings towards Amatorio. BBB said that she spoke to Amatorio about it, but that the latter got mad at her and said that AAA was hard- headed. BBB then went to Lipa City to talk to her daughter. It was on that occasion that AAA told BBB that she was raped by Amatorio five times. The first was on July 27, 1991, which was incidentally the birthday of AAA; the second time was on July 30, 1991, the third time was in June 1992, the fourth time was on November 15, 1993, and the last time was on September 29, 1994. After learning what Amatorio had done to her daughter, BBB went to the municipal building in Guinayangan, Quezon, where she executed an Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and filed a complaint against Amatorio. BBB testified that AAA was only nine years old when the first act of rape was committed. BBB also presented the birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of AAA to prove such fact.<br><br>On cross-examination, BBB testified that Amatorio was living in her house at Guinayangan, Quezon, along with her daughter AAA.<br><br>The next witness presented by the prosecution was the victim, AAA, who testified that she knew Amatorio one month before she was raped by him and that he was the common-law husband of BBB. At around 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on July 27, 1991, AAA testified that Amatorio called her in their backyard telling her that he would give her a gift. AAA said that she was celebrating her 9<sup>th</sup> birthday on the said day. Once there, Amatorio held AAA in her arms and pressed a knife at the side of her body and dragged her to the grassy portion of the backyard. Amatorio removed the shorts and panty of AAA and pulled out the button of her shirt. Amatorio then removed his shorts and brief. During this time, Amatorio was still holding the knife and had it poked at the side of AAA. Amatorio then placed himself on top of AAA and opened her thighs placing himself at the center. AAA testified that her private part became painful and bloodied, because the penis of Amatorio entered her vagina. AAA said that she fought back, but she was not able to stop Amatorio since he was very strong. Amatorio then boxed the thigh of AAA which caused her to feel weak. After Amatorio had ravaged her, AAA testified that Amatorio told her "<i>na ingatan kong makahalata ang Nanay ko</i>" or else he will kill them.<br><br>Three days after the first incident, Amatorio repeated the same bestial act on AAA on July 30, 1991 at about 4:30 a.m. AAA testified that she was sleeping when her mother left the house in order to fetch water. She was surprised when Amatorio covered her mouth and undressed her. She said that she was raped by Amatorio and that she could not do anything but cry. AAA begged for Amatorio's mercy, but he did not hear her and, instead, told her that he would do the same thing to her sister if she will tell anybody what had happened to her.<br><br>Sometime in June 1992, AAA was residing in the house of Roberto Olar. It was on that occasion that AAA was raped a third time by Amatorio. AAA testified that Amatorio ordered her to go with him fishing in a fishpond near the seashore and that she was raped on the way there. She said that she again begged for mercy, but that Amatorio did not stop. She also said that she believed Amatorio would kill her mother and sister which is why Amatorio was able to rape her again.<br><br>AAA then testified that she was raped a fourth time on November 15, 1993 at around 12:30 p.m. and a fifth time on September 29, 1994 .<br><br>AAA left their home and went to Lipa City to live with her grandmother. It was only on October 20, 1996 that AAA finally told BBB, her mother, that she had been raped. AAA said that she told her mother what had happened to her, because she heard that Amatorio was also bringing her younger sister to fish and that she was afraid that he would do the same thing he did to her to her sister. It was because of this that she wrote a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to BBB asking BBB not to allow her sister to go with Amatorio. AAA likewise, wrote another letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to her sister, asking her not to go with Amatorio as he might do something wrong to her. BBB then went to Lipa City to talk to AAA about the letter. It was on this occasion that AAA finally told her mother that she was raped by Amatorio five times. AAA executed an Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in connection with the case.<br><br>The prosecution next presented Dr. Florencia Agno Vergara, the doctor who examined AAA. Dr. Vergara issued a Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> wherein her findings were "hymen showed irregular borders" which meant that the vaginal borders were irregular and with latches.<br><br>The defense presented Amatorio who denied having raped AAA. He said that he does not know anything about the claim of AAA that he raped her on July 27, 1991. He also claimed that although he was at their house in Guinayangan, Quezon on the said date, AAA was not there because she was living with her father Jun in Manila. He then added that on the dates which according to AAA she was raped by him, AAA was not with him but in Manila with her father.<br><br>On January 28, 2005, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> finding Amatorio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, this Court finds accused Leonito Amatorio GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in Criminal Cases Nos. 2840-C, 2841-C, 2842-C, 2843-C and 2844-C and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the victim AAA the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages in Criminal Cases Nos. 2840-C, 2841-C, 2842-C, 2843-C; and the penalty of DEATH in Criminal Case No. 2844-C and payment of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.<br><br>The accused is to be credited of his preventive imprisonment if proper and any, pursuant to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 6127 and E.O.

As observed by the RTC, AAA broke down and cried during her narration of her sexual ordeals or abuse by Amatorio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>For his part, Amatorio only offers the defense of plain denial. He denied knowledge about AAA's allegation of rape on July 27, 1991, since he claimed that AAA was in Manila during that time. He also denied having committed the other four allegations of rape, because he claims that AAA was again in Manila and not in Quezon.<br><br>Jurisprudence teaches that between categorical testimonies that ring of truth, on one hand, and a bare denial, on the other, the Court has strongly ruled that the former must prevail. Indeed, positive identification of the accused, when categorical and consistent, and without any ill motive on the part of the eyewitnesses testifying on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As observed by the RTC, Amatorio miserably failed to adduce evidence showing that AAA or her mother was actuated by any ill-motive in charging him with five counts of rape.<br><br>All told, this Court has no reason to reverse the findings of the RTC finding the testimony of AAA and the other witnesses credible as it was in the position to hear the witnesses themselves and observe their behavior and manner of testifying. As this Court had held in previous cases, time and again, we have consistently held that when a woman, more so if a minor, states that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. For no woman, least of all a child, would weave a tale of sexual assaults to her person, open herself to examination of her private parts and later be subjected to public trial or ridicule if she was not, in truth, a victim of rape and impelled to seek justice for the wrong done to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Fraga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court held that "although the rape of a person under eighteen (18) years of age by the common-law spouse of the victim's mother is punishable by death, this penalty cannot be imposed on accused-appellant x x x because his relationship was not what was alleged in the informations."<br><br>Contrary to the findings of the RTC, that the "<i>qualifying circumstance of minority and relationship were clearly established by the prosecution in Criminal Case No. 2844-C and it was also properly alleged in the Information</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court finds that the same is bereft of basis as the relationship of Amatorio to AAA was, in fact, not alleged in all the five Informations. It is basic that the filiation or kinship with the accused must be alleged in the information as part of the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The failure to accurately allege the relationship between appellant and his victim in the information bars his conviction of rape in its qualified form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus, since Amatorio's relationship to AAA was not alleged in the Information, he is thus auspiciously spared from being convicted of qualified rape.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, the RTC erred when it convicted Amatorio of qualified rape in Criminal Case No. 2844-C, as he can only be held liable for simple rape as correctly ruled by the CA. Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, otherwise known as <i>The Anti-Rape Law of 1997</i>, reads:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 266-A. <i>Rape; When and How Committed. </i>- Rape is committed.<br><br>1) By a man who have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ART. 266-B. <i>Penalties</i>. - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.</blockquote><br>Finally, with respect to damages, the Court affirms the RTC and the CA's awards of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of rape committed.<br><br>Civil indemnity is automatically awarded upon proof of the commission of the crime by the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, the civil indemnity awarded to victims of qualified rape shall not be less than P75,000.00, and P50,000.00 for simple rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 for each count is also automatically granted in a rape case without need of further proof other than the fact of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>This Court, however, also awards exemplary damages in view of the minority of the victim. In line with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> an award of P30,000.00 for each count of rape is thus warranted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the challenged Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated August 29, 2006, in CA-G.R.
