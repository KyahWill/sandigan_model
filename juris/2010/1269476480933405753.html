Pantaleon (<i>Pantaleon</i>) (collectively, <i>petitioners</i>) who seek to reverse and set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 5, 2003 and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 22, 2003 of the Former Ninth Division of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. CV No. 69627. The assailed CA Decision affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>), Branch 73, Antipolo City in Civil Case No. 97-4552 that held the petitioners liable for payment of P3,526,117.00 to respondent Arthur F. Menchavez (<i>respondent</i>), but modified the interest rate from 4% per month to 12% per annum, computed from the filing of the complaint to full payment.  The assailed CA Resolution denied the petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><center><u><b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b><br></u></center><br>The facts of the case, gathered from the records, are briefly summarized below.<br><br>On December 8, 1993, Pantaleon, the President and Chairman of the Board of PRISMA, obtained a <b>P1,000,000.00</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><b> loan from the respondent, with a monthly interest of P40,000.00 payable for six months,</b> or a total obligation of P1,240,000.00 to be paid within six (6) months,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> under the following schedule of payments:<br><br><blockquote>January 8, 1994 ......................

Pantaleon, hereby acknowledge the receipt of ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PESOS (P1,240,000), Philippine Currency, from Mr. Arthur F. Menchavez, representing a six-month loan payable according to the following schedule:<br><blockquote>January 8, 1994 ...................... P40,000.00<br>February 8, 1994 .....................

Pantaleon signed the promissory note in his personal capacity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and as duly authorized by the Board of Directors of PRISMA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The petitioners failed to completely pay the loan within the stipulated six (6)-month period.<br><br>From September 8, 1994 to January 4, 1997, the petitioners paid the following amounts to the respondent:<br><br><blockquote>September 8, 1994 ..................P320,000.00<br>October 8, 1995.......................P600,000.00<br>November 8, 1995....................P158,772.00<br>January 4, 1997 ........................ P30,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br>As of January 4, 1997, the petitioners had already paid a total of P1,108,772.00.  However, the respondent found that the petitioners still had an outstanding balance of P1,364,151.00 as of January 4, 1997, to which it <b>applied a 4% monthly interest</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Thus, on August 28, 1997, the respondent filed a complaint for sum of money with the RTC to enforce the unpaid balance, <b>plus 4% monthly interest</b>, P30,000.00 in attorney's fees, P1,000.00 per court appearance and costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In their Answer dated October 6, 1998, the petitioners admitted the loan of P1,240,000.00, but denied the stipulation on the 4% monthly interest, arguing that the interest was not provided in the promissory note. Pantaleon also denied that he made himself personally liable and that he made representations that the loan would be repaid within six (6) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>THE RTC RULING</b></u><br></center><br>The RTC rendered a Decision on October 27, 2000 finding that the respondent issued a check for P1,000,000.00 in favor of the petitioners for a loan that would earn  an interest of 4% or P40,000.00 per month, or a total of P240,000.00 for a 6-month period. It noted that the petitioners made several payments amounting to P1,228,772.00, but they were still indebted to the respondent for P3,526,117.00 as of February <b>11</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 1999 after considering the 4% monthly interest. The RTC observed that PRISMA was a one-man corporation of Pantaleon and used this circumstance to justify the piercing of the veil of corporate fiction. Thus, the RTC ordered the petitioners to jointly and severally pay the respondent the amount of P3,526,117.00 plus 4% per month interest from February 11, 1999 until  fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The petitioners elevated the case to the CA <i>via </i>an ordinary appeal under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, insisting that there was no express stipulation on the 4% monthly interest.<br><br><u><center><b>THE CA RULING</b><br></center></u><br>The CA decided the appeal on May 5, 2003. The CA found that the parties agreed to a 4% monthly interest principally based on the board resolution that authorized Pantaleon to transact a loan with an approved interest of not more than 4% per month. The appellate court, however, noted that the interest of 4% per month, or 48% per annum, was unreasonable and should be reduced to 12% per annum.  The CA affirmed the RTC's finding that PRISMA was a mere instrumentality of Pantaleon that justified the piercing of the veil of corporate fiction. Thus, the CA modified the RTC Decision by imposing a 12% per annum interest, computed from the filing of the complaint until finality of judgment, and thereafter, 12% from finality until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After the CA's denial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of their motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><sup> </sup>the petitioners filed the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><u><center><b>THE PETITION</b><br></center></u><br>The petitioners submit that the CA mistakenly relied on their board resolution to conclude that the parties agreed to a 4% monthly interest because the board resolution was not an evidence of a loan or forbearance of money, but merely an authorization for Pantaleon to perform certain acts, including the power to enter into a contract of loan. The expressed mandate of Article 1956 of the Civil Code is that interest due should be stipulated in writing, and no such stipulation exists. Even assuming that the loan is subject to 4% monthly interest, the interest covers the six (6)-month period only and cannot be interpreted to apply beyond it. The petitioners also point out the glaring inconsistency in the CA Decision, which reduced the interest from 4% per month or 48% per annum to 12% per annum, but failed to consider that the amount of P3,526,117.00  that the RTC ordered them to pay includes the compounded  4% monthly interest.<br><br><u><center><b>THE CASE FOR THE RESPONDENT</b><br></center></u><br>The respondent counters that the CA correctly ruled that the loan is subject to a 4% monthly interest because the board resolution is attached to, and an integral part of, the promissory note based on which the petitioners obtained the loan. The respondent further contends that the petitioners are estopped from assailing the 4% monthly interest, since they agreed to pay the 4% monthly interest on the principal amount under the promissory note and the board resolution.<br><br><center><u><b>THE ISSUE</b></u><br></center><br>The core issue boils down to whether the parties agreed to the 4% monthly interest on the loan. If so, does the rate of interest apply to the 6-month payment period only or until full payment of the loan?<br><br><u><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center></u><br><b><i> We find the petition meritorious.</i></b><br><br><b><i>Interest due should be<br> stipulated in writing; <br>otherwise, 12% per annum</i></b><br><br>Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations governs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In such cases, courts have no authority to alter the contract by construction or to make a new contract for the parties; a court's duty is confined to the interpretation of the contract the parties made for themselves without regard to its wisdom or folly, as the court cannot supply material stipulations or read into the contract words the contract does not contain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is only when the contract is vague and ambiguous that courts are permitted to resort to the interpretation of its terms to determine the parties' intent.<br><br>In the present case, the respondent issued a check for P1,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In turn, Pantaleon, in his personal capacity and as authorized by the Board, executed the promissory note quoted above.  Thus, the P1,000,000.00 loan shall be payable within six (6) months, or from January 8, 1994 up to June 8, 1994.  During this period, the loan shall earn an interest of P40,000.00 per month, for a total obligation of P1,240,000.00 for the six-month period. <b>We note that this agreed sum can be computed at 4% interest per month, but no such rate of interest was stipulated in the promissory note; rather a <i>fixed sum equivalent to this rate</i> was agreed upon.</b><br><br>Article 1956 of the Civil Code specifically mandates that "no interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing." Under this provision, the payment of interest in loans or forbearance of money is allowed only if: (1) there was an express stipulation for the payment of interest; and (2) the agreement for the payment of interest was reduced in writing. The concurrence of the two conditions is required for the payment of interest at a stipulated rate. Thus, we held in <i>Tan v. Valdehueza</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and <i>Ching v. Nicdao</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that collection of interest without any stipulation in writing is prohibited by law.<br><br>Applying this provision, we find that the interest of P40,000.00 per month corresponds only to the six (6)-month period of the loan, or from January 8, 1994 to June 8, 1994, as agreed upon by the parties in the promissory note. Thereafter, the interest on the loan should be at the legal interest rate of 12%<i> per</i> <i>annum</i>, consistent with our ruling in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. <b>In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default</b>, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code." (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>We reiterated this ruling in <i>Security Bank and Trust Co. v. RTC-Makati</i>, <i>Br. 61</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>Sulit v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i>Crismina Garments, Inc. v.

Lorenzo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  Thus, the RTC and the CA misappreciated the facts of the case; they erred in finding that the parties agreed to a 4% interest, compounded by the application of this interest beyond the promissory note's six (6)-month period. The facts show that the parties agreed to the payment of a <b><i>specific sum of money </i></b>of P40,000.00 per month for six months, not to a 4% rate of interest payable within a six (6)-month period.<br><br><b><i>Medel v. Court of Appeals not<br> applicable</i></b><br><br>The CA misapplied <i>Medel v. Court of Appeals</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup> in finding that a 4% interest per month was unconscionable.<br><br>In <i>Medel</i>, the debtors in a  P500,000.00 loan were  required to pay an interest of 5.5% per month,  a service charge of 2% per annum, and a penalty charge of 1% per month, plus attorney's fee equivalent to 25% of the amount due, until the loan is fully paid. Taken in conjunction with the stipulated service charge and penalty, we found the interest rate of 5.5% to be excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable, exorbitant and hence, contrary to morals, thereby rendering the stipulation null and void.<br><br>Applying <i>Medel, </i>we invalidated and reduced the stipulated interest in <i>Spouses Solangon v. Salazar</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35] </sup> of 6% per month or 72% per annum interest on a P60,000.00 loan; in <i>Ruiz v.

Quiño,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38] </sup> of 7% interest per month or 84% per annum interest on a P15,000.00 loan; in <i>Bulos, Jr. v. Yasuma,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39] </sup> of 4% per month or 48% per annum interest on a P2,500,000.00 loan; and in <i>Chua v. Timan</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40] </sup> of 7% and 5% per month for loans totalling P964,000.00. We note that in all these cases, the terms of the loans were open-ended; the stipulated interest rates were applied for an indefinite period.<br><br><i>Medel</i> finds no application in the present case where no other stipulation exists for the payment of any extra amount except a <b><i>specific sum of </i>P40,000.00 per month</b> on the principal of a loan payable within six months. Additionally, no issue on the excessiveness of the stipulated amount of P40,000.00 per month was ever put in issue by the petitioners;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> they only assailed the application of a 4% interest rate, since it was not agreed upon.<br><br>It is a familiar doctrine in obligations and contracts that the parties are bound by the stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions they have agreed to, which is the law between them, the only limitation being that these stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions are not contrary to law, morals, public order or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The payment of the <b><i>specific sum of money</i></b> of P40,000.00 per month was voluntarily agreed upon by the petitioners and the respondent. There is nothing from the records and, in fact, there is no allegation showing that petitioners were victims of fraud when they entered into the agreement with the respondent.<br><br>Therefore, as agreed by the parties, the loan of P1,000,000.00 shall earn P40,000.00 per month for a period of six (6) months, or from December 8, 1993 to June 8, 1994, for a total principal and interest amount of P1,240,000.00. Thereafter, interest at the rate of 12% per annum shall apply. The amounts already paid by the petitioners during the pendency of the suit, amounting to P1,228,772.00 as of February <b>12</b>, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> should be deducted from the total amount due, computed as indicated above. We remand the case to the trial court for the actual computation of the total amount due.<br><br><b><i>Doctrine of Estoppel not applicable</i></b><br><br>The respondent submits that the petitioners are estopped from disputing the 4% monthly interest beyond the six-month stipulated period, since they agreed to pay this interest on the principal amount under the promissory note and the board resolution.<br><br>We disagree with the respondent's contention.<br><br>We cannot apply the doctrine of estoppel in the present case since the facts and circumstances, as established by the record, negate its application. Under the promissory note,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> what the petitioners agreed to was the payment of a <b><i>specific sum of </i>P40,000.00 per month for six months - <i>not a 4% rate of interest per month</i></b><i> <b>for six (6) months</b></i><b> - on a loan whose principal is P1,000,000.00, for the total amount of P1,240,000.00</b>.  Thus, no reason exists to place the petitioners in estoppel, barring them from raising their present defenses against a 4% per month interest after the six-month period of the agreement.  The board resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> on the other hand, simply authorizes Pantaleon to contract for a loan with a monthly interest of not more than 4%.  This resolution merely embodies the extent of Pantaleon's authority to contract and does not create any right or obligation except as between Pantaleon and the board. Again, no cause exists to place the petitioners in estoppel.<br><br><b><i>Piercing the corporate veil unfounded</i></b><br><br>We find it unfounded and unwarranted for the lower courts to pierce the corporate veil of PRISMA.<br><br>The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil applies only in three (3) basic instances, namely: a) when the separate and distinct corporate personality defeats public convenience, as when the corporate fiction is used as a vehicle for the evasion of an existing obligation; b) in fraud cases, or when the corporate entity is used to justify a wrong, protect a fraud, or defend a crime; or c) is used in <i>alter ego</i> cases, <i>i.e., </i>where a corporation is essentially a farce, since it is a mere alter ego or business conduit of a person, or where the corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of another corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  In the absence of malice, bad faith, or a specific provision of law making a corporate officer liable, such corporate officer cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the present case, we see no competent and convincing evidence of any wrongful, fraudulent or unlawful act on the part of PRISMA to justify piercing its corporate veil.  While Pantaleon denied personal liability in his Answer, he made himself accountable in the promissory note "<i>in his personal capacity and as authorized by the Board Resolution</i>"<sup> </sup>of PRISMA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  With this statement of personal liability and in the absence of any representation on the part of PRISMA that the obligation is all its own because of its separate corporate identity, we see no occasion to consider piercing the corporate veil as material to the case.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE</b>, in light of all the foregoing, we hereby <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> the Decision dated May 5, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 69627. The petitioners' loan of P1,000,000.00 shall bear interest of P40,000.00 per month for six (6) months from December 8, 1993 as indicated in the promissory note. Any portion of this loan, unpaid as of the end of the six-month payment period, shall thereafter bear interest at 12% <i>per annum.</i> The total amount due and unpaid, including accrued interests, shall bear interest at 12% <i>per annum</i> from the finality of this Decision.
