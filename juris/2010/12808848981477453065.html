This was a part of Lot No. 1306 originally owned and possessed by Andres as identified and described in the Declaration of Real Property No. 7187.<br><br>On March 10, 2004, the trial court rendered a Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, as follows:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Ordering the defendants to return to the plaintiffs the disputed portion consisting of 447 square meters and now covered by TCT No. T-112864 of the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan, in the name of Jose Mano, Jr. married to Rosanna Reyes;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Ordering defendants to immediately demolish and/or remove the concrete fence erected on the premises;<br><br>3.&nbsp; Ordering the defendants to pay plaintiffs the amounts of P50,000.00 for moral damages; P30,000.00 for exemplary damages and P50,000.00 for attorney's fees;<br><br>4.&nbsp; Ordering the Register of Deeds of Bulacan to cancel said TCT No. T-112864 of the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan;<br><br>5.&nbsp; Defendants to pay costs of this suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals </i></b><br><br>Respondents went to the CA on appeal.&nbsp; In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated January 16, 2006, the CA reversed and set aside the ruling of the RTC and dismissed the complaint. According to the CA, respondents satisfactorily proved their ownership over the disputed property.&nbsp; The Free Patent No. 031418-92-463 and the TCT No. T-112864, as well as the tax declaration offered in evidence by respondents are more convincing than the evidence presented by the petitioners.&nbsp; Also, petitioners failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence the fact of fraud allegedly committed by Jose in obtaining title to the disputed property.<br><br>The Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioners was denied by the CA through its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated May 3, 2006.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Hence, this petition raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>Whether the CA gravely abused its discretion when it declared that petitioners were unable to prove ownership of the disputed portion notwithstanding evidence introduced and admitted.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>Whether the CA gravely abused its discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, when it reversed the decision of the lower court finding fraud committed by the respondent in obtaining title to the property in question.</blockquote><br>Simply put, the issues raised are: (1) Did the CA err in holding that the respondents are the owners of the disputed 447 square meter property? and (2) Did the CA err in finding that no fraud was committed by the respondents in obtaining title to the disputed property?<br><br><b><i>Petitioners' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioners argue that the CA erred in not holding that they are the rightful owners as Federico inherited the property from his father Andres, who died on October 10, 1959.&nbsp; Jose purchased a parcel of land from Feliciano measuring only 2,056 square meters but his application for free patent indicated a lot with a total area of 2,739 square meters. Moreover, he indicated the same to be located at Dampol II, Pulilan, Bulacan; however, it is actually located at Dampol 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; He also declared that the said property is not claimed or occupied by any person but the truth is that the 447 square meters is owned and possessed by Federico.<br><br><b><i>Respondents' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, contend that they have a better title to the property.&nbsp; The certificate of title issued in their name is an absolute and indefeasible evidence of ownership of the property.&nbsp; It is binding and conclusive upon the whole world.&nbsp; There was also no proof or evidence presented to support the alleged fraud on the part of Jose, nor was there any allegation of specific acts committed by him which constitute fraud.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>After serious consideration, we find petitioners' arguments to be meritorious.<br><br><i>There is preponderance of evidence that <br>Federico is the owner of the disputed<br> property.</i><br><br>We rule that Federico is the owner of the disputed 447 square meter lot.&nbsp; The Deed of Conditional Sale described the property purchased by Jose as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A part of parcel of land (T.D. No. 14312) situated at Dampol 1<sup>st</sup>, Pulilan, Bulacan. Bounded on the North- Lot 6225; East- Lot 1306 &amp; 1311; South- Lot 1307 and 1308 and West- Lot 1304 &amp; 1299. <i>Containing an area of Two Thousand Fifty Six (2,056) square meters, more or less</i>. (Bulacan)."<br></blockquote><br>Feliciano sold a portion of Lot 1305 to Jose. After the sale was made, a Sketch/Special Plan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> was prepared by Geodetic Engineer Fortunato E. Chavez.&nbsp; It is clear from such document that Lot 1305-A representing the upper portion with an area of 1,112 square meters was retained by Feliciano and what was sold was the lower portion thereof which became Lot No. 1305-B with a total area of 2,292 square meters.&nbsp; This exceeds the area of 2,056 square meters indicated in the above sale transaction.<br><br>In another Sketch/Special Plan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> prepared by Geodetic Engineer Norberto C. Chavez, it is shown that Lot No. 10176-B with an area of 2,292 square meters with a right of way going to Camino Provincial Highway was the one sold to Jose and which was also sold by him to the Balingcongan spouses.&nbsp; This is also known as Lot No. 1305-B.&nbsp; TCT No. T-112865 was issued in the name of the spouses Balingcongan. Lot No. 10175 which represents the upper portion of Lot No. 1305 was retained by Feliciano.&nbsp; This is also known as Lot No. 1305-A.&nbsp; However, what is surprising is that the said plan showed that Lot No. 10176-A with an area of 447 square meters had been made to appear as part of the lot sold by Feliciano to Jose.&nbsp; TCT No. T-112864 was issued in the name of Jose.&nbsp; If indeed this disputed area is part of Lot No. 1305 then it should have been part of Lot No. 1305-A which was retained by Feliciano as it is at the East side of the said property.<br><br>Moreover, during the ocular inspection,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> it was observed that all the neighboring lots are either square or rectangle.&nbsp; There is an old fence, measuring about 40 meters long (abutting the newly constructed fence), which bounds the true and actual area purchased by Jose.&nbsp; Thus, if the old fence is followed, the land purchased would either be square or rectangular like the adjoining lots.&nbsp; However, if the disputed 447 square meters would be included in the land purchased by Jose, the same would slant remarkably to the right, to the extent of covering the entire area fronting the provincial road, which as per tax declaration of Federico, is the boundary of his land on the north.<br><br>Furthermore, Feliciano, the owner of Lot No. 1305 from whom Jose acquired the property through sale, testified that his lot is only about 2,000 square meters and that Andres owns the adjoining lot which is enclosed by a fence.&nbsp; Part of his testimony is copied verbatim to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

Also, in his application, he stated that the land described and applied for is not claimed or occupied by any person when in reality the same is owned and possessed by Federico.<br><br><i>Petitioners are entitled to an award <br>of moral and exemplary damages.</i><br><br>&nbsp;Article 2217<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Civil Code defines what are included in moral damages while Article 2219 enumerates the cases where they may be recovered.&nbsp; Moral damages are in the category of an award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered and not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> "The person claiming moral damages must prove the existence of bad faith by clear and convincing evidence for the law always presumes good faith.&nbsp; It is not enough that one merely suffered sleepless nights, mental anguish, serious anxiety as the result of the actuations of the other party.
