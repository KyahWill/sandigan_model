The CA likewise affirmed appellant's conviction for four counts of Estafa.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, the Court modifies the penalties imposed by the trial court, <i>viz:</i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 95-143311, the amount involved is P30,000.00 ([appellant] having returned to complainant Dominador Ilacin the amount of P10,000.00).

The minimum term of the indeterminate sentence should be four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i> and the maximum term should at least be eight (8) years of <i>prision mayor </i>plus a period of one (1) year [one (1) year for each additional P10,000.00] or a total maximum period of nine (9) years of <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 95-143315, the amount involved is P39,000.00 ([appellant] having returned to complainant Vivencio Martinez the amount of P16,000.00).  The minimum term of the indeterminate sentence should be four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional </i>and the maximum term should be at least eight (8) years of <i>prision mayor</i> plus a period of one (1) year [one (1) year for each additional P10,000.00] for a total maximum period of nine (9) years of <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 95-143317, the amount involved is P29,000.00 ([appellant] having returned to complainant Arnulfo Suyat the amount of P16,000.00). The minimum term of the indeterminate sentence should be four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional </i>and the maximum term should be eight (8) [years] of <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 95-143318, large scale illegal recruitment is punishable with life imprisonment and a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (<i>Article 39, Labor Code).</i><br><br>The amount of actual damages awarded to the three complainants is modified there being partial payments made by the appellant, viz:<br><blockquote>1)  Dominador Ilacin  - P30,000.00<br>2)  Vivencio Martinez  - P39,000.00<br>3)  Arnulfo Suyat  - P29,000.00</blockquote><br>WHEREFORE, considering that the imposable penalty in Criminal Case No. 95-143318 (Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale) is life imprisonment consistent with Section 13, paragraph (b), Rule 124 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, the Court hereby certifies this case and elevates the entire records to the Honorable Supreme Court for the mandated review.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal filed by appellant raising the following assignment of errors:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Issues</b><br></div><br><center><b>I.</b><br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED PALPABLE ERROR IN NOT FINDING [THAT] THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE [APPELLANT].<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED [THE CASE] IN A WAY PROBABLY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Appellant's Arguments</i></b><br><br>As regards the crime of Illegal Recruitment in large scale, appellant maintains that she could not be convicted of the same because she merely assisted complainants in their applications with the recruitment agency.  She likewise insists that she turned over the amounts she received from the complainants to JH Imperial Organization Placement Corp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Appellant insists that the courts below erred in finding her guilty of the crime of Estafa because there is no proof that she falsely represented to have the capacity to send complainants as factory workers in South Korea.  She also avers that there is no evidence presented to show that she personally undertook to deploy complainants for work abroad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b><i>Appellee's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Appellee  argues  that  the  trial court and  the  CA correctly convicted appellant of the crime of Illegal Recruitment in large scale.  There is proof beyond reasonable doubt that she impressed upon the complainants that she had the authority to deploy them for employment abroad.  She even received money from the complainants and issued corresponding receipts.  There was also proof that she was not a licensee or holder of authority to deploy workers abroad.  In fact, her admission that she merely "referred" the complainants to JH Imperial Organization Placement Corp. was already an act of recruitment under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code.  Appellee also argues that all the elements of Estafa were satisfactorily proven by the prosecution.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>Article 13(b) of the Labor Code defines "recruitment and placement" <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>(b)  "Recruitment and placement" refers to any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not:  <i>Provided, </i>That any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement.<br></blockquote><br>In this case, all the four complainants unanimously declared that appellant offered and promised them employment abroad. They also testified that they gave various amounts to appellant as payment for placement and processing fees. Notwithstanding said promises and payments, they were not able to leave for abroad to work.  These testimonies, as well as the documentary evidence they submitted consisting of the receipts issued them by the appellant, all prove that the latter was engaged in recruitment and placement activities.<br><br>Even conceding that appellant merely referred the complainants to JH Imperial Organization Placement Corp., the same still constituted an act of recruitment.  As explicitly enumerated in Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, "recruitment and placement" includes the act of making referrals, whether for profit or not. Thus, the CA correctly held that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Even if [appellant] did no more that "suggest" to complainants where they could apply for overseas employment, her act constituted "referral" within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Labor Code (<i>People v. Ong, 322 SCRA 38</i>).  Referral is the act of passing along or forwarding of an applicant for employment after an initial interview of a selected applicant for employment to a selected employer, placement officer or bureau. (<i>People v. Goce, 247 SCRA 780</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>Having already established that appellant was engaged in "recruitment and placement," the issue that must be resolved next is whether such activities may be considered illegal and whether the acts were committed in large scale.<br><br>Article 38 of the Labor Code defines "illegal recruitment" as:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 38.  <i>ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT. </i>- (a) Any recruitment activities, including the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, to be undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> shall be deemed illegal and punishable under Article 39 of this Code.  x x x<br><br>(b)  Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage and shall be penalized in accordance with Article 39 hereof.<br><br>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring and/or confederating with one another in carrying out any unlawful or illegal transaction, enterprise or scheme defined under the first paragraph hereof. Illegal recruitment is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group.</blockquote><br>In the instant case, the prosecution satisfactorily established that appellant was not a licensee or holder of authority to deploy workers abroad.  By this fact alone, she is deemed to have engaged in illegal recruitment and the same was committed in large scale because it was carried out against the four complainants.<br><br>The fact that JH Imperial Organization Placement Corp. was a holder of a valid license to deploy workers abroad did not serve to benefit herein appellant.  There was no evidence at all that said recruitment agency authorized herein appellant to act as its agent.  As aptly noted by the appellate court:<br><br><blockquote>From the testimonies of the complainants, it is clearly shown that [appellant] did more than just make referrals.  It was [appellant] whom they approached regarding their plans of working overseas.  It was [appellant] who collected the fees and receipts [therefor] were issued in her name. It was x x x [appellant] from whom they learned what papers or documents to submit.  Despite the denial, [appellant], nevertheless, failed to explain why recruitment activities were done in her residence.  Likewise, she failed to present Milagros Lopez, one of the staff of Imperial, to whom she allegedly turned over the money she collected from the complainants or any officer from the recruitment agency to prove that she was merely a conduit thereof. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>The three elements of the crime of illegal recruitment, to wit: a) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; b) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the said Code (now Section 6 of RA 8042); and c) the offender committed the same against three or more persons, individually or as a group,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> are present in the instant case. Consequently, we rule that the trial court and the CA correctly found appellant guilty of Illegal Recruitment in large scale.<br><br>In the instant case, the applicable law at the time of the commission of the crime of Illegal Recruitment in large scale was Article 39 of the Labor Code. Under said law, the imposable penalty is life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00.  The CA therefore correctly imposed upon herein appellant the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 95-143318.<br><br>We also affirm the findings of the trial court and the CA that appellant is guilty of four counts of Estafa, the elements of which are: a) the accused defrauded another by abuse of confidence or by means of deceit; and b) the offended party suffered damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  In the instant case, we agree with the observations of the CA that:<br><br><blockquote>In this case, [appellant] misrepresented herself to the complainants as one who can make arrangements for job placements in South Korea as factory workers.  By reason of her misrepresentations, false assurances, and deceit, complainants were induced to part with their money.  The recruits waited for at least a year, only to realize that they were hoodwinked, as no jobs were waiting for them abroad.<br><br>Criminal liability for estafa already committed is not affected by the fact that [appellant] returned a portion of their money.  Compromise or novation of contract pertains and affects only the civil aspect of the case.  <i>Estafa</i> is a public offense that must be prosecuted and punished by the Court in its motion even though complete reparation should have been made of the damage suffered by the offended party. x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>Anent the penalties for the four counts of Estafa, we held in <i>People v. Temporada</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>The prescribed penalty for <i>estafa</i> under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the RPC, when the amount defrauded exceeds P22,000.00, is <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum.  The minimum term is taken from the penalty next lower or anywhere within <i>prision correccional</i> minimum and medium (<i>i.e., </i>from 6 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months).  Consequently, the RTC correctly fixed the minimum term for the five <i>estafa</i> cases at 4 years and 2 months of <i>prision correccional </i>since this is within the range of <i>prision correccional</i> minimum and medium.<br><br>On the other hand, the maximum term is taken from the prescribed penalty of <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum in its maximum period, adding 1 year of imprisonment for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000,00, provided that the total penalty shall not exceed 20 years. However, the maximum period of the prescribed penalty of <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum is not <i>prision mayor </i>minimum as apparently assumed by the RTC.  To compute the maximum period of the prescribed penalty, <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum should be divided into three equal portions of time each of which portion shall be deemed to form one period in accordance with Article 65 of the RPC.  Following this procedure, the maximum period of <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum is from 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years. The incremental penalty, when proper, shall thus be added to anywhere from 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years, at the discretion of the court.<br><br>In computing the incremental penalty, the amount defrauded shall be subtracted by P22,000.00, and the difference shall be divided by P10,000.00.  Any fraction of a year shall be discarded as was done starting with the case of <i>People v. Pabalan</i> in consonance with the settled rule that penal laws shall be construed liberally in favor of the accused. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Following the aforementioned procedure, we find that the penalties imposed by the appellate court are proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the December 11, 2002 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
