				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief Background</b><br></div><br>On June 30, 1991 Estrellita Vizconde and her daughters Carmela, nineteen years old, and Jennifer, seven, were brutally slain at their home in Parañaque City.&nbsp; Following an intense investigation, the police arrested a group of suspects, some of whom gave detailed confessions.&nbsp; But the trial court smelled a frame-up and eventually ordered them discharged.&nbsp; Thus, the identities of the real perpetrators remained a mystery especially to the public whose interests were aroused by the gripping details of what everybody referred to as the Vizconde massacre.<br><br>Four years later in 1995, the National Bureau of Investigation or NBI announced that it had solved the crime.&nbsp; It presented star-witness Jessica M. Alfaro, one of its informers, who claimed that she witnessed the crime.&nbsp; She pointed to accused Hubert Jeffrey P. Webb, Antonio "Tony Boy" Lejano, Artemio "Dong" Ventura, Michael A. Gatchalian, Hospicio "Pyke" Fernandez, Peter Estrada, Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez, and Joey Filart as the culprits.&nbsp; She also tagged accused police officer, Gerardo Biong, as an accessory after the fact.&nbsp; Relying primarily on Alfaro's testimony, on August 10, 1995 the public prosecutors filed an information for rape with homicide against Webb, <i>et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court of Parañaque City, Branch 274, presided over by Judge Amelita G. Tolentino, tried only seven of the accused since Artemio Ventura and Joey Filart remained at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The prosecution presented Alfaro as its main witness with the others corroborating her testimony.&nbsp; These included the medico-legal officer who autopsied the bodies of the victims, the security guards of Pitong Daan Subdivision, the former laundrywoman of the Webb's household, police officer Biong's former girlfriend, and Lauro G. Vizconde, Estrellita's husband.<br><br>For their part, some of the accused testified, denying any part in the crime and saying they were elsewhere when it took place.&nbsp; Webb's alibi appeared the strongest since he claimed that he was then across the ocean in the United States of America.&nbsp; He presented the testimonies of witnesses as well as documentary and object evidence to prove this.&nbsp; In addition, the defense presented witnesses to show Alfaro's bad reputation for truth and the incredible nature of her testimony.<br><br>But impressed by Alfaro's detailed narration of the crime and the events surrounding it, the trial court found a credible witness in her.&nbsp; It noted her categorical, straightforward, spontaneous, and frank testimony, undamaged by grueling cross-examinations.&nbsp; The trial court remained unfazed by significant discrepancies between Alfaro's April 28 and May 22, 1995 affidavits, accepting her explanation that she at first wanted to protect her former boyfriend, accused Estrada, and a relative, accused Gatchalian; that no lawyer assisted her; that she did not trust the investigators who helped her prepare her first affidavit; and that she felt unsure if she would get the support and security she needed once she disclosed all about the Vizconde killings.<br><br>In contrast, the trial court thought little of the denials and alibis that Webb, Lejano, Rodriguez, and Gatchalian set up for their defense.&nbsp; They paled, according to the court, compared to Alfaro's testimony that other witnesses and the physical evidence corroborated. Thus, on January 4, 2000, after four years of arduous hearings, the trial court rendered judgment, finding all the accused guilty as charged and imposing on Webb, Lejano, Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, and Rodriguez the penalty of reclusion perpetua and on Biong, an indeterminate prison term of eleven years, four months, and one day to twelve years.&nbsp; The trial court also awarded damages to Lauro Vizconde.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision, modifying the penalty imposed on Biong to six years minimum and twelve years maximum and increasing the award of damages to Lauro Vizconde.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court did not agree that the accused were tried by publicity or that the trial judge was biased.&nbsp; It found sufficient evidence of conspiracy that rendered Rodriguez, Gatchalian, Fernandez, and Estrada equally guilty with those who had a part in raping and killing Carmela and in executing her mother and sister.<br><br>On motion for reconsideration by the accused, the Court of Appeals' Special Division of five members voted three against two to deny the motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> hence, the present appeal.<br><br>On April 20, 2010, as a result of its initial deliberation in this case, the Court issued a Resolution granting the request of Webb to submit for DNA analysis the semen specimen taken from Carmela's cadaver, which specimen was then believed still under the safekeeping of the NBI.&nbsp; The Court granted the request pursuant to section 4 of the Rule on DNA Evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to give the accused and the prosecution access to scientific evidence that they might want to avail themselves of, leading to a correct decision in the case.<br><br>Unfortunately, on April 27, 2010 the NBI informed the Court that it no longer has custody of the specimen, the same having been turned over to the trial court. The trial record shows, however, that the specimen was not among the object evidence that the prosecution offered in evidence in the case.<br><br>This outcome prompted accused Webb to file an urgent motion to acquit on the ground that the government's failure to preserve such vital evidence has resulted in the denial of his right to due process.<br><br><center><u><b>Issues Presented</b></u><br></center><br>Accused Webb's motion to acquit presents a threshold issue: whether or not the Court should acquit him outright, given the government's failure to produce the semen specimen that the NBI found on Carmela's cadaver, thus depriving him of evidence that would prove his innocence.<br><br>In the main, all the accused raise the central issue of whether or not Webb, acting in conspiracy with Lejano, Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, Rodriguez, Ventura, and Filart, raped and killed Carmela and put to death her mother and sister.&nbsp; But, ultimately, the controlling issues are:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not Alfaro's testimony as eyewitness, describing the crime and identifying Webb, Lejano, Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, Rodriguez, and two others as the persons who committed it, is entitled to belief; and<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not Webb presented sufficient evidence to prove his alibi and rebut Alfaro's testimony that he led the others in committing the crime.<br><br>The issue respecting accused Biong is whether or not he acted to cover up the crime after its commission.<br><br><center><u><b>The Right to Acquittal</b><br><b>Due to Loss of DNA Evidence</b></u><br></center><br>Webb claims, citing <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> that he is entitled to outright acquittal on the ground of violation of his right to due process given the State's failure to produce on order of the Court either by negligence or willful suppression the semen specimen taken from Carmela.<br><br>The medical evidence clearly established that Carmela was raped and, consistent with this, semen specimen was found in her.&nbsp; It is true that Alfaro identified Webb in her testimony as Carmela's rapist and killer but serious questions had been raised about her credibility.&nbsp; At the very least, there exists a possibility that Alfaro had lied.&nbsp; On the other hand, the semen specimen taken from Carmela cannot possibly lie.&nbsp; It cannot be coached or allured by a promise of reward or financial support.&nbsp; No two persons have the same DNA fingerprint, with the exception of identical twins.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; If, on examination, the DNA of the subject specimen does not belong to Webb, then he did not rape Carmela.&nbsp; It is that simple.&nbsp; Thus, the Court would have been able to determine that Alfaro committed perjury in saying that he did.<br><br>Still, Webb is not entitled to acquittal for the failure of the State to produce the semen specimen at this late stage.&nbsp; For one thing, the ruling in <i>Brady v. Maryland</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> that he cites has long be overtaken by the decision in <i>Arizona v. Youngblood</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; where the U.S. Supreme Court held that due process does not require the State to preserve the semen specimen although it might be useful to the accused unless the latter is able to show bad faith on the part of the prosecution or the police. Here, the State presented a medical expert who testified on the existence of the specimen and Webb in fact sought to have the same subjected to DNA test.<br><br>For, another, when Webb raised the DNA issue, the rule governing DNA evidence did not yet exist, the country did not yet have the technology for conducting the test, and no Philippine precedent had as yet recognized its admissibility as evidence.&nbsp; Consequently, the idea of keeping the specimen secure even after the trial court rejected the motion for DNA testing did not come up.&nbsp; Indeed, neither Webb nor his co-accused brought up the matter of preserving the specimen in the meantime.<br><br>Parenthetically, after the trial court denied Webb's application for DNA testing, he allowed the proceeding to move on when he had on at least two occasions gone up to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to challenge alleged arbitrary actions taken against him and the other accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255,="" 0,="" 0);=""><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]&nbsp;</sup> They raised the DNA issue before the Court of Appeals but merely as an error committed by the trial court in rendering its decision in the case.&nbsp; None of the accused filed a motion with the appeals court to have the DNA test done pending adjudication of their appeal.&nbsp; This, even when the Supreme Court had in the meantime passed the rules allowing such test.&nbsp; Considering the accused's lack of interest in having such test done, the State cannot be deemed put on reasonable notice that it would be required to produce the semen specimen at some future time.<br><br>Now, to the merit of the case.<br><br><u><center><b>Alfaro's Story</b><br></center></u><br>Based on the prosecution's version, culled from the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals, on June 29, 1991 at around 8:30 in the evening, Jessica Alfaro drove her Mitsubishi Lancer, with boyfriend Peter Estrada as passenger, to the Ayala Alabang Commercial Center parking lot to buy <i>shabu </i>from Artemio "Dong" Ventura.&nbsp; There, Ventura introduced her to his friends: Hubert Jeffrey P. Webb, Antonio "Tony Boy" Lejano, Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez, Hospicio "Pyke" Fernandez, Michael Gatchalian, and Joey Filart.&nbsp; Alfaro recalled frequently seeing them at a <i>shabu</i> house in Parañaque in January 1991, except Ventura whom she had known earlier in December 1990.<br><br>As Alfaro smoked her shabu, Webb approached and requested her to relay a message for him to a girl, whom she later identified as Carmela Vizconde. Alfaro agreed.&nbsp; After using up their shabu, the group drove to Carmela's house at 80 Vinzons Street, Pitong Daan Subdivision, BF Homes, Parañaque City.&nbsp; Riding in her car, Alfaro and Estrada trailed Filart and Rodriguez who rode a Mazda pick-up and Webb, Lejano, Ventura, Fernandez, and Gatchalian who were on a Nissan Patrol car.<br><br>On reaching their destination, Alfaro parked her car on Vinzons Street, alighted, and approached Carmela's house. Alfaro pressed the buzzer and a woman came out.&nbsp; Alfaro queried her about Carmela.&nbsp; Alfaro had met Carmela twice before in January 1991.&nbsp; When Carmela came out, Alfaro gave her Webb's message that he was just around.&nbsp; Carmela replied, however, that she could not go out yet since she had just arrived home. She told Alfaro to return after twenty minutes.&nbsp; Alfaro relayed this to Webb who then told the group to drive back to the Ayala Alabang Commercial Center.<br><br>The group had another <i>shabu</i> session at the parking lot.&nbsp; After sometime, they drove back but only Alfaro proceeded to Vinzons Street where Carmela lived.&nbsp; The Nissan Patrol and the Mazda pick-up, with their passengers, parked somewhere along Aguirre Avenue.&nbsp; Carmela was at their garden.&nbsp; She approached Alfaro on seeing her and told the latter that she (Carmela) had to leave the house for a while.&nbsp; Carmela requested Alfaro to return before midnight and she would leave the pedestrian gate, the iron grills that led to the kitchen, and the kitchen door unlocked. Carmela also told Alfaro to blink her car's headlights twice when she approached the pedestrian gate so Carmela would know that she had arrived.<br><br>Alfaro returned to her car but waited for Carmela to drive out of the house in her own car.&nbsp; Alfaro trailed Carmela up to Aguirre Avenue where she dropped off a man whom Alfaro believed was Carmela's boyfriend.&nbsp; Alfaro looked for her group, found them, and relayed Carmela's instructions to Webb.&nbsp; They then all went back to the Ayala Alabang Commercial Center.&nbsp; At the parking lot, Alfaro told the group about her talk with Carmela.&nbsp; When she told Webb of Carmela's male companion, Webb's mood changed for the rest of the evening (<i>"bad trip"</i>).<br><br>Webb gave out free cocaine.&nbsp; They all used it and some <i>shabu</i>, too.&nbsp; After about 40 to 45 minutes, Webb decided that it was time for them to leave.&nbsp; He said, <i>"Pipilahan natin siya </i>[Carmela] <i>at ako ang mauuna." </i>Lejano said, <i>"Ako ang susunod" </i>and the others responded <i>"Okay, okay."</i>&nbsp; They all left the parking lot in a convoy of three vehicles and drove into Pitong Daan Subdivision for the third time.&nbsp; They arrived at Carmela's house shortly before midnight.<br><br>Alfaro parked her car between Vizconde's house and the next.&nbsp; While waiting for the others to alight from their cars, Fernandez approached Alfaro with a suggestion that they blow up the transformer near the Vizconde's residence to cause a brownout (<i>"Pasabugin kaya natin ang transformer na ito").&nbsp; </i>But Alfaro shrugged off the idea, telling Fernandez, <i>"Malakas lang ang tama mo." </i> When Webb, Lejano, and Ventura were already before the house, Webb told the others again that they would line up for Carmela but he would be the first.&nbsp; The others replied, <i>"O sige, dito lang kami, magbabantay lang kami."</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Alfaro was the first to pass through the pedestrian gate that had been left open. Webb, Lejano, and Ventura followed her.&nbsp; On entering the garage, Ventura using a chair mounted the hood of the Vizcondes' Nissan Sentra and loosened the electric bulb over it (<i>"para daw walang ilaw").&nbsp; </i>The small group went through the open iron grill gate and passed the dirty kitchen. Carmela opened the aluminum screen door of the kitchen for them.&nbsp; She and Webb looked each other in the eyes for a moment and, together, headed for the dining area.<br><br>As she lost sight of Carmela and Webb, Alfaro decided to go out.&nbsp; Lejano asked her where she was going and she replied that she was going out to smoke.&nbsp; As she eased her way out through the kitchen door, she saw Ventura pulling out a kitchen drawer.&nbsp; Alfaro smoked a cigarette at the garden.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes, she was surprised to hear a woman's voice ask, <i>"Sino yan?" </i> Alfaro immediately walked out of the garden to her car.&nbsp; She found her other companions milling around it.&nbsp; Estrada who sat in the car asked her, <i>"Okay ba?" </i><br><br>After sitting in the car for about ten minutes, Alfaro returned to the Vizconde house, using the same route.&nbsp; The interior of the house was dark but some light filtered in from outside.&nbsp; In the kitchen, Alfaro saw Ventura searching a lady's bag that lay on the dining table.&nbsp; When she asked him what he was looking for, he said: "<i>Ikaw na nga dito, maghanap ka ng susi."&nbsp; </i>She asked him what key he wanted and he replied: <i>"Basta maghanap ka ng susi ng main door pati na rin ng susi ng kotse."&nbsp; </i>When she found a bunch of keys in the bag, she tried them on the main door but none fitted the lock.&nbsp; She also did not find the car key.<br><br>Unable to open the main door, Alfaro returned to the kitchen.&nbsp; While she was at a spot leading to the dining area, she heard a static noise (like a television that remained on after the station had signed off).&nbsp; Out of curiosity, she approached the master's bedroom from where the noise came, opened the door a little, and peeked inside.&nbsp; The unusual sound grew even louder.&nbsp; As she walked in, she saw Webb on top of Carmela while she lay with her back on the floor.&nbsp; Two bloodied bodies lay on the bed.&nbsp; Lejano was at the foot of the bed about to wear his jacket.&nbsp; Carmela was gagged, moaning, and in tears while Webb raped her, his bare buttocks exposed.<br><br>Webb gave Alfaro a meaningful look and she immediately left the room.&nbsp; She met Ventura at the dining area.&nbsp; He told her, <i>"Prepare an escape.&nbsp; Aalis na tayo."&nbsp; </i>Shocked with what she saw, Alfaro rushed out of the house to the others who were either sitting in her car or milling on the sidewalk.&nbsp; She entered her car and turned on the engine but she did not know where to go.&nbsp; Webb, Lejano, and Ventura came out of the house just then.&nbsp; Webb suddenly picked up a stone and threw it at the main door, breaking its glass frame.<br><br>As the three men approached the pedestrian gate, Webb told Ventura that he forgot his jacket in the house. But Ventura told him that they could not get in anymore as the iron grills had already locked.&nbsp; They all rode in their cars and drove away until they reached Aguirre Avenue.&nbsp; As they got near an old hotel at the Tropical Palace area, Alfaro noticed the Nissan Patrol slow down. Someone threw something out of the car into the cogonal area.<br><br>The convoy of cars went to a large house with high walls, concrete fence, steel gate, and a long driveway at BF Executive Village.&nbsp; They entered the compound and gathered at the lawn where the "blaming session" took place.&nbsp; It was here that Alfaro and those who remained outside the Vizconde house learned of what happened.&nbsp; The first to be killed was Carmela's mother, then Jennifer, and finally, Carmella.&nbsp; Ventura blamed Webb, telling him, <i>"Bakit naman pati yung bata?"&nbsp; </i>Webb replied that the girl woke up and on seeing him molesting Carmela, she jumped on him, bit his shoulders, and pulled his hair.&nbsp; Webb got mad, grabbed the girl, pushed her to the wall, and repeatedly stabbed her.&nbsp; Lejano excused himself at this point to use the telephone in the house.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Webb called up someone on his cellular phone.<br><br>At around 2:00 in the morning, accused Gerardo Biong arrived.&nbsp; Webb ordered him to go and clean up the Vizconde house and said to him, "<i>Pera lang ang katapat nyan."&nbsp; </i>Biong answered,<i> "Okay lang."&nbsp; </i>Webb spoke to his companions and told them, "We don't know each other.&nbsp; We haven't seen each other...<i>baka maulit yan."&nbsp; </i>Alfaro and Estrada left and they drove to her father's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b>1. The quality of the witness</b><br><br>Was Alfaro an ordinary subdivision girl who showed up at the NBI after four years, bothered by her conscience or egged on by relatives or friends to come forward and do what was right?&nbsp; No. She was, at the time she revealed her story, working for the NBI as an "asset," a stool pigeon, one who earned her living by fraternizing with criminals so she could squeal on them to her NBI handlers.&nbsp; She had to live a life of lies to get rewards that would pay for her subsistence and vices.<br><br>According to Atty. Artemio Sacaguing, former head of the NBI Anti-Kidnapping, Hijacking, and Armed Robbery Task Force (AKHAR) Section, Alfaro had been hanging around at the NBI since November or December 1994 as an "asset."&nbsp; She supplied her handlers with information against drug pushers and other criminal elements.&nbsp; Some of this information led to the capture of notorious drug pushers like Christopher Cruz Santos and Orlando Bacquir.&nbsp; Alfaro's tip led to the arrest of the leader of the "Martilyo gang" that killed a police officer.&nbsp; Because of her talent, the task force gave her "very special treatment" and she became its "darling," allowed the privilege of spending nights in one of the rooms at the NBI offices.<br><br>When Alfaro seemed unproductive for sometime, however, they teased her about it and she was piqued.&nbsp; One day, she unexpectedly told Sacaguing that she knew someone who had the real story behind the Vizconde massacre.&nbsp; Sacaguing showed interest.&nbsp; Alfaro promised to bring that someone to the NBI to tell his story.&nbsp; When this did not happen and Sacaguing continued to press her, she told him that she might as well assume the role of her informant. Sacaguing testified thus:<br><br><blockquote><b><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>ATTY.

Everybody was talking about what the police found at the crime scene and there were lots of speculations about them.<br><br><u>Secondly</u>, the police had arrested some "akyat-bahay" group in Parañaque and charged them with the crime.&nbsp; The police prepared the confessions of the men they apprehended and filled these up with details that the evidence of the crime scene provided.&nbsp; Alfaro's NBI handlers who were doing their own investigation knew of these details as well.&nbsp; Since Alfaro hanged out at the NBI offices and practically lived there, it was not too difficult for her to hear of these evidentiary details and gain access to the documents.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the confessions of some members of the Barroso "akyat bahay" gang, condemned by the Makati RTC as fabricated by the police to pin the crime on them, shows how crime investigators could make a confession ring true by matching some of its details with the physical evidence at the crime scene. Consider the following:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Barroso gang members said that they got into Carmela's house by breaking the glass panel of the front door using a stone wrapped in cloth to deaden the noise.&nbsp; Alfaro could not use this line since the core of her story was that Webb was Carmela's boyfriend.&nbsp; Webb had no reason to smash her front door to get to see her.<br><br>Consequently, to explain the smashed door, Alfaro had to settle for claiming that, on the way out of the house, Webb picked up some stone and, out of the blue, hurled it at the glass-paneled front door of the Vizconde residence.&nbsp; His action really made no sense.&nbsp; From Alfaro's narration, Webb appeared rational in his decisions.&nbsp; It was past midnight, the house was dark, and they wanted to get away quickly to avoid detection.&nbsp; Hurling a stone at that glass door and causing a tremendous noise was bizarre, like inviting the neighbors to come.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">b</span>. The crime scene showed that the house had been ransacked. The rejected confessions of the Barroso "akyat-bahay" gang members said that they tried to rob the house.&nbsp; To explain this physical evidence, Alfaro claimed that at one point Ventura was pulling a kitchen drawer, and at another point, going through a handbag on the dining table.&nbsp; He said he was looking for the front-door key and the car key.<br><br>Again, this portion of Alfaro's story appears tortured to accommodate the physical evidence of the ransacked house.&nbsp; She never mentioned Ventura having taken some valuables with him when they left Carmela's house.&nbsp; And why would Ventura rummage a bag on the table for the front-door key, spilling the contents, when they had already gotten into the house.&nbsp; It is a story made to fit in with the crime scene although robbery was supposedly not the reason Webb and his companions entered that house.<br><br>c. It is the same thing with the garage light.&nbsp; The police investigators found that the bulb had been loosened to turn off the light.&nbsp; The confessions of the Barroso gang claimed that one of them climbed the parked car's hood to reach up and darken that light.&nbsp; This made sense since they were going to rob the place and they needed time to work in the dark trying to open the front door.&nbsp; Some passersby might look in and see what they were doing.<br><br>Alfaro had to adjust her testimony to take into account that darkened garage light. So she claimed that Ventura climbed the car's hood, using a chair, to turn the light off.&nbsp; But, unlike the Barroso "akyat-bahay" gang, Webb and his friends did not have anything to do in a darkened garage.&nbsp; They supposedly knew in advance that Carmela left the doors to the kitchen open for them. It did not make sense for Ventura to risk standing on the car's hood and be seen in such an awkward position instead of going straight into the house.<br><br>And, thirdly, Alfaro was the NBI's star witness, their badge of excellent investigative work.&nbsp; After claiming that they had solved the crime of the decade, the NBI people had a stake in making her sound credible and, obviously, they gave her all the preparations she needed for the job of becoming a fairly good substitute witness. She was their "darling" of an asset. And this is not pure speculation. As pointed out above, Sacaguing of the NBI, a lawyer and a ranking official, confirmed this to be a cold fact. Why the trial court and the Court of Appeals failed to see this is mystifying.<br><br>At any rate, did Alfaro at least have a fine memory for faces that had a strong effect on her, given the circumstances?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; She named Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez as one of the culprits in the Vizconde killings.&nbsp; But when the NBI found a certain Michael Rodriguez, a drug dependent from the Bicutan Rehabilitation Center, initially suspected to be Alfaro's Miguel Rodriguez and showed him to Alfaro at the NBI office, she ran berserk, slapping and kicking Michael, exclaiming: "How can I forget your face.&nbsp; We just saw each other in a disco one month ago and you told me then that you will kill me."&nbsp; As it turned out, he was not Miguel Rodriguez, the accused in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Two possibilities exist: Michael was really the one Alfaro wanted to implicate to settle some score with him but it was too late to change the name she already gave or she had myopic vision, tagging the wrong people for what they did not do.<br><br><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of the testimony</b><br><br>There is another thing about a lying witness: her story lacks sense or suffers from inherent inconsistencies.&nbsp; An understanding of the nature of things and the common behavior of people will help expose a lie.&nbsp; And it has an abundant presence in this case.<br><br><u>One</u>.&nbsp; In her desire to implicate Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, Rodriguez, and Filart, who were supposed to be Webb's co-principals in the crime, Alfaro made it a point to testify that Webb proposed twice to his friends the gang-rape of Carmela who had hurt him.&nbsp; And twice, they (including, if one believes Alfaro, her own boyfriend Estrada) agreed in a chorus to his proposal.&nbsp; But when they got to Carmela's house, only Webb, Lejano, Ventura, and Alfaro entered the house.<br><br>Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, and Rodriguez supposedly stayed around Alfaro's car, which was parked on the street between Carmela's house and the next. Some of these men sat on top of the car's lid while others milled on the sidewalk, visible under the street light to anyone who cared to watch them, particularly to the people who were having a drinking party in a nearby house.&nbsp; Obviously, the behavior of Webb's companions out on the street did not figure in a planned gang-rape of Carmela.<br><br><u>Two</u>. Ventura, Alfaro's dope supplier, introduced her for the first time in her life to Webb and his friends in a parking lot by a mall. So why would she agree to act as Webb's messenger, using her gas, to bring his message to Carmela at her home. More inexplicably, what motivated Alfaro to stick it out the whole night with Webb and his friends?<br><br>They were practically strangers to her and her boyfriend Estrada.&nbsp; When it came to a point that Webb decided with his friends to gang-rape Carmela, clearly, there was nothing in it for Alfaro. Yet, she stuck it out with them, as a police asset would, hanging in there until she had a crime to report, only she was not yet an "asset" then.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, Alfaro had been too soaked in drugs to think clearly and just followed along where the group took her, how could she remember so much details that only a drug-free mind can?<br><br><u>Three</u>. When Alfaro went to see Carmela at her house for the second time, Carmella told her that she still had to go out and that Webb and his friends should come back around midnight.&nbsp; Alfaro returned to her car and waited for Carmela to drive out in her own car.&nbsp; And she trailed her up to Aguirre Avenue where she supposedly dropped off a man whom she thought was Carmela's boyfriend.&nbsp; Alfaro's trailing Carmela to spy on her unfaithfulness to Webb did not make sense since she was on limited errand.&nbsp; But, as a critical witness, Alfaro had to provide a reason for Webb to freak out and decide to come with his friends and harm Carmela.<br><br><u>Four</u>. According to Alfaro, when they returned to Carmela's house the third time around midnight, she led Webb, Lejano, and Ventura through the pedestrian gate that Carmela had left open.&nbsp; Now, this is weird.&nbsp; Webb was the gang leader who decided what they were going to do.&nbsp; He decided and his friends agreed with him to go to Carmela's house and gang-rape her.&nbsp; Why would Alfaro, a woman, a stranger to Webb before that night, and obviously with no role to play in the gang-rape of Carmela, lead him and the others into her house?&nbsp; It made no sense.&nbsp; It would only make sense if Alfaro wanted to feign being a witness to something she did not see.<br><br><u>Five</u>. Alfaro went out of the house to smoke at the garden.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes, a woman exclaimed, <i>"Sino yan?</i>"&nbsp; On hearing this, Alfaro immediately walked out of the garden and went to her car. Apparently, she did this because she knew they came on a sly.&nbsp; Someone other than Carmela became conscious of the presence of Webb and others in the house.&nbsp; Alfaro walked away because, obviously, she did not want to get involved in a potential confrontation.&nbsp; This was supposedly her frame of mind: fear of getting involved in what was not her business.<br><br>But if that were the case, how could she testify based on personal knowledge of what went on in the house?&nbsp; Alfaro had to change that frame of mind to one of boldness and reckless curiosity.&nbsp; So that is what she next claimed.&nbsp; She went back into the house to watch as Webb raped Carmela on the floor of the master's bedroom.&nbsp; He had apparently stabbed to death Carmela's mom and her young sister whose bloodied bodies were sprawled on the bed.&nbsp; Now, Alfaro testified that she got scared (another shift to fear) for she hurriedly got out of the house after Webb supposedly gave her a meaningful look.<br><br>Alfaro quickly went to her car, not minding Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, Rodriguez, and Filart who sat on the car or milled on the sidewalk.&nbsp; She did not speak to them, even to Estrada, her boyfriend.&nbsp; She entered her car and turned on the engine but she testified that she did not know where to go.&nbsp; This woman who a few minutes back led Webb, Lejano, and Ventura into the house, knowing that they were decided to rape and harm Carmela, was suddenly too shocked to know where to go!&nbsp; This emotional pendulum swing indicates a witness who was confused with her own lies.<br><br><b>4. The supposed corroborations</b><br><br>Intending to provide corroboration to Alfaro's testimony, the prosecution presented six additional witnesses:<br><br><b>Dr. Prospero A. Cabanayan, </b>the NBI Medico-Legal Officer who autopsied the bodies of the victims, testified on the stab wounds they sustained<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and the presence of semen in Carmela's genitalia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> indicating that she had been raped.<br><br><b>Normal E.

Security guard White did not, therefore, provide corroboration to Alfaro's testimony.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Justo Cabanacan, </b>the security supervisor at Pitong Daan Subdivision testified that he saw Webb around the last week of May or the first week of June 1991 to prove his presence in the Philippines when he claimed to be in the United States.&nbsp; He was manning the guard house at the entrance of the subdivision of Pitong Daan when he flagged down a car driven by Webb. Webb said that he would see Lilet Sy. Cabanacan asked him for an ID but he pointed to his United BF Homes sticker and said that he resided there. Cabanacan replied, however, that Pitong Daan had a local sticker.<br><br>Cabanacan testified that, at this point, Webb introduced himself as the son of Congressman Webb.&nbsp; Still, the supervisor insisted on seeing his ID.&nbsp; Webb grudgingly gave it and after seeing the picture and the name on it, Cabanacan returned the same and allowed Webb to pass without being logged in as their Standard Operating Procedure required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>But Cabanacan's testimony could not be relied on.&nbsp; Although it was not common for a security guard to challenge a Congressman's son with such vehemence, Cabanacan did not log the incident on the guardhouse book.&nbsp; Nor did he, contrary to prescribed procedure, record the visitor's entry into the subdivision.&nbsp; It did not make sense that Cabanacan was strict in the matter of seeing Webb's ID but not in recording the visit.<br><br><b>Mila Gaviola</b> used to work as laundry woman for the Webbs at their house at BF Homes Executive Village.&nbsp; She testified that she saw Webb at his parents' house on the morning of June 30, 1991 when she got the dirty clothes from the room that he and two brothers occupied at about 4.a.m.&nbsp; She saw him again pacing the floor at 9 a.m.&nbsp; At about 1 p.m., Webb left the house in t-shirt and shorts, passing through a secret door near the maid's quarters on the way out.&nbsp; Finally, she saw Webb at 4 p.m. of the same day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, however, Gaviola could not say what distinguished June 30, 1991 from the other days she was on service at the Webb household as to enable her to distinctly remember, four years later, what one of the Webb boys did and at what time.&nbsp; She could not remember any of the details that happened in the household on the other days.&nbsp; She proved to have a selective photographic memory and this only damaged her testimony.<br><br>Gaviola tried to corroborate Alfaro''s testimony by claiming that on June 30, 1991 she noticed bloodstains on Webb's t-shirt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; She did not call the attention of anybody in the household about it when it would have been a point of concern that Webb may have been hurt, hence the blood.<br><br>Besides, Victoria Ventoso, the Webbs' housemaid from March 1989 to May 1992, and Sgt. Miguel Muñoz, the Webbs' security aide in 1991, testified that Gaviola worked for the Webbs only from January 1991 to April 1991.&nbsp; Ventoso further testified that it was not Gaviola's duty to collect the clothes from the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor bedrooms, this being the work of the housemaid charged with cleaning the rooms.<br><br>What is more, it was most unlikely for a laundrywoman who had been there for only four months to collect, as she claimed, the laundry from the rooms of her employers and their grown up children at four in the morning while they were asleep.<br><br>And it did not make sense, if Alfaro's testimony were to be believed that Webb, who was so careful and clever that he called Biong to go to the Vizconde residence at 2 a.m. to clean up the evidence against him and his group, would bring his bloodied shirt home and put it in the hamper for laundrywoman Gaviola to collect and wash at 4 a.m. as was her supposed habit.<br><br><b>Lolita De Birrer</b> was accused Biong's girlfriend around the time the Vizconde massacre took place.&nbsp; Birrer testified that she was with Biong playing mahjong from the evening of June 29, 1991 to the early morning of June 30, when Biong got a call at around 2 a.m. This prompted him, according to De Birrer, to leave and go to BF.&nbsp; Someone sitting at the backseat of a taxi picked him up.&nbsp; When Biong returned at 7 a.m. he washed off what looked like dried blood from his fingernails.&nbsp; And he threw away a foul-smelling handkerchief.&nbsp; She also saw Biong take out a knife with aluminum cover from his drawer and hid it in his steel cabinet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The security guard at Pitong Daan did not notice any police investigator flashing a badge to get into the village although Biong supposedly came in at the unholy hour of two in the morning.&nbsp; His departure before 7 a.m. also remained unnoticed by the subdivision guards.&nbsp; Besides, if he had cleaned up the crime scene shortly after midnight, what was the point of his returning there on the following morning to dispose of some of the evidence in the presence of other police investigators and on-lookers?&nbsp; In fact, why would he steal valuable items from the Vizconde residence on his return there hours later if he had the opportunity to do it earlier?<br><br>At most, Birrer's testimony only established Biong's theft of certain items from the Vizconde residence and gross neglect for failing to maintain the sanctity of the crime scene by moving around and altering the effects of the crime. Birrer's testimony failed to connect Biong's acts to Webb and the other accused.<br><br><b>Lauro Vizconde</b> testified about how deeply he was affected by the loss of her wife and two daughters.&nbsp; Carmella spoke to him of a rejected suitor she called "Bagyo," because he was a Parañaque politician's son.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Lauro did not appear curious enough to insist on finding out who the rejected fellow was.&nbsp; Besides, his testimony contradicts that of Alfaro who testified that Carmela and Webb had an on-going relation.&nbsp; Indeed, if Alfaro were to be believed, Carmela wanted Webb to come to her house around midnight.&nbsp; She even left the kitchen door open so he could enter the house.<br><br><b>5. The missing corroboration</b><br><br>There is something truly remarkable about this case: the prosecution's core theory that Carmela and Webb had been sweethearts, that she had been unfaithful to him, and that it was for this reason that Webb brought his friends to her house to gang-rape her is totally uncorroborated!<br><br>For instance, normally, if Webb, a Congressman's son, courted the young Carmela, that would be news among her circle of friends if not around town. But, here, none of her friends or even those who knew either of them came forward to affirm this.&nbsp; And if Webb hanged around with her, trying to win her favors, he would surely be seen with her.&nbsp; And this would all the more be so if they had become sweethearts, a relation that Alfaro tried to project with her testimony.<br><br>But, except for Alfaro, the NBI asset, no one among Carmela's friends or her friends' friends would testify ever hearing of such relationship or ever seeing them together in some popular hangouts in Parañaque or Makati.&nbsp; Alfaro's claim of a five-hour drama is like an alien page, rudely and unconnectedly inserted into Webb and Carmela's life stories or like a piece of jigsaw puzzle trimmed to fit into the shape on the board but does not belong because it clashes with the surrounding pieces.&nbsp; It has neither antecedent nor concomitant support in the verifiable facts of their personal histories.&nbsp; It is quite unreal.<br><br>What is more, Alfaro testified that she saw Carmela drive out of her house with a male passenger, Mr. X, whom Alfaro thought the way it looked was also Carmela's lover.&nbsp; This was the all-important reason Webb supposedly had for wanting to harm her. Again, none of Carmela's relatives, friends, or people who knew her ever testified about the existence of Mr.X in her life.&nbsp; Nobody has come forward to testify having ever seen him with Carmela.&nbsp; And despite the gruesome news about her death and how Mr. X had played a role in it, he never presented himself like anyone who had lost a special friend normally would.&nbsp; Obviously, Mr. X did not exist, a mere ghost of the imagination of Alfaro, the woman who made a living informing on criminals.<br><br><center><u><b>Webb's U.S. Alibi</b></u><br></center><br>Among the accused, Webb presented the strongest alibi.<br><br><b>a.

Alibi versus positive identification </b><br><br>The trial court and the Court of Appeals are one in rejecting as weak Webb's alibi.&nbsp; Their reason is uniform: Webb's alibi cannot stand against Alfaro's positive identification of him as the rapist and killer of Carmela and, apparently, the killer as well of her mother and younger sister.&nbsp; Because of this, to the lower courts, Webb's denial and alibi were fabricated.<br><br>But not all denials and alibis should be regarded as fabricated.&nbsp; Indeed, if the accused is truly innocent, he can have no other defense but denial and alibi.&nbsp; So how can such accused penetrate a mind that has been made cynical by the rule drilled into his head that a defense of alibi is a hangman's noose in the face of a witness positively swearing, "I saw him do it."?&nbsp; Most judges believe that such assertion automatically dooms an alibi which is so easy to fabricate.&nbsp; This quick stereotype thinking, however, is distressing.&nbsp; For how else can the truth that the accused is really innocent have any chance of prevailing over such a stone-cast tenet?<br><br>There is only one way.<span>&nbsp; A judge must keep an open mind.&nbsp; He must guard against slipping into hasty conclusion, often arising from a desire to quickly finish the job of deciding a case.&nbsp; A positive declaration from a witness that he saw the accused commit the crime should not automatically cancel out the accused's claim that he did not do it. A lying witness can make as positive an identification as a truthful witness can.&nbsp; The lying witness can also say as forthrightly and unequivocally, "He did it!" without blinking an eye.<br><br>Rather, to be acceptable, the positive identification must meet at least two criteria:<br><br><u>First</u>, the positive identification of the offender must come from a credible witness. She is credible who can be trusted to tell the truth, usually based on past experiences with her.&nbsp; Her word has, to one who knows her, its weight in gold.<br><br>And <u>second</u>, the witness' story of what she personally saw must be believable, not inherently contrived.&nbsp; A witness who testifies about something she never saw runs into inconsistencies and makes bewildering claims.<br><br>Here, as already fully discussed above, Alfaro and her testimony fail to meet the above criteria.<br><br>She did not show up at the NBI as a spontaneous witness bothered by her conscience. She had been hanging around that agency for sometime as a stool pigeon, one paid for mixing up with criminals and squealing on them.&nbsp; Police assets are often criminals themselves.&nbsp; She was the prosecution's worst possible choice for a witness. Indeed, her superior testified that she volunteered to play the role of a witness in the Vizconde killings when she could not produce a man she promised to the NBI.<br><br>And, although her testimony included details, Alfaro had prior access to the details that the investigators knew of the case.&nbsp; She took advantage of her familiarity with these details to include in her testimony the clearly incompatible act of Webb hurling a stone at the front door glass frames even when they were trying to slip away quietly--just so she can accommodate this crime scene feature.&nbsp; She also had Ventura rummaging a bag on the dining table for a front door key that nobody needed just to explain the physical evidence of that bag and its scattered contents.&nbsp; And she had Ventura climbing the car's hood, risking being seen in such an awkward position, when they did not need to darken the garage to force open the front door--just so to explain the darkened light and foot prints on the car hood.<br><br>Further, her testimony was inherently incredible.&nbsp; Her story that Gatchalian, Fernandez, Estrada, Rodriguez, and Filart agreed to take their turns raping Carmela is incongruent with their indifference, exemplified by remaining outside the house, milling under a street light, visible to neighbors and passersby, and showing no interest in the developments inside the house, like if it was their turn to rape Carmela. Alfaro's story that she agreed to serve as Webb's messenger to Carmela, using up her gas, and staying with him till the bizarre end when they were practically strangers, also taxes incredulity.<br><br>To provide basis for Webb's outrage, Alfaro said that she followed Carmela to the main road to watch her let off a lover on Aguirre Avenue.&nbsp; And, inexplicably, although Alfaro had only played the role of messenger, she claimed leading Webb, Lejano, and Ventura into the house to gang-rape Carmella, as if Alfaro was establishing a reason for later on testifying on personal knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her swing from an emotion of fear when a woman woke up to their presence in the house and of absolute courage when she nonetheless returned to become the lone witness to a grim scene is also quite inexplicable.<br><br>Ultimately, Alfaro's quality as a witness and her inconsistent, if not inherently unbelievable, testimony cannot be the positive identification that jurisprudence acknowledges as sufficient to jettison a denial and an alibi.<br><br><b>f. A documented alibi</b><br><br>To establish alibi, the accused must prove by positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that (a) he was present at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime, and (b) that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The courts below held that, despite his evidence, Webb was actually in Parañaque when the Vizconde killings took place; he was not in the U.S. from March 9, 1991 to October 27, 1992; and if he did leave on March 9, 1991, he actually returned before June 29, 1991, committed the crime, erased the fact of his return to the Philippines from the records of the U.S. and Philippine Immigrations, smuggled himself out of the Philippines and into the U.S., and returned the normal way on October 27, 1992.&nbsp; But this ruling practically makes the death of Webb and his passage into the next life the only acceptable alibi in the Philippines.&nbsp; Courts must abandon this unjust and inhuman paradigm.<br><br>If one is cynical about the Philippine system, he could probably claim that Webb, with his father's connections, can arrange for the local immigration to put a March 9, 1991 departure stamp on his passport and an October 27, 1992 arrival stamp on the same.&nbsp; But this is pure speculation since there had been no indication that such arrangement was made.&nbsp; Besides, how could Webb fix a foreign airlines' passenger manifest, officially filed in the Philippines and at the airport in the U.S. that had his name on them?&nbsp; How could Webb fix with the U.S. Immigration's record system those two dates in its record of his travels as well as the dates when he supposedly departed in secret from the U.S. to commit the crime in the Philippines and then return there?&nbsp; No one has come up with a logical and plausible answer to these questions.<br><br>The Court of Appeals rejected the evidence of Webb's passport since he did not leave the original to be attached to the record.&nbsp; But, while the best evidence of a document is the original, this means that the same is exhibited in court for the adverse party to examine and for the judge to see.&nbsp; As Court of Appeals Justice Tagle said in his dissent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the practice when a party does not want to leave an important document with the trial court is to have a photocopy of it marked as exhibit and stipulated among the parties as a faithful reproduction of the original.&nbsp; Stipulations in the course of trial are binding on the parties and on the court.<br><br>The U.S. Immigration certification and the computer print-out of Webb's arrival in and departure from that country were authenticated by no less than the Office of the U.S. Attorney General and the State Department.&nbsp; Still the Court of Appeals refused to accept these documents for the reason that Webb failed to present in court the immigration official who prepared the same.&nbsp; But this was unnecessary.&nbsp; Webb's passport is a document issued by the Philippine government, which under international practice, is the official record of travels of the citizen to whom it is issued.&nbsp; The entries in that passport are presumed true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The U.S. Immigration certification and computer print-out, the official certifications of which have been authenticated by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, merely validated the arrival and departure stamps of the U.S. Immigration office on Webb's passport.&nbsp; They have the same evidentiary value.&nbsp; The officers who issued these certifications need not be presented in court to testify on them.&nbsp; Their trustworthiness arises from the sense of official duty and the penalty attached to a breached duty, in the routine and disinterested origin of such statement and in the publicity of the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals of course makes capital of the fact that an earlier certification from the U.S. Immigration office said that it had no record of Webb entering the U.S.&nbsp; But that erroneous first certification was amply explained by the U.S. Government and Court of Appeals Justice Tagle stated it in his dissenting opinion, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>While it is true that an earlier Certification was issued by the U.S. INS on August 16, 1995 finding "no evidence of lawful admission of Webb," this was already clarified and deemed erroneous by no less than the US INS Officials.&nbsp; As explained by witness Leo Herrera-Lim, Consul and Second Secretary of the Philippine Embassy in Washington D.C., said Certification did not pass through proper diplomatic channels and was obtained in violation of the rules on protocol and standard procedure governing such request.</b><br><br><b>The initial request was merely initiated by BID Commissioner Verceles who directly communicated with the Philippine Consulate in San Francisco, USA, bypassing the Secretary of Foreign Affairs which is the proper protocol procedure.&nbsp; Mr. Steven Bucher, the acting Chief of the Records Services Board of US-INS Washington D.C. in his letter addressed to Philip Antweiler, Philippine Desk Officer, State Department, declared the earlier Certification as incorrect and erroneous as it was "not exhaustive and did not reflect all available information." Also, Richard L. Huff, Co-Director of the Office of Information and privacy, US Department of Justice, in response to the appeal raised by Consul General Teresita V. Marzan, explained that "the INS normally does not maintain records on individuals who are entering the country as visitors rather than as immigrants: and that a notation concerning the entry of a visitor may be made at the Nonimmigrant Information system. Since appellant Webb entered the U.S. on a mere tourist visa, obviously, the initial search could not have produced the desired result inasmuch as the data base that was looked into contained entries of the names of IMMIGRANTS and not that of NON-IMMIGRANT visitors of the U.S..</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court and the Court of Appeals expressed marked cynicism over the accuracy of travel documents like the passport as well as the domestic and foreign records of departures and arrivals from airports.&nbsp; They claim that it would not have been impossible for Webb to secretly return to the Philippines after he supposedly left it on March 9, 1991, commit the crime, go back to the U.S., and openly return to the Philippines again on October 26, 1992.&nbsp; Travel between the U.S. and the Philippines, said the lower courts took only about twelve to fourteen hours.<br><br>If the Court were to subscribe to this extremely skeptical view, it might as well tear the rules of evidence out of the law books and regard suspicions, surmises, or speculations as reasons for impeaching evidence.&nbsp; It is not that official records, which carry the presumption of truth of what they state, are immune to attack.&nbsp; They are not.&nbsp; That presumption can be overcome by evidence.&nbsp; Here, however, the prosecution did not bother to present evidence to impeach the entries in Webb's passport and the certifications of the Philippine and U.S.' immigration services regarding his travel to the U.S. and back.&nbsp; The prosecution's rebuttal evidence is the fear of the unknown that it planted in the lower court's minds.<br><br><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Effect of Webb's alibi to others</b><br><br>Webb's documented alibi altogether impeaches Alfaro's testimony, not only with respect to him, but also with respect to Lejano, Estrada, Fernandez, Gatchalian, Rodriguez, and Biong.&nbsp; For, if the Court accepts the proposition that Webb was in the U.S. when the crime took place, Alfaro's testimony will not hold together.&nbsp; Webb's participation is the anchor of Alfaro's story.&nbsp; Without it, the evidence against the others must necessarily fall.<br><br><center><u><b>CONCLUSION</b></u></center><br>In our criminal justice system, what is important is, not whether the court entertains doubts about the innocence of the accused since an open mind is willing to explore all possibilities, but whether it entertains a reasonable, lingering doubt as to his guilt.&nbsp; For, it would be a serious mistake to send an innocent man to jail where such kind of doubt hangs on to one's inner being, like a piece of meat lodged immovable between teeth.<br><br>Will the Court send the accused to spend the rest of their lives in prison on the testimony of an NBI asset who proposed to her handlers that she take the role of the witness to the Vizconde massacre that she could not produce?<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the Decision dated December 15, 2005 and Resolution dated January 26, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

 it should be the common desire of bench and bar that crime is not left 
unpunished, it is no less important, if not more so, that the innocent 
be shielded from hasty prosecution and rash conviction.&nbsp; We have nothing
 but praise for sincerity and zeal in the enforcement of the law.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, the <u>undeserved penalties</u> inflicted upon the blameless, and the <u>indelible stain upon their name</u>, which is never quite washed&nbsp;&nbsp; away by time, should caution all concerned to <b>a more careful and conscientious scrutiny of all the facts before the finger is pointed and the stone is cast</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>And
 so, as in all criminal cases, the very voluminous records of the 
present cases call for a "more careful and conscientious scrutiny" in 
order to determine what <u>the</u> facts are before the accused's conviction is affirmed.<br><br>On
 June 30, 1991, Estrellita Vizconde and her daughters, then 19-year old 
Carmela and then seven-year old Jennifer, were found dead in their home 
at No. 80 Vinzons Street, BF Homes Subdivision, Parañaque.&nbsp;&nbsp; They all 
bore multiple stab wounds on different parts of their bodies.&nbsp; Some of 
their personal belongings appeared to be missing.<br><br>An intense and sustained investigation conducted by the police resulted in the arrest of a group of suspects, the <i>Akyat Bahay </i>gang members, some of whom gave detailed confessions to having committed the crimes, hence, their indictment in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp;
 The Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 63 eventually found those
 suspects to have been victims of police frame-up, however, and were 
thus ordered discharged.<br><br>Subsequently, in 1995, the National 
Bureau of Investigation (NBI) which conducted a parallel investigation 
announced that it had solved the crime by presenting its "star witness" 
in the person of Jessica Alfaro y Mincey (Alfaro), one of its 
"informers" or "assets," who claimed to have been an eyewitness to the 
crime.&nbsp; She named the accused Hubert Jeffrey P. Webb, Antonio "Tony Boy"
 Lejano, Artemio "Dong" Ventura, Michael A. Gatchalian, Hospicio "Pyke" 
Fernandez, Peter Estrada, Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez, and Joey Filart as 
the culprits. She also tagged Parañaque police officer Gerardo Biong as 
an accessory after the fact.&nbsp; On the basis of Alfaro's account, an 
Information was filed on August 10, 1995 before the Parañaque RTC 
against Webb, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for rape with homicide, reading as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That

1991, in the municipality of Parañaque, province of Rizal, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Hubert 
Jeffrey P. Webb conspiring and confederating with accused Antonio "Tony

Hiospicio "Pyke" Fernandez, Peter Estrada, Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez and 
Joey Filart, mutually helping one another, while armed with bladed 
instruments, with the use of force and intimidation, with lewd design, 
with abuse of superior strength, nighttime and with the use of motor 
vehicle, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of 
the person of Carmela Vizconde against her will and consent.<br><br>That
 by reason or on the occasion of the aforesaid rape or immediately 
thereafter, the above-named accused with intent to kill, conspiring and 
confederating together, mutually helping one another, did then and there
 and with evidence premeditation, abuse of superior strength, nighttime,
 with the use of motor vehicle, assault and stab with bladed instruments
 Carmela Vizconde, Estrellita Vizconde and Jennifer Vizconde, thereby 
inflicting upon them numerous stab wounds in different parts of their 
bodies which caused their instantaneous death.<br><br>The accused 
GERARDO BIONG and JOHN DOES having knowledge after the commission of the
 above-mentioned crime, and without having participated therein as 
principals or accomplices, took part subsequent to its commission by 
assisting, with abuse of authority as police officer, the above-named 
principal accused, to conceal or destroy the effects or instruments 
thereof by failing to preserve the physical evidence and allowing their 
destruction in order to prevent the discovery of the crime.</blockquote><br>The
 case was, after the Presiding Judge of Branch 258 of the Parañaque RTC 
inhibited, re-raffled to Branch 274 of the Parañaque RTC.&nbsp; The trial 
court, then presided over by Judge Amelita G. Tolentino, tried only 
seven of the accused, Artemio Ventura and Joey Filart having remained at
 large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At the trial, the prosecution presented Alfaro as its main witness.&nbsp; The other witnesses were <b>Dr. Prospero Cabanayan</b>, the medico-legal officer who autopsied the bodies of the victims; <b>Lolita Carrera Birrer,</b> an ex-lover of Gerardo Biong; <b>Mila Gaviola</b>, former laundrywoman of the Webbs; <b>Normal White and Justo Cabanacan,</b> security personnel of the <i>Pitong Daan</i> Subdivision, BF Homes, Parañaque, and <b>Lauro G. Vizconde</b>, Estrellita's husband.<br><br>The
 defense presented testimonial evidence which tended to cast a bad light
 on Alfaro's reputation for truth, as well as on the implausibility of 
her account.<br><br>At all events,&nbsp; some of the accused invoked alibi, 
claiming to have been somewhere else at the time of the commission of 
the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Webb's case, he presented documentary and testimonial 
proof that he was in the United States of America from March 1991 to 
October 1992.<br><br>The trial court, impressed by Alfaro's detailed 
narration of the events surrounding the commission of the crime, deemed 
her a credible witness after finding her testimony to have been 
corroborated by those of the other prosecution witnesses, as well as by 
the physical evidence. To the trial court, her testimony was 
categorical, straightforward, spontaneous, and frank, and withstood 
grueling cross-examinations by the different defense counsel.<br><br>On the other hand, it belittled the denial and alibi of accused Webb, Lejano, Rodriguez, and Gatchalian in light of their <u>positive identification</u> by Alfaro.<br><br>And
 so after a protracted trial, the trial court rendered on January 4, 
2000 a 172-page decision finding all the accused guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of rape with homicide.<br><br>Thus the trial court disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,
 this Court hereby finds all the principal accused GUILTY BEYOND 
REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE WITH HOMICIDE AND HEREBY SENTENCES
 EACH ONE OF THEM TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA.&nbsp; This 
Court likewise finds the accused Gerardo Biong GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE 
DOUBT AS AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT, AND HEREBY SENTENCES HIM TO SUFFER
 AN IMPRISONMENT OF ELEVEN (11) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS AND ONE (1) DAY 
TO TWELVE (12) YEARS.&nbsp; In addition, the Court hereby orders all the 
accused to jointly and severally pay the victim's surviving heir, Mr. 
Lauro Vizconde, the following sums by way of civil indemnity:<br><br><blockquote>1) The amount of P150,000.00 for wrongful death of the victims;<br>2) The amount of P762,450.00 representing actual damages sustained by Mr. Lauro Vizconde;<br>3) The amount of P2,000,000.00 as moral damages sustained by Mr. Lauro Vizconde;<br>4) The amount of P97,404.55 as attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>On
 appeal, the Court of Appeals rendered its challenged Decision of 
December 15, 2005 affirming with modification the trial court's decision
 by reducing the penalty imposed on Biong to six years minimum and 
twelve years maximum and increasing the award of civil indemnity to 
Lauro Vizconde to P200,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp;
 The appellate court found that indeed there was sufficient evidence 
that Rodriguez, Gatchalian, Fernandez, and Estrada had conspired to rape
 and kill Carmela as well as to kill Estrellita and Jennifer.<br><br>On 
motion for reconsideration by the accused, the appellate court's Special
 Division of five members, voting three against two, sustained its 
affirmance of the trial court's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, this appeal.<br><br>On
 April 20, 2010, as a result of its initial deliberation in this case, 
the Court issued a Resolution granting the request of Webb to submit for
 <i>Deoxyribonucleic Acid</i> (DNA) analysis the semen specimen taken 
from Carmela's cadaver, which specimen was believed to be still under 
the safekeeping of the NBI.&nbsp; The Court granted the request pursuant to 
Section 4 of the Rule on DNA Evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to give the accused and the prosecution access to scientific evidence which could affect the result of the case.<br><br>On
 April 27, 2010, however, the NBI informed the Court that it no longer 
had custody of the specimen which it claimed had been turned over to the
 trial court. <i>Parenthetically</i>, the trial court records do not 
show that the specimen was among the object evidence that was offered in
 evidence in the case by any of the parties. It was in light of this 
development that accused Webb filed an urgent motion to acquit on the 
ground that the government's failure to preserve such vital evidence has
 resulted in the denial of his right to due process.<br><br>In the draft
 decision prepared by Justice Martin S. Villarama as a basis of this 
Court's deliberation, the decision of the appellate court affirming with
 modification the trial court's decision was affirmed.<br><br>In 
discussing why the Decision of the Court of Appeals is being affirmed 
with modification, the draft decision which was the basis of this 
Court's deliberations, started by stating a "fundamental rule," <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>It
 is a fundamental rule that findings of the trial courts which are 
factual in nature and which involve credibility are accorded respect 
when no glaring errors, gross misapprehensions of facts and speculative,
 arbitrary and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such 
findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; When the trial 
court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said 
findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>The
 draft decision, which was later adopted by the dissenters, found "no 
glaring errors, gross misapprehensions of facts and speculative, 
arbitrary and unsupported conclusions" made by the lower courts.&nbsp; It 
readily credited the testimony of prosecution "star" witness Jessica 
Alfaro (Alfaro) who, it observed,&nbsp; "underwent exhaustive and intense 
cross-examination by eight&nbsp;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; defense lawyers . . . [and] revealed
 such details and observations which only a person who was actually with
 the perpetrators could have known."<br><br>The trial court banked 
primarily on Alfaro who claimed to be an eyewitness to the massacre and 
considered the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses as merely 
corroborative of hers.<br><br>Jurisprudence has consistently summoned, however, that for testimonial evidence to be worthy of belief, it must <i>firstly</i> proceed from the mouth of a <u>credible witness</u>.
 A person may be credible where he is without previous conviction of a 
crime; who is not a police character and has no police record; who has 
not perjured in the past; <u>whose affidavit or testimony is not incredible</u>;&nbsp; who has a good standing in the community; and who is&nbsp; reputed to be trustworthy and reliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, the <u>person's testimony must in itself be credible</u>.<br><br><i>Daggers v. Van Dyck</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> illuminates:<br><br><blockquote>Evidence
 to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible 
witness, but it must be credible in itself - such as the common 
experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the 
circumstances.&nbsp; We have no test of the truth of human testimony, except 
its <u>conformity to our knowledge, observation, and experience</u>.&nbsp; Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Alfaro
 was found both by the trial and appellate courts to be a credible 
witness.&nbsp; She impressed the trial court which found her to have 
"testified in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank 
manner, and [to] ha[ve] remained consistent in her testimony."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>By Alfaro's own admission, she was a habitual drug addict who inhaled and sniffed shabu "every other day"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <u>since December 1990</u>.&nbsp;
 It was about this time that she met Artemio "Dong" Ventura who provided
 her with a regular supply of shabu at the so-called "house of shabu" in
 Parañaque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; In March 
1991, she stopped getting her supply of shabu from Ventura as she 
instead got it from other sources including Orly Bacquir and Cris Santos
 and places such as Quezon City, Makati and Tondo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In
 the afternoon of June 29, 1991, the date of the commission of the 
crime, before she and accused Peter Estrada, who she claimed was her 
boyfriend, went to the Alabang Commercial Center, she had taken illegal 
drugs, and in the evening of even date, she not only smoked shabu but 
sniffed cocaine as well at the "parking lot."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It was only in about October 1994 that she stopped taking illegal drugs.<br><br>The paper of authors <i>Burrus and Marks,</i> "<i>Testimonial Reliability of Drug Addicts,"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><i> </i>teaches:<br><br><blockquote>. . . [W]here the <u>prolonged
 use of drugs has impaired the witness' ability to perceive, recall or 
relate, impeaching testimony is uniformly sustained by the courts.</u>&nbsp; 
Aside from organic deterioration, however, testimony may be impugned if 
the witness was under the influence of drugs at the time of perceiving 
the event about which he is testifying or at the time he is on the 
stand. This necessarily follows, for even the temporary presence of 
drugs affects the functioning of the body's organs, and thus bears 
directly on the credibility of the witness' testimony...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Evidence
 derived from the testimony of a witness who was under the influence of 
drugs during the incident to which he is testifying is indeed very 
unreliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; So it has 
been held that "habitual users of narcotics become notorious liars and 
that their testimony is likely to be affected thereby."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We believe it will be admitted that habitual users of opium, or other like narcotics, become <u>notorious liars</u>.
 The habit of lying comes doubtless from the fact that the users of 
those narcotics pass the greater part of their lives in an unreal world,
 and thus <u>become unable to distinguish between images and facts, between illusions and realities</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Defense
 witness Dr. Rey San Pedro, then Deputy Executive Director of the 
Dangerous Drugs Board, opined that drug addicts or dependents are 
generally liars who would lie for less than noble objectives, such as 
for money and/or to satisfy their craving for attention, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><span>Atty.

 National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Epimaco Velasco had a 
view similar to that of Dr. San Pedro's â”€ that any information which is 
being furnished by a drug addict is "not generally reliable" and his 
capacity to lie may be "very great."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In their earlier mentioned paper, <i>Burrus and Marks</i>
 write on the "peculiar effects upon veracity" of the principal types of
 drugs, like cocaine and amphetamine which were used by Alfaro:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>b.&nbsp; <i>Cocaine </i>â”€
 Cocaine is a powerful cortical stimulant which causes a state of 
euphoric excitement and varying degrees of pleasurable hallucinations.&nbsp; 
Under its influence, a person experiences sensations of great muscular 
and mental strength and overestimates his capabilities.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He is truly, at
 least while under the drug's influence, in </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">an "unreal" or "dream world,"</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
 and the majority exception of admitting impeaching testimony where the 
witness was under the influence of the drug at the time of perception or
 testifying seems clearly sustainable in medical evidence.</span><br><br>Over 
time, cocaine produces on the addict a degree of physical and mental 
deterioration not found in connection with the use of opiates.&nbsp; The 
cocaine addict is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not a normal person</span>; many, in fact, become paranoids 
and suffer from feelings of persecution.&nbsp; V<span style="text-decoration: underline;">isual, auditory and tactual 
hallucinations are common</span>, as are digestive tract disorders, and 
occasionally convulsions.<br><br>It would seem to follow that, so far as
 medical evidence is concerned, expert testimony should be admissible to
 impeach the cocaine addict.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both in its long-run effect of organic 
deterioration and in its short run influence, the drug severs the user's
 contact with reality, and renders him, to that extent, </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">unreliable</b><b>.</b>
 Even the majority admits impeaching testimony in cases of organic 
deterioration.&nbsp; There are few instances of deterioration more pronounced
 than that found in the habitual user of cocaine.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>e. <i>Amphetamine</i>â”€ Similar to the barbiturates and bromides, amphetamine operates upon the central nervous system, and <b>its effect on the&nbsp; user's ability to perceive and accurately to relate is dependent on the&nbsp; amount of the drug taken.</b>&nbsp;
 Rather than a depressant however, amphetamine is a potent stimulant, 
the initial proper dosage promoting wakefulness and alertness, increased
 initiative, confidence, euphoria and increased motor activity.&nbsp; Thus, 
the non-addict's sparing use of the drug, would not seem to impair 
reliability and impeaching testimony to this end should be excluded.<br><br>Overdosage
 and repeated medication, however, can prove most harmful.&nbsp; Thus, the 
addict may suffer vasomotor disturbances, dizziness, agitation, 
confusion and delirium.&nbsp; The usual dosage taken by the addict is 
sufficient to cause toxic psychosis characterized by hallucinations and 
paranoid delusions similar in effect to cocaine.&nbsp; In this state, the 
amphetamine addict's testimonial capabilities are definitely impaired.<br><br>The
 result is that with amphetamine, as well as with barbiturates and 
bromides, impeachment should depend upon the amount of the drug taken 
and the extent of its use.&nbsp; Absent excessive use to the extent of 
organic deterioration, the barbiturate, bromide or amphetamine addict, 
when not intoxicated by the direct influence of the drug, is apparently 
perfectly reliable and the majority judicial view, under these 
circumstances seems sustainable.&nbsp; Also, as with marihuana, its effects 
vary with the personality make-up of the user, with the result that 
this, too, should be considered in admitting or excluding the impeaching
 testimony.&nbsp; This, of course, broadens the inquiry from the 
physiological-pharmacological effects of drugs upon reliability to the 
psychological framework of the user in its relation to his ability to 
tell the truth or proneness to lie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; (italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>How Alfaro got to be a "star" witness in this case was narrated by then NBI agent Artemio Sacaguing:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><span><span><span>Atty.

 agent Sacaguing was the special "handler" of Alfaro, an NBI "asset" who
 regularly provided leads on projects or cases being investigated by the
 NBI, on which account she received special treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; From 
Sacaguing's above-quoted testimony, Alfaro came forward with her 
"knowledge" about the commission of the crimes only <i>after </i>being 
cajoled by the NBI agents about her lack of productivity and her failure
 to make good her word that she knew and would bring someone who could 
"shed light" on the crimes that occurred close to four years earlier.&nbsp; 
It is thus hard to fathom how her motives for suddenly developing a 
first hand account of the commission of the crimes could be treated as 
anything but suspect.&nbsp; Yet, the lower courts, despite the&nbsp; peculiar 
circumstances related by Sacaguing, were not put on guard from 
swallowing Alfaro's testimony.<br><br>Significantly, <u>Alfaro never disputed Sacaguing's above-quoted testimoy</u>.<br><br>The
 trial court credited as satisfactory and plausible Alfaro's explanation
 for her silence from the time she allegedly witnessed the crimes in 
June 1991 up to "about October 1994" when the numbing effects of drug 
abuse only began to wear off and she had an earnest desire to reform her
 life.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="CENTER"><span><span><u>WITNESS JESSICA ALFARO ON CLARIFICATORY QUESTIONS BY THE COURT</u></span></span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><span><span>Court:</span></span></div></td> <td width="90%"><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><span><span>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Alfaro's confession of having for years, after the commission of the 
crimes, been numbed by the effects of drug abuse, would the dissenters 
take as gospel truth her what they termed "vivid" and "infallible" 
recollection of the minutiae surrounding the commission of the crime in 
June 1991, and point to the accused as the malefactors, particularly 
Webb, despite evidence, documentary and testimonial, supporting his 
alibi?<br><br>The explanation for this feat of wizardry is within 
arms-length - Alfaro appears to be a rehearsed witness. Prior to her 
decision to surface and claim to tell what she "knew" about the crimes, 
the crimes had already been played out in the media, both print and 
broadcast, in every gory detail.&nbsp; It was a raging topic that drew 
intense discussions in both talk shows and informal gatherings, and all 
sorts of speculations about it were rife.&nbsp; In fact, prior to the arrest 
of the accused, members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) arrested
 some members of an "<i>akyat-bahay</i>" gang who were charged 
accordingly. These gang members were later released upon orders of the 
Makati Regional Trial Court after it was discovered that their 
confessions were fabricated by the PNP to conform to the physical 
evidence found at the crime scene.<br><br>It is not thus difficult to 
believe that Alfaro could have become familiar with the evidentiary 
details of the crimes, given that she was practically a resident at the 
offices of the NBI which was actively investigating the crimes, not to 
mention her being an NBI "star" witness.<br><br>Sadly, dissenters choose to gloss over the <u>strikingly uncanny similarities</u> between the confessions of the "<i>akyat-bahay</i>"
 gang members and Alfaro's testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature and extent of the 
similarities were amplified by Justice Dacudao in his Dissenting 
Opinion, which is quoted at length<i>:</i><br><br><blockquote>It also bothers me that <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Ms. Alfaro's narration</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of the events in the case under review </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">was
 in many points uncannily similar to that set forth in the extrajudicial
 confessions or sinumpaang salaysay executed by certain members</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of 
the so-called "Akyat Bahay Gang</span>" of the Barroso group (the brothers 
Villardo Datuin Barroso, Jr. and Roberto Datuin Barroso and their 
several companions Rolando Mendoza y Gomez, Ernesto Cesar, Bienvenido 
Baydo, Angelito Santos y Bisen, Boy Kulit, Rey Doe and several other 
John Does). These persons were earlier charged with two cases of robbery
 with homicide, and one case of rape with homicide that is now the very 
subject of the case under review.&nbsp; Indeed, I cannot understand why the 
three criminal cases that were instituted before the Makati City RTC, 
Brnach 63, (presided over by Judge Julio R. Logarta,) which<b> recited facts and events that are so strikingly akin to those set forth in the information</b>
 filed in the case under review, hardly commanded the attention of the 
trial court.&nbsp; The records of these criminal cases, which were introduced
 in evidence by the accused-appellants during the trial of the case 
under review, covered the following:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Criminal Case No. 
91-7135 filed by then Assistant Chief State Prosecutor Aurelio C. Trampe

 thereby inflicting upon her multiple stab wounds causing her 
instantaneous death.<br><span><span></span></span><br>Contrary to law.<span><span><span></span></span></span></blockquote><br><br>Consider this:&nbsp; In 
the aforementioned cases, one of the accused therein (Angelito Santos y 
Bisen) who by his account was bothered by his conscience, surrendered 
and executed an affidavit or sinumpaang salaysay narrating his 
participation in the gruesome killing of members of the Vizconde family 
and the rape-killing of a young Vizconde girl.&nbsp; And based on the 
extrajudicial confessions of the accused in these cases (specifically 
Angelito Santos y Bisen, Ernesto L. Cesar, the Barroso brothers 
Villardo, Jr. and Roberto, and Rolando G. Mendoza) it appears that the 
group conspired to rob the house of the Vizcondes in W. Vinzons Street 
inside the BF Subdivision; that they used at least two (2) vehicles in 
going there (a mint green Toyota Corona, and an owner's tinted jeepney);
 that when they entered the subdivision, one of them motioned to the 
security guards manning the gate that the other vehicles were with him; 
that when they reached the Vizconde residence at W. Vinzons Street, BF 
Homes, one of them (Bienvenido "Ben" Baydo) climbed the fence, and once 
inside the house opened the gate for the group; that Bienvenido "Ben" 
Baydo put-out the light in the garage; that using a stone "na binalot sa
 basahan" Ben Baydo broke the glass in the door and opened it; that a 
woman who had apparently been roused from sleep (apparently referring to
 Mrs. Estrellita Nicolas Vizconde) came near the door and shouted 
"magnanakaw"; that Ben Baydo gagged the woman and dragged her inside the
 master's bedroom where Ben Baydo, Boy Kulit, Rolando Mendoza and 
Roberto Barroso stabbed her several times (one knife used in stabbing 
was described as "isang double blade na mga anim na pulgada ang haba 
nang talim"); that when a young girl (apparently referring to Jennifer 
Nicolas Vizconde) inside started to cry and shout, she too was stabbed 
to death by Rolando Mendoza, Ernesto Cesar, Villardo Barroso, Jr., Ben 
Baydo and Boy Kulit; that in one of the rooms they found a young woman 
(apparently referring to Carmela Nicolas Vizconde) who was raped 
successively by Roberto Barroso, Rolando Mendoza, Ben Baydo, and Ernesto
 Cesar and later repeatedly stabbed to death; and that they ransacked 
the house for valuables and were able to find cash and jewelries which 
they later on divided among themselves.&nbsp; Some of the pieces of jewelry 
were pawned by some of the accused at the Tambunting Pawnshop and the La
 Cebuana Pawnshop at Dart, Paco.&nbsp; <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Carefully evaluated</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, it is plain enough that the statements contained in the extrajudicial confessions or sinumpaang salaysay also </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">overlapped or corroborated each other in their material particulars</b><b style="text-decoration: underline;">.</b><br><br>Stock
 must be taken of the fact that the detailed extrajudicial confessions 
or sinumpaang salaysay of the several accused (especially Villardo 
Barroso y Datuin, Jr., Roberto Barroso y Datuin, his Rolando Mendoza y 
Gomez, Ernesto Cesar y Lizardo, Angelito Santos y Bisen) in the three 
criminal cases, were acknowledged and ratified before Judge Roberto L. 
Makalintal, Atty. Luis Matro, Atty. Francis Tolentino and Atty. Salvador
 B. Aguas, who affirmed that the said extrajudicial confessions or 
sinumpaang salaysay were freely and voluntarily given by the affiants, 
and that no duress violence, intimidation or coercion of any kind was 
employed against the affiants when the latter gave their statements if 
they did not want to; and that indeed the affiants were made aware of 
their constitutional right to have a lawyer of their choice to assist 
them during the custodial investigation and to remain silent if they 
wished to.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as seen in the consolidated decision rendered 
in the three criminal cases, these extrajudicial confessions or 
sinumpaang salaysay were declared inadmissible by the Makati City RTC, 
for having been allegedly obtained through duress, threats, or 
intimidation.&nbsp; The dismissal of these criminal cases nowithstanding, it 
does not detract from the fact:&nbsp; (1) that said criminal case had indeed 
been filed in court, (2) that the criminal indictments were erected on 
the strength of the extrajudicial confessions or sinumpaang salaysay 
executed by the accused therein,&nbsp; (3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">these extrajudicial 
confessions or sinumpaang salaysay set forth facts and events that are 
eerily similar to those which found their way into the information</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 
was filed in the case under review</span>; (4) that the victims in the three 
criminal cases are also the victims in the case under review; and (5) 
that since the accused therein had been duly arraigned, as indeed, 
criminal proceedings had been commenced thereon before a competent 
court, the accused therein were in real danger of being convicted of the
 felonies charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>On
 the questioned inconsistencies between Alfaro's April 28, 1995 and May 
22, 1995 Affidavits, the dissenters brush them aside as not necessarily 
affecting her credibility, citing <i>People v. Sanchez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><i> </i>which held:<br><br><blockquote>.
 . .&nbsp; [W]e advert to that all-too familiar rule that discrepancies 
between sworn statements and testimonies made at the witness stand do 
not necessarily discredit the witnesses.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sworn statement/affidavits are
 generally subordinated in importance to open court declarations</span> because
 the former are often executed when an affiant's mental faculties a<span style="text-decoration: underline;">re 
not in such a state as to afford him a fair opportunity of narrating in 
full the incident which has transpired</span>.&nbsp; Testimonies given during trials
 are much more exact and elaborate. Thus, testimonial evidence carries 
more weight than sworn statements/affidavits.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>It
 bears emphasis that the questioned inconsistencies in Alfaro's 
Affidavits, and indeed they are too glaring to escape attention, arise 
not from an affidavit and testimony at the witness stand but from t<span style="text-decoration: underline;">wo 
affidavits.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>And the dissenters forget that the <i>first</i> 
Affidavit, dated April 28, 1995, was given about two months shy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">four</span> 
years from the occurrence of the crime in late June 1991 and, therefore,
 her mental faculties could not have been in "such a state as [not] to 
afford [her] a fair opportunity of narrating in full the incident" 
subject of her tale. The <i>second</i> Affidavit, on the other hand, was executed 24 days after the <i>first</i>
 Affidavit or on May 22, 1995.&nbsp; Do the dissenters find that Alfaro's 
mental faculties were more refreshed at a date more remote from the 
occurrence of the crime she claims to have witnessed?<br><br>Again, as did the lower courts, the dissenters disregard the glaring inconsistencies between Alfaro's two affidavits <i>vis-à-vis</i>
 her testimony in open court which undeniably detract from credibility â”€
 of witness and of testimony.&nbsp; Consider these inconsistencies reflected

 dissenters approvingly note the trial court's findings that Alfaro had 
sufficiently explained these discrepancies between her two affidavits as
 arising from a desire "<u>to <b>protect</b> her former boyfriend Estrada and her relative Gatchalian, <b>the absence of a lawyer</b> during the first taking of her statements by the NBI, <b>her distrust of the first investigators</b> who took her statements and prepared her April 28, 1995 affidavit</u>, and her <u><b>uncertainty</b> if she could obtain adequate support and security for her own life</u> were she to disclose everything she knows about the Vizconde killings."&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)<br><br>There was, however, no rational basis for Alfaro to mistrust her "handler" Sacaguing who was present at the execution of the <i>first</i>
 Affidavit, or the NBI for that matter, she, as stated earlier, having 
been accorded special treatment precisely because she was one of the 
more valuable "assets" of the NBI.&nbsp; Sacaguing himself testified that

sympathy and even for her spiritual needs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>

accused's petitions assailing, among other orders, the trial court's 
order denying their right to cross examine Alfaro, <u>for purposes of impeachment</u>, on her conflicting Affidavits.&nbsp; Thus, the appellate court, in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 39839 and 39840 of June 21, 1996, held:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>[T]he
 issue of the right of petitioners to cross-examine Jessica Alfaro on 
the alleged inconsistencies between her first and second affidavits is 
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">too crucial to be simply</span> brushed aside with a perfunctory application of
 the general rule adverted to in the preceding paragraphs.&nbsp; <b><u>It may bring about a failure of justice</u></b>.&nbsp;
 Consequently, we consider the actuations of respondent judge in this 
regard to be reviewable by certiorari under rule 65 of the Rules of 
Court. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>Under Section 11, 
Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, an adverse party's witness may be 
impeached (1) by contradictory evidence; (2) by evidence that his 
general reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity is bad; (3) <b><u>by evidence that he has made at other times statement inconsistent with his present testimony</u></b>;
 and (4) by producing the record of his conviction of an offense.&nbsp; 
Insofar as impeachment by evidence of prior inconsistent statements 
however, under Section 13 of the same Rule 132, a proper foundation must
 first be laid, in that, the attention of the witness should first be 
called to such statements, and he should be asked whether or not he made
 them, and afforded an opportunity for explanation, or affirmance, or 
denial of the authenticity of the writing.&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring 
in the original)</blockquote><br>A testimony given four years after the 
occurrence of crime which gives minute details that even contradict 
tales earlier given is too incredible as to draw dubiety.&nbsp; The lucid 
observations of Court of Appeals Justice Renato C. Dacudao in his 
Dissent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> for the acquittal of the accused, and the graphic analysis of Justice Roberto Abad in his <i>ponencia </i>on why Alfaro's testimony can not be relied upon are thus well taken.<br><br>It bears stressing that the defense's earnest assertion that <u>the
 prosecution failed to rebut the pieces of evidence, highlighted by the 
defense, that seriously dent its (the prosecution's) case has <b>not</b> been controverted</u>.<br><br>Respecting
 Alfaro's "eyewitness identification" of Webb as the rapist: As 
reflected in the tabulations above, she had conflicting claims on <u>whether</u> and <u>where</u>
 she witnessed the commission of the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; AT ALL EVENTS, such 
identification is not as accurate and authoritative as the scientific 
forms of identification evidence such as <i>Deoxyribonucleic Acid </i>(DNA) testing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 which testing could not now, in the present case, be carried out in 
view of the information of the NBI that it no longer has custody of the 
semen specimen from rape victim Carmela's cadaver, <u>claiming that it had turned it over to the trial court</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The NBI did not, however, present any documentary proof of such claim.&nbsp; <i>Parenthetically</i>, it does not appear from the records that the specimen was offered in evidence by any of the parties.<br><br>To
 Webb's credit, he had asked for the conduct of DNA evidence on October 
6, 1997, during the trial on the merits, when he filed a <u>Motion to Direct NBI to Submit Semen Specimen to DNA Analysis</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which motion the prosecution opposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; The motion was subsequently denied by the trial court by its November 25, 1997 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> citing <i>Lim v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
 to the effect that DNA, "being a relatively new science, it has not as 
yet been accorded official recognition by our courts." Besides, the 
trial court "believed" that no one in the Philippines had as yet the 
knowledge and expertise to testify on matters involving DNA testing. 
What is worse, however, is that it "believed" that DNA testing "will not
 subserve the ends of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
 If the motion had been granted and DNA analysis were carried out, 
nagging doubts on Webb's culpability for the crimes or lack of it could 
have been dissipated.<br><br><i>FINALLY</i>, even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that
 the burden of evidence had shifted to the defense, the testimonial and 
documentary evidence of the defense indubitably establishes that, with 
respect to accused Webb, he was out of the country when the crime 
occurred.<br><br>It is <b>undisputed </b>that accused Webb's travel and 
immigration documents, which have not been found to be spurious, 
unquestionably show that he left the Philippines for the United States 
on March 9, 1991 and returned to the Philippines only on October 26, 
1992.&nbsp; In rejecting Webb's alibi, the dissenters point out:<br><br><blockquote>These
 dates [March 9, 1991 and October 26, 1992] are so distant from the time
 of the commission of the crime, June 29, 1991 and June 30, 1991, and <u>it would not have been impossible during the interregnum for Webb to travel back to the country</u>
 and again fly to the US several times considering that the travel time 
on board an airline from the Philippines to San Francisco, and from San 
Francisco to the Philippines takes only about twelve (12) hours to 
fourteen (14) hours.&nbsp; Given the financial resources and political 
influence of his family, <u>it was not unlikely that Webb could have 
traveled back to the Philippines before June 29-30, 1991 and then 
departed for the US again, and returning to the Philippines in October 
1992</u>.&nbsp; There clearly exists, therefore, such <i>possibility </i>of 
Webb's presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission,
 and its excuse cannot be deemed airtight. (underscoring and italics 
supplied)</blockquote><br>It is now the dissenters' reasoning which 
turns highly speculative and conjectural, one borne out of unfounded 
suspicion.&nbsp; It suspects that the Webb family may have used its 
"financial resources and political influence" to control all the U.S. 
and Philippine immigration people, thus allowing Webb to secretly 
"travel back to the country and again fly to the U.S. <b>several times</b>"
 between March 9, 1991 and October 26, 1992.&nbsp; It bears noting that the 
prosecution proffered no evidence to establish that during the 
interregnum Webb had surreptitiously slipped out of the U.S.A. to the 
Philippines, and that he subsequently re-entered the U.S.A. by 
bypassing&nbsp;&nbsp; all immigration controls and protocols in both countries. 
This is the stuff of which spy novels are made, but not in the real 
world where the lives of innocent individuals are at stake.<br><br>Facts
 decide cases.&nbsp; Conjectures and suspicions are not facts, hence, they 
have no evidentiary value. They cannot be the bases of conviction as 
they cannot substitute for the constitutional requirement of proof of 
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Suspicions, no matter how strong they 
are, must never sway judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, given the evidence on record, <u>it is crucial to heed the Court's <b>caveat</b>
 that when an accused puts up the defense of alibi, "the courts should 
not at once have a mental prejudice against him.&nbsp; For, taken in the 
light of all the evidence on record, it may be sufficient to acquit him</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>While alibi is, indeed, a weak defense because the accused can <i>easily fabricate</i> his story to escape criminal liability,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 in the present case, Webb's alibi could not have been fabricated with 
ease.&nbsp; His travel and immigration documents showing his departure from 
the Philippines and arrival in the U.S.A., not to mention the 
testimonial and documentary evidence on his activities while in the 
U.S.A. between March 9, 1991 and October 26, 1992, deserve full credit.&nbsp;
 <u>If half the world away could not even be considered to be "so far removed from the crime scene</u>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <u>as
 to evince the physical impossibility of actual presence, then the 
defense of alibi can only be appreciated when an accused lands in a 
different planet</u>.<br><br>The dissenters cite <i>People v. Larrañaga</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><i> </i>to
 highlight the weakness of alibi as a defense.&nbsp; That case did not 
involve foreign and travel immigration documents or even the use of a 
passport, the accused therein having claimed that he was in Quezon City 
at the time the crime was committed in Cebu City.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he was 
positively identified by several prosecution witnesses whose 
testimonies, unlike Alfaro's, were credible and trustworthy, this Court 
rejected Larrañaga's alibi.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>for failure of the

 The Barroso gang members said that they got into Carmela's house by 
breaking the glass panel of the front door using a stone wrapped in 
cloth to deaden the noise. Alfaro could not use this line since the core
 of her story was that Webb was Carmela's boyfriend.&nbsp; Webb had no reason
 to smash her front door to get to see her.<br><br>Consequently, to 
explain the smashed door, Alfaro had to settle for claiming that, on the
 way out of the house, Webb picked up some stone and, out of the blue, 
hurled it at the glass-paneled front door of the Vizconde residence.&nbsp; 
His action really made no sense.&nbsp; From Alfaro's narration, Webb appeared
 rational in his decisions. It was past midnight, the house was dark, 
and they wanted to get away quickly to avoid detection. Hurling a stone 
at that glass door and causing a tremendous noise was bizarre, like 
inviting the neighbors to come.<br><br>b. The crime scene showed that 
the house had been ransacked.&nbsp; The rejected confessions of the Barroso 
"akyat-bahay" gang members said that they tried to rob the house.&nbsp; To 
explain this physical evidence, Alfaro claimed that at one point Ventura
 was pulling a kitchen drawer, and at another point, going through a 
handbag on the dining table.&nbsp; He said he was looking for the front-door 
key and the car key.<br><br>Again, this portion of Alfaro's story 
appears tortured to accommodate the physical evidence of the ransacked 
house.&nbsp; She never mentioned Ventura having taken some valuables with him
 when they left Carmela's house.&nbsp; And why would Ventura rummage a bag on
 the table for the front-door key, spilling the contents, when they had 
already gotten into the house. It is a story made to fit in with the 
crime scene although robbery was supposedly not the reason Webb and his 
companions entered that house.<br><br>c.&nbsp; It is the same thing with the 
garage light.&nbsp; The police investigators found that the bulb had been 
loosed to turn off the light.&nbsp; The confessions of the Barroso gang 
claimed that one of them climbed the parked car's hood to reach up and 
darken that light.&nbsp; This made sense since they were going to rob the 
place and they needed time to work in the dark trying to open the front 
door.&nbsp; Some passersby might look in and see what they were doing.<br><br>Alfaro
 had to adjust her testimony to take into account that darkened garage 
light.&nbsp; So she claimed that Ventura climbed the car's hood, using a 
chair, to turn the light off.&nbsp; But, unlike the Barroso "akyat-bahay" 
gang, Webb and his friends did not have anything to do in a darkened 
garage. They supposedly knew in advance that Carmela left the doors to 
the kitchen open for them.&nbsp; It did not make sense for Ventura to risk 
standing on the car's hood and be seen in such an awkward position 
instead of going straight into the house.</blockquote><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> G.R.

 the middle part of 1991, the gruesome deaths of 19-year old Carmela 
Vizconde, her mother Estrellita and 7-year old sister Jennifer in the 
hands of unknown assailants inside their home in a private subdivision 
shocked our countrymen and alarmed the authorities of the rise in 
heinous crimes, particularly those committed by individuals under the 
influence of drugs.&nbsp; Investigations conducted by the police and other 
bodies including the Senate, and even the arrest of two (2) sets of 
suspects ("<i>akyat-bahay</i>"<i> </i>gang and former contractor/workers
 of the Vizcondes), failed to unravel the truth behind the brutal 
killings - until an alleged eyewitness surfaced four (4) years later.&nbsp; 
The ensuing courtroom saga involving sons of prominent families had 
become one (1) of the most controversial cases in recent history as the 
entire nation awaited its long-delayed closure.<br><br><u><center><b>The Case</b><br></center></u><br>Subject of review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>

crime of Rape with Homicide.<br><br>The petition for review on

 RTC and CA concurred in their factual findings based mainly on the 
testimony of the prosecution's principal witness, Jessica M. Alfaro who 
is a confessed former drug user, the declarations of four (4) other 
witnesses and documentary exhibits.<br><br>Alfaro testified that on June
 29, 1991 at around 8:30 in the evening, she drove her Mitsubishi Lancer
 and, with her then boyfriend Peter Estrada, went to the Ayala Alabang 
Commercial Center parking lot to get her order of one (1) gram of <i>shabu</i>
 from Artemio "Dong" Ventura.&nbsp; There she met&nbsp; and was introduced to 
Ventura's friends: Hubert Jeffrey P. Webb, Antonio "Tony Boy" Lejano, 
Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez, Hospicio "Pyke" Fernandez, Michael Gatchalian 
and Joey Filart&nbsp; (she had previously seen them in a <i>shabu </i>house located in Parañaque which they frequented as early as January 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> while she had known&nbsp; Ventura since December 1990<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>).&nbsp; After paying for her <i>shabu</i>
 and while she was smoking it, Webb approached her and requested a favor
 for her to relay a message to a certain girl who happened to be 
Carmela, to which she agreed. After the group finished their <i>shabu </i>session,
 they proceeded to Carmela's place at No. 80 Vinzons Street, Pitong Daan
 Subdivision, BF Homes, Parañaque City.&nbsp; She and Estrada in her car 
followed the two (2) vehicles: Webb, Lejano, Ventura, Fernandez and 
Gatchalian on board a Nissan Patrol car; while Filart and Rodriguez rode
 a Mazda pick-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Upon
 reaching the area, Alfaro parked her car along Vinzons St. and 
approached the gate of the house pointed to by Webb. She pressed the 
buzzer and when a woman came out, she asked for Carmela.&nbsp; When she was 
able to talk to Carmela (an acquaintance she had met only twice in 
January 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>), Alfaro 
relayed Webb's message that he was around.&nbsp; However, Carmela said she 
cannot make it as she had just arrived home and told Alfaro to come back
 after twenty (20) minutes. She relayed the answer of Carmela to Webb 
who then instructed the group to return to Ayala Alabang Commercial 
Center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>At the same parking lot, the group had another <i>shabu </i>session
 before&nbsp;&nbsp; proceeding again to Carmela's residence in a convoy.&nbsp; Alfaro 
went to Vinzons St. alone while the Nissan Patrol and Mazda parked 
somewhere along Aguirre Avenue.&nbsp; Upon seeing Carmela who was at their 
garden, Alfaro was approached by Carmela saying she was going out for a 
while.&nbsp; Carmela told Alfaro that they come back before 12:00 midnight 
and she would just leave the pedestrian gate, as well as the iron grill 
gate leading to the kitchen door, open and unlocked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 Carmela further instructed Alfaro to blink her car's headlights twice 
before reaching the pedestrian gate to signal her arrival.&nbsp; Alfaro 
returned to her car but waited for Carmela's car to get out of the gate.
 Carmela drove ahead and Alfaro likewise left Vinzons St. Upon reaching 
the main road, Aguirre Avenue, she saw Carmela drop off the man who was 
with her in the car (whom she thought to be her boyfriend<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>).&nbsp;
 Alfaro looked for the group and relayed Carmela's instructions to Webb.
 Thereafter, they all went back to the Ayala Alabang Commercial Center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>At
 the parking lot, Alfaro relayed to the group what transpired during her
 last conversation with Carmela.&nbsp; She also told Webb about Carmela's 
male companion; this changed his mood for the rest of the evening ("<i>bad trip</i>"<i> </i>already<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>).&nbsp; Webb then gave out complimentary cocaine and all of them used <i>shabu</i> and/or cocaine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> After about 40 to 45 minutes, Webb decided it was time to leave, declaring: "<i>Pipilahan natin siya </i>[Carmela]<i> at ako ang mauuna.</i>"<i>&nbsp; </i>Lejano said: "<i>Ako ang susunod</i>" and the others responded "<i>Okay, okay</i>."&nbsp;
 They all left the parking lot and their convoy of three (3) vehicles 
entered Pitong Daan Subdivision for the third time. They arrived at the 
Vizconde residence between 11:45 to 11:55 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Alfaro
 parked her car in between the Vizconde house and its adjacent house. 
While waiting for the rest of the group to alight from their cars, 
Fernandez approached her suggesting that they blow up the transformer 
near the pedestrian gate of the Vizconde residence in order to cause a 
brownout ("<i>Pasabugin kaya natin ang transformer na ito</i>"<i>)</i>. She shrugged off the idea and told Fernandez "<i>Malakas lang ang tama mo.</i>"
 When Webb, Lejano and Ventura were already standing infront of the 
Vizconde residence, Webb repeated to the boys that they will line up for
 Carmela but he will be the first, and the others said, "<i>O sige, dito lang kami, magbabantay lang kami.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Alfaro
 entered first the pedestrian gate which was left open, followed by 
Webb, Lejano and Ventura.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the garage, Ventura pulled out a chair to
 get on top of the hood of the Vizcondes' Nissan Sentra car and loosened
 the electric bulb ("<i>para daw walang ilaw</i>"<i>).</i>&nbsp; They 
proceeded to the iron grill gate which was likewise left open, and 
passed through the dirty kitchen.&nbsp; It was Carmela who opened the 
aluminum screen door of the kitchen for them to enter. Carmela and Webb 
for a moment looked at each other in the eye, and then proceeded towards
 the dining area.&nbsp; As she lost sight of Carmela and Webb, Alfaro decided
 to go out of the house.&nbsp; Lejano asked where she was going and she told 
him she will smoke outside.&nbsp; On her way to the screen door, she saw 
Ventura pulling a drawer in the kitchen.&nbsp; At the garden area, she smoked
 a cigarette.&nbsp; After about twenty (20) minutes, she was surprised upon 
hearing a female voice uttered "<i>Sino yan?</i>" and she immediately 
walked out towards her car. She found the others still outside around 
her car and Estrada who was inside the car said: "<i>Okay ba?</i>"&nbsp; 
After staying in her car for about ten (10) minutes, she returned to the
 house passing through the same iron grill gate and dirty kitchen. While
 it was dark inside the house, there was light coming from outside. In 
the kitchen, she saw Ventura searching a lady's bag on top of the dining
 table.&nbsp; When she asked Ventura what was it he was looking for, he said:
 "<i>Ikaw na nga dito, maghanap ka ng susi.</i>"&nbsp; She asked him what particular key and he replied: "<i>Basta maghanap ka ng susi ng main door pati na rin ng susi ng kotse.</i>"&nbsp;
 When she found a bunch of keys in the bag, she tried them on the main 
door of the house but none of them fitted the lock; she also did not 
find any car key.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Unable
 to open the main door, Alfaro walked back towards the kitchen but upon 
reaching the spot leading to the dining area, she heard a very loud 
static sound (like that coming from a television which had signed off).&nbsp;
 Out of curiosity, she went to the door of the master's bedroom where 
the sound was coming from and peeped inside. She pushed the slightly 
ajar door with her fingers and the sound grew even louder.&nbsp; After 
pushing the door wider, she walked into the room.&nbsp; There she saw a man 
on top of Carmela who was lying on the floor, two (2) bloodied bodies on
 top of the bed and Lejano who was at the foot of the bed about to wear 
his jacket. She turned her eyes on Carmela who was gagged, moaning and 
in tears while Webb was pumping her, his bare buttocks exposed.&nbsp; Webb 
gave her a look and she immediately left the room.&nbsp; At the dining area, 
she met Ventura who told her: "<i>Prepare an escape.&nbsp; Aalis na tayo.</i>"<i>&nbsp; </i>Shocked by what she saw, Alfaro rushed out of the house and found the rest of the group outside, in her car and on the sidewalk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Alfaro
 boarded her car and started the engine but did not know where to 
proceed.&nbsp; She saw Webb, Lejano and Ventura leaving the house already.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Webb suddenly picked up a stone and threw it to the main door, breaking 
its glass frame. When the three (3) were near the pedestrian gate, Webb 
told Ventura that he left behind his jacket.&nbsp; But Ventura said they 
cannot make it anymore as the iron grills were already locked.&nbsp; They all
 rode in their cars and drove away until they reached Aguirre Avenue.&nbsp; 
Near an old hotel in the Tropical Palace area, Alfaro saw the Nissan 
Patrol slow down and something thrown out into a cogonal area. They went
 to a large house with high walls and concrete fence, steel gate and 
long driveway located at BF Executive Village. They parked their cars 
inside the compound and gathered in the lawn area where the "blaming 
session" took place.&nbsp; It was only at this point that Alfaro and the 
others came to know fully what happened at the Vizconde house. The 
mother was the first one (1) killed, then Jennifer and the last, 
Carmela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Ventura was blaming Webb telling him: "<i>Bakit naman pati yung bata?</i>"&nbsp;
 According to Webb, the girl was awakened and upon seeing him molesting 
Carmela, she jumped on him, bit his shoulders and pulled his hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Webb got mad and grabbed the girl, pushed her to the wall and stabbed 
her several times.&nbsp; Lejano excused himself and used the telephone inside
 the house, while Webb called up someone on his cellular phone. At 
around 2:00 in the morning, Gerardo Biong arrived and talked to Webb who
 ordered him to clean up the Vizconde house, and said "<i>Pera lang ang katapat nyan.</i>"<i>&nbsp; </i>Biong answered "<i>Okay lang</i>."&nbsp; Webb addressed the group and gave his final instructions:&nbsp; "We don't know each other. We haven't seen each other...<i>baka maulit yan.</i>"&nbsp; She and Estrada then departed and went to her father's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>Dr. Prospero A. Cabanayan</b>,
 medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), who
 conducted the autopsy on the cadavers of the victims, testified on his 
findings as stated in the autopsy reports he submitted to the court.&nbsp; 
The bodies were photographed showing their condition before the start of
 the post-mortem examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Considering that they were almost in complete <i>rigor mortis</i>,
 the victims must have been dead for twelve (12) hours.&nbsp; Carmela's hands
 were on her back hogtied with an electric cord and her mouth gagged 
with a pillow case.&nbsp; She had contusions on her right forearm and thighs,
 ligature marks on her wrists and nine (9) stab wounds on her chest 
(five <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> wounds are 
"connecting" or reaching to the back of the body). Further, specimen 
taken from her genitalia tested positive for the presence of human 
spermatozoa, which is indicative of complete penetration plus 
ejaculation of the male sex organ into the female sex organ.&nbsp; The 
contusions on her thighs were probably due to the application of blunt 
force such as a fist blow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Dr.
 Cabanayan further testified that Estrellita was also hogtied from 
behind and her wrists bore ligature marks from an electric cord with a 
plug. She sustained twelve (12) stab wounds, eight (8) of which are 
"communicating" or perforating (through and through stab wounds) which 
are fatal since vital organs are involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp;
 As to Jennifer, her stab wounds, nineteen (19) in all, had the 
characteristics of one (1) which is extremely blunt, the other extremely
 sharp. These wounds are located in different parts of her body, most of
 which are on the left anterior chest. But unlike Carmela and 
Estrellita, Jennifer had two (2) stab wounds on her back and incise 
wounds on her left and right forearms, the latter usually referred to as
 defense wounds. Seven (7) of the nine (9) stab wounds on her chest were
 perforating, hence fatal wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp;
 Judging from the characteristics of the stab wounds sustained by the 
victims, Dr. Cabanayan concluded that they could have been inflicted 
using sharp-edged, pointed and single-bladed instruments such as a 
kitchen knife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>Normal E. White</b>,<b> Jr., </b>
 one (1) of four (4) security guards assigned at Pitong Daan Subdivision
 which is part of the United BF Homes, testified that he and Edgar 
Mendez were the guards on duty on the night of June 29, 1991, starting 
at 7:00 o'clock in the evening until 7:00 o'clock in the morning of June
 30, 1991. On June 30, 1991, at around 6:00 a.m., a homeowner called his
 attention on the incident the previous night at the Vizconde house.&nbsp; He
 immediately proceeded to said house where there were already many 
people.&nbsp; The housemaids of the Vizcondes led him to the entrance at the 
kitchen and pointed to the master's bedroom. Upon entering the room, he 
saw the bloodied bodies of the victims: two (2) were on top of the bed, 
and one (1) lying down on the floor.&nbsp; He is familiar with Mrs. Vizconde,
 Carmela and Jennifer because they were kind to the guards and usually 
greeted them. Mrs. Vizconde was gagged and her hands tied, while 
Jennifer was also lying on top of the bed. Carmela was lying on her back
 with one (1) of her legs raised, her dress pulled up and her genitals 
exposed. He also noticed that the TV was still on with loud sound.&nbsp; He 
went out to call the police but he met their Security Chief whom he 
informed about the killings at the Vizconde house. He then proceeded 
directly to the entrance/guard post of the subdivision and was told by 
Mendez that there were already policemen who had arrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Having
 been apprised of the arrival of the police, White, Jr. returned to the 
Vizconde house to observe what was going on. He saw the policemen 
already investigating the crime scene and one (1) of them he later came 
to know as Gerardo Biong.&nbsp; There was also a woman who was with Biong 
when he was conducting the investigation inside the Vizconde premises at
 the garage area. The maids were being asked if they were able to hear 
the breaking of the main door's glass frame, and he saw Biong in the act
 of further breaking the remaining glass. He recognized other homeowners
 who were also there, including Michael Gatchalian who passed by infront
 of the house. Afterwards, he returned to their guard post where their 
Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Justo Cabanacan, probed him and Mendez on 
anything they had observed the previous night.&nbsp; He and Mendez told 
Cabanacan that they did not notice anything unusual except "Mike" 
(Michael Gatchalian) and his friends entering and exiting the 
subdivision gate ("<i>labas-masok</i>").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>White,
 Jr.&nbsp; recounted that Mike's group entered the subdivision on the night 
of June 29, 1991. Upon approaching the gate, Mike's car slowed down on 
the hump.&nbsp; He was about to flag down and verify ("<i>sisitahin</i>") but
 Mike (who was at the right front seat) immediately opened his window to
 show his face and pointed to two (2) vehicles behind him as his 
companions.&nbsp; Because of&nbsp; their policy allowing outsiders to enter the 
subdivision as long as they are accompanied by a homeowner, he and 
Mendez just let the three (3) vehicles in (Mike was in the first car). 
That was actually the second time he saw Mike and his "<i>barkada</i>" 
that night because he had earlier seen them at Vinzons St. near the 
Gatchalian residence.&nbsp; However, he could no longer remember the precise 
time he saw the group on these two (2) instances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>White,
 Jr. further testified that on the night of June 30, 1991, policemen 
took him from the Pitong Daan Subdivision Homeowners' Association and 
brought him to the Parañaque Municipal Building. Biong was forcing him 
to admit that he was one (1) of those who killed the Vizconde women. 
Biong boxed him insisting he was among the perpetrators and had no mercy
 for the victims.&nbsp;&nbsp; He and Mendez were later fetched by the Chief of 
Security of Pitong Daan Subdivision Homeowners' Association, Nestor 
Potenciano Jr., and OIC Justo Cabanacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Biong had also taken their logbook where they list down the names of 
visitors, plate number of vehicles, name and street of the homeowner 
they were staying at, etc. However, when presented with the alleged 
logbook, White, Jr. said it was not the same logbook, he could not 
recognize its cover and could not categorically confirm the entries 
supposedly made in his own handwriting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b>Justo Cabanacan</b>,
 another security guard assigned at the Pitong Daan Subdivision and the 
one (1) supervising his co-guards White, Jr., Mendez and Tungo, 
testified that when he reported for duty on June 30, 1991 at about 7:00 
o'clock in the morning, he was met by Mendez who told him about the 
killing of a homeowner and her family.&nbsp; When he asked Mendez if he and 
White, Jr. noticed anything unusual during their tour of duty the 
previous night,&nbsp; Mendez said everything was alright except for Mike and 
his friends who had gone in and out of the subdivision ("<i>labas-masok</i>")
 until the wee hours in the morning of June 30, 1991.&nbsp; White, Jr.&nbsp; also 
reported to him that on the night of June 29, 1991, while doing his 
roving duty around the subdivision, he noticed vehicles parked along 
Vinzons St. near the house of Mr. Almogino where there seemed to be a 
drinking party, and that Mike was "<i>labas-masok</i>" through the 
subdivision gate.&nbsp; He confirmed it was indeed their policy that if one 
(1) is a son/daughter of a homeowner, or accompanied by a homeowner or 
any relative of homeowner, he/she will no longer be stopped or queried 
by the guards.&nbsp; In particular, he knows Mike and had seen him visit the 
house of Lilet Sy, another homeowner.&nbsp; He often goes to Lilet Sy's house
 because of the various complaints of homeowners against her like the 
presence of too many people at her house until midnight and the vehicles
 of her visitors running over her neighbors' plants. This Lilet Sy is 
also a suspected drug pusher within the subdivision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Cabanacan
 further testified that around the last week of May or first week of 
June 1991, he came to know Hubert Webb because he had stopped his car at
 the subdivision gate as it had no local sticker of Pitong Daan 
Subdivision. It was around 7:00 o'clock in the evening when Webb 
arrived. He greeted Webb and asked about his destination.&nbsp; Webb replied 
he was going to see Lilet Sy.&nbsp; When he asked Webb to leave an 
identification card, Webb pointed to his car sticker saying he is also a
 BF Homes resident.&nbsp; He explained to Webb that the sticker on his car 
was for United BF Homes and not the local sticker of Pitong Daan 
Subdivision.&nbsp; Webb then said:&nbsp; "<i>Taga-diyan lang ako sa Phase III...saka anak ako ni Congressman Webb</i>."&nbsp;

pulled out his wallet.&nbsp; Webb gave him a laminated ID card with Webb's

 to the room of Hubert to get his and his brothers' (Jason and 
Michael's) dirty clothes, using the small "secret door" at the second 
floor near the servants' quarters.&nbsp; She noticed that Michael and Jason 
were still asleep while Hubert was sitting on the bed wearing only his 
pants.&nbsp; When she finished collecting dirty clothes including those of 
Senator Webb, she brought them down to the laundry area. She ate 
breakfast and rested for a while.&nbsp; Afterwards, she started washing first
 Senator Webb's clothes and then those of the sons. She washed Hubert's 
white shirt with round neck and found it had fresh blood stains at the 
stomach area and also splattered blood ("<i>tilamsik lang</i>") on the 
chest.&nbsp; She had difficulty removing the blood stains and had to use 
Chlorox. After she finished washing the clothes, she hanged them to dry

into Hubert's room through the "secret door."&nbsp; She saw Hubert pacing the
 floor ("<i>di mapakali</i>"); this was about 9:00 a.m. already.&nbsp; She 
saw Hubert again around 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon as he left the

asked her to come to the Parañaque police station to play "mahjong" at 
Aling Glo's canteen located at the back of their office.&nbsp; They started 
playing at 6:30 in the evening.&nbsp; Between 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning of
 June 30, 1991, the radio operator at the police station went down to 
the canteen telling Biong he has a call. She took Biong's place at the 
game while Biong went to the headquarters. After a while, she followed 
Biong to ask if he was joining the next bet.&nbsp; Biong was on the telephone
 talking with someone and visibly irked.&nbsp; She heard Biong's words: "<i>Ano?... Saan?... Mahirap yan ah! O sige, dadating ako... Ano?... Saan?... Dilaw na taxi?</i>"<i> </i>&nbsp;
 Biong then told her he was leaving and shortly thereafter a taxicab 
arrived with a man seated at the back seat.&nbsp; Biong bade her good-bye 
saying he was going to BF Homes.&nbsp; She continued playing "mahjong" until 
morning.&nbsp; At around 7:00 a.m., Biong came back and went straight to the 
washing area of the canteen.&nbsp; She followed him and saw him cleaning 
blood stains on his fingernails.&nbsp; After wiping his face and hands with a
 handkerchief, he threw it away and when she asked why, Biong said it 
smelled stinky.&nbsp; Biong was in bad mood ("<i>aburido</i>") and complained, "<i>Putang inang mga batang `yon, pinahirapan ako nang husto</i>".
 Afterwards, Biong took out a knife with aluminum cover from his drawer 
and put it in his steel cabinet.&nbsp; She invited him for lunch but another 
policeman, Galvan, came and told Biong to proceed to BF Homes and 
investigate the three (3) dead persons there.&nbsp; Biong answered, "<i>Oo, susunod na ako" </i>and

permission, she joined them in going to the Vizconde residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Upon
 arriving at the Vizconde house, Biong asked that the victims' relatives
 and the homeowners' association President be summoned. A certain Mr. 
Lopez and Ms. Moreno arrived and also a security guard named White, Jr. 
who pointed to the location of the victims' bodies.&nbsp; They entered the 
master's bedroom and she saw the mother and a small girl on top of the 
bed, and a young woman sprawled on the floor.&nbsp; After inspecting the 
bodies, Biong went to the toilet and turned on the faucet; the running 
water washed out the blood on the flooring of the toilet. Biong searched
 the drawers using his ballpen.&nbsp; She saw him took a round pendant watch 
and pocketed it.&nbsp; They went out of the room and on the top of the dining
 table they saw a shoulder bag and scattered next to it were various 
items such as Carmela's ATM card, her driver's license and calling 
cards.&nbsp; Biong proceeded to the main door and removed its chain lock. 
When they came out towards the garage area, Biong saw a stone by the 
window.&nbsp; He then asked Capt. Bartolome to go inside the room of the two 
(2) maids to see for himself if indeed the noise of the breaking glass 
could not be heard. When Capt. Bartolome was already inside the middle 
room, Biong shattered the remaining glass of the main door with the butt
 of his gun.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Biong asked if he could hear it, Capt. Bartolome 
answered in the affirmative. Biong next inspected the garage where he 
saw the footmarks on the car's hood; Biong also found fingerprints on 
the electric bulb.&nbsp; She was just beside Biong at the time.&nbsp; They 
followed Biong towards the back of the house but upon seeing another 
shoe print on the ground just outside the master's bedroom, he directed 
them not to proceed any further.&nbsp; They left the Vizconde house at around
 10:00 a.m. and proceeded to the Parañaque Municipal Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Birrer

 Biong arrived at her house bringing along with him the two (2) maids of
 the Vizcondes.&nbsp; He asked her to cook something for the maids to eat.&nbsp; 
Biong also instructed her to interview the maids on what they know about
 the killings.&nbsp; She did as told but the maids said they do not know 
anything as they were asleep. After they had lunch, Biong told her to 
let the maids rest.&nbsp; While she and the maids were resting at the sala, 
Biong requested to use her bathroom. Before taking a bath, Biong took 
out the contents of his pockets which he put on the dining table.&nbsp; She 
saw Carmela's ATM card and driver's license, bracelet, earrings and the 
round pendant watch Biong had taken from a jewelry box while they were 
inside the Vizconde house.&nbsp; When Biong left her house, he brought all 
said items with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On

When she asked him where it came from, Biong initially just said it was 
given as a gift but when she further queried, he answered: "<i>Natatandaan mo ba `yong nirespondehan ko noong gabi sa BF Homes? Doon galing `yon.</i>"
 She asked Biong whether those were the youths he had mentioned earlier 
and he said yes.&nbsp; As to the jewelries taken by Biong from the Vizconde 
house, she was with Biong when the latter pawned them at a pawnshop near
 Chow-Chow; Biong got P20,000.00 for the pawned items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Birrer
 further testified that two (2) weeks after they went to the Vizconde 
residence to investigate, Biong on two (2) occasions brought her along 
to a certain house.&nbsp; It was only Biong who went inside the said house as
 she waited in a taxicab. In both instances, Biong came out of the house
 with an envelope containing an undisclosed amount of money. She 
remembered this because when she was already staying in Pangasinan on 
December 7, 1995, she saw flashed on ABS-CBN's TV Patrol News 7:00 p.m. 
newscast on television, a video footage of the house of Senator Webb.

this unfortunate tragedy befell his family -- but communicated with his 
wife through telephone once or twice a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Lauro
 G. Vizconde further testified that his daughter, when she was still 
alive, was so close to him that she confides her daily activities, 
dreams, ambitions and plans in life. She intended to pursue further 
masteral and doctoral degrees in business psychology in the U.S.A.&nbsp; In 
fact, that was the reason he transferred from one (1) state to another 
looking for a school where Carmela could enroll. However, he had to come
 home in July 1991 and bury his wife and daughters whose violent deaths 
he was informed of only upon arriving in the country and when he saw 
their bodies with stab wounds at the funeral parlor just before burial. 
He spent burial expenses in the amount of P289,000.00, plus P103,000.00 
incidental expenses, P300,000.00 paid for memorial lots and around 
P100,000.00 for the construction of the mausoleum - with a grand total

 politician in Parañaque and comes from an affluent family.&nbsp; He also 
expressed his mental anguish, wounded feelings, emotional suffering due 
to the untimely demise of his family.&nbsp; It actually cost him his life, 
his heart bled all the time and only time can tell when he can fully 
cope with the situation. He is presently totally displaced and jobless; 
he misses his family and he now lives an abnormal life with no 
inspiration and no more challenge to work for. When asked how much 
compensation he will ask for moral damages, he answered saying he leaves
 the matter to the sound discretion of the court as in truth, no amount 
can truly compensate him for the loss of his loved ones.&nbsp; He sought 
justice for the death of his family and hoped that the culprits, whoever

Alabang Village.<br><br>Lejano further testified that with the exception
 of Miguel "Ging" Rodriguez and Michael "Mike" Gatchalian who are his 
former schoolmates, he does not know any of his co-accused. They left 
the house of Syap brothers early morning of June 30, 1991; it was Cas 
Syap who brought him and Mike home.&nbsp; On July 5, 1991, he and Cas Syap 
went to the police station where Mike, who was picked up as a suspect by
 the police on July 4, was detained.&nbsp; When they met Biong there, they 
told him they are willing to vouch for Mike's innocence and even 
volunteered to give statements.&nbsp; Biong told them to return the following
 day. However, when he returned in the morning of July 6, 1991, Biong 
wanted his fingerprints taken right away but he told Biong he needed to 
consult someone first.&nbsp; He eventually submitted himself for 
fingerprinting after his name came out in the media. Lejano pointed out 
that Alfaro failed to identify him even as she passed by him three (3)

 a childhood friend and neighbor of Gatchalian, who testified that he 
was among those who went inside the Vizconde house in the morning of 
June 30, 1991 and Biong even asked him to take pictures; thereupon at 
around 9:30 a.m., he saw Gatchalian&nbsp; in front of the Vizconde residence 
telling him that he just woke up and exchanged pleasantries with him;

witness and which offer was refused by Gatchalian and his father;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> and <b><i>Atty. Manuel Sunga</i> </b>who
 accompanied Gatchalian to the Department of Justice (DOJ) when he 
submitted his counter-affidavit (where there were already media people),
 testified that they were invited to&nbsp; the conference room where State 
Prosecutor Zuño in the presence of then Secretary Guingona made the 
offer for Gatchalian to turn state witness but it was rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><b>Atty. Francisco C. Gatchalian</b>
 confirmed that the NBI and later the DOJ made offers for his son to 
turn state witness in this case but they refused for the reason that his
 son was innocent of the crime charged. Michael had told him that on the
 night of June 29, 1991 until early morning of June 30, 1991, Michael 
was with his friends at Ayala Alabang Village in Muntinlupa at the 
residence of the Syaps. Gatchalian narrated that when he woke up to jog 
in the morning of June 30, 1991 around 7:00 to 7:30, he passed by the 
Vizconde house and saw people milling in front.&nbsp; At about 8:30 a.m., he 
saw the crowd getting bigger and so he instructed Michael who had 
wakened up, to find out and check what happened to their neighbor.&nbsp; 
Michael rushed out towards the Vizconde residence and when he came back 
about 10:00 o'clock that same morning, he reported that the house was 
robbed and people were killed inside the house.&nbsp; Both of them stayed in 
their house that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; He denied Alfaro's claim that she was their 
distant relative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Accused <b>Miguel Rodriguez</b>
 maintained he was at home when the killings took place.&nbsp; He presented 
as witness his first cousin Mark Josef Andres Rualo who testified that 
at around 1:00 in the morning of June 30, 1991, he called up Rodriguez 
asking why he has not yet proceeded to the birthday party of Rualo at 
their house. Rodriguez replied that he could not make it because he was 
not fetched by his brother Art (who was the one with a car).&nbsp; So he 
handed the telephone to Art (who had arrived at the party around 9:30 to
 10:00 p.m.) for them to talk.&nbsp; From Rodriguez's residence at Pilar 
Village, it will take about fifteen (15) to twenty (20) minutes by car.&nbsp;
 It was a big party attended by some eighty (80) guests and which ended 
by 3:30 to 4:00 a.m.&nbsp; But it was only the first time he had invited 
Rodriguez to his birthday party. He knows Lejano, Rodriguez's close 
friend and classmate, because Rodriguez used to bring him along when 
Rodriguez comes to his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>The
 other witnesses presented by Rodriguez, Col. Charles Calima, Jr. and 
Michael Rodriguez, testified on the alleged incident of "mistaken 
identity" wherein Alfaro supposedly pointed to one (1) "Michael 
Rodriguez," a drug dependent who was pulled out by Col. Calima from the 
Bicutan Rehabilitation Center on the basis of the description given by 
NBI agents. They testified that when Alfaro confronted this "Michael 
Rodriguez," she became very emotional and immediately slapped and kicked
 him telling him, "How can I forget your face.&nbsp; We just saw each other 
in a disco one month ago and you told me then that you will kill me."&nbsp; 
Contrary to the physical description given by the NBI, the accused 
Miguel Rodriguez he saw inside the court room had no tattoo on his arm 
and definitely not the same "Michael Rodriguez" whom Alfaro slapped and 
kicked at the NBI premises. Michael Rodriguez testified that he was 
blindfolded and brought to the comfort room by NBI agents and forced to 
admit that he was Miguel Rodriguez; he identified Alfaro and Atty. 
Figueras from a collage of photographs shown to him in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Accused <b>Gerardo Biong </b>testified
 that the last time he handled this case was when General Filart 
announced the case as solved with the presentation of suspects sometime 
in October 1991.&nbsp; However, he was subpoenaed by the NBI for the taking 
of his statement because Lauro Vizconde complained that he had stolen 
jewelries at the Vizconde house.&nbsp; He had sought the examination of 
latent fingerprints lifted from the crime scene but the suspects turned 
out negative when tested.&nbsp; He denied the accusation regarding the 
destruction of evidence as well as missing items during his 
investigation at the Vizconde residence. The bloodied bed, mats, pillows
 and bed sheets were burned by people at the funeral parlor as ordered 
by Mr. Gatmaitan. Among the suspects he had then were Michael 
Gatchalian, Tony Boy Lejano and Cas Syap.&nbsp; As to the testimony of Birrer
 that they played "mahjong" on the night of June 29, 1991, he said it 
was not true because the place was closed on Saturdays and Sundays.&nbsp; 
After a surveillance on Birrer, he discovered she had in her possession 
Carmela's driver's license and was driving a car already.&nbsp;&nbsp; He denied 
Birrer's account that he went to a place after receiving a telephone 
call at 2:30 in the morning of June 30, 1991.&nbsp; As to Alfaro, he met her 
for the first time at the NBI on June 23, 1995.&nbsp; His brown jacket was 
given to him long ago by a couple whose dispute he was able to settle. 
He only met Webb and Estrada at the NBI. Biong denied the accusations of
 Birrer, saying that she was angry at him because they separated and he 
had hit her after he heard about her infidelity. Neither has he seen 
Alfaro before the filing of this case.&nbsp; He was administratively charged 
before the Philippine National Police (PNP) for Grave Misconduct due to 
non-preservation of evidence.&nbsp; He was offered by the NBI to turn state 
witness but he declined as he found it difficult to involve his 
co-accused whom he does not really know.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Biong
 admitted that Birrer went along with him, Galvan and Capt. Bartolome to
 the Vizconde residence in the morning of June 30, 1991.&nbsp; Upon arriving 
at the Vizconde house, he looked for the victims' relatives and the 
homeowners' association president; Atty. Lopez and Mrs. Mia came.&nbsp; In 
going inside the house, they passed through the kitchen door which was 
open already.&nbsp; On top of the kitchen table, there was a lady's bag with 
things scattered; he later inspected them but did not think of examining
 the bag or taking note of the calling cards and other items for 
possible relevance to the investigation.&nbsp; Upon entering the master's 
bedroom, he saw the bloodied bodies. Mrs. Vizconde's hands were hogtied 
from behind and her mouth gagged while Jennifer's body was also 
bloodied.&nbsp; Carmela who was lying on a floor carpet was likewise gagged, 
her hands hogtied from behind and her legs spread out, her clothes 
raised up and a pillow case was placed on top of her private part.&nbsp; He 
had the bodies photographed and prepared a spot report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Biong
 also admitted that before the pictures were taken, he removed with his 
bare hands the object, which was like a stocking cloth, that was wrapped
 around Carmela's mouth and neck. As to the main door glass, it was the 
upper part which he broke. There was a red jewelry box they saw where a 
pearl necklace inside could be seen; he remembered he had it 
photographed but he had not seen those pictures. They left the Vizconde 
house and brought the cadavers to the funeral parlor.&nbsp; He did not take 
steps to preserve the bloodied carpet, bed sheets and blankets because 
they have been previously told by NBI that no evidence can be found on 
such items.&nbsp; As for the footprint and shoe print found on the hood of 
the car and at the back of the house, he also could not recall if he had
 those photographed. It was only the following day that he brought an 
employee of the Parañaque police to lift fingerprints from the crime 
scene; he was the one (1) giving instructions at the time.&nbsp; However, no 
latent fingerprints had been taken; despite attempts, no clear 
fingerprint had been lifted and he did not any more ask why.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Biong
 further admitted that he was so angry with the Vizconde housemaids as 
he did not believe they did not hear anything despite the loud sound of 
the breaking of the main door glass.&nbsp; He also admitted mauling Normal E.
 White, Jr. because he thought he was withholding information during the
 investigation.&nbsp; Edgar Mendez did not tell him about the entry of a 
three (3)-vehicle convoy into the subdivision on the night of June 29, 
1991. As for Michael Gatchalian, he knows him because on July 3, 1991 at
 4:30 a.m., they caught him at Vinzons St. at the entrance of Pitong 
Daan Subdivision for possession of marijuana. However, he does not know 
any more what happened to that case he filed against Gatchalian as he 
was already dismissed from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> He also admitted having mauled Gatchalian while interrogating him for his participation in the Vizconde killings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></center><br>On January 4, 2000, the trial court rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> finding all the accused guilty as charged, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,

 trial court found Alfaro as a credible and truthful witness, 
considering the vast details she disclosed relative to the incident she 
had witnessed inside the Vizconde house. The trial court noted that 
Alfaro testified in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and 
frank manner, and has remained consistent in her narration of the events
 despite a lengthy and grueling cross-examination conducted on her by 
eight (8) defense lawyers. Neither was her credibility and veracity of 
her declarations in court affected by the differences and 
inconsistencies between her April 28, 1995 and May 22, 1995 affidavits, 
which she had satisfactorily explained during the trial considering the 
circumstances that she initially desired to protect her former boyfriend
 Estrada and her relative Gatchalian, the absence of a lawyer during the
 first taking of her statements by the NBI, her distrust of the first 
investigators who took her statements and prepared her April 28, 1995 
affidavit, and her uncertainty if she could obtain adequate support and 
security for her own life were she to disclose everything she knows 
about the Vizconde killings.<br><br>On the other hand, the trial court 
ruled that principal accused Webb, Lejano, Rodriguez and Gatchalian 
failed to establish their defense of <i>alibi, </i>the accused having 
been positively identified by Alfaro as the group who conspired and 
assisted one (1) another in plotting and carrying out on the same night 
the rape of Carmela, on the occasion of which Carmela's mother and 
sister were also stabbed to death.&nbsp; The trial court held that Alfaro 
gave a clear, positive and convincing testimony which was sufficiently 
corroborated on its material points by the testimonies of other 
witnesses and confirmed by the physical evidence on record.<br><br><u><center><b>The Court of Appeals Ruling</b><br></center></u><br>By Decision of December 15, 2005, the CA affirmed with modification the trial court's decision:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,

 CA upheld the trial court in giving full weight and credence to&nbsp; the 
eyewitness testimony of Alfaro which was duly corroborated by other 
prosecution witnesses who had not been shown to have ill-motive and 
malicious intent in revealing what they know about the Vizconde 
killings. It disagreed with the appellants' view that they were victims 
of an unjust judgment upon their mere allegations that they were tried 
by publicity, and that the trial judge was biased whose discriminatory 
and hostile attitude was demonstrated by her rejection of 132 out of 142
 exhibits of the defense during the bail hearings and her refusal to 
issue subpoenas to prospective defense witnesses such as former 
Secretary Teofisto Guingona and Antonio Calvento.<br><br>The CA also 
fully concurred with the trial court's conclusion that all the principal
 accused failed to establish their defense of <i>alibi</i> after 
carefully evaluating the voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence
 presented by the defense. On the issue of conspiracy, the CA found that
 the prosecution was able to clearly and convincingly establish its 
presence in the commission of the crime, notwithstanding that appellants
 Rodriguez, Gatchalian, Estrada and Fernandez did not actually rape 
Carmela, nor participated in killing her, her mother and sister.<br><br>On
 motion for reconsideration filed by the appellants, the CA's Special 
Division of Five, voting 3-2, affirmed the December 15, 2005 Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>&nbsp;
 In the Resolution dated January 26, 2007, the majority reiterated that 
it has fully explained in its Decision why the US-INS Certifications 
submitted by appellant Webb deserve little weight.&nbsp; It stressed that it 
is a case of positive identification versus <i>alibi</i> founded on documentary evidence.&nbsp; On the basis of the rule that <i>alibi </i>is
 accepted only upon the clearest proof that the accused was not and 
could not have been at the crime scene when it was committed, the CA in 
resolving the appeal considered the weight of documentary evidence in 
light of testimonial evidence -- an eyewitness account that the accused 
was the principal malefactor.&nbsp; As to the issue of apparent 
inconsistencies between the two (2) affidavits executed by Alfaro, the 
CA said this is a settled matter, citing the Joint Decision in CA-G.R. 
SP No. 42285 and CA-G.R. SP No. 42673 entitled "<i>Rodriguez v. Tolentino</i>"<i> </i>and<i> </i>"<i>Webb, et al. v. Tolentino, et al.</i>," which had long become final.<br><br><u><center><b>Appellants' Arguments</b><br></center></u><br>Appellants

assails the denial by the trial court of his motion (and also appellant 
Webb's) for DNA testing despite a certification from the NBI that the 
specimen semen remained intact, which Justice Tagle in his dissenting 
opinion also found as unjust. He further argues that the right to a 
speedy trial is violated even if the delay was not caused by the 
prosecution but by events that are not within the control of the 
prosecution or the courts.&nbsp; Thus, the length of time which took Alfaro 
to come forward and testify in this case is most conspicuous.&nbsp; Her delay
 of four (4) years in reporting the crime has to be taken against her, 
particularly with the story behind it.&nbsp; She volunteered to come forward 
only after the arrests of previous accused did not lead anywhere.&nbsp; 
Moreover, it is clear that she adopted the version previously advanced 
by an "<i>akyat-bahay</i>" gang, as noted by Justice Dacudao in his 
dissenting opinion. Gatchalian thus contends that the delay occurred 
even before a preliminary investigation was conducted and cites cases 
upholding the right of accused persons to a speedy trial where there was
 delay in the preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br><center><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Totality of Evidence Established the</b><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Guilt of Appelants Beyond Reasonable Doubt</b><br></center><br>Appellants
 assail the lower courts in giving full faith and credence to the 
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, particularly Jessica Alfaro 
despite&nbsp; inconsistencies and contradictions in her two (2) affidavits, 
and the&nbsp; alleged "piece by piece discarding" of their voluminous 
documentary exhibits and testimonies of no less than ninety-five (95) 
witnesses.&nbsp; They contend that the totality of evidence engenders a 
reasonable doubt entitling them to acquittal from the grave charge of 
rape with homicide.<br><br>After a thorough and conscientious review of 
the records,&nbsp; I firmly believe that the CA correctly upheld the 
conviction of appellants.<br><br><b><i>Credibility of Prosecution</i></b><br><b><i>Witnesses</i></b><br><br>The
 determination of the competence and credibility of a witness rests 
primarily with the trial court, because it has the unique position of 
observing the witness' deportment on the stand while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]&nbsp;</sup>
 It is a fundamental rule that findings of the trial courts which are 
factual in nature and which involve credibility are accorded respect 
when no glaring errors, gross misapprehensions of facts and speculative,
 arbitrary and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such 
findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]&nbsp;</sup> When the trial court's findings have been 
affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive 
and binding upon this Court.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</span></sup><br><br>Reexamining the 
testimony of Alfaro, who underwent exhaustive and intense 
cross-examination by eight (8) defense lawyers, it is to be noted that 
she revealed such details and observations which only a person who was 
actually with the perpetrators could have known.&nbsp; More importantly, her 
testimony was corroborated on its material points by the declarations of
 other prosecution witnesses, to wit: 
 that their convoy of three (3) vehicles repeatedly entered the Pitong 
Daan Subdivision on the night of June 29, 1991 was confirmed by the 
security guard on duty, Normal White, Jr., who also testified that he 
had seen Gatchalian and his group standing at the vicinity of the 
Almogino residence located near the end of Vinzons St., which is 
consistent with Alfaro's testimony that on their first trip to the 
subdivision she parked her car infront of the Vizconde house while 
appellants parked their respective cars near the dead end of Vinzons 
St.; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1][2]</span>&nbsp; that Ventura climbed
 on the hood of the Nissan Sentra car and loosened the light bulb to 
turn it off was confirmed by the testimony of Birrer and appellant Biong
 that they found a shoe print on the hood of the car parked inside the 
garage of the Vizconde house; even defense witnesses Dennis Almogino 
(neighbor of the Vizcondes) and SPO2 Reynaldo Carbonnel declared that 
the garage was totally without light; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[3]</span> that a lady's bag was on top of the dining table in the kitchen was likewise confirmed by Birrer and Biong; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[4]</span>
 that a loud static sound coming from the TV set inside the master's 
bedroom which led Alfaro to the said room, matched with the observations
 of the Vizconde housemaids, Birrer and&nbsp; Biong that when they went 
inside the Vizconde house in the morning of June 30, 1991, the TV set 
inside the master's bedroom was still turned on with a loud sound; <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[5]</span>
 the positioning of the dead bodies of Carmela, Estrellita and Jennifer 
and their physical appearance or condition (hogtied, gagged and 
bloodied) was correctly described by Alfaro, consistent with the 
declarations of White, Jr., Birrer and Biong who were among those who 
first saw the bodies in the morning of June 30, 1991;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[6]</span>
 that Carmela was raped by Webb and how the three (3) women were killed 
as Alfaro learned from the conversation of the appellants at the BF 
Executive Village house, was consistent with the findings of Dr. 
Cabanayan who conducted the autopsy and post-mortem examination of the 
cadavers in the morning of June 30, 1991 showing that the victims died 
of multiple stab wounds, the specimen taken from Carmela's vaginal canal
 tested positive for spermatozoa and the approximate time of death based
 on the onset of <i>rigor mortis</i>, which would place it between midnight and 2:00 o'clock in the morning of June 30, 1991; <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[7]</span>
 that Webb, just before going out of the gate of the Vizconde house, 
threw a stone which broke the glass frame of the main door, jibed with 
the testimony of Birrer who likewise saw a stone near the broken glass 
panel at the living room of the Vizconde house, and Biong himself 
testified that he even demonstrated to Capt. Bartolome and the 
housemaids the loud sound by again hitting the glass of the main door;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup>&nbsp; and <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[8]</span>
 that after Webb made a call on his cellular phone, Biong arrived at 
around 2:00 o'clock in the morning of June 30, 1991 at the BF Executive 
Village house where she and appellants retreated, was consistent with 
the testimony of Birrer that Biong left the "mahjong" session to answer a
 telephone call between 1:00 to 2:00 o'clock in the morning of June 30, 
1991 and thereafter Birrer asked where he was going, to which&nbsp; Biong 
replied "BF" and shortly thereafter a taxicab with a man at the backseat
 fetched Biong.<br><br>Indeed, Alfaro could not have divulged the 
foregoing details of the crime if she did not really join the group of 
Webb in going to the Vizconde residence and witness what happened during
 the time Webb, Lejano and Ventura were inside the house and when the 
group retreated to BF Executive Village. Contrary to appellants' 
contention, Alfaro's detailed testimony appears clear and convincing, 
thus giving the Court the impression that she was sincere and credible. 
She even opened her personal life to public scrutiny by admitting that 
she was addicted to <i>shabu</i> for sometime and that was how she came 
to meet Webb's group and got entangled in the plot to gang-rape Carmela.
 Her being a former drug user in no way taints her credibility as a 
witness. The fact that a witness is a person of unchaste character or 
even a drug dependent does not <i>per se </i>affect her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>Alfaro's
 ability to recollect events that occurred four (4) years ago with&nbsp; her 
mental condition that night of June 29, 1991 when she admittedly took <i>shabu</i>
 three (3) times and even sniffed cocaine, was likewise questioned by 
the appellants.&nbsp; When the question was posed to Alfaro on 
cross-examination, she positively stated that while indeed she had taken
 <i>shabu</i> at that time, her perception of persons and events around 
her was not diminished.&nbsp; Her faculties unimpaired by the drugs she had 
taken that night, Alfaro was able to vividly recall what transpired the 
whole time she was with appellants.&nbsp; Alfaro testified that even if she 
was then a regular <i>shabu</i> user, she had not reached that point of being paranoid <i>(</i>"<i>praning</i>").&nbsp;
 It was the first time Alfaro sniffed cocaine and she described its 
initial effect as being "stoned," but lasting only five (5) to seven (7)
 minutes.&nbsp; However, she did not fall asleep since <i>shabu </i>and "coke" are not downers.<br><br>Alfaro
 further explained her indifference and apathy in not dissuading Webb 
and her group from carrying out their evil plan against Carmela as due 
to the numbing effect of drugs, which also enabled her to dislodge from 
her mind the harrowing images of the killings for quite sometime.&nbsp; 
Eventually, the chance to redeem herself came when she was invited to a 
Christian fellowship, and with her child's future in mind, her desire to
 transform her life grew stronger.&nbsp; As she cast off her addiction to 
drugs, its desensitizing effect began to wear off and her conscience 
bothered her no end.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, the delay of four (4) 
years in admitting her involvement in the Vizconde killings cannot be 
taken against Alfaro.&nbsp; In fact, she had to muster enough courage to 
finally come out in the open considering that during her last encounter 
with appellants at a discotheque in 1995, she was threatened by 
appellant Rodriguez that if she will not keep her mouth shut, she will 
be killed.&nbsp; He even offered her a plane ticket for her to go abroad. 
Coming from wealthy and influential families, and capable of barbaric 
acts she had already seen, appellants instilled such fear in Alfaro that
 her reluctance to report to the authorities was perfectly 
understandable.<br><br>I find that the circumstances of habitual drug 
use and delay in reporting a crime did not affect the competence and 
credibility of prosecution witness Alfaro.&nbsp; It bears stressing that the 
fact of delay alone does not work against the witnesses. Delay or 
vacillation in making a criminal accusation does not necessarily impair 
the credibility of the witness if such delay is satisfactorily 
explained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>Besides, appellants failed to 
adduce any evidence to establish any improper motive that may have 
impelled Alfaro to falsely testify against them, other than their 
allegation that she regularly associated with NBI agents as one (1)&nbsp; of 
their informants. The absence of evidence of improper motive on the part
 of the said witness for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the 
conclusion that no such improper motive exists and that her testimony is
 worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup>&nbsp; Neither had appellants established any ill-motive on the part of the other prosecution witnesses.<br><br><b><i>Inconsistencies and Discrepancies in Alfaro's <br>April 28, 1995 and May 22, 1995 Affidavits</i></b><br><br>Appellants,
 from the start of preliminary investigation, have repeatedly harped on 
the discrepancies and inconsistencies in Alfaro's first and second 
affidavits. However, this Court has repeatedly ruled that whenever there
 is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness 
in court, the testimony commands greater weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> With
 greater relevance should this rule apply in situations when a 
subsequent affidavit of the prosecution witness is intended to amplify 
and correct inconsistencies with the first affidavit, the discrepancies 
having been adequately explained. We held in <i>People v. Sanchez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> <br><br><blockquote>...we
 advert to that all-too familiar rule that discrepancies between sworn 
statements and testimonies made at the witness stand do not necessarily 
discredit the witnesses. Sworn statements/affidavits are generally 
subordinated in importance to open court declarations because the former
 are often executed when an affiant's mental faculties are not in such a
 state as to afford him a fair opportunity of narrating in full the 
incident which has transpired. Testimonies given during trials are much 
more exact and elaborate. Thus, testimonial evidence carries more weight
 than sworn statements/affidavits<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span><sup style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</span></sup><br></blockquote><br>Alfaro
 explained the circumstances surrounding her execution of the first 
Affidavit dated April 28, 1995 which was done without the presence of a 
lawyer and at the house of agent Mario Garcia where she was brought by 
Atty. Sacaguing and Moises Tamayo, another agent of task force 
Anti-Kidnapping, Hijack and Robbery (AKHAR). The unusual questioning of 
these men gave her the impression that she was merely being used to 
boost their career promotion and her distrust was even heightened when 
they absolutely failed to provide her security.&nbsp; She was aghast upon 
discovering the completed affidavit which falsely stated that it was 
made in the presence of her lawyer of choice (Atty. Mercader who was not
 actually present). Agent Tamayo also incorporated inaccurate or 
erroneous information indicating that she was a college graduate even if
 she tried to correct him. Tamayo simply told her to just let it remain 
in the statement as it would not be noticed anyway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup>&nbsp; 
Moreover, on account of her urgent concern for her own security and fear
 of implicating herself in the case, Alfaro admitted down playing her 
own participation in her narration (including the circumstance that she 
had previously met Carmela before the incident) and those of her 
ex-boyfriend Estrada and her relative, Gatchalian.<br><b><br></b><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><b>Prosecution Evidence Sufficient to Convict Appellants</b>&nbsp; <br></div><br>This
 Court has consistently held that the rule on the trial court's 
appreciation of evidence must bow to the superior rule that the 
prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
 The law presumes an accused innocent, and this presumption must prevail
 unless overturned by competent and credible proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]&nbsp;</sup> Thus, we are tasked to consider two crucial points in sustaining a judgment of conviction: <i>first, </i>the
 identification of the accused as perpetrator of the crime, taking into 
account the credibility of the prosecution witness who made the 
identification as well as the prosecution's compliance with legal and 
constitutional standards; and <i>second, </i>all the elements constituting the crime were duly proven by the prosecution to be present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;There
 appears to be no question about the fact that a horrible and most 
unfortunate crime has been committed.&nbsp; It is, in this case, indeed a 
given fact, but next to it is the pivotal issue of whether or not the 
prosecution has been able to discharge its equal burden in 
substantiating the identities of accused-appellants as the perpetrators 
of the crime.&nbsp; As well said often, conviction must rest on the strength 
of the prosecution's case and not on the weakness of the defense.<br><br><b><i>Positive Identification</i></b><br><b><i>of Accused-Appellants</i></b><br><br>Eyewitness identification constitutes vital evidence and, in most cases, decisive of the success or failure of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup>&nbsp;
 Both the RTC and CA found the eyewitness testimony of Alfaro credible 
and competent proof that appellants Webb, Lejano, Gatchalian, Fernandez,
 Rodriguez and Estrada were at the scene of the crime and that Webb 
raped Carmela as the bloodied bodies of her mother and sister lay on top
 of the bed inside the master's bedroom, and right beside it stood 
Lejano while Ventura was preparing for their escape. At another house in
 BF Executive Village where the group retreated after leaving the 
Vizconde house, Alfaro witnessed the blaming session, particularly 
between Ventura and Webb, and thereupon learned from their conversation 
that Carmela's mother and sister were stabbed to death before she 
herself was killed.&nbsp; Alfaro likewise positively identified appellant 
Biong, whom somebody from the group described as the driver and 
bodyguard of the Webb family, as the person ordered by Webb to "clean 
the Vizconde house."<br><br>The testimony of Alfaro on its material 
points was corroborated by Birrer, Dr. Cabanayan, White, Jr., Cabanacan 
and Gaviola.&nbsp; Appellants' presence at the scene of the crime before, 
during and after its commission was duly established. Their respective 
participation, acts and declarations were likewise detailed by Alfaro 
who was shown to be a credible witness. It is axiomatic that a witness 
who testifies in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank 
manner and remains consistent on cross-examination is a credible 
witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>A criminal case rises or falls on the
 strength of the prosecution's case, not on the weakness of the defense.
 Once the prosecution overcomes the presumption of innocence by proving 
the elements of the crime and the identity of the accused as perpetrator
 beyond reasonable doubt, the <i>burden of evidence</i> then shifts to 
the defense which shall then test the strength of the prosecution's case
 either by showing that no crime was in fact committed or that the 
accused could not have committed or did not commit the imputed crime, or
 at the very least, by casting doubt on the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> <br><br><center><u><b>Appellants' Alibi and Denial</b></u><br></center><br>We have held in a number of cases that <i>alibi</i> is an inherently weak and unreliable defense, for it is easy to fabricate and difficult to disprove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; To establish <i>alibi</i>,
 the accused must prove (a) that he was present at another place at the 
time of the perpetration of the crime, and (b) that it was physically 
impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime. Physical 
impossibility "refers to the distance between the place where the 
accused was when the crime transpired and the place where it was 
committed, as well as the facility of access between the two places."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to its doubtful nature, <i>alibi</i> must be supported by clear and convincing proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"Alibi,
 the plea of having been elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the
 time of the commission of the felony, is a plausible excuse for the 
accused.&nbsp; Let there be no mistake about it.&nbsp; Contrary to the common 
notion, alibi is in fact a good defense.&nbsp; But, to be valid for purposes 
of exoneration from a criminal charge, <b>the defense of alibi must be 
such that it would have been physically impossible for the person 
charged with the crime to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time of
 its commission, the reason being that no person can be in&nbsp; two places 
at the same time. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of 
no exception.&nbsp; Where there is the least possibility of accused's 
presence at the crime scene, the alibi will not hold water</span>.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> [emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><br>The
 claim of appellant Webb that he could not have committed the crime 
because he left for the United States on March 9, 1991 and returned to 
the Philippines only on October 26, 1992 was correctly rejected by the 
RTC and CA.&nbsp; These dates are so distant from the time of the commission 
of the crime, June 29, 1991 and June 30, 1991, and it would not have 
been impossible during the interregnum for Webb to travel back to the 
country and again fly to the US several times considering that the 
travel time on board an airline from the Philippines to San Francisco, 
and from San Francisco to the Philippines takes only about twelve (12) 
to fourteen (14) hours.&nbsp; Given the financial resources and political 
influence of his family, it was not unlikely that Webb could have 
traveled back to the Philippines before June 29-30, 1991 and then 
departed for the US again, and returning to the Philippines in October 
1992.&nbsp; There clearly exists, therefore, such <i>possibility </i>of Webb's presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission, and his excuse cannot be deemed airtight.<br><br>This Court in <i>People v. Larrañaga</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><i> </i>had similarly rejected the defense of <i>alibi</i>
 of an accused, involving a shorter travel distance (Quezon City to 
Cebu) and even shorter period of time showing the least possibility of 
an accused's presence at the time of the commission of the crime (a 
matter of hours) than in the case at bar (March 9, 1991 to June 29, 1991
 which is three <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> months). 
In denying the motion for reconsideration of accused Larrañaga, we held 
that accused Larrañaga failed to establish his defense of <i>alibi, </i>which is futile in the face of positive identification:<br><br><blockquote>This case presents to us a balance scale whereby perched on one end is appellants' <i>alibi</i>
 supported by witnesses who were either their relatives, friends or 
classmates, while on the other end is the positive identification of the
 herein appellants by the prosecution witnesses who were not, in any 
way, related to the victims. With the above jurisprudence as guide, we 
are certain that the balance must tilt in favor of the latter.<br><br>Besides,
 a thorough examination of the evidence for the prosecution shows that 
the appellants failed to meet the requirements of <i>alibi</i>, i.e., 
the requirements of time and place. They failed to establish by clear 
and convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for them to be
 at the Ayala Center, Cebu City when the Chiong sisters were abducted. 
What is clear from the evidence is that Rowen, Josman, Ariel, Alberto, 
James Anthony and James Andrew were all within the vicinity of Cebu City
 on July 16, 1997.<br><br>Not even Larrañaga who claimed to be in Quezon
 City satisfied the required proof of physical impossibility. During the
 hearing, it was shown that <b>it takes only one (1) hour to travel by 
plane from Manila to Cebu and that there are four (4) airline companies 
plying the route. One of the defense witnesses admitted that there are 
several flights from Manila to Cebu each morning, afternoon and evening</b>. <b>Indeed,
 Larrañaga's&nbsp; presence in Cebu City on July 16, 1997 was proved to be 
not only a possibility but a reality. Four (4) witnesses identified 
Larrañaga as one of the two men talking to Marijoy and Jacqueline on the
 night of July 16, 1997.</b> Shiela Singson testified that on July 16, 
1997, at around 7:20 in the evening, she saw Larrañaga approach Marijoy 
and Jacqueline at the West Entry of Ayala Center. The incident reminded 
her of Jacqueline's prior story that he was Marijoy's admirer. Shiela 
confirmed that she knows Larrañaga since she had seen him on five (5) 
occasions. Analie Konahap also testified that on the same evening of 
July 16, 1997, at about 8:00 o'clock, she saw Marijoy and Jacqueline 
talking to two (2) men at the West Entry of Ayala Center. She recognized
 the two (2) men as Larrañaga and Josman, having seen them several times
 at Glicos, a game zone, located across her office at the third level of
 Ayala Center. Williard Redobles, the security guard then assigned at 
Ayala Center, corroborated the foregoing testimonies of Shiela and 
Analie. In addition, Rosendo Rio, a businessman from Cogon, Carcar, 
declared that he saw Larrañaga at Tan-awan at about 3:30 in the morning 
of July 17, 1997. The latter was leaning against the hood of a white 
van. And over and above all, Rusia categorically identified Larrañaga as
 one of the <i>participes criminis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>In
 the light of relevant precedents, I find no reversible error committed 
by the RTC in refusing to give credence to appellant Webb's argument 
that he could not have committed the crime of rape with homicide because
 he was still in the US on June 29 and 30, 1991.&nbsp; The RTC thus correctly
 ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Granting for the sake of argument that the 
claim of departure for the United States of the accused Webb on March 9,
 1991 and his arrival in the Philippines on October 26, 1992 had been 
duly established by the defense, it cannot prove that he remained in the
 United States during the intervening period.&nbsp; <b>During the long span 
of time between March, 1991 to October, 1992, it was not physically 
impossible for the accused Webb to have returned to the Philippines, 
perpetrate the criminal act, and travel back to the United States. </b><br><br>It
 must be noted that the accused Webb is a scion of a rich, influential, 
and politically powerful family with the financial capacity to travel 
back and forth from the Philippines to the United States. He could very 
well afford the price of a plane ticket to free him from all sorts of 
trouble. Since there are numerous airlines plying the route from Manila 
to the United States, it cannot be said that there was lack of available
 means to transport.&nbsp; Moreover, the lapse of more than three (3) months 
from the time the accused Webb left the Philippines for the United 
States on March 9, 1991 to June 29 and 30, 1991 when the crime was 
committed is more than enough time for the accused Webb to have made 
several trips from the United States to the Philippines and back. The 
Court takes judicial notice of the fact that <b>it only requires the 
short period of approximately eighteen (18) hours to reach the 
Philippines from the United States, with the advent of modern travel.</b><br><br>It
 must likewise be noted that the father of the accused Webb, besides 
being rich and influential, was at that time in 1991, the Congressman of
 Parañaque and later became a Senator of the Republic of the 
Philippines.&nbsp; Thus, the Webb money and connections were at the disposal 
of the accused Webb, and it is worthy of belief that the accused Webb 
could have departed and entered the country without any traces 
whatsoever of his having done so.&nbsp; In fact, defense witness Andrea 
Domingo, former Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration and 
Deportation testified on the practice of "<i>human smuggling</i>" at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.<br><br>On
 this point, the Supreme Court has declared in a case that even the 
lapse of the short period of one (1) week was sufficient for an accused 
to go to one place, to go to another place to commit a crime, and then 
return to his point of origin.&nbsp; The principal factor considered by the 
Supreme Court in denying the defense of alibi in <i>People vs. Jamero </i>(24 SCRA 206) was the <b>availability to the accused of the means by which to commit a crime elsewhere and then return to his refuge</b>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup>&nbsp; [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>There
 is likewise no merit in appellant Webb's contention that the CA 
misappreciated his voluminous documentary evidence and numerous 
witnesses who testified on his stay in the US.&nbsp; The CA, after a 
meticulous and painstaking reevaluation of Webb's documentary and 
testimonial evidence, sustained the RTC's conclusion that these pieces 
of evidence were either inadmissible, incompetent or irrelevant. I quote
 with approval the CA's findings which are well-supported by the 
evidence on record:<br><br><blockquote>(a) U.S. INS Certifications<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The
 Court seriously doubts that evidentiary weight could be ascribed to the
 August 31, 1995 and October 13, 1995 Certifications of the U.S. INS and
 computer print-out of the Nonimmigrant Information System (NIIS) which 
allegedly established Webb's entry to and exit from the United States.&nbsp; 
This is due to the fallibility demonstrated by the US INS with regard to
 the certifications which the said office issued regarding the basic 
information under its direct control and custody.<br><br>It is to be 
remembered that as part of his evidence, Webb presented the explanation 
of one Steven P. Bucher, Acting Chief of Records Services Branch of the 
U.S. INS, who admitted that the U.S. INS had previously reported on 
August 10, 1995, erroneously, that it had no record of the arrival and 
departure of Webb to and from the United States.&nbsp; The said office later 
on admitted that it failed to exhaustively study all information 
available to it.&nbsp; We are not convinced with this explanation.&nbsp; It is to 
be noted that the U.S. INS is an agency well known for its stringent 
criteria and rigid procedure in handling documents relating to one's 
travel into and out of its territory.&nbsp; Such being the case, it would 
therefore be hard to imagine that the said agency would issue a 
certification that it had no record of a person's entry into and exit 
from the United States without first conducting an efficient 
verification of its records.<br><br>We do not also believe that a second
 search could give rise to a different conclusion, considering that 
there is no showing that the records searched were different from those 
viewed in the first search.&nbsp; The later certifications issued by the U.S.
 INS modifying its first certification and which was issued only a few 
weeks earlier, come across as a strained effort by Webb at establishing 
his presence in the United States in order to reinforce his flimsy <i>alibi.</i><br><br>It
 is not amiss to note that a reading of the first Certificate of 
Non-existence of Record (Exhibit "212-D") subscribed by Debora A. Farmer
 of the U.S. INS would show that the U.S. INS had&nbsp; made a "diligent" 
search, and found no record of admission into the United States of Webb.
 The search allegedly included an inquiry into the automated and 
non-automated records systems of the U.S. INS. Be it also noted that the
 basis of the U.S. INS second certification (Exhibit "218") was a 
printout coming also from automated information systems.<br><br>As pointed out by the Office of the Solicitor General in its appeal brief, <b>"how
 it became possible for the U.S. INS Archives in Washington, which is 
supposed to merely download and copy the information given by the San 
Francisco INS, to have an entry on accused-appellant Webb when the said 
port of entry had no such record was never sufficiently addressed by the
 defense."</b><br><br>It is with this view that the Court recognizes little if not nil probative value in the second certification of the U.S. INS.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b)&nbsp; Passenger Manifest of United Airlines Flight<br><br>The
 purported passenger manifest for the United Airlines flight that 
allegedly conveyed accused-appellant Webb for the United States, was<b> not identified by the United Airlines personnel who actually prepared and completed the same. </b>
 Instead, the defense presented Dulcisimo Daluz, the supervisor of 
customer services of United Airlines in Manila, who had no hand in the 
actual preparation or safekeeping of the said passenger manifest.&nbsp; It 
must be stressed that to satisfactorily prove the due execution of a 
private document, the testimony of the witness with regard to the 
execution of the said document must be positive.&nbsp; Such being the case, 
his testimony thereto is at most hearsay and therefore not worthy of any
 credit.<br><br>Likewise, we note that the said passenger manifest produced in court is a <b>mere photocopy and the same did not comply with the strict procedural requirement of the airline company</b>,<b> that is,</b> <b>all the checking agents who were on duty on March 9, 1991 must sign or initial the passenger manifest.</b>&nbsp; This further lessens the credibility of the said document.<br><br>(c)&nbsp; United Airline Ticket<br><br>...the alleged United Airline ticket of accused-appellant Webb offered in evidence is<b> a mere photocopy of an alleged original, which was never presented below.</b>
 Other than the submission that the original could no longer be produced
 in evidence, there is no other proof that there ever was an original 
airline ticket in the name of Webb.&nbsp; This does not satisfy the 
requirements set forth under Section 5 of Rule 130. x x x we find that 
the photocopy presented in evidence has little if no probative value.&nbsp; 
Even assuming there was such an original ticket in existence, the same 
is hardly of any weight, in the absence of clear proof that the same was
 indeed used by accused-appellant Webb to go to the United States.<br><br>(d) Philippine passport<br><br>The
 passport of accused-appellant Webb produced in evidence, and the 
inscriptions appearing thereon, also offer little support of Webb's <i>alibi.</i>&nbsp; Be it noted that <b>what appears on record is only the photocopy of the pages of Webb's passport.&nbsp; </b>The
 Court therefore can only rely on the appreciation of the trial court as
 regards the authenticity of the passport and the marks appearing 
thereon, as it is the trial court that had the exclusive opportunity to 
view at first hand the original of the document, and determine for 
itself whether the same is entitled to any weight in evidence.<br><br>(e)&nbsp; Video footage of accused-appellant Webb's parents in Disneyland and Yosemite Park.<br><br>The
 video footage serendipitously taken by Victor Yap allegedly of Senator 
Webb and his family while on vacation at Disneyland in Anaheim, 
California on July 3, 1991 does little to support the <i>alibi</i> of accused-appellant Webb for it is quite interesting to note that <b>nowhere did accused-appellant Webb appear in this footage</b>.&nbsp;
 None of the people shown in the film was identified as the 
accused-appellant Webb. Moreover, the records disclose that just before 
the segment of the film that showed Senator Webb, there was a gap or 
portion of static that appeared which did not appear in any other 
portion of the footage.&nbsp; We find that this supports the conclusion that <b>the videotape was possibly tampered </b>as an additional support to the <i>alibi</i> of accused-appellant that he was in the United States.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(f)&nbsp; Video footage at Lake Tahoe and the del Toro-Manlapit Wedding<br><br>...the
 video footage showing accused-appellant Webb seemingly on holiday at 
Lake Tahoe with the Wheelocks, to our mind does not disprove that Webb 
was in the country at the time of the Vizconde killing.&nbsp; Firstly, <b>the date being shown intermittently in the footage was not the same or near the date of the Vizconde killing.</b>&nbsp;
 As we have earlier stated, we do not discount the possibility that Webb
 was in the Philippines during the time he was supposed to have been in 
the United States, especially, when there are eyewitnesses who testified
 to the effect that Webb was in the Philippines only a couple of weeks 
before the killing and who also testified of Webb's participation in the
 crime.&nbsp; In any case, we take judicial notice that modern electronic and
 photographic advances could offer a means to splice or modify recorded 
images to configure to a desired impression, including the insertion or 
annotation of numeric figures on a recorded image.<br><br>Likewise, the videotape and photographs taken on Alex del Toro's wedding also fail to convince, as this was <b>allegedly taken on October 10, 1992 well after the fateful days of June 29 and 30, 1991.</b><br><br>(g)&nbsp; Photograph of Webb and Christopher&nbsp; Esguerra before the Dee Lite Concert<br><br>The
 photograph of accused-appellant Webb with Esguerra allegedly taken in 
late April 1991 before they went to a band concert has little probative 
value.&nbsp; It must be pointed out that <b>the image in the picture itself 
does not depict the date or place it was taken, or of any Dee Lite 
concert allegedly attended by Webb</b>.&nbsp; Likewise, we observed that the photograph appears to have been <b>trimmed down from a bigger size</b>,
 possibly to remove the date printed therein. It is also to be noted 
that Esguerra admitted that the inscription appearing at the back of the
 photograph of, "Hubert and I before the Dee Lite Concert, April 1991" 
was only written by him in 1995, after it was given to him by 
accused-appellant's mother, Elizabeth, before he took the witness 
stand.&nbsp; The Court cannot therefore but cast suspicion as to its 
authenticity.<br><br>(h)&nbsp; Webb's Driver's License<br><br>We agree with the trial court's observation that t<b>he
 Driver's License allegedly obtained by accused-appellant from the 
California Department of Motor Vehicle sometime in the first week of 
June 1991 is unworthy of credit, because of the inconsistencies in 
Webb's testimony as to how he obtained the same.</b>&nbsp; In one testimony, 
Webb claimed he did not make an application but just walked in the 
licensing office and he did not submit any photograph relative to his 
application.&nbsp; In a later testimony, he claimed that he submitted an ID 
picture for his driver's license, and that the picture appearing on his 
driver's license was the very same picture he submitted together with 
his application for the driver's license.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are two inconsistent 
testimonies on the same subject matter, which render the said driver's 
license and the alleged date when the same was obtained, unworthy of 
credit.<br><br>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; Logbook of Alex del Toro and Check Payments of Webb's salary<br><br>The
 employment records of accused-appellant, which include the alleged 
logbook of del Toro in his pest control business, and check payments to 
Webb were also offered to support the latter's alleged presence in the 
United States on the dates near the day of the Vizconde killings.&nbsp; A 
review of the logbook shows that the same is unworthy of any evidentiary
 weight. <b>The entries where the accused Webb were indicated to have 
performed work for del Toro, showed that the name of Webb 
("Hubie"/"U.B.") was merely superimposed on the actual entries and could
 have been easily fabricated </b>to create the impression that Webb had 
some participation in the business of del Toro, and therefore, are not 
reliable proofs of Webb's presence and occupation in the United States 
around the time of the Vizconde killing.<br><br>The alleged check 
payments of Webb's salary are also unreliable.&nbsp; The check dated June 13,
 1991 was made payable to "Cash", while the other check which appeared 
to be payable to "Hubert Webb" was however dated only July 10, 1991.&nbsp; <b>Neither of the said checks squarely placed accused-appellant Webb in the United States at the time of the Vizconde killings</b>.&nbsp; Simply put, neither check is therefore clear proof to support Webb's <i>alibi.</i><br><br>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp; Bicycle/Sportscar<br><br>The
 Toyota MR2 sportscar and Cannondale bicycle allegedly purchased by 
accused-appellant Webb and his father in the United States appear to 
have been purchased with great haste, and under suspicious 
circumstances.<br><br>Consider that immediately after the 
accused-appellant's father, former Senator Freddie Webb, arrived in the 
United States, the first thing he did was go out with his friend Honesto
 Aragon and accused-appellant to look for a bicycle and a car to be used
 by the latter in going to and from work.&nbsp; The car was bought sometime 
in early July 1991 and the bicycle sometime on June 30, 1991.&nbsp; It is a 
wonder to this Court that the accused-appellant and his father would buy
 a bicycle and a sportscar at practically the same time to provide the 
accused-appellant transportation to his work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would not just a car or a
 bicycle do for him? Also, the hurried purchase of the car right after 
the arrival of Freddie Webb appears at the very least, suspicious, as a 
prospective car-buyer would understandably want to make a canvas first 
for the best car to buy, and not just to purchase the first car he sees.<br><br>Moreover,
 as aptly observed by the trial court, though it was made clear that the
 purpose of purchasing the said bicycle and car was for 
accused-appellant's convenience in going to and from his work -- we 
find, that this contradicts the other evidence presented by 
accused-appellant because it appears from his evidence that other than 
his brief stint in del Toro's pest control company business and his 
employment as a gasoline station attendant which incidentally was not 
sufficiently proven, all that accused-appellant did in the United States
 was to go sightseeing, shopping and meet with family and friends.<br><br>Lastly,
 the fact that the car and the bicycle were allegedly purchased in close
 proximity to the date of the rape and killing of the Vizconde women 
does little to dissuade the perception that the car and bicycle were 
purchased only for the purpose of providing a plausible defense of <i>alibi</i> for Webb.<br><br>(k)&nbsp; Letters to Jennifer Claire Cabrera<br><br>Cabrera,
 a friend and neighbor of accused-appellant in BF Homes, Parañaque, 
produced four (4) letters allegedly written and sent to her by Webb 
while he was in the United States, in order to support the 
accused-appellant's <i>alibi.&nbsp; </i>These were allegedly the only letters sent by Webb to her.<br><br>The
 letters were allegedly written and posted at around the same time the 
Vizconde rape and killing happened, such that, if the letters were to be
 duly considered, they would place Webb in the United States at the same
 time the June 30, 1991 killings occurred; thus, bolstering Webb's 
defense of <i>alibi.</i><br><br>However, the said letters, to our mind, are not convincing proof of <i>alibi</i>,
 inasmuch said letters were produced only in 1995 at the time she gave a
 statement, and the same time Webb was charged.&nbsp; However, Cabrera 
admitted that she knew Webb was being involved or accused in the 
Vizconde killings as early as 1991 and that she was shocked upon 
learning that he was being implicated therein.<br><br>The Court finds it
 incredible that despite being shocked in 1991, about the involvement of
 her friend, accused-appellant in the Vizconde rape-slay, Cabrera would 
wait until 1995 to "produce" the letters that could have cleared her 
friend's name.&nbsp; An interregnum of four years before coming out with 
valuable proof in support of a friend is to our mind, a telling factor 
on the credibility of the alleged letters.<br><br>Also, the impression 
that may be inferred from reading the letters was one of a man who was 
pining away for his ladylove.&nbsp; Webb was quite expressive with his 
feelings when he wrote that he missed Cabrera, "a lot," yet after only 
four letters that was conveniently written sometime in June 1991, he 
thereafter stopped writing letters to Cabrera as if the whole matter was
 already forgotten.&nbsp; It is highly suspicious therefore that the only 
letters of accused-appellant Webb to Cabrera were written and sent at 
the exact opportune time that the Vizconde killings occurred which 
conveniently supplied a basis for his defense of <i>alibi</i>.<br><br>Moreover,
 from the contents of the letters, we can deduce that there was some 
sort of romantic relationship with the accused-appellant Webb and 
Cabrera.&nbsp; In fact, Webb in his letters referred to Cabrera as his 
"sweetheart" and "dearest", and confessed to her that all he thinks 
about was her, and he was hoping he would dream of her at night.&nbsp; It is 
not improbable, therefore, that Cabrera could have prevaricated herself 
to save her friend.<br><br>In sum, accused-appellant tried vainly to establish his defense of <i>alibi</i>
 with the presentation of not only a substantial volume of documentary 
evidence but also testimonies of an overwhelming number of witnesses 
which were comprised mostly of relatives and family friends who 
obviously wanted him to be exonerated of the crime charged.&nbsp; It is for 
this reason that we regard their testimonies with an eye of suspicion 
for it is but natural, although morally unfair, for a close relative or 
friend to give weight to blood ties and close relationship in times of 
dire needs especially when a criminal case is involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>The
 rule is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that in determining the 
value and credibility of evidence, witnesses are to be weighed, not 
numbered.The testimony of only one witness, if credible and positive, is
 sufficient to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup>&nbsp; As to appellant Webb's 
voluminous documentary evidence, both the RTC and CA judiciously 
examined each exhibit and concluded that these do not pass the test of 
admissibility and materiality insofar as proving the physical 
impossibility of his presence at the Vizconde residence on June 29, 1991
 until the early morning of June 30, 1991.<br><br>Appellant Webb cites 
the opposite view taken by Justices Tagle and Dacudao in their 
dissenting opinions and urges this Court to accord the US INS 
certification and other documents relative to his arrival and departure 
in the US on the dates March 9, 1991 and October 26, 1992, respectively,
 the presumption of regularity being official documents issued by US 
authorities. Justices Tagle and Dacudao concurred in stating that the 
conclusion of their three (3) colleagues (majority) that the US INS 
certifications did not exclude the possibility of Webb traveling back to
 the Philippines and again departing for the US between March 9, 1991 
and October 26, 1992 -- is nothing but speculation and conjecture.&nbsp; Webb
 further mentions that since a Justice of this Court "confirmed 
appellant Webb's alibi of being in the United States on 29 June 
1991[,[a]t the very least, such exculpatory testimony coupled with the 
plethora of appellant Webb's other documentary and testimonial evidence 
on his presence in the United States on 29 June 1991 raises <i>reasonable doubt</i> as to appellant Webb's guilt of the crime charged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>I find the contentions bereft of merit.<br><br>In
 the first place, let it be emphasized that Justice Carpio's testimony 
before the trial court confirmed merely the fact that his conversation 
with then Congressman Webb took place on June 29, 1991 and what the 
latter relayed to him about his location at the time such telephone call
 was made, who was with him in the US (his wife and appellant Webb) and 
the purpose of their US trip (to find a job for appellant Webb).&nbsp; Said 
witness even admitted that he had no personal knowledge that appellant 
Webb was in fact in the United States at the time of his telephone 
conversation with Congressman Webb.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>As to the 
travel documents consisting of his US passport, US INS certifications 
and other evidence presented by appellant Webb in support of his <i>alibi</i>,&nbsp;
 while it is true that such presentation of passport, plane ticket and 
other travel documents can serve as proof that he was indeed out of the 
country at the time of the Vizconde killings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> it must
 still be shown that the evidence is clear and convincing, and the 
totality of such evidence constitutes an airtight excuse as to exclude 
the least possibility of his presence at the crime scene. However, 
appellant Webb failed in this regard and the RTC and CA did not err in 
giving scant weight to his arsenal of evidence, particularly so on the 
strength of the positive identification of appellant Webb as Carmela's 
rapist and one of those who actually took part in the brutal killing of 
Carmela, her mother and sister between midnight of June 29, 1991 and 
early morning of June 30, 1991.<br><br>Indeed, <i>alibi </i>cannot be sustained where it is not only without <i>credible</i>
 corroboration, but also where it does not, on its face, demonstrate the
 physical impossibility of the accused's presence at the place and time 
of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup>&nbsp; Against positive evidence, <i>alibi</i> becomes most unsatisfactory.&nbsp; <i>Alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of a credible witness.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup>&nbsp;
 Appellant Webb was placed at the crime scene by Alfaro who positively 
identified him as the one (1) who plotted and committed the rape of 
Carmela, and later fatally stabbed her, her mother and sister, aided by 
or in concert with Lejano and Ventura. Gaviola and Cabanacan gave 
corroborating testimonies that appellant Webb was here in the country, 
as he was just in his house at BF Homes Subdivision Phase III, at least a
 few weeks prior to and on June 29 to 30, 1991.<br><br>Verily, it is only when the identification of the accused as the author of the crime charged is inconclusive or unreliable that <i>alibi </i>assumes
 importance.&nbsp; Such is not the situation in the case at bar where the 
identification of the perpetrators by a lone eyewitness satisfied the 
moral certainty standard.<br><br>It is the prosecution's burden to prove
 the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Definitely, 
"reasonable doubt" is not mere guesswork whether or not the accused is 
guilty, but such uncertainty that "a reasonable man may entertain after a
 fair review and consideration of the evidence."&nbsp; Reasonable doubt is 
present when --<br><br><blockquote>after the entire comparison and consideration of 
all the evidences, leaves the minds of the [judgesin that condition that
 they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, 
of the truth of the charge; a certainty that convinces and directs the 
understanding, and satisfies the reason and judgment of those who are 
bound to act conscientiously upon it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup></blockquote><br><br>That 
reasonable doubt is not engendered by the presentation of certifications
 of entry into and exit from the US, passport with stamp marks of 
departure and declarations of witnesses who are mostly relatives and 
friends of appellant Webb, can be gleaned from the fact that passports 
and plane tickets indicating dates of arrival and departure do not 
necessarily prove that the very same person actually took the flight.&nbsp; 
This Court takes judicial notice of reported irregularities and 
tampering of passports in the years prior to the recent issuance by the 
DFA of machine-readable passports.&nbsp; In fact, the proliferation of 
photo-substituted passports, fake immigration stamps, assumed identity 
and double passports, among others, have been cited as grounds to 
justify the necessity of amending the <i>Philippine Passport Act of 1996</i>
 (R.A. No. 8239) as proposed in the Senate, "x x x to rally for the 
issuance of passports using tamper proof and the latest data encryption 
technology; and provide stiffer penalties against proliferators of fake 
passports."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>It is worthy of note I note that 
the original of Webb's passport was not offered in evidence and made 
part of the records, which only gives credence to the prosecution's 
allegation that it bore signs of tampering and irregularities.&nbsp; And as 
earlier mentioned, the much vaunted US-INS second certification dated 
August 31, 1995 based on a mere computer print-out from the 
Non-immigrant Information System (Exhibit "213-1-D") retrieved from the 
US- INS Archives in Washington, and the accompanying certifications, 
have little probative value, the truth of their contents had not been 
testified to by the persons who issued the same. Moreover, the issuance 
of this certification only a couple of weeks after the August 10, 1995 
US-INS Office in San Francisco was issued, only raised questions as to 
its accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said earlier certification through Debora A. Farmer 
stated that:<br><br><blockquote>[a]fter diligent search <b>no record is found to exist </b> in the records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.&nbsp; The search included a review of the Service <b>automated

 show that the August 10, 1995 US-INS Certification was erroneous, 
appellant Webb presented the Memorandum addressed to Secretary Domingo 
L. Siazon signed by Consul Leo M. Herrera-Lim, the Diplomatic Note dated
 October 30, 1995&nbsp; and&nbsp; the letter of&nbsp;&nbsp; Debora Farmer stating that the 
San Francisco certification was erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> The 
prosecution, however, presented another document which indicated that an
 appeal to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Information and 
Privacy yielded a negative result on any record on file that one (1) 
Hubert Webb arrived in the United States on March 9, 1991, and further 
that Richard L. Huff, Co-Director of the Office of Information and 
Privacy had in effect sustained as correct the US-INS San Francisco 
report that there is no such data on Hubert Webb in the San Francisco 
database so that the Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C. should 
instead ask the assistance of <i>other U.S. government agencies </i>in their search for data on appellant Webb.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>The
 defense endeavored to explain why the US-INS Archives in Washington 
could have made the "mistake" of stating that it had no data or 
information on the alleged entry of appellant Webb on March 9, 1991 and 
his exit on October 26, 1992.&nbsp; However, it had not satisfactorily 
addressed the nagging question of how it became possible for the US-INS 
Archives in Washington, which is supposed to merely download and copy 
the information given by the San Francisco INS, to have an entry on 
appellant Webb when the said port of entry had no such record.&nbsp; 
Considering that many visitors (nonimmigrants) are admittedly not 
entered into the NIIS database, and that diligent search already yielded
 a negative response on appellant Webb's entry into the US on March 9, 
1991 as per the August 10, 1995 Certification, as to what US government 
agency the alleged computer-generated print-out in the August 31, 1995 
certification actually came from remains unclear.<br><br>Appellant 
Webb's reliance on the presumption of regularity of official functions, 
stressing the fact that the US-INS certifications are official 
documents, is misplaced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presumption leaned on is disputable and 
can be overcome by evidence to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup>&nbsp; In this
 case, the existence of an earlier negative report on the NIIS record on
 file concerning the entry of appellant Webb into and his exit from the 
US on March 9, 1991 and October 26, 1992, respectively, had raised 
serious doubt on the veracity and accuracy of the subsequently issued 
second certification dated August 31, 1995 which is based merely on a 
computer print-out of his alleged entry on March 9, 1991 and departure 
on October 26, 1992.<br><br>As to the testimony of former Foreign 
Affairs Secretary Domingo L. Siazon, the same cannot be given due 
credence since he is incompetent to testify on the contents of the 
August 31, 1995 US-INS Certification, having merely received the said 
document in his capacity as&nbsp; the head of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs of the Philippines. Consul Leo M. Herrera-Lim's testimony 
likewise did not carry much weight considering that its significance is 
confined to the fact that the document from the US-INS was transmitted 
and received by the DFA.&nbsp; It is to be noted that the certification 
issued by the Philippine Embassy with respect to the US-INS 
Certifications contained a disclaimer, specifically stating that the 
Embassy assumed no responsibility for the contents of the annexed 
document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> The same observations regarding the 
"consularized certifications" was reflected in the Decision dated April 
16, 1998 in CA-G.R. SP No. 42285 ("<i>Miguel Rodriguez v. Amelita Tolentino</i>") and CA-G.R. SP No. 42673 ("<i>Hubert P. Webb v. Amelita Tolentino</i>").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>Appellant
 Webb's travel documents and other supposed paper trail of his stay in 
the US are unreliable proof of his absence in the Philippines at the 
time of the commission of the crime charged.&nbsp; The non-submission in 
evidence of his <b>original passport, </b>which was <b>not</b> <i>formally offered</i> <i>and made part of the records, </i>had
 deprived the RTC, CA and this Court the opportunity to examine the 
same. Such original is a crucial piece of evidence which unfortunately 
was placed beyond judicial scrutiny.<br><br>IWe quote the following observations made by the prosecution on Webb's passport from the appeal brief of the OSG:<br><br><blockquote>In
 tandem with the presentation of the various U.S. INS certifications to 
bolster appellant Webb's story of a U.S. sojourn before, during and 
after the commission of the offense charged, he further anchors his 
defense on his passport (Exh. AAAAAA and 294) ostensibly to show, among 
others, that the grant by the United States government granted him a 
visa effective from April 6, 1989 to April 6, 1994 and the U.S. 
Immigration in San Francisco stampmarked it on March 9, 1991 (Exh. 
AAAAAA-6) on page 30 thereof (Exh. AAAAAA-2 and 294-D).<br><br>On its 
face, what the entries in the passport plainly suggest is that appellant
 Webb violated U.S. immigration laws by "overstaying" beyond the usual 
six-(6) month period allowed for tourists. However, he being the son of a
 Senator would not unnecessarily violate U.S. immigration laws.&nbsp; It 
would be quite easy for him to apply for and secure an extension of his 
authorized stay in the U.S., if only he requested.&nbsp; But why did not he 
or his parents secure the extension? Why was there no evidence to show 
that he ever requested an extension?&nbsp; Did he really overstay in the U.S.
 or could he simply enter and leave the U.S. and the Philippines without
 marking his passport?&nbsp; These raise serious questions on the integrity 
of the passport.<br><br>Is appellant Webb really untouchable that even 
U.S. authorities in various states would let him get "off the hook" 
without much of a fuss after his alleged brushes with the law (TSN - 
Hubert Webb dated September 10, 1997, p. 82)?&nbsp; This is especially 
incredible considering that he was allegedly apprehended in the United 
States near the U.S. border (Ibid., pp. 82-83) where authorities are 
always on the look out for illegal aliens.<br><br>The questions 
involving appellant Webb's passport are not limited to the stamp marks 
(or lack of stamp marks) therein. There are unusual things about his 
passport which he has been unable to explain satisfactorily.<br><br>The passport of her mother, Elizabeth Webb, for example, appears to be well preserved despite having been used <b>more </b>frequently
 than that of appellant Webb who supposedly used it in only one trip 
abroad.&nbsp; Not only do some of the pages appear smudged or untidy, but 
more significantly, the perforations on the passport pages indicating 
the serial number of appellant Webb's passport no longer fit exactly on 
the pages -- that is, they are no longer aligned.&nbsp; The perforations are 
intended not only to indicate the serial number of the passport but more
 importantly to countercheck intercalations and tampering.&nbsp; The 
"non-alignment" of the perforations is thus significant.<br><br>In 
addition to the over-all shabby appearance of appellant Webb's passport,
 what is evident is the torn plastic portion of the dorsal page thereof 
near the holder's signature.&nbsp; There is also the matter of the marked 
difference in the signatures of appellant Webb as appearing on the 
dorsal side of the passport (Exh. AAAAAA-3 and 294-A-1) as compared with
 that appearing on his laminated photograph (Exh. AAAAAA-5 and 
294-C-1).&nbsp; Of course, he tried to offer an explanation on the variance 
in the two (2) signatures.&nbsp; All he could reason out, however, was that 
he wrote his name using his normal penmanship when in a lazy mood (TSN 
-- Hubert Webb dated August 14, 1997, p. 27), implying that the 
signature appearing on his laminated photograph is his real signature. A
 review of his other documentary evidence supposedly bearing his 
signature shows that what appears therein is his name written in his 
"normal penmanship," and that it is only in the laminated picture (Exh. 
AAAAAA-5 and 294-C) that such "real signature" appears. Following 
appellant Webb's explanation, it means that he was in a lazy mood all 
the time!<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup></blockquote><br>Two (2) more documents 
presented by appellant Webb deserve a close look --&nbsp; his US Driver's 
License supposedly issued on June 14, 1991, and the Passenger Manifest.&nbsp;
 The RTC's evaluation of said documents revealed their lack of probative
 value, thus:<br><br><blockquote>On August 14, 1997, [Webbtestified that
 he did not make any application since the procedure in California 
provides for a walk-in system, that he did not submit any photograph 
relative to his application for a Californian Driver's License, inasmuch
 as a photograph of him was taken, and that, his driver's license was 
issued sometime on the first week of June, 1991.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, on
 September 1, 1997, the accused suddenly and completely changed his 
testimony while still on direct examination.&nbsp; He claims that the picture
 appearing on the driver's license was the very same he submitted 
together with his application for the driver's license. Thus, the 
discrepancy as to the source of the photograph (Exhibit "334-E") between
 the testimony given on August 14, 1997 where the accused Webb said that
 the California Department of Motor Vehicle took his picture, and the 
testimony given on September 1, 1997 where he said that he submitted it 
to the California DMV as an attachment to his supposed driver's license 
application renders the accused Webb's testimony as unbelievable and 
unworthy of credence.<br><br>It is beyond belief that the same picture 
submitted by the accused Webb became the picture in the driver's license
 allegedly issued on June 14, 1991.&nbsp; Moreover, it is contrary to human 
nature and experience, aside from the fact that it is likewise contrary 
to the procedure described by the accused Webb in obtaining a driver's 
license in the State of California.&nbsp; Since a driver's license is one of 
the principal means of identification in the United States as well as in
 the Philippines, to allow the applicants to produce their own pictures 
would surely defeat the purpose in requiring them to appear before the 
Department of Motor Vehicle, that is, to ensure the integrity and 
genuineness of the driver's license.<br><br>The Court takes note that 
the accused Webb, in his fervent desire to exculpate himself from 
criminal liability, earlier offered in evidence the <b>letter dated January 10, 1992 of Mr. Robert L. Heafner, Legal Attache of the Embassy of the United States </b>to
 the then Director of the National Bureau of Investigation, Alfredo S. 
Lim, (Exhibit "61") which stated in very clear terms that <b>the accused Webb's California Driver's License Number A8818707 was issued on August 9, 1991</b>.&nbsp;
 Furthermore, the said letter states the listed address of the accused 
Webb at the time of the issuance of the driver's license was 532 So. 
Avenida Faro Ave., Anaheim, California 92807.&nbsp; The said listed address 
of the accused Webb at the time his driver's license was issued has 
demolished the testimony of the defense witness Sonia Rodriguez that the
 accused Webb was supposed to be already living with the Rodriguez 
family in Longwood, Florida by the first week of August, 1991.<br><br>The accused Webb likewise offered in evidence the <b>official communication coming from the Federal Bureau of Investigation dated December 31, 1991</b> (Exhibit "MMM" and submarkings; Exhibit "66-C" and submarkings) which likewise gave the information that <b>the accused Webb was issued California Driver's License No. 8818707 on August 9, 1991</b>,
 and that as of August 9, 1991, the address of the accused Webb was 532 
South Avenida Faro, Anaheim, California 92807.&nbsp; The fact that the 
alleged Driver's License No. A8818707 was issued on two (2) different 
dates (August 9, 1991 and June 14, 1991) casts a serious doubt on its 
provenance and authenticity.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In order to establish
 that the accused Hubert Webb departed from the Philippines on 09 March 
1991 on board UA flight 808 the defense also presented witness Dulcisimo
 Daluz, Station Manager of United Airlines for Manila who in turn 
presented a document purporting to be the <b>Passenger Manifest for the flight departing on 09 March 1991</b> (Exhibits "233-A" to "233-N").<br><br>This
 document merits outright rejection considering that the defense witness
 Daluz confirmed that the same was prepared by the UA departure area 
personnel and not by himself.&nbsp; Thus, this document is merely hearsay and
 is devoid of any merit whatsoever.<br><br>In respect of the plane 
ticket of the accused Hubert Webb, what was likewise offered as part of 
the testimony of Daluz was a mere photo copy, wherein Daluz also 
admitted not having any direct participation in its preparation.<br><br>The spurious nature of the document was observed by the witness Daluz himself who admitted that there were <b>irregularities in the Passenger Manifest presented by the defense.</b>
 According to Daluz, it is a strict procedural requirement that all the 
checking agents who were on duty on March 9, 1991 were supposed to 
initial the Passenger Manifest,&nbsp; However, he admitted that <b>Exhibits "223" and "223-N" did not contain the initials of the checking agents who were supposed to initial the same</b>.<br><br>The
 defense presented Agnes Tabuena, Vice-President for Finance and 
Administration of the Philippine Airlines for the purpose of 
establishing that Hubert Webb arrived in the Philippines only on 26 
October 1992.<br><br>Like witnesses Daluz and Nolasco, Tabuena's statements on the witness stand and the Certification was based exclusively on the <b>Passenger Manifest of PAL's PR 103.</b>&nbsp;
 Unfortunately for the defense, the said testimony is of no probative 
value and of doubtful veracity considering that the witness did not 
prepare the same, nor did the witness identify the persons who prepared 
the same other than that they were "airport staff", nor did she had any 
idea when the document was transmitted to her office.&nbsp; In fact, the 
witness could not even interpret the contents of the said Passenger 
Manifest, much more testify as to the due execution and genuineness 
thereof.<br><br>In view of the vital necessity to the other accused of 
establishing accused Webb's alibi, it is important to note that Atty. 
Francisco Gatchalian, father of the accused Michael Gatchalian was then a
 high ranking PAL Official and a colleague of Tabuena.&nbsp; This makes the 
source of the document, even ignoring the fact of its inadmissibility, 
suspicious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> [emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><br>The <i>alibi</i>
 of appellants Gatchalian and Lejano, who claimed they were&nbsp; at the Syap
 residence at Ayala Alabang Village watching video tapes the whole night
 of June 29, 1991 until early morning of June 30, 1991, was even less 
plausible considering the distance of that place from Pitong Daan 
Subdivision, which is just a few minutes ride away.&nbsp; The RTC noted the 
manifestation of the defense on Andrew Syap's refusal to testify on 
Gatchalian and Lejano's whereabouts during the night in question, 
despite their efforts to convince him to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; It further noted the 
testimony of Assistant NBI Director Pedro Rivera that Carlos Syap upon 
seeing Gatchalian with their group even berated Gatchalian for dragging 
him into his (Gatchalian's) own problem.&nbsp; Aside from Alfaro, security 
guard Normal White, Jr. also testified that the presence of Gatchalian 
(son of a homeowner), who pointed to the other appellants in the two (2)
 cars behind him as his companions, was the reason they allowed his 
friends to enter the subdivision on the night of June 29, 1991. White, 
Jr. also categorically declared he had, earlier that same night,&nbsp; seen 
Gatchalian with his friends standing at Vinzons St.&nbsp; Thus, other than 
the hearsay declaration of his father who merely testified on what his 
son told him about spending the night watching video tapes at the Syap 
residence on June 29, 1991, Gatchalian presented no corroborative 
evidence of his <i>alibi.</i><br><br>As to appellant Lejano, he was 
positively identified by Alfaro as the first to express approval of 
Webb's plan to gang-rape Carmela by saying, "<i>Ako ang susunod.</i>"<i> </i>Lejano
 was also with Alfaro, Webb and Ventura in going inside the Vizconde 
house, and whom she later saw inside the master's bedroom, at the foot 
of the bed where the bloodied bodies of Estrellita and Jennifer lay, and
 just standing there about to wear his jacket while Webb was pumping the
 hogtied and gagged Carmela on the floor. His <i>alib</i>i is likewise 
feeble, as he could have easily gone to the Vizconde house within a few 
minutes from the Syap residence where he and Gatchalian allegedly 
watched video tapes.<br><br>Appellant Fernandez, on his part, insisted 
that Alfaro's story was simply fabricated by her "hidden mentors" who 
considered the sworn statement of Roberto D. Barroso taken on November 
4, 1991.&nbsp; Barroso was one (1) of the members of the "<i>Akyat Bahay</i>"
 gang who were earlier charged before the Makati City RTC in Criminal 
Case Nos. 91-7135-37 for Rape with Homicide and for Robbery with 
Homicide in connection with the Vizconde killings.&nbsp; There is an uncanny 
congruence in the details of the incident as testified to by Alfaro, 
with the sworn statement of Barroso particularly pertaining to the 
manner by which the garage light of the Vizconde house was put out, the 
smashing of the glass panel of the main door, and the appearance of a 
woman who opened the main door saying "<i>Sino kayo?</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>Such
 submissions are inane, in view of the dismissal of those cases filed 
against the first set of suspects based on lack of evidence.&nbsp; Contrary 
to Fernandez's insinuation of a fabricated eyewitness account, Alfaro 
gave much more minute details than the limited narration given by 
Barroso.&nbsp; More important, Alfaro's testimony was sufficiently 
corroborated on its material points, not only by the physical evidence, 
but also by the testimonies of four (4) disinterested witnesses for the 
prosecution: White, Jr., Cabanacan, Gaviola and Birrer.<br><br>Fernandez
 also cited as among the reasons why Alfaro's declarations were far from
 positive, the non-recovery of the fatal weapons used in the killings. 
He contended that a crucial link in the prosecution's physical evidence 
was thus missing, as Alfaro could not even say what was the "object" or 
"thing" which she saw thrown out of the Nissan Patrol while the group 
was on their way to the BF Executive Village. Hence, her suggestion that
 what she saw Ventura took from the kitchen drawer may have been kitchen
 knives used to kill the victims must fail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>Such
 proposition fails to persuade.&nbsp; The failure to present the murder 
weapon will not exculpate the accused from criminal liability. The 
presentation and identification of the weapon used are <i>not </i>indispensable
 to prove the guilt of the accused, much more so where the perpetrator 
has been positively identified by a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>Appellant
 Rodriguez denies being a conspirator with Webb's group in the 
commission of the crime, asserting that his presence and participation 
in the Vizconde killings, from the time of its inception up to its 
consummation, was not established beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; He cites the
 failure of Alfaro to mention his name as part of the "group" twice in 
her testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; These instances refer to Alfaro's direct examination 
when she was asked to name the persons riding the convoy of three (3) 
vehicles when they left Ayala Alabang Commercial Center parking lot to 
proceed to the Vizconde residence at Pitong Daan Subdivision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup>
 and the second time when she was asked to enumerate the members of the 
"group" who were waiting along Aguirre Avenue during their second trip 
to the Vizconde residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, when Alfaro 
testified that the rest of the group acted as lookouts while she, Webb, 
Lejano and Ventura went inside the Vizconde house, it must be understood
 as limited only to those she had previously enumerated, which 
definitely did not include Rodriguez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup><br><br>The 
argument is untenable. The mere fact that Alfaro missed out naming 
Rodriguez in two (2) instances during her direct examination does not 
give rise to the conclusion that he was not positively identified by 
Alfaro as among those present and participated prior to, during and 
after the commission of the crime as lookouts along with the rest of the
 group. Contrary to Rodriguez's claim, the first time that Alfaro 
referred to and enumerated the members of the "group" which she had 
unexpectedly joined that night, was at the beginning of her narration on
 how she met Ventura's friends when she got her order of <i>shabu</i> at the Ayala Alabang Commercial Center parking lot.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">And you said that Dong Ventura introduced you to this group, will you name the group that was introduced to you by Dong Ventura?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div></td> <td> First, he introduced me to Hubert Webb, then Fyke Fernandez, <b>Miguel Rodriguez</b>, and then Tonyboy Lejano, Michael Gatchalian.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote><br>Alfaro
 was again asked to enumerate the members of the "group" when the 
prosecution asked her to name the members of the group, in the later 
part of her direct examination during the same hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup>&nbsp; She also testified that after everyone, including Rodriguez, took part in a <i>shabu </i>session, they left the parking lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 It thus logically follows that whenever Alfaro made reference to the 
"group" in her entire narration, it necessarily included those she had 
enumerated she had met and had a <i>shabu</i> session with at the Ayala 
Alabang Commercial Center parking lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; This same group was with her 
from their first trip to the Vizconde residence until the time they left
 Pitong Daan Subdivision and retreated to a house at BF Executive 
Village early morning of June 30, 1991.&nbsp; Alfaro had specifically 
mentioned Rodriguez when asked by Prosecutor Zuño to describe their 
relative positions at the lawn area of the BF Executive Village house, 
thus establishing his presence during the "blaming session":<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A.&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x&nbsp; kalat kami, sir, pero hindi kami magkakalayo x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">How about Miguel Rodriguez, how far was he from Hubert?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Two meters away.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Mike is very very near <b>Ging Rodriguez.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></blockquote>It
 must be stressed that Alfaro categorically declared it was Rodriguez 
who approached her at Faces Disco on March 30, 1995 and told her to shut
 up or she would be killed.&nbsp; Aside from making that threat, Rodriguez 
also offered Alfaro a plane ticket so she could leave the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup>&nbsp;
 Rodriguez's bare denial cannot be given any evidentiary weight.&nbsp; We 
have ruled that denial is a self-serving negative evidence that cannot 
be given greater weight than the declaration of a credible witness who 
testified on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br><br>Rodriguez's attempt to set up an <i>alibi</i>
 through the testimony of his cousin Mark Rualo was equally frail.&nbsp; Even
 assuming as true Rualo's testimony that he had indeed invited Rodriguez
 to attend his birthday party on June 29, 1991 but Rodriguez opted to 
stay in his house and even talked to him on the phone when he called 
Rodriguez to ask why he was not yet at the party, it cannot serve as 
proof of Rodriguez's whereabouts at the time of the commission of the 
crime. It did not rule out the actual presence of Rodriguez at the crime
 scene.<br><br>Appellant Estrada, just like Rodriguez and Fernandez, did not take the witness stand and simply relied on the <i>alibi</i>
 defense of his co-accused, principally that of Webb.&nbsp; Alfaro testified 
that it was Estrada, then her boyfriend, who was together with her in 
her car throughout the night of June 29, 1991 until early morning of 
June 30, 1991.&nbsp; Estrada was among those who acted as lookouts outside 
the Vizconde house after they all concurred in the plan of Webb to 
gang-rape Carmela while they were still at the parking lot of the Ayala 
Alabang Commercial Center.<br><br><b><i>Conspiracy among <br>appellants duly proven</i></b><br><br>The
 existence of conspiracy between appellants Webb, Ventura, Lejano, 
Gatchalian, Fernandez, Rodriguez and Filart was satisfactorily&nbsp; proven 
by the prosecution. Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to 
an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit 
it. Conspiracy comes to life at the very instant the plotters agree, 
expressly or impliedly, to commit the felony and forthwith decide to 
actually pursue it. It may be proved by direct or circumstantial 
evidence<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> Although only one (1) rape was actually 
proven by the prosecution, as conspirators who mutually agreed to commit
 the crime and assisted one (1) another in its commission, on the 
occasion of which the rape victim Carmela, her mother Estrellita and 
sister Jennifer, were killed, each of the accused-appellants shall be 
criminally liable for rape with homicide.<br><br>Indeed, appellants by 
their individual acts, taken as a whole, showed that they were acting in
 unison and cooperation to achieve the same unlawful objective, even if 
it was only Webb, Ventura and Lejano who actually went inside the 
Vizconde house while Estrada, Fernandez, Rodriguez, Gatchalian and 
Filart stood as lookouts outside the house.&nbsp; Under these premises, it is
 not even necessary to pinpoint the precise participation of each of the
 accused-appellants, the act of one being the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup><br><br>One
 who participates in the material execution of the crime by standing 
guard or lending moral support to the actual perpetrators thereof is 
criminally responsible to the same extent as the latter. There being 
conspiracy among the accused-appellants, they are liable as 
co-principals regardless of the manner and extent of their 
participation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br><br><b><i>Biong guilty as accessory<br> after the fact</i></b><br><br>Appellant
 Biong contends that he cannot be convicted as accessory to the crime of
 rape with homicide because the acts imputed to him did not result in 
the hiding of the case.&nbsp; There was no evidence that such indeed was his 
intent or motive.&nbsp; He points out that the bodies of the victims were 
found at their respective places where they were assaulted and there was
 no evidence that they had been moved an inch from where they breathed 
their last.&nbsp; He asserts that non-preservation of the evidence is not an 
accessory crime under the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br>The contentions have no merit.<br><br>The
 Revised Penal Code in Article 19 defines an accessory as one who has 
knowledge of the commission of the crime, yet did not take part in its 
commission as principal or accomplice, but took part in it subsequent to
 its commission by <i>any of three modes</i>: (1) profiting himself or 
assisting the offender to profit by the effects of the crime; (2) 
concealing or destroying the body of the crime, or the effects or 
instruments thereof in order to prevent its discovery; and (3) 
harboring, concealing, or assisting in the escape of the principals of 
the crime, provided the accessory acts with abuse of his public 
functions or when the offender is guilty of treason, parricide, murder, 
or an attempt to take the life of the Chief Executive, or is known to be
 habitually guilty of some other crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup><br><br>Under 
paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, there 
are two (2) classes of accessories, one of which is a public officer who
 harbors, conceals or assists in the escape of the principal. Such 
public officer must have acted with abuse of his public functions, and 
the crime committed by the principal is <i>any crime</i>, provided it is
 not a light felony. Appellant Biong is one (1) such public officer, and
 he abused his public function when, instead of immediately arresting 
the perpetrators of the crime, he acceded to the bidding of appellant 
Webb to "clean the Vizconde house," which means he must help hide any 
possible trace or sign linking them to the crime, and not necessarily to
 prevent the discovery of the bodies in such actual condition upon their
 deaths. Hence, such "cleaning" would include obliterating fingerprints 
and other identifying marks which appellants Webb, Lejano and Ventura 
might have left at the scene of the crime.<br><br>Contrary to Biong's 
assertion, his failure to preserve evidence at the crime scene such as 
fingerprints on the doors and objects inside the master's bedroom where 
the bodies were found, the bloodied floor of the toilet, the actual 
material used in gagging Carmela and Estrellita, the bloodied blankets 
and bed sheets, the original condition of the broken glass panel of the 
main door, the shoe print and foot prints on the car hood and at the 
back of the house, fingerprints on the light bulb at the garage -- was a
 form of assistance to help the perpetrators evade apprehension by 
confusing the investigators&nbsp;&nbsp; in determining initially what happened and
 the possible suspects<i>.&nbsp; </i>Consequently<i>, </i>Biong's unlawful 
taking of the jewelries and Carmela's ATM card and driver's license, his
 act of breaking the larger portion of the main door glass<i>, </i>the 
washing out of the blood on the toilet floor and permitting the 
relatives to burn the bloodied bed sheets and blankets -- had in fact 
misled the authorities in identifying potential suspects. Thus, the 
police had a difficult time figuring out whether it was robbers who 
entered the Vizconde house and perpetrated the rape-slay, or drug-crazed
 addicts on the loose, or other persons having motive against the 
Vizconde family had exacted revenge, or a brutal sexual assault on 
Carmela by men who were not strangers to her which also led to the 
killings.<br><br>On the basis of strong evidence of appellant Biong's 
effort to destroy crucial physical evidence at the crime scene, I hold 
that the RTC did not err in convicting him as an accessory to the crime 
of rape with homicide.<br><br><b><i>Penalty</i></b><br><br>The CA was 
correct in affirming the sentence imposed by the RTC upon each of the 
accused-appellants Webb, Lejano, Gatchalian, Rodriguez, Fernandez and 
Estrada. The proper penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> because the 
imposition of the death penalty under the Revised Penal Code (in Article
 335 thereof, as amended by R.A. No. 2632 and R.A. No. 4111, when by 
reason or on the occasion of rape, a homicide is committed), was 
prohibited by the Constitution at the time the offense was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup>&nbsp;
 At any rate, the subsequent passage of R.A. No. 9346 entitled "An Act 
Prohibiting the Imposition of the Death Penalty in the Philippines," 
which was signed into law on June 24, 2006, would have mandated the 
imposition on accused-appellants the same penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>As
 to the penalty imposed by the CA on appellant Biong as accessory after 
the fact to the crime of rape with homicide, we find the same proper and
 in order.<br><br><b><i>DNA Testing</i></b><br><br>Appellant Gatchalian 
reiterates his and appellant Webb's motion for DNA testing of the semen 
specimen taken from the vaginal cavity of Carmela during the autopsy 
conducted by Dr. Cabanayan, which motion was denied by the RTC for lack 
of available scientific expertise and technology at the time.<br><br>With
 the great advances in forensic science and under pertinent state laws, 
American courts allow post-conviction DNA testing when its application 
has strong indications that the result could potentially exonerate the 
convict. Indeed, even a convicted felon has the right to avail of new 
technology not available during his trial.<br><br>On October 2, 2007, this Court approved the <i>Rule on DNA Evidence</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> which took effect on October 15, 2007.<br><br>Pursuant to Section 4 of the Rule, the court may at any time, either <i>motu proprio</i>

 Resolution dated April 20, 2010, this Court granted appellant Webb's 
request to submit for DNA analysis the semen specimen taken from the 
cadaver of Carmela Vizconde under the custody of the National Bureau of 
Investigation (NBI).&nbsp; We ordered (1) the NBI to assist the parties in 
facilitating the submission of the said specimen to the UP-Natural 
Science and Research Institute (UP-NSRI), Diliman, Quezon City; and (2) 
the NBI and UP-NSRI to report to this Court within fifteen (15) days

Technical Services, informed this Court that the semen specimen/vaginal 
smear taken from the cadaver of Carmela Vizconde and all original 
documents (autopsy and laboratory reports, and photographs) are no 
longer in the custody of the NBI as these were submitted as evidence to 
the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Parañaque City, Branch 274 by then NBI

RTC Branch 274 of the specimen/vaginal smear mentioned in Dr.

records such as the TSN of January 31, 1996 and February 7, 1996 during

those slides was when he had the photographs thereof taken in 1995 (the 
first time was when he examined them in 1991), and as far as he knows 
between 1991 and 1995, those slides were kept in the Pathology 
Laboratory of the NBI; and (d) The entire records of the cases were

Branch 274 in 1996; and (b) comment on the alleged conflicting 
representations in its <i>Compliance and Manifestation</i> dated April 27, 2010, both within ten days from notice. However, the NBI has not complied with said directive.<br><br>In
 his Comment on the OSG's motion for reconsideration, appellant 
Fernandez argued that when this Court, in the higher interest of 
justice, relaxed the <i>Rule on DNA Evidence</i> to afford Webb the 
fullest extent of his constitutional rights, the prosecution was not 
thereby denied its equally important right to due process. Contrary to 
the OSG's claim that this Court immediately granted DNA testing without 
observing the requisites under Section 4 of the <i>Rule on DNA Evidence</i>,
 and without due notice and hearing, appellant asserts that the 
Resolution dated April 20, 2010 clearly defines the parameters of the 
DNA analysis to be conducted by the UP-NSRI assisted by the NBI. Indeed,
 there are ample safeguards in the Rule to assure the reliability and 
acceptability of the results of the DNA testing.&nbsp; Fernandez, however, 
objected to the statement of the OSG that "in the light of positive 
identification" of appellant Webb by the principal witness for the 
prosecution, Jessica Alfaro, the existing circumstances more than 
warrant the affirmation of Webb's guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfaro's cross-examination 
exposed her as an "out-and-out perjurer, a bold and intentional liar 
under oath" and a "fake witness" whose account of the incident is 
"shot-through with fatal omissions, self-contradictions, inconsistencies
 and inherent improbabilities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup><br><br>Appellant 
Lejano likewise filed his comment, pointing out that the trial court 
denied Webb's motion to direct the NBI to submit semen specimen for DNA 
analysis on November 25, 1997 only after lengthy exchange of pleadings 
between the defense and prosecution, the latter having properly opposed 
said motion.&nbsp; Hence, the People cannot now rightfully claim that there 
was no notice or hearing on the issue of submitting the semen specimen 
for DNA analysis.&nbsp; Citing <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span>[176]</span></sup>
 Lejano contended that the suppression of exculpatory evidence - or 
evidence that will show reasonable probability that the verdict would 
have been different had the evidence been disclosed - grossly violates 
an accused's right to due process.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the evidence needs 
only to be subjected to DNA analysis to establish the innocence of 
appellant Webb, as well as of petitioner and appellant Lejano.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 
further asserted that the semen specimen was already existing at the 
time of the trial, and hence can hardly be considered as "new evidence" 
and that DNA testing of said semen specimen taken from the victim 
Carmela Vizconde "has the scientific potential to produce new 
information that is relevant to the proper resolution of the case" (Sec.
 4 (d), <i>Rule on DNA Evidence</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup><br><br>On his 
part, appellant Webb stressed that there are exceptional circumstances 
that justify this Court's order to immediately conduct the DNA 
analysis.&nbsp; He has been behind bars for more than fifteen (15) years.&nbsp; He
 has filed a motion for DNA analysis as early as 1997 or thirteen (13) 
years ago.&nbsp; The result of such test could yield evidence that could 
acquit him while no damage will be suffered by the prosecution 
considering that this Court emphasized in its Resolution of April 20, 
2010 that the prosecution's evidences and concerns regarding the proper 
preservation of evidence in the custody of the NBI would have to be 
addressed in the light of the requirements laid down by the <i>Rule on DNA Evidence.</i>&nbsp;
 As to the prosecution's argument that this Court cannot receive and 
appreciate "new evidence,"&nbsp; Section 4 of the Rule states that "the 
appropriate court may, at any time, either <i>motu proprio</i> or on 
application of any person who has a legal interest in the matter in 
litigation, order a DNA testing"; DNA testing is even available 
post-conviction (<i>Ibid, </i>Sec. 6).&nbsp;&nbsp; This Court in accordance with 
proper procedure thus decided to receive DNA evidence in order not to 
further delay the case, appellants after all, were convicted more than 
ten (10) years ago in 2000 and have been incarcerated for fifteen (15) 
years now.<br><br>Webb further underscored that where the evidence has 
not been offered, it is the prosecution who should have the legal 
custody and responsibility over it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> The NBI's letter 
dated April 23, 1997 confirmed that the semen specimen was in its 
custody. The NBI's repudiation of such fact is belied by the records; 
the Prosecution's Formal Offer of Evidence shows that Exhibits "S", "T" 
and "U" were merely photographs of the slides containing the vaginal 
smear. Also, nowhere in the transcript of stenographic notes taken 
during Dr. Cabanayan's testimony was it shown that he turned over the 
actual slides to the trial court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, when Dr. Cabanayan 
was asked on February 6, 1996 to produce the slides, which he had 
promised to bring during the previous hearing, he admitted that he 
"forgot all about it" when he came to the hearing. Thus, it appears from
 the record that from the time the semen specimen was taken from Carmela
 Vizconde's cadaver, it has always been in the custody of the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup><br><br>Evidently,
 the NBI could no longer produce the semen specimen/vaginal smear taken 
from the cadaver of Carmela Vizconde and consequently DNA analysis of 
said physical evidence can no longer be done.&nbsp; Hence, this Court set 
aside the April 20, 2010 resolution and forthwith proceeded to resolve 
the present appeal on the basis of existing evidence which have been 
formally offered by the parties and/or made part of the records.<br><br><b><i>Appellant Webb's Urgent </i></b><br><b><i>Motion To Acquit</i></b><br><br>With
 the recall of the order for DNA testing, appellant Webb moved for his 
acquittal on the ground of violation of his constitutional right to due 
process by reason of the State's failure to produce the semen specimen, 
either through negligence or willful suppression.&nbsp; Webb argues that the 
loss or suppression by the prosecution of the semen specimen denied him 
the right to avail of the latest DNA technology and prove his 
innocence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Citing American jurisprudence (<i>Matter of Dabbs v. Vergari</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup><i> California v. Trombetta</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181] </sup>and <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>[182])<i>,</i>
 Webb contends that in disallowing the DNA examination he had requested,
 the RTC denied him from presenting a "complete defense" through that 
"singular piece of evidence that could have definitively established his
 innocence," the trial court relying instead on the identification of 
Jessica Alfaro, a "perjured witness."&nbsp; The constitutional duty of the 
prosecution to turn over exculpatory evidence to the accused includes 
the duty to preserve such evidence.<br><br>Webb maintains that the semen
 specimen extracted from the cadaver of Carmela had exculpatory value, 
as even NBI's Dr. Cabanayan testified during the hearing of February 7, 
1996, that it was still possible to subject the same to DNA analysis to 
identify the person to whom the sperm belonged.&nbsp; Thus, a DNA analysis of
 said semen specimen excluding appellant Webb as the source thereof 
would disprove the prosecution's evidence against him. Further, Webb 
points out that the prosecution considered the presence of spermatozoa 
on the body of Carmela as evidence that she was raped, offering the 
photographs of the glass slides containing the sperm cells as proof that
 she was in fact raped on or about the late evening of June 29, 1991 or 
early morning of June 30, 1991. But the only evidence of the prosecution
 that it was Webb who raped Carmela was the testimony of Alfaro which 
was given full credit by the RTC and CA despite all its inconsistencies,
 and despite all documentary and testimonial evidence presented by the 
defense proving that Webb was at the United States at the time the crime
 was committed.<br><br>On the matter of preserving DNA evidence, Webb cites Section 12 of the <i>Rule on DNA Evidence</i>
 which authorizes the court to order the appropriate government agency 
to preserve the DNA evidence during trial and even when the accused is 
already serving sentence, until such time the decision of the court has 
become final and executory.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this Court has given Webb the best 
opportunity to prove his innocence in the order granting DNA analysis of
 the sperm specimen taken from Carmela's cadaver, such potentially 
exculpatory evidence could not be produced by the State. Webb now claims
 that as a result of the destruction or loss of evidence under the NBI's
 custody, he was effectively deprived of his right to present a complete
 defense, in violation of his constitutional right to due process, thus 
entitling him to an acquittal.<br><br><b><i>Loss of Semen Specimen</i></b><br><b><i>Not Ground For </i></b><br><b><i>Acquittal of Webb </i></b><br><br>Webb's
 argument that under the facts of this case and applying the cited 
rulings from American jurisprudence, he is entitled to acquittal on the 
ground of violation of his constitutional right to due process,is 
without merit.<br><br>In <i>Brady v. Maryland</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> it was held that "the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process <i>where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment</i>,
 irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution."&nbsp; In 
said case, the petitioner was convicted of murder committed in the 
course of robbery and sentenced to death.&nbsp;&nbsp; He later learned that the 
prosecution suppressed an extrajudicial confession made by his 
accomplice who admitted he did the actual killing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The US Supreme 
Court granted a new trial and remanded the case but only on the question
 of punishment.<br><br>In <i>Matter of Dabbs v. Vergari</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup>
 the court ordered DNA testing of specimen taken from a rape victim 
after the sexual assault and from the accused who was convicted, DNA 
testing being unavailable at the time of the trial.&nbsp; Accused therein was
 identified by the victim as her attacker.&nbsp; The court found the factual 
circumstances clearly showed that the semen specimen could have come 
only from the accused.&nbsp; It noted that the witness testified that accused
 acted alone, had ejaculated and she did not have sexual intercourse 
with any other person within 24 hours prior to the sexual assault. DNA 
testing ultimately revealed that petitioner's DNA composition did not 
match with that found on the victim's underwear.&nbsp; Consequently, the 
court granted petitioner's subsequent motions to vacate the judgment of 
conviction.<br><br>In <i>California v. Trombetta,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup>
 a case involving the prosecution for drunk driving, the US Supreme 
Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Constitution does not 
require that law enforcement agencies preserve breath samples in order 
to introduce breath-analysis tests at trial.<br><br><blockquote>Given 
our precedents in this area, we cannot agree with the California Court 
of Appeal that the State's failure to retain breath samples for 
respondents constitutes a violation of the Federal Constitution. To 
begin with, California authorities in this case did not destroy 
respondents' breath samples in a calculated effort to circumvent the 
disclosure requirements established by Brady v. Maryland and its 
progeny.&nbsp; In failing to preserve breath samples for respondents, the 
officers here were acting "in good faith and in accord with their normal
 practice."&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; The record contains no allegation of official animus
 towards respondents or of a conscious effort to suppress exculpatory 
evidence.<br><br>More importantly, California's policy of not preserving breath samples is without constitutional defect.&nbsp; <i>Whatever
 duty the Constitution imposes on the States to preserve evidence, that 
duty must be limited to evidence that might be expected to play a 
significant role in the suspect's defense.</i><br><br>To meet this 
standard of constitutional materiality, x x x evidence must both possess
 an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was 
destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to
 obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.&nbsp; 
Neither of these conditions is met on the facts of this case.&nbsp; [italics 
supplied.]</blockquote><br>From the above cases, it is clear that what 
is crucial is the requirement of materiality of the semen specimen 
sought for DNA testing. Appellant Webb must be able to demonstrate a 
reasonable probability that the DNA sample would prove his innocence. 
Evidence is material where "there is reasonable probability that, had 
the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding
 would have been different."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Yatar,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup><i> </i>decided before the promulgation of the <i>Rule on DNA Evidence,</i>
 the Court expounded on the nature of DNA evidence and the factors to be
 considered in assessing its probative value in the context of 
scientific and legal developments.&nbsp; The proper judicial approach is 
founded on the concurrence of <i>relevancy </i>and <i>reliability.</i>&nbsp; Most important, forensic identification though useful does not preclude independent evidence of identification.<br><br><blockquote>DNA
 is a molecule that encodes the genetic information in all living 
organisms. A person's DNA is the same in each cell and it does not 
change throughout a person's lifetime; the DNA in a person's blood is 
the same as the DNA found in his saliva, sweat, bone, the root and shaft
 of hair, earwax, mucus, urine, skin tissue, and vaginal and rectal 
cells. Most importantly, because of polymorphisms in human genetic 
structure, no two individuals have the same DNA, with the notable 
exception of identical twins.<br><br>DNA print or identification 
technology has been advanced as a uniquely effective means to link a 
suspect to a crime, or to exonerate a wrongly accused suspect, where 
biological evidence has been left. For purposes of criminal 
investigation, <b>DNA identification is a fertile source of both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.</b>
 It can assist immensely in effecting a more accurate account of the 
crime committed, efficiently facilitating the conviction of the guilty, 
securing the acquittal of the innocent, and ensuring the proper 
administration of justice in every case.<br><br>DNA evidence collected 
from a crime scene can link a suspect to a crime or eliminate one from 
suspicion in the same principle as fingerprints are used. Incidents 
involving sexual assault would leave biological evidence such as hair, 
skin tissue, semen, blood, or saliva which can be left on the victim's 
body or at the crime scene. Hair and fiber from clothing, carpets, 
bedding, or furniture could also be transferred to the victim's body 
during the assault. Forensic DNA evidence is helpful in proving that 
there was physical contact between an assailant and a victim. If 
properly collected from the victim, crime scene or assailant, DNA can be
 compared with known samples to place the suspect at the scene of the 
crime.<br><br>The U.P. National Science Research Institute (NSRI), which
 conducted the DNA tests in this case, used the Polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) amplification method by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) 
analysis. With PCR testing, tiny amounts of a specific DNA sequence can 
be copied exponentially within hours. Thus, getting sufficient DNA for 
analysis has become much easier since it became possible to reliably 
amplify small samples using the PCR method.<br><br><b>In assessing the probative value of DNA evidence, courts should consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the following factors</b>:
 how the samples were collected, how they were handled, the possibility 
of contamination of the samples, the procedure followed in analyzing the
 samples, whether the proper standards and procedures were followed in 
conducting the tests, and the qualification of the analyst who conducted
 the tests.<br><br>In the case at bar, Dr. Maria Corazon Abogado de 
Ungria was duly qualified by the prosecution as an expert witness on DNA
 print or identification techniques. Based on Dr. de Ungria's testimony,
 it was determined that the gene type and DNA profile of appellant are 
identical to that of the extracts subject of examination.&nbsp; The blood 
sample taken from the appellant showed that he was of the following gene
 types: vWA 15/19, TH01 7/8, DHFRP2 9/10 and CSF1PO 10/11, which are 
identical with semen taken from the victim's vaginal canal. Verily, a 
DNA&nbsp; match exists between the semen found in the victim and the blood 
sample given by the appellant in open court during the course of the 
trial.<br><br>Admittedly, we are just beginning to integrate these 
advances in science and technology in the Philippine criminal justice 
system, so we must be cautious as we traverse these relatively 
unchartered waters. Fortunately, we can benefit from the wealth of 
persuasive jurisprudence that has developed in other jurisdictions. 
Specifically, the prevailing doctrine in the U.S. has proven 
instructive.<br><br><b>In <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow</i>, it was ruled 
that pertinent evidence based on scientifically valid principles could 
be used as long as it was relevant and reliable.</b> Judges, under <i>Daubert</i>,
 were allowed greater discretion over which testimony they would allow 
at trial, including the introduction of new kinds of scientific 
techniques. DNA typing is one such novel procedure.<br><br><b>Under 
Philippine law, evidence is relevant when it relates directly to a fact 
in issue as to induce belief in its existence or non-existence</b>. Applying the <i>Daubert</i>
 test to the case at bar, the DNA&nbsp; evidence obtained through PCR&nbsp; 
testing&nbsp; and utilizing STR analysis, and which was appreciated by the 
court a quo is relevant and reliable since it is reasonably based on 
scientifically valid principles of human genetics and molecular biology.<br><br><b>Independently
 of the physical evidence of appellant's semen found in the victim's 
vaginal canal, the trial court appreciated the following circumstantial 
evidence as being sufficient to sustain a conviction beyond reasonable 
doubt</b>: (1) Appellant and his wife were living in the house of Isabel
 Dawang together with the victim, Kathylyn Uba; (2) In June 1998, 
appellant's wife left the house because of their frequent quarrels; (3) 
Appellant received from the victim, Kathylyn Uba, a letter from his 
estranged wife in the early morning of June 30, 1998; (4) Appellant was 
seen by Apolonia Wania and Beverly Denneng at 1:00 p.m. of June 30, 1998
 near the kitchen of the house of Isabel Dawang, acting strangely and 
wearing a dirty white shirt with collar; (5) Judilyn Pas-a saw appellant
 going down the ladder of the house of Isabel at 12:30 p.m., wearing a 
dirty white shirt, and again at 1:30 p.m., this time wearing a black 
shirt; (6) Appellant hurriedly left when the husband of Judilyn Pas-a 
was approaching; (7) Salmalina Tandagan saw appellant in a dirty white 
shirt coming down the ladder of the house of Isabel on the day Kathylyn 
Uba was found dead; (8) The door leading to the second floor of the 
house of Isabel Dawang was tied by a rope; (9) The victim, Kathylyn Uba,
 lay naked in a pool of blood with her intestines protruding from her 
body on the second floor of the house of Isabel Dawang, with her stained
 pants, bra, underwear and shoes scattered along the periphery; (10) 
Laboratory examination revealed sperm in the victim's vagina (Exhibits 
"H" and "J"); (11) The stained or dirty white shirt found in the crime 
scene was found to be positive with blood; (12) DNA of slide, Exhibits 
"J" and "H", compared with the DNA profile of the appellant are 
identical; and (13) Appellant escaped two days after he was detained but
 was subsequently apprehended, such flight being indicative of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> [emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><br>Indeed, in other jurisdictions it has been recognized that DNA test results are not always exculpatory.<br><br><blockquote>Postconviction
 test results are not always exculpatory. In addition, exculpatory test 
results will not necessarily free the convicted individual.&nbsp; If the 
evidence does exclude the petitioner, the court must weigh the 
significance of the exclusion in relation to all the other evidence.&nbsp; 
Convicted offenders often believe that if crime scene evidence does not 
contain their DNA they will automatically be exonerated.&nbsp; Not finding 
the petitioner's DNA does not automatically indicate the case should be 
overturned, however.&nbsp; In a rape case, for example, the perpetrator may 
have worn a condom, or not ejaculated.&nbsp; In some cases, the absence of 
evidence is not necessarily evidence of the defendant's absence or lack 
of involvement in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup></blockquote><br>We hold 
that the source of the semen extracted from the vaginal cavity of the 
deceased victim is immaterial in determining Webb's guilt. From the 
totality of the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the 
defense, Webb was positively identified as Carmela's rapist.<br><br>As 
the records bear out, the positive identification of appellant Webb as 
Carmela's rapist satisfied the test of moral certainty, and the 
prosecution had equally established beyond reasonable doubt the fact of 
rape and the unlawful killing of Carmela, Estrellita and Jennifer on the
 occasion thereof.&nbsp; Even assuming that the DNA analysis of the semen 
specimen taken from Carmela's body hours after her death excludes Webb 
as the source thereof, it will not exonerate him from the crime 
charged.&nbsp; Alfaro did not testify that Webb had ejaculated or did not use
 a condom while raping Carmela.&nbsp; She testified that she saw Webb rape 
Carmela and it was only him she had witnessed to have committed the rape
 inside the Vizconde residence between late evening of June 29, 1991 and
 early morning of June 30, 1991. Moreover, she did not testify that 
Carmela had no sexual relations with any other man at least 24 hours 
prior to that time.&nbsp; On the other hand, a positive result of DNA 
examination of the semen specimen extracted by Dr. Cabanayan from 
Carmela's cadaver would merely serve as corroborative evidence.<br><br>As
 to the loss of the semen specimen in the custody of the NBI, appellant 
Webb's contention that this would entitle him to an acquittal on the 
basis of <i>Brady v. Maryland</i> is misplaced.<br><br>In <i>Arizona v. Youngblood,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup>
 a 10-year old boy was molested and sodomized by the accused, a 
middle-aged man, for 1½ hours.&nbsp; After the assault, the boy was examined 
in a hospital where the physician used swab to collect specimen from the
 boy's rectum and mouth, but did not examine them at anytime.&nbsp; These 
samples were refrigerated but the boy's clothing was not.&nbsp; Accused was 
identified by the victim in a photographic lineup and was convicted of 
child molestation, sexual assault and kidnapping.&nbsp; During the trial, 
expert witnesses had testified that timely performance of tests with 
properly preserved semen samples could have produced results that might 
have completely exonerated the accused.&nbsp; The Court held:<br><br><blockquote><b>There
 is no question but that the State complied with Brady and Agurs here.&nbsp; 
The State disclosed relevant police reports to respondent, which 
contained information about the existence of the swab and the clothing,</b>
 and the boy's examination at the hospital.&nbsp; The State provided 
respondents' expert with the laboratory reports and notes prepared by 
the police criminologist, and respondent's expert had access to the swab
 and to the clothing.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Due Process Clause of 
the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in Brady, makes the good or bad
 faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the 
defendant material exculpatory evidence. But we think the Due Process 
Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the 
State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than
 that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might 
have exonerated the defendant. x x x&nbsp; We think that requiring a 
defendant to show bad faith on the part of the police both limits the 
extent of the police's obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable 
bounds and confines it to that class of cases where the interests of 
justice most clearly require it, i.e., those cases in which the police 
themselves by their conduct indicate that the evidence could form a 
basis for exonerating the defendant.&nbsp; We therefore hold that <b>unless a
 criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, 
failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a 
denial of due process of law.</b><br><br>In this case, the police 
collected the rectal swab and clothing on the night of the crime: 
respondent was not taken into custody until six weeks later.&nbsp; <b>The 
failure of the police to refrigerate the clothing and to perform tests 
on the semen samples can at worst be described as negligent.&nbsp; None of 
this information was concealed from respondent at trial, and the 
evidence - such as it was - was made available to respondent's expert 
who declined to perform any tests on the samples</b>.&nbsp; The Arizona Court of Appeals noted in its opinion - and we agree--that <b>there was no suggestion of bad faith on the part of the police.&nbsp; It follows, therefore, from what we have said, that</b> <b>there was no violation of the Due Process Clause.</b>&nbsp; [emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><br>In
 this case, there is no showing of bad faith on the part of the police 
investigators, specifically the NBI, for the non-production of the 
vaginal swab and glass slide containing the semen specimen, during the 
trial and upon our recent order for DNA testing.&nbsp; The prosecution did 
not conceal at anytime the existence of those vaginal swab and glass 
slide containing the vaginal smear.&nbsp; Curiously, despite Dr. Cabanayan's 
admission during the hearing that it was still possible to subject the 
semen specimen to DNA analysis, the defense never raised the issue 
thereafter and resurrected the matter only in October 1997 when Webb's 
counsel filed his motion.<br><br>It bears to stress that the vaginal 
smear itself was not formally offered by the prosecution, but only the 
photographs of the glass slide containing the semen specimen for the 
purpose only of proving that Carmela was in fact raped <i>and not that Webb was the source of the sperm/semen.</i>&nbsp;
 As noted by the RTC when it denied Webb's motion for DNA on November 
25, 1997, prevailing jurisprudence stated that DNA being a relatively 
new science then, has not yet been accorded official recognition by our 
courts.&nbsp; The RTC also considered the more than six (6) years that have 
elapsed since the commission of the crime in June 1991, thus the 
possibility of the specimen having been tampered with or contaminated.&nbsp; 
Acting on reasonable belief that the proposed DNA examination will not 
serve the ends of justice but instead lead to complication and confusion
 of the issues of the case, the trial court properly denied Webb's 
request for DNA testing.<br><br>We thus reiterate that the vaginal smear
 confirming the presence of spermatozoa merely corroborated Alfaro's 
testimony that Carmela was raped before she was killed. Indeed, the 
presence or absence of spermatozoa is immaterial in a prosecution for 
rape. The important consideration in rape cases is not the emission of 
semen but the unlawful penetration of the female genitalia by the male 
organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, a negative result of DNA 
examination of the semen specimen could not have exonerated Webb of the 
crime charged as his identity as a principal in the rape-slay of Carmela
 was satisfactorily established by the totality of the evidence. A 
finding that the semen specimen did not match Webb's DNA does not 
necessarily negate his presence at the <i>locus criminis.</i><br><br><b><i>Civil Liability of Appellants</i></b><br><br>&nbsp;The
 Court sustains the award of P100,000.00 as civil indemnity,&nbsp; pursuant 
to current jurisprudence that in cases of rape with homicide, civil 
indemnity in the amount of P100,000.00 should be awarded to the heirs of
 the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup>&nbsp; Civil indemnity is mandatory and 
granted to the heirs of the victims without need of proof other than the
 commission of the crime. For the deaths of Estrellita and Jennifer, the
 award of civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> to their heirs,<i> </i>was likewise in order, in the amount of P50,000.00 each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Following <i>People v. Dela Cruz,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup><i> </i>P75,000.00 civil indemnity and P75,000 moral damages in rape cases are awarded only if they are classified as heinous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 As the rape-slay of Carmela took place in 1991, R.A. No. 7659 entitled 
"AN ACT TO IMPOSE DEATH PENALTY ON CERTAIN HEINOUS CRIMES, AMENDING FOR 
THAT PURPOSE THE REVISED PENAL LAWS, AS AMENDED, OTHER SPECIAL PENAL 
LAWS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES," which was approved on December 13, 1993 
and was to become effective fifteen (15) days after its publication in 
two national newspapers of general circulation, was not yet effective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup><br><br>As to moral damages, recent jurisprudence allows the amount of P75,000.00 to be awarded in cases of&nbsp; rape with homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup>
 We find the amount of P2,000,000.00 as moral damages awarded by the RTC
 as affirmed by the CA, rather excessive. While courts have a wide 
latitude in ascertaining the proper award for moral damages, the award 
should not be to such an extent that it inflicts injustice on the 
accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> The award of P2,000,000.00 as moral damages 
to the heir of the victims should accordingly be reduced to&nbsp; 
P500,000.00.&nbsp; The rest of the awards given by the trial court are 
affirmed.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I respectfully vote that the appeals in the above-entitled cases be <b>DISMISSED</b> and the Decision dated December 15, 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR H.C. No. 00336 be <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> only as to the award of damages.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>

A Senior Justice of this Court, who was a witness in the case (while he was in private law practice) and who consequently inhibited himself from participation, was even publicly maligned in the print and broadcast media through unsupported speculations about his intervention in the case.&nbsp; That was how bad and how low comments about the case had been.<br><br>In essence, the <i>sub judice</i> rule restricts comments and disclosures pertaining to pending judicial proceedings.&nbsp; The restriction applies not only to participants in the pending case, <i>i.e.</i>, to members of the bar and bench, and to litigants and witnesses, but also to the public in general, which necessarily includes the media.&nbsp; Although the Rules of Court does not contain a specific provision imposing the <i>sub judice</i> rule, it supports the observance of the restriction by punishing its violation as <b>indirect contempt</b> under Section 3(d) of Rule 71:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.&nbsp; Indirect contempt to be punished after charge and hearing. -&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; a person guilty of any of the following acts may be punished for indirect contempt:<br><br><center>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br></center><br>(d) Any improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice[.]<br></blockquote><br>Persons facing charges for indirect contempt for violation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule often invoke as defense their right to free speech and claim that the citation for contempt constitutes a form of impermissible subsequent punishment.<br><br>We have long recognized in this jurisdiction that the freedom of speech under Section 4, Article III of the Constitution is not absolute.&nbsp; A very literal construction of the provision, as espoused by US Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> may lead to the disregard of other equally compelling constitutional rights and principles.&nbsp; In <i>Vicente v.

Diokno</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> we also elucidated this delicate balancing of interests in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>The sovereign power has the inherent right to protect itself and its people from vicious acts which endanger the proper administration of justice; hence, the State has every right to prosecute and punish violators of the law. This is essential for its self-preservation, nay, its very existence. But this does not confer a license for pointless assaults on its citizens. The right of the State to prosecute is not a <i>carte blanche</i> for government agents to defy and disregard the rights of its citizens under the Constitution. Confinement, regardless of duration, is too high a price to pay for reckless and impulsive prosecution. Hence, even if we apply in this case the "multifactor balancing test" which requires the officer to weigh the manner and intensity of the interference on the right of the people, the gravity of the crime committed and the circumstances attending the incident, still we cannot see probable cause to order the detention of petitioners.<br><br>The purpose of the Bill of Rights is to protect the people against arbitrary and discriminatory use of political power. This bundle of rights guarantees the preservation of our natural rights which include personal liberty and security against invasion by the government or any of its branches or instrumentalities. Certainly, in the hierarchy of rights, the Bill of Rights takes precedence over the right of the State to prosecute, and when weighed against each other, the scales of justice tilt towards the former. Thus, relief may be availed of to stop the purported enforcement of criminal law where it is necessary to provide for an orderly administration of justice, to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner, and to afford adequate protection to constitutional rights.<br><br>Let this then be a constant reminder to judges, prosecutors and other government agents tasked with the enforcement of the law that in the performance of their duties they must act with circumspection, lest their thoughtless ways, methods and practices cause a disservice to their office and maim their countrymen they are sworn to serve and protect. We thus caution government agents, particularly the law enforcers, to be more prudent in the prosecution of cases and not to be oblivious of human rights protected by the fundamental law. While we greatly applaud their determined efforts to weed society of felons, let not their impetuous eagerness violate constitutional precepts which circumscribe the structure of a civilized community.</blockquote><br>Indeed, at the core of our criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence of the accused until proven guilty. Lip service to this ideal is not enough, as our people are well acquainted with the painful reality that the rights of the accused to a fair trial were violated with impunity by an unchecked authority in our not so distant history. In response, the rights of the accused were enshrined in no less than the 1987 Constitution, particularly Article III thereof. They are further bolstered by the Rules of Court, related legislation, general rules on evidence, and rules on ethical conduct.<br><br>The said rights of the accused come with the corresponding duties, nay, guarantees on the part of the State, the prosecution in particular. The prosecution's disregard of these standards amounts to prosecutorial misconduct.<br><br>Some examples of prosecutorial misconduct would be the intimidation of defense witnesses, the obstruction of defense lawyers' access to prosecution witnesses, the coercion of confession from the accused, the issuance of prejudicial comments about the accused, the mishandling and/or withholding of evidence, and the failure to preserve evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issuance of Prejudicial Comments<br> About the Accused</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Section 14(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution emphatically mandates:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14. (1) <u>No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law</u>.<br><br>(2) <u>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved</u>, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf. However, after arraignment, trial may proceed notwithstanding the absence of the accused: Provided, that he has been duly notified and his failure to appear is unjustifiable. (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>The presumption of innocence of the accused is at the center of our criminal justice system - the cornerstone, as it were, of all the other rights accorded to the accused, including the right to due process of law. In pronouncing the presumption of innocence of the accused and their right to due process, the Constitution declares that the risk of letting the guilty walk free would be error on the side of justice. This outcome is infinitely better than imprisoning an innocent person.<br><br>Because the accused must be presumed innocent, and because they are entitled to due process of law, it is the duty of the prosecution not to issue prejudicial statements about them while the trial is being conducted. This standard applies with even more force to the trial judge who must at all times not only be impartial, but also appear to be so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Allegations of issuance of prejudicial comments about the accused in this case pertained to the acts of the trial judge, and not the prosecution. When allegations of instances of the trial judge's bias were first brought to this Court, it was understandable that the Court would accord the judge the presumption of regularity in the performance of her duties. Her subsequent acts, however, as well as her Decision - taken together - showed a pattern now recognizable in retrospect as bias against the accused, amounting to denial of due process.<br><br>In <i>Webb, et al. v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the accused assailed the Court of Appeals for denying their Petition for the inhibition from the case of Judge Amelita Tolentino, the presiding judge of Branch 274 of the Regional Trial Court of Paranaque.<br><br>Webb's first Motion for the disqualification of Judge Tolentino, filed prior to their arraignment, was anchored on the ground that the said judge had allegedly told the media that "failure of the accused to surrender following the issuance of the warrant of arrest is an indication of guilt." This motion was denied by Judge Tolentino. Two days later, Webb filed a second motion to disqualify her. Allegedly, she had further told the media that the accused "should not expect the comforts of home," pending the resolution of his Motion to be committed to the custody of the Philippine National Police at Camp Ricardo Papa, Bicutan, Paranaque. The judge again denied the Motion. Gerardo Biong also filed a motion to disqualify her on the ground of bias and partiality, but this Motion was also denied.<br><br>Thereafter, at the hearing for the accused's Petitions for bail during which the prosecution presented Jessica Alfaro, Judge Tolentino issued an Order. The judge ruled that Alfaro could not be cross-examined on the contents of the latter's April 28 Affidavit. The affidavit was held to be inadmissible in evidence, as it was allegedly not executed in the presence of a counsel.<br><br>Alfaro was asked about her brother Patrick Alfaro and her uncle Robert Alfaro. She admitted that her brother was a drug addict and had been arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for illegal drug possession. She further claimed that her brother was now in the United States. The prosecution objected to further questions regarding the arrest and departure of Alfaro's brother on the ground that it was irrelevant, immaterial and impertinent for cross-examination. Despite the defense counsel's explanation that the questions were for the purpose of establishing Alfaro's bias and motive for testifying against the accused, the trial court sustained the objection.<br><br>Similar objections on the ground of irrelevance, immateriality and impertinence were sustained by the trial court when the defense counsel cross-examined Alfaro on her educational attainment. Prior to the cross-examination, Alfaro was shown her transcript of records indicating her completion of only one academic year, thus earning nine units of college.<br><br>Accused then filed a Motion to disqualify Judge Tolentino or inhibit herself from the case due to bias and prejudice, but she denied the Motion.<br><br>The accused thus assailed before this Court <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Order of judge Tolentino denying Webb's motion for hospitalization; and <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the Order of Judge Tolentino disallowing the defense to cross-examine Alfaro on the contents of her April 28 affidavit.<br><br>Accused later filed with this Court a Supplemental Petition to set aside Judge Tolentino's Order denying their Motion for inhibition.<br><br>This Court resolved to refer the petitions to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition.<br><br>In the meantime, the hearing on the accused's Petitions for bail continued, with petitioner Webb filing a motion for deposition of witnesses residing in the United States, who would testify on his presence in that country on the date of the commission of the crime. This Petition was denied by Judge Tolentino on the ground that petitioner failed to allege that the witnesses did not have the means to go to the place of the trial. Petitioner Webb filed another Supplemental Petition to the Court of Appeals challenging the said Order.<br><br>The defense made their Formal Offer of Evidence upon conclusion of the hearings on the Petitions for bail. The prosecution filed its Comment/Objection to the Formal Offer of Evidence. Judge Tolentino ruled on the accused's formal offer of evidence, admitting only ten <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> out of the one hundred forty-two [142] exhibits offered by the defense. Subsequently, the judge denied the accused's Petitions for bail.<br><br>The Court of Appeals rendered its Decision on the various Petitions and Supplemental Petitions, reversing Judge Tolentino's refusal to admit Alfaro's April 28 Affidavit. The appellate court, however, denied all the other reliefs prayed for. The accused thus elevated the matter to this Court.<br><br>They subsequently filed a Supplemental Petition, alleging, among others, that during the trial on the merits, Judge Tolentino had allowed prosecution witness Atty. Pedro Rivera to testify on the character of the accused, although the defense had not put his character in issue; that the judge disallowed the defense to impeach the credibility of Atty. Rivera by the presentation of an earlier statement executed by him, on the ground that his statement was immaterial; and that, after ruling that the proffer of oral evidence made by defense counsel Atty. Vitaliano Aguirre was improper on cross-examination, Judge Tolentino struck the proffer from the record.<br><br>We affirmed the Court of Appeals' disposition, explaining as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A critical component of due process is a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal [and] every litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge for all the other elements of due process, like notice and hearing, would be meaningless if the ultimate decision would come from a partial and biased judge.[However, t]his right must be weighed with the duty of a judge to decide cases without fear of repression. Hence, to disqualify a judge on the ground of bias and prejudice the movant must prove the same by clear and convincing evidence. ...<br><br>As a general rule, repeated rulings against a litigant, no matter how erroneous and vigorously and consistently expressed, are not a basis for disqualification of a judge on grounds of bias and prejudice. Extrinsic evidence is required to establish bias, bad faith, malice or corrupt purpose, in addition to the palpable error which may be inferred from the decision or order itself. Although the decision may seem so erroneous as to raise doubts concerning a judge's integrity, absent extrinsic evidence, the decision itself would be insufficient to establish a case against the judge. The only exception to the rule is when the error is so gross and patent as to produce an ineluctable inference of bad faith or malice.<br><br>A perusal of the records will reveal that petitioners failed to adduce any extrinsic evidence to prove that respondent judge was motivated by malice or bad faith in issuing the assailed rulings. Petitioners simply lean on the alleged series of adverse rulings of the respondent judge which they characterized as palpable errors. This is not enough. We note that respondent judge's rulings resolving the various motions filed by petitioners were all made after considering the arguments raised by all the parties. It is true that the respondent judge erred in some of her rulings such as her rejection of petitioners' one hundred thirty two pieces of evidence. It appears, however, that respondent judge reversed this erroneous ruling and already admitted these 132 pieces of evidence after finding that "the defects in [their] admissibility have been cured through the introduction of additional evidence during the trial on the merits." This correction diminishes the strength of petitioners' charge that respondent judge is hopelessly biased against them. ...<br><br>... There is still another reason why we should observe caution in disqualifying respondent judge. The trial of the petitioners is about to end and to assign a new judge to determine the guilt or innocence of petitioners will not be for the best interest of justice. The records of the case at bar run into volumes. These voluminous records cannot capture in print the complete credibility of witnesses when they testified in court. As the respondent judge observed the demeanor of witnesses while in the witness chair, she is in the best position to calibrate their credibility. The task of evaluating the credibility of witnesses includes interpreting their body language and their meaningful nuances are not expressed in the transcripts of their testimonies.<br><br>We hasten to stress that a party aggrieved by erroneous interlocutory rulings in the course of a trial is not without remedy. The range of remedy is provided in our Rules of Court and we need not make an elongated discourse on the subject. But certainly, the remedy for erroneous rulings, absent any extrinsic evidence of malice or bad faith, is not the outright disqualification of the judge. For there is yet to come a judge with the omniscience to issue rulings that are always infallible. The courts will close shop if we disqualify judges who err for we all err.</blockquote><br><b>Mishandling and/or <br>Withholding of Evidence</b><br><br>The rights of the accused to have compulsory process to secure the production of evidence on their behalf is a right enshrined in no less than our Constitution, particularly Article III,&nbsp; Section 14 thereof, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14:<br><br>(1)No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.<br><br>(2)<u>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused</u> shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and <u>shall enjoy the right</u> to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and <u>to have compulsory process to secure</u> the attendance of witnesses and <u>the production of evidence in his behalf</u>.

The accused may, however, waive his presence at the trial pursuant to the stipulations set forth in his tail, unless his presence is specifically ordered by the court for purposes of identification. The absence of the accused without justifiable cause at the trial of which he had notice shall be considered a waiver of his right to be present thereat. When an accused under custody escapes, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to be present on all subsequent trial dates until custody over him is regained. Upon motion, the accused may be allowed to defend himself in person when it sufficiently appears to the court that he can properly protect his rights without the assistance of counsel.<br><br>(d) To testify as a witness in his own behalf but subject to cross-examination on matters covered by direct examination. His silence shall not in any manner prejudice him.<br><br>(e) To be exempt from being compelled to be a witness against himself.<br><br>(f) To confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him at the trial. Either party may utilize as part of its evidence the testimony of a witness who is deceased, out of or can not with due diligence be found in the Philippines, unavailable, or otherwise unable to testify, given in another case or proceeding, judicial or administrative, involving the same parties and subject matter, the adverse party having the opportunity to cross-examine him.<br><br>(g) <u>To have compulsory process issued to secure the attendance of witnesses and production of other evidence in his behalf</u>.<br><br>(h) To have speedy, impartial and public trial.<br><br>(i) To appeal in all cases allowed and in the manner prescribed by law.

Before submitting his Counter-Affidavit, Webb filed with the DOJ Panel a Motion for Production and Examination of Evidence and Documents for the NBI to produce, among others, any other written statements of Alfaro.<br><br>The DOJ Panel granted the Motion, and the NBI submitted a mere photocopy of an earlier Sworn Statement of Alfaro dated 28 April 1995. The Statement did not appear to be signed by Alfaro's counsel of choice, named as Atty. Arturo Mercader, Jr.. in the same document. In this earlier Sworn Statement, Alfaro declared that she had never met Carmela before that fateful night; that she did not know why the accused wanted to enter the Vizconde house, except that they were after Carmela; that the accused entered the premises by jumping over the fence; that she did not know how the accused were able to enter the house, as she was about ten (10) meters away from the kitchen door; that she did not know who opened that door for the accused, but hinted that one of the maids must have done it since Estrellita and Carmela were tied; and that she had no idea what transpired in the house until they left the area.<br><br>This Statement contradicted salient points in Alfaro's 22 May 1995 Sworn Statement, which was the basis of the NBI's complaint. In her 22 May 1995 Sworn Statement, Alfaro claimed to have known Carmela since February 1991; that the group decided to rape Carmela when Alfaro informed Webb that Carmela had dropped off a man who appeared to be her boyfriend; that Carmela left open the gate through which they entered the premises freely; that Alfaro led the group in entering the kitchen door; that she witnessed the rape of Carmela by Webb and also saw the bodies of Estrellita and Jennifer piled up on the bed.<br><br>The NBI explained that they produced a mere photocopy of the 28 April 1995 Sworn Statement, because the original was lost. When the DOJ Panel refused to issue a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> to Atty. Mercader, the accused filed a case with the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 63, to obtain the original of the first Sworn Statement. Atty. Mercader then appeared and produced before the trial court the original Sworn Statement of Alfaro dated 28 April 1995, which also contained his signature. Webb retained a certified true copy of the first Sworn Statement (certified by Assistant State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuno), while the duplicate original copy thereof was submitted to the DOJ Panel.<br><br>The DOJ Panel still found probable cause to charge the accused and on 10 August 1995, an Information for Rape with Homicide was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Paranaque against Webb, et al. It was raffled to Branch 274, presided by Judge Amelita Tolentino, who thereupon issued warrants for their arrest.<br><br>Webb et al. came to this Court to assail the DOJ Panel's finding and the trial court's issuance of warrants for their arrest. We upheld the right of petitioners to compel the NBI to disclose exculpatory evidence in their favor:<br><br><blockquote>Further, petitioners charge the NBI with violating their right to discovery proceedings during their preliminary investigation by suppressing the April 28, 1995 original copy of the sworn statement of Alfaro and the FBI Report. The argument is novel in this jurisdiction and as it urges an expansive reading of the rights of persons under preliminary investigation it deserves serious consideration. To start with, our Rules on Criminal Procedure do not expressly provide for discovery proceedings during the preliminary investigation stage of a criminal proceeding. Sections 10 and 11 of Rule 117 do provide an accused the right to move for a bill of particulars and for production or inspection of material evidence in possession of the prosecution. But these provisions apply after the filing of the Complaint or Information in court and the rights are accorded to the accused to assist them to make an intelligent plea at arraignment and to prepare for trial.<br><br>This failure to provide discovery procedure during preliminary investigation does not, however, negate its use by a person under investigation when indispensable to protect his constitutional right to life, liberty and property. Preliminary investigation is not too early a stage to guard against any significant erosion of the constitutional right to due process of a potential accused. As aforediscussed, the object of a preliminary investigation is to determine the probability that the suspect committed a crime. We hold that the finding of a probable cause by itself subjects the suspect's life, liberty and property to real risk of loss or diminution. In the case at bar, the risk to the liberty of petitioners cannot be understated for they are charged with the crime of rape with homicide, a non-bailable offense when the evidence of guilt is strong.<br><br>Attuned to the times, our Rules have discarded the pure inquisitorial system of preliminary investigation. Instead, Rule 112 installed a quasi-judicial type of preliminary investigation conducted by one whose high duty is to be fair and impartial. 44 As this Court emphasized in Rolito Go vs. Court of Appeals, "the right to have a preliminary investigation conducted before being bound over for trial for a criminal offense, and hence formally at risk of incarceration or some other penalty, is not a mere or technical right; it is a substantive right." A preliminary investigation should therefore be scrupulously conducted so that the constitutional right to liberty of a potential accused can be protected from any material damage. We uphold the legal basis of the right of petitioners to demand from their prosecutor, the NBI, the original copy of the April 28, 1995 sworn statement of Alfaro and the FBI Report during their preliminary investigation considering their exculpatory character, and hence, unquestionable materiality to the issue of their probable guilt. The right is rooted on the constitutional protection of due process which we rule to be operational even during the preliminary investigation of a potential accused. It is also implicit in Section (3) (a) of Rule 112 which requires during the preliminary investigation the filing of a sworn complaint which shall ". . . state the known address of the respondent and be accompanied by affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses as well as other supporting documents . . . ."<br><br>In laying down this rule, the Court is not without enlightened precedents from other jurisdictions. In the 1963 watershed case of <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>&nbsp; the United States Supreme Court held that "suppression of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution." Its progeny is the 1935 case of <i>Mooney v. Holohan</i>&nbsp; which laid down the proposition that a prosecutor's intentional use of perjured testimony to procure conviction violates due process. Thus, evolved jurisprudence firming up the prosecutor's duty to disclose to the defense exculpatory evidence in its possession. The rationale is well put by Justice Brennan in <i>Brady</i>&nbsp; -- "society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair." Indeed, prosecutors should not treat litigation like a game of poker where surprises can be sprung and where gain by guile is not punished. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Nevertheless, we ruled that with the production of the first Sworn Statement, "(p)etitioners thus had the fair chance to explain to the DOJ Panel then still conducting their preliminary investigation the exculpatory aspects of this sworn statement. Unfortunately for petitioners, the DOJ Panel still found probable cause to charge them despite the alleged material discrepancies between the first and second sworn statements of Alfaro. For reasons we have expounded, this finding of probable cause cannot be struck down as done with grave abuse of discretion."<br><br>It appeared, however, that the prosecution would continue to suppress&nbsp; Alfaro's first Sworn Statement. When bail hearings commenced on 9 October 1995, the prosecution started with a presentation of the testimony of Alfaro. On 16 October 1995, Alfaro was allowed by the trial court to testify on the circumstances surrounding the execution of the two Sworn Statements, notwithstanding that said statements were not presented for proper identification and marking. On cross-examination, Alfaro admitted that in the first Sworn Statement were answers that were not hers, but were only supplied by the NBI agents then present during the statement-taking. For instance, she stated that the answer to question number 8 is not true, because she only finished second year and was not actually a college graduate.<br><br>On the third day of Alfaro's cross-examination, the prosecution objected to questions referring to the first Sworn Statement on the ground that it was made without the assistance of counsel. The trial court sustained the objection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The accused's counsel orally sought reconsideration, but this was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> When counsel moved for reconsideration, the trial court denied the motion "with finality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The accused's counsel then showed the trial court their copy of the first Sworn Statement containing Atty. Mercader's signature and certified as a true copy by Asst. Prosecutor Zuno. In turn, Assitant Prosecutor Atty. Zuno, who had the duplicate original thereof, failed or refused to produce the statement despite repeated requests from the accused Webb. (It was produced only on 24 October 1995.) Alfaro's cross-examination continued, with no question pertaining to the first Sworn Statement allowed.<br><br>On 8 November 1995, the trial court issued its Order dated 30 October 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in open court. The Court rejected the admissibility of the first Sworn Statement and barred its use for the purpose of impeaching Alfaro's credibility or for refuting her subsequent statements. All previous questions and answers connected with the said Sworn Statement were also ordered expunged from the records. The trial court reasoned that the said Sworn Statement was an "illegally obtained evidence, and therefore, cannot be used either directly or indirectly against Alfaro." Citing Section 12, Article III of the Constitution, the trial court concluded that "Alfaro could not be cross-examined by the defense on the contents of the said affidavit in order to discredit her statement dated May 22, 1995 and her testimony in open court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>This Order led accused Webb et al. to seek Judge Tolentino's inhibition and to incorporate the above instance as part of their proof of the trial judge's bias. The Court of Appeals denied the Petition, and we affirmed the denial in the manner laid out in the preceding discussion.<br><br><b>Failure to Preserve Evidence</b><br><br>As discussed in the preceding section, the accused's right to access to evidence necessitates in the correlative duty of the prosecution to produce and permit the inspection of the evidence, and not to suppress or alter it. When the prosecution is called upon not to suppress or alter evidence in its possession that may benefit the accused, it is also necessarily obliged to preserve the said evidence. To hold otherwise would be to render illusory the existence of such right.<br><br>The advent of DNA technology prompted this Court's promulgation of the New Rules for DNA Evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> As DNA evidence provides objective proof of identification and may be obtained from evidence left in the scene of the crime or in the victim's person, it also gives new meaning to the above duty of the prosecution.<br><br>The prosecution did not fare well when measured against this standard.<br><br>Alfaro testified that the group had earlier agreed that Webb would be the first to rape Carmela. When Alfaro said she saw Webb pumping Carmela, while two bloodied bodies were on top of the bed, the former was so shocked that she "stepped back and turned around to go outside." On her way out, she met Ventura near the door. He said, "Prepare escape." Things had apparently gone awry, so they left the place. The NBI proclaimed that the semen samples they had collected from Carmela were preserved in slides and remained intact. Thus, in order for the prosecution's theory to be consistent, pursuant to the quantum required in criminal cases, the DNA evidence in the slides must positively match that from accused Webb.<br><br>Based on the foregoing circumstances, the defense counsel accordingly filed a Motion to Direct NBI to Submit Semen Specimen to DNA Analysis during the course of the trial. Several exchanges of pleadings on the matter were filed before the trial court, and at no time was the timeliness of the filing of the Motion at issue.&nbsp; It could not have been, considering that the Motion was timely filed during the course of the trial. While the Motion was filed six years after the crime was committed, the trial of the accused herein did not start until more than four years after the commission of the crime.<br><br>The trial court denied the Motion on 25 November 1997, holding that since more than six (6) years had lapsed since the commission of the crime, there was no assurance that the semen specimen remained uncontaminated. Also, the trial court held that Webb was not able to show that the proper procedure for the extraction and preservation of the semen sample had been complied with. Finally, the trial court held that a DNA test would only lead to confusion of the issues.<br><br>However, as correctly held by Justice Lucenito Tagle in his Dissenting Opinion, the trial judge's objections to the DNA testing were based on mere conjectures that ran against the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.<br><br>Meanwhile, the idea that a negative DNA test result would not have necessarily exculpated Webb, because previous sexual congress by Carmela with another man prior to the crime could not be discounted, would unrealistically raise the bar of evidence - and for the wrong party, i.e., for the part of the defense, instead of for the prosecution.&nbsp; If a negative DNA test result could not be considered as providing certainty that Webb did not commit the crime, would it not have at least cast a reasonable doubt that he committed it?<br><br>Moreover, the argument against the relevance of the semen sample - that the presence of semen was not necessary to prove that rape was committed - is not in point. What the defense was after when it sought DNA testing was neither to prove nor to disprove the commission of rape, but to pinpoint the identity of the assailant. In this case, semen with spermatozoa was in fact obtained, and it did possess exculpatory potential that might be beneficial to the accused. In <i>Tijing v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we held that "courts should apply the results of science when competently obtained in aid of situations presented, since to reject said result is to deny progress." Hence, it is the constitutional duty of the trial judge to afford all possible means to both the NBI and the counsel for accused, in order that such evidence may be scrutinized in open court. The Court held in <i>People v. Yatar:</i><br><br><blockquote>DNA print or identification technology has been advanced as a uniquely effective means to link a suspect to a crime, or to exonerate a wrongly accused suspect, where biological evidence has been left. For purposes of criminal investigation, DNA identification is a fertile source of both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. It can assist immensely in effecting a more accurate account of the crime committed, efficiently facilitating the conviction of the guilty, securing the acquittal of the innocent, and ensuring the proper administration of justice in every case.<br><br>DNA evidence collected from a crime scene can link a suspect to a crime or eliminate one from suspicion in the same principle as fingerprints are used. Incidents involving sexual assault would leave biological evidence such as hair, skin tissue, semen, blood, o saliva which can be left on the victim's body or at the crime scene. Hair and fiber from clothing, carpets, bedding or furniture could also be transferred to the victim's body during the assault. Forensic DNA evidence is helpful in proving that there was physical contact between an assailant and a victim. If properly collected from the victim, crime scene or assailant, DNA can be compared with known samples to place the suspect at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><span></span></blockquote></span><br><sup style="color: rgb(255,="" 0,="" 0);=""><span>Thus, when the present case reached this Court and a similar Motion&nbsp; was filed, we resolved to grant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> petitioner's motion to allow DNA testing of the semen sample collected from the victim in order to compare it with Webb's DNA.

Since then, the technology has grown by leaps and bounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the United States, there are now only eight (8) states that have not adopted statutes allowing post-conviction DNA testing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>, with some requiring the correlative duty to preserve DNA evidence. So far, 261 convicts in the United States have been exonerated as a result of post-conviction DNA testing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Second, <i>Youngblood</i> was not a product of a unanimous Decision. The majority opinion in <i>Youngblood</i> was penned by Justice Rehnquist and concurred in by Justices White, O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy, with Justice Stevens concurring with the result and writing a Separate Opinion. Justice Blackmun wrote a strong Dissent, which was joined in by Justices Brennan and Marshall.<br><br>A critique<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the <i>Youngblood</i> decision points out that there are two competing due process interests therein. On the one hand is <b>adjudicative fairness</b>, which "seeks to ensure that the accused receives meaningful protection in court, in other words, reliable fact finding and a fair trial. ... [and which] manifests itself in an assessment of the materiality of evidence and prejudice to the accused ...[as] paramount in determining whether a due process violation has occurred." On the other hand is<b> instrumentalism</b>, which seeks "to impose restraints on the state. ...[by] punishing the state for police and prosecutorial misconduct. ... to deter future misconduct and to create a prophylactic effect. In measuring the misconduct, one examines the subjective intent of the officer and whether the officer acted in good faith or bad faith. Under this approach, the focus is on the state, not the individual. Moreover, the focus on the state and on deterring official misconduct invites an examination of the costs of providing additional process."<br><br>The majority opinion in <i>Youngblood</i> focused on the state of mind of the police officer rather than on materiality and fairness to the accused. However, in his Separate Opinion wherein he registered his reservation to the bad faith standard being laid out by the majority, Justice Stevens recognized that "there may well be cases in which the defendant is unable to prove that the State acted in bad faith but in which the loss or destruction of evidence is nonetheless so critical to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally unfair."<br><br>While the earlier case <i>Brady v. Maryland<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></b></i> held that due process violation could be committed even without bad faith,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><sup> </sup>the majority distinguished <i>Youngblood</i> from <i>Brady </i>by holding that the evidence in <i>Brady</i> was clearly favorable to the accused, while that in <i>Youngblood</i> was only <i>potentially</i> exculpatory.<br><br>Justice Blackmun opined, though, that it was impossible for the accused to prove that a particular piece of evidence was exculpatory when, precisely, it was no longer in existence. Justice Blackmun also disapproved of the bad-faith standard, because "(a)part from the inherent difficulty a defendant would have in obtaining evidence to show a lack of good faith, the line between `good faith' and `bad faith' is anything but bright, and the majority's formulation may well create more questions than it answers."<br><br>Justice Blackmun proposed the following alternative to the bad-faith standard:<br><br><blockquote>Rather than allow a State's ineptitude to saddle a defendant with an impossible burden, a court should focus on the type of evidence, the possibility it might prove exculpatory, and the existence of other evidence going to the same point of contention in determining whether the failure to preserve the evidence in question violated due process. To put it succinctly, where no comparable evidence is likely to be available to the defendant, police must preserve physical evidence of a type that they reasonably should know has the potential, if tested, to reveal immutable characteristics of the criminal, and hence to exculpate a defendant charged with the crime.</blockquote><br>Justice Blackmun then gave his opinion on how to balance the defendant's rights and the duty imposed upon the law enforcement to preserve evidence:<br><br><blockquote>Due process must also take into account the burdens that the preservation of evidence places on the police. Law enforcement officers must be provided the option, as is implicit in <em>Trombetta,</em> of performing the proper tests on physical evidence and then discarding it. Once a suspect has been arrested, the police, after a reasonable time, may inform defense counsel of plans to discard the evidence. When the defense has been informed of the existence of the evidence, after a reasonable time, the burden of preservation may shift to the defense. There should also be flexibility to deal with evidence that is unusually dangerous or difficult to store.<br></blockquote><br>Third, it is not amiss to note that in the year 2000, the injustice of the <i>Youngblood</i> decision was brought into sharp relief when more sophisticated DNA technology was used on the degraded evidence. The technology yielded a DNA profile that (1) exonerated Larry Youngblood of the crime charged (child molestation, sexual assault and kidnapping) and (2) enabled the police to find the real offender. Excerpts from the website of The Innocence Project, an organization advocating the use of DNA evidence, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Larry Youngblood was convicted in 1985 of child molestation, sexual assault, and kidnapping. He was sentenced to ten years and six months in prison. In October 1983, a ten year old boy was abducted from a carnival in Pima County, Arizona, and molested and sodomized repeatedly for over an hour by a middle aged man. The victim was taken to a hospital, where the staff collected semen samples from his rectum as well as the clothing he was wearing at the time of the assault.<br><br>Based on the boy's description of the assailant as a man with one disfigured eye, Youngblood was charged with the crime. He maintained his innocence at trial, but the jury convicted him, based largely on the eyewitness identification of the victim. No serological tests were conducted before trial, as the police improperly stored the evidence and it had degraded. Expert witnesses at trial stated that, had the evidence been stored correctly, test results might have demonstrated conclusively Youngblood's innocence.<br><br>Larry Youngblood appealed his conviction, claiming the destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence violated his due process rights, and the Arizona Court of Appeals set aside his conviction. He was released from prison, three years into his sentence, but in 1988, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's ruling, and his conviction was reinstated (Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51). Youngblood remained free as the case made its way through the Arizona appellate court system a second time, but returned to prison in 1993, when the Arizona Supreme Court reinstated his conviction.<br><br>In 1998, Youngblood was released on parole, but was sent back to prison in 1999 for failing to register his new address, as required by Arizona sex offender laws. In 2000, upon request from his attorneys, the police department tested the degraded evidence using new, sophisticated DNA technology. Those results exonerated Youngblood, and he was released from prison in August 2000. The district attorney's office dismissed the charges against Larry Youngblood that year.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, the DNA profile from the evidence was entered into the national convicted offender databases. In early 2001, officials got a hit, matching the profile of Walter Cruise, who is blind in one eye and currently serving time in Texas on unrelated charges. In August 2002, Cruise was convicted of the crime and sentenced to twenty-four years in prison.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>In view of all the foregoing salient objections to <i>Youngblood</i>, it should not be adopted in this jurisdiction.<br><br>While it is a laudable objective to inquire into the state of mind of the prosecution and punish it when it has committed prosecutorial misconduct, there are times when, undoubtedly, whether through malice or plain ineptitude, its act or omission results in plain injustice to the accused.<br><br>In our various decisions relating to interlucotory orders and incidents pertaining to this case, this court's adherence to instrumentalism has led to our finding in each instance that there was no due process violation committed against petitioner, because bad faith was not shown by the prosecution or the trial judge.<br><br>However, since "the task of the pillars of the criminal justice system is to preserve our democratic society under the rule of law, ensuring that all those who appear before or are brought to the bar of justice are afforded a fair opportunity to present their side,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the measure of whether the accused herein has been deprived of due process of law should not be limited to the state of mind of the prosecution, but should include fundamental principles of fair play. Hence, as we write <i>finis</i> to this case, it is time we evaluate the total picture that the prosecution's acts or omissions have wrought upon the accused's rights with each seemingly innocuous stroke, whatever its intention may have been.<br><br>The various violations of the accused's rights have resulted in his failure to secure a just trial.

U. L. Rev. 241, Norman C. Bay reported (pp. 282-283):<br><br>Forensic DNA typing was not developed until 1985, when Dr. Alec Jeffreys, an English scientist, used the technique to exonerate one suspect in the sexual assault and murder of two young girls and to inculpate another. Three years later, in 1988, the same year Youngblood was decided, the FBI began testing DNA. That same year, for the first time, a state appellate court upheld the admission of DNA evidence in a criminal case. The crime at issue in Youngblood occurred well before the advent of DNA testing, and the Supreme Court decided the case when DNA testing was in its infancy, still embroiled in litigation over its reliability and admissibility.<br><br>In the two decades since it was first used, forensic DNA typing has continued to progress. At this point, scientists have developed three generations of tests. The current, dominant generation of technology is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This approach analyzes DNA taken from the nucleus of a cell. PCR allows the DNA in a biological sample to be replicated; only a minute amount of DNA is needed and the sample from which it comes can be highly degraded. Only a few cells are required for reliable results. Usable DNA can be recovered from a myriad of items, including computer keyboards, hats, bandannas, eyeglasses, facial tissue, cotton swabs, dirty laundry, toothpicks, chewing gum, cigarette butts, envelope seals, the mouths of bottles, the rims of glasses, or urine stains.<br><br>PCR is usually followed by short tandem repeat (STR) testing, which compares thirteen specific regions, or loci, found on nuclear DNA. The odds that two unrelated individuals will share the same thirteen-loci DNA profile can be as high as one in a billion or more. Thus, PCR-STR analysis is both highly sensitive and discriminating. It is sensitive in that small amounts of biological material can be tested. It is discriminating in that the results of a thirteen-loci comparison generate unique DNA profiles that can establish guilt or innocence to a practical certainty in certain types of cases.<br><br>Yet another powerful forensic DNA tool has emerged: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing. Unlike STR analysis, this technique examines the DNA contained in the mitochondria of a cell, not its nucleus. This is important because some biological material, including hair shafts, bones, and teeth, lack nuclei, but possess mitochondria. In some cases, especially those involving decomposed tissue, only teeth or bones may remain. Mitochondrial DNA testing allows for the study and comparison of DNA in such material. One drawback to mtDNA is that it is not as discriminating as STR. Mitochondrial DNA is passed maternally; consequently, siblings and maternal relatives have the same mtDNA, and the test cannot distinguish among them. Nonetheless, mtDNA provides a powerful supplement to STR and may allow for analysis when none is otherwise available. Among other things, mtDNA has identified one of the unknown soldiers in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, the remains of Czar Nicholas II and his family, and the likely offspring of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Heming.<br><br>Since 1985, the field of forensic DNA typing has continued to progress. Emerging Y-chromosome analysis focuses on variations in male genetic material; it may prove to be helpful in sexual assault cases involving multiple male perpetrators. Hand-held or portable devices with "labs-on-a-chip" may be developed that allow for rapid DNA testing at a crime scene. Robotic systems are already being used to help process DNA samples. Similarly, computer software compares and interprets STR data. In short, forensic DNA typing will continue to become increasingly automated, faster, cheaper, and more accurate. This, in turn, ought to affect the due process calculus when the state loses or destroys potentially exculpatory evidence. The context in which such problems arise today is entirely different than when Youngblood was decided." (Citations omitted.)<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; 98 J. Crim.
