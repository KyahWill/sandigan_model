It is admitted by the accused that Patrick Teng was brought to Pampanga on the day he was abducted and was released shortly before midnight the next day or on December 15, 1994.  There is likewise no dispute that a PhP 2.5 million ransom was raised by the Teng family on December 15, 1994 and was handed to Chung in the evening of the same day for the payment and release of Patrick Teng as instructed by the negotiator.  The undisputed facts also show that Chung was apprehended by the PACC shortly after midnight or very early on December 16, 1994; while Jimboy Bringas and Navarro were apprehended at past 1:00 p.m. on December 16, 1994; and the other accused were apprehended in Pampanga late afternoon and early evening on December 16, 1994.<br><br>Both courts <i>a quo</i> found all accused guilty beyond reasonable for the crime of carnapping and kidnapping.  With the instant appeal, what remains to be resolved is the respective criminal liability or lack thereof of accused-appellants Navarro, Chung, Jimboy and Bobby Bringas.  An assiduous review of the records at hand, particularly the testimonies of both prosecution and defense witnesses, however, constrains this Court to affirm the appellate court's decision and resolution affirming their conviction except that of Bobby Bringas.<br><br><b>Prosecution Witnesses More Credible</b><br><br><b>First</b>. The testimonies of prosecution witnesses Maricel Hipos and Eric Teng were straightforward, cohesive, positive and credible.  More so when they are corroborated on material points by the testimonies of both prosecution and defense witnesses.  Besides, there is no showing that Maricel Hipos and Eric Teng had any motive to falsely testify against the accused.  As a rule, absent any evidence showing any reason or motive for prosecution witnesses to perjure, the logical conclusion is that no such improper motive exists, and their testimonies are thus worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>The testimony of Maricel was initially assailed by accused-appellant Sulayao who testified that when the kidnapping was carried out they did not use any weapon or handgun, that they were let into the house voluntarily by Maricel and that it was Rosales who took Patrick Teng without a struggle.  This assertion was uniformly shared by Pajarillo, Calaguas and Ross.  However, aside from their mere assertion, they did not present any evidence supporting such contention.<br><br>The testimony of Maricel on what occurred is corroborated by the testimony of the accused that the gift Calaguas was holding did not fit the aperture in the gate.  Maricel never intended them to enter the Teng's premises but was merely constrained to open the gate due to the ruse adopted by the accused.<br><br>Very telling are the testimonies of Pajarillo, Sulayao and Ross asserting that they did not see Maricel.  This is incredulous for Maricel positively identified them as among the companions of Rosales during the extra-judicial line-up conducted by the PACC in Camp Crame.  Aside from Calaguas, Maricel picked out Pajarillo, Sulayao and Ross from a line-up of about 15 men.  During her testimony in open court, she again positively identified them.  If indeed they did not meet her, Maricel could not have identified them as among the companions of Rosales and Calaguas.<br><br>Moreover, the mere denials of Calaguas, Pajarillo, Sulayao and Ross cannot prevail over the positive assertion of Maricel that she was with Sweeney, the sister of Eric Teng, and two other helpers, Dina and Melanie, who were the "yayas" of Patrick and Mikee.  Pajarillo, Sulayao, Calaguas and Ross want the Court to believe that it was only Maricel who was in the house of Eric Teng or that aside from her there was nobody in the first floor of Eric Teng's house when Rosales supposedly brought down Patrick Teng.<br><br>Further, the testimony of Maricel is not only credible but cohesive as well considering the events that transpired from the phone call received at around 11:30 a.m. to the arrival of the kidnappers at 1:30 p.m., the time Dina was able to find scissors to cut their bindings and being freed therefrom and calling Kimbol, who rushed to Eric's place; then Kimbol calling Eric at around 2:30 p.m. with the latter rushing home.  The testimony of Eric would show how he received the call from his brother, his rushing home and receiving the first call from the negotiator [kidnappers] at around 3:10 p.m.<br><br>As to the use of violence and intimidation, it is abundantly clear from Maricel's testimony that the accused indeed used guns to threaten and intimidate them.  At the very least, Maricel positively identified Calaguas as the one holding the gift and poking her with a gun when she opened the gate, and her being herded together with Sweeney and the other house helpers to the children's room at the second floor.  The use of guns to threaten and intimidate is not only plausible but well nigh credible considering the crime involved.  Besides, it must be noted that during the press conference on December 17, 1994, caught on camera and shown during the evening news on the same day was Pajarillo uttering words to the effect that Chung provided them with a .45 caliber and a .38 caliber handguns.<br><br>It must be noted that there is no showing that Maricel simply made up the details of her testimony or that she was coached.  Both courts <i>a quo</i> found her testimony credible, cohesive and straightforward.  We find no cogent reason to substitute the findings of the trial court as affirmed by the appellate court.    Besides, the trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies because of their unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand, and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination--significant factors in evaluating the sincerity of witnesses, in the process of unearthing the truth.[117]<br><br>Furthermore, the testimony of Eric supplies what transpired after he received the call from his brother Kimbol on December 14, 1994 until the morning of December 17, 1994 when the PACC held a press conference presenting the alleged kidnappers and his being able to tape segments of the evening news showing footages of the press conference.  His testimony is likewise straightforward, cohesive and credible, which was not at all rebutted by the defense.<br><br><b>Second</b>. The testimony of state witness Rosales was likewise straightforward, cohesive and credible. And it was likewise corroborated on some material points by the officers of the PACC Task Force Habagat.<br><br>Rosales was among the six arrested on December 16, 1994 in Pampanga.  Jimboy Bringas pinpointed them to PACC operatives led by Police Chief Inspector Tucay.  He was not included in the two Informations since he was utilized as a state witness and placed under the witness protection program of the government. It must be noted that prosecutorial powers include the discretion of granting immunity to an accused in exchange for testimony against another.[118]  And the fact that an individual had not been previously charged or included in an Information does not prevent the prosecution from utilizing said person as a witness.[119]<br><br>In <i>People v. Bohol</i>, the Court held that the fact that an accused has been "discharged as a state witness and was no longer prosecuted for the crime charged does not render his testimony incredible or lessen its probative weight."[120]<br><br>The testimony of Rosales was not rebutted by the accused.  His narration of the events transpiring from December 7 to 13, 1994 leading up to the actual kidnapping on December 14, 1994 cohesively showed the specific roles of the other accused relative to the instant crime. Although the Court believes that he had a greater role than what he testified to as being merely coerced.  Be that as it may, it would not change the fact that in his participation of the crime, he knew and clearly pointed out the specific roles of the accused in the conspiracy and actual execution of the kidnapping and the carnapping.<br><br>The testimonies of police officers from the PACC corroborated the transfer of the Patrick to Chung at around or shortly before midnight of December 15, 1994 in the parking lot of Philippine Westin Plaza.<br><br>It bears stressing that prosecution witnesses Maricel Hipos, Eric Teng and state witness Jason Rosales never wavered in their testimonies under rigorous cross-examination by the various counsels representing the accused during trial. The same holds true with the testimonies of the PACC police officers.<br><br>In fine, when the credibility of witnesses is in issue, the trial court's assessment is accorded great weight unless it is shown that it has overlooked a certain fact or circumstance of weight which the lower court may have overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated and which, if properly considered, would alter the results of the case.[121]  In the instant case, we find no fact or circumstance of substance overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated by the courts <i>a quo</i>, except as to that of Bobby Bringas.<br><br><b>Third</b>. The prosecution witnesses PACC police officers gave clear, credible and straightforward testimonies on what transpired on their end regarding the kidnapping:  their monitoring of the negotiation, the surveillance of Chung and the arrest of the accused.  Their testimonies were not at all rebutted.  In fact, as aptly narrated by Police Chief Inspector Tucay, accused-appellants Chung and Navarro could not deny seeing each other in the evening of December 15, 1994 in the vicinity of their houses in Paco, their subsequent meeting at the Bowling Inn and at the Philippine Westin Plaza.  After his arrest in the house of Eric Teng, Chung supplied to the PACC the names and identities of Jimboy Bringas and Navarro which led to their arrest at past 1 p.m. on December 16, 1994 in Malate. And, after his arrest, Jimboy Bringas in turn pinpointed to the PACC operatives led by Police Chief Inspector Tucay the other accused who were arrested in Pampanga late in the afternoon and early evening of December 16, 1994.<br><br><b>Fourth</b>. From the defense testimonies of Jimboy Bringas, Ross, Pajarillo, Sulayao and Calaguas--upon the backdrop of the testimonies of prosecution witnesses--they collectively point to Chung and Navarro as the brains of the kidnapping.  Pajarillo, however, asserted that his co-accused Navarro is not the same person as the mastermind Navarro.  This assertion, however, fails vis-à-vis the testimony of Rosales and other accused who testified that Navarro worked closely with Chung.<br><br><center><b>Second Core Issue:  Presence of Conspiracy</b><br></center><br><b>Kidnapping for ransom proven <br>beyond reasonable doubt</b><br><br>The crime of <i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention</i>, under Art. 267<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> of the RPC, has the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the offender is a private individual; not either of the parents of the victim or a public officer who has a duty under the law to detain a person;<br><br>(2) he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty;<br><br>(3) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and<br><br>(4) in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances is present:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than three days;<br>(b) it is committed by simulating public authority;<br>(c) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made or<br>(d) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female or a public official.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></div></blockquote><br>It must be noted that when the victim is a minor and the accused is any of the parents, the crime is <i>Inducing a minor to abandon his home</i> defined and penalized under the second paragraph of Art. 271 of the RPC.  While if it is a public officer who has a duty under the law to detain a person but detains said person without any legal ground is liable for <i>Arbitrary detention</i> defined and penalized under Art. 124 of the RPC.<br><br>The essence of the crime of kidnapping is the actual deprivation of the victim's liberty, coupled with indubitable proof of intent of the accused to effect the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup>  Moreover, if the victim is a minor, or the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained for the purpose of extorting ransom, the duration of his detention becomes inconsequential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup>  Ransom means money, price or consideration paid or demanded for the redemption of a captured person that will release him from captivity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, all the elements of the crime of kidnapping for ransom has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  The accused are all private individuals.  The kidnapping of Patrick Teng, then three years old, a minor is undisputed.  That ransom was demanded and paid is established.  The only issue to be resolved is whether the accused are equally guilty of kidnapping for ransom having conspired with each other.<br><br><b>Duly-Proven Conspiracy</b><br><br>Accused-appellants uniformly assail the court <i>a quo</i>'s findings of conspiracy in the commission of the kidnapping for ransom of Patrick Teng. Our assiduous review of the records of the case shows the presence of conspiracy.  However, we fail to appreciate the direct participation of Bobby Bringas in the conspiracy.  Thus, accused-appellants Jimboy Bringas, Chung and Navarro together with the other accused Pajarillo, Sulayao, Ross and Calaguas are equally guilty and liable for the crime charged for having conspired to commit and did commit kidnapping for ransom of Patrick.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a crime and decide to commit it.  It may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence consisting of acts, words or conduct of the alleged conspirators before, during and after the commission of the felony to achieve a common design or purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>Proof of the agreement need not rest on direct evidence, as the same may be inferred from the conduct of the parties indicating a common understanding among them with respect to the commission of the offense.  Corollarily, it is not necessary to show that two or more persons met together and entered into an explicit agreement setting out the details of an unlawful scheme or the details by which an illegal objective is to be carried out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br><br>To be held guilty as a co-principal by reason of conspiracy, the accused must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity--mere presence when the transaction was made does not necessarily lead to an inference of concurrence with the criminal design to commit the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132] </sup> Moreover, the same degree of proof necessary to prove the crime is required to support a finding of criminal conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br>The testimony of state witness Rosales is the lynchpin by which the conspiracy is proven.  Jimboy Bringas brought together Rosales, Calaguas and Sulayao from Pampanga, while Rosales brought in Ross and Pajarillo from Laguna.  They thus formed the team, although Jimboy Bringas did not join the team but was in on the sharing of the ransom.  Together with Chung, Navarro and two others (Glenn Sangalang and Ricky Castillo), they proceeded to Eric's house on December 14, 1994 and kidnapped Patrick. Verily, a conspiracy is more readily proved by the acts of a fellow criminal than by any other method.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>Together with Ricky Castillo and Rosales, accused Ross, Pajarillo, Sulayao and  Calaguas  actively participated in the kidnapping. Ross drove<br><br>one of the cars.  Pajarillo, Sulayao and Calaguas entered the house with Rosales.  Calaguas poked a gun at Maricel.  Pajarillo gagged and bound Maricel.  The others herded the house helpers, the kids and Sweeney to the second floor.  They took Patrick after binding everyone except Mikee Teng.  Then they brought Patrick to Pampanga.  In all, they carried out a concerted plan of kidnapping and detaining Patrick until they were given word to bring back the child to Manila which they did the very next day shortly before midnight at the Philippine Westin Plaza.<br><br>Then they went back to Pampanga, apparently to await their share of the ransom money.  Clearly, Ross' testimony that he is employed as a driver who can earn so much as PhP5,000 in a day and can ill afford to be absent is belied by his accompanying the others to Pampanga after they delivered Patrick Teng to Chung on December 15, 1994 shortly before midnight.  And he continued to stay in Pampanga with the others until his arrest on December 16, 1994 while on a drinking spree.  In all, he was absent from work from the 14<sup>th</sup> until the 16<sup>th</sup> of December 1994.<br><br>Jimboy Bringas evidently participated in the planning and the subsequent execution of the conspiracy by bringing in Calaguas and Sulayao from Pampanga. Together with them, he met with Chung and Navarro.  And together with Rosales he went to Laguna to fetch Pajarillo and Ross.  In effect, he recruited or brought in the team that would carry out the kidnapping.  He knows the other accused and was the one who went with the PACC team led by Police Chief Inspector Tucay to Pampanga in the late afternoon of December 16, 1994 and identified them to be arrested.<br><br>Rosales' actuations, first in ringing the doorbell at the gate and urging Maricel to open it and in asking for the car key and taking the Toyota Corolla of Eric do not tend to show that he was merely coerced.  This is, however, academic considering his turning state witness.<br><br>Accused-appellant Navarro's assertion that he was only implicated fails to persuade. His direct involvement in the conspiracy is clearly shown in that:  (1) the testimony of Rosales shows Navarro's involvement with Chung; (2) the unanimous testimonies of Calaguas, Pajarillo, Sulayao and Ross to the effect that Navarro was together with Chung in their meetings before the kidnapping and Navarro was with them when they went to Eric Teng's place on December 14, 1994; (3) Navarro's admission caught on camera during the December 17, 1994 press conference that he made calls to negotiate the ransom which bolsters Eric's testimony that he recognized the voice of Navarro as the negotiator calling his residence; (4) Navarro received PhP100,000 from Chung in the evening of December 15, 1994 at the Bowling Inn; (5) Navarro was with Chung when Patrick Teng was delivered by the other accused in the parking lot of Philippine Westin Plaza.<br><br>Similarly, accused-appellant Chung's assertion that he was only implicated flies from logic given that not only Rosales pinned him as the mastermind but that the other accused testified to the effect that together with Navarro he orchestrated the kidnapping.  The foregoing clearly shows his involvement:  (1) per Pajarillo's admission during the December 17, 1994 press conference, Chung provided the guns; (2) Chung's admission to Eric through a phone call he made at noon on December 16, 1994 asking pardon and forgiveness; (3) Chung gave misleading information to Eric about his being intercepted when he was supposed to deliver the ransom money; (4) Chung proceeded to his parents' place in Paco and gave PhP50,000 from the ransom money to his mother; (5) Chung left the remaining PhP2.35 million in his parents' place without telling Eric about it; (6) Chung took Patrick from the other accused at the parking lot of Philippine Westin Plaza shortly before midnight of December 15, 1994 without paying the ransom; (7) Chung brought Patrick back home without telling Eric upon their arrival about the ransom money.<br><br>Where the acts of the accused collectively and individually demonstrate the existence of a common design towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful purpose, conspiracy is evident, and all the perpetrators will be liable as principals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br><b>Bobby Bringas' participation either<br>as accomplice or as co-conspirator not <br>established</b><br><br>As to Bobby Bringas, it is undisputed that he did not participate in the actual kidnapping.  He was in Pampanga from December 10, 1994 until he was arrested together with the others on December 16, 1994.  It may be true that the other accused brought Patrick to Bobby Bringas' place but it was not shown that Bobby Bringas took care of Patrick as the group moved to different places.  It was neither clearly shown that Bobby Bringas recruited the other accused to carry out the kidnapping.  It was only Rosales' testimony that Bobby Bringas asked him to drive.  Aside from that, the fact alone that the other accused went to his place does not point to his direct involvement in the conspiracy considering that he knows them.  He worked as driver for the mother of Rosales and Pajarillo is his <i>kumpare</i>. There is therefore no clear and convincing evidence of Bobby Bringas' direct involvement either in the kidnapping of Patrick or in the conspiracy to its commission.<br><br>In the absence of evidence showing the direct participation of the accused in the commission of the crime, conspiracy must be established by clear and convincing evidence in order to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup>  Given our observation that the involvement of Rosales was not merely of a person under coercion, there is reasonable doubt as to Bobby Bringas' involvement for it was Jimboy Bringas who brought or recruited Sulayao and Calaguas from Pampanga. There is therefore a palpable reasonable doubt of the existence of conspiracy on the part of Bobby Bringas. The presence of reasonable doubt as to the existence of conspiracy suffices to negate not only the participation of the accused in the commission of the offense as principal but also, in the absence of proof implicating the accused as accessory or accomplice, the criminal liability of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]  </sup>Consequently, Bobby Bringas must be acquitted from the crime of kidnapping for ransom.<br><br>The penalty for kidnapping for ransom under Art. 267 of the RPC, as amended, would have been the supreme penalty of death.
