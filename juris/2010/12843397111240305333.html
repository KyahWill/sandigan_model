Likewise, the defense never presented any proof that "AAA" was suffering from a disease at the time.&nbsp; Neither did the defense elicit any admission from "AAA" that she scratched her genital thus causing the reddening.&nbsp; On the contrary, records show that "AAA" was forthright in her testimony that her father inserted his finger into her vagina.<br><br>Moreover, appellant's admission that he touches "AAA's" vagina each time he gives her a bath strengthens our belief that he is capable of committing sexual abuse to his own daughter.&nbsp; Also, such admission does not negate the possibility of committing rape by sexual assault on "AAA" on April 7, 2002.<br><br>We reviewed succintly the testimony of "AAA" and we find the same credible and straightforward.&nbsp; At the time of the incident, "AAA" was only 3 years old. She was 5 years old when she testified before the court.&nbsp; However, despite her age she consistently and without hesitation pointed to her father as the person who inserted his finger into her vagina on April 7, 2002.<br><br>Her tender age notwithstanding the trial court ably found "AAA" competent to testify on her harrowing experience.&nbsp; As aptly observed by the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>Certain nagging questions need to be answered such as for instance did the children fully understand the meaning of what they were telling the court?&nbsp; Were they able to distinguish truth from falsehood?&nbsp; Were they able to appreciate the duty to tell the truth in court?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The competence of "BBB" to testify as to the fact of her having been sexually abused was amply demonstrated before this Court.&nbsp; Both "BBB" and "AAA" were asked questions by the prosecution and defense in order to probe their competency to testify in terms of their ability to perceive, remember, communicate and distinguish truth from falsehood.&nbsp; After observing the manner of testifying and hearing the answers of the child witnesses, this court was satisfied that no substantial doubt existed regarding the ability of the children to perceive, remember, communicate, distinguish truth from falsehood, or appreciate the duty to tell the truth in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Both the trial court and the CA correctly found appellant guilty of statutory rape.</i></b><br><br><b>&nbsp; </b>Under Art. 266-A(1)(d) of the RPC, statutory rape is committed "[b]y a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman" who is "under twelve (12) years of age."&nbsp; In the instant case, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that appellant had carnal knowledge of "BBB" who was only 5 years of age at the time.<br><br>Both the trial court and the appellate court correctly disregarded appellant's contention that "BBB's" testimony was rehearsed.&nbsp; The records clearly show that "BBB" testified in a straightforward and credible manner despite the rigid cross-examination by the appellant's counsel.&nbsp; She remained steadfast throughout her narration that it was appellant who sexually abused her.&nbsp; This prompted the trial court to state thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is unthinkable that a child of tender years placed under rigid cross-examination would not loosen up or break down and reveal the details of such a traumatic experience including pinpointing the actual perpetrator of the crime.&nbsp; It is believed that such traumatic experiences are deeply engraved in the memory of the victim and will certainly come to the surface once the victim is confronted and cross-examined especially when the victim is an innocent and naÃ¯ve child.&nbsp; Their natural innocence and naivete will prevent them from sustaining a lie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>There is likewise no basis to appellant's claim that "CCC" coached "BBB" to testify falsely against him.&nbsp; We agree with the trial court's observation that:<br><br><blockquote>To say that "CCC" deliberately concocted the rape charge against accused who was her husband and that she taught her children, who were only 5 and 7 years of age, to falsely testify against their very own father would attribute such a high degree of malevolence if not sophistication to said witness.&nbsp; This court finds it highly improbable.&nbsp; To go out of her way to file a complaint and go through the rigors of a public trial for the purpose of having her husband convicted for an offense he did not commit is to this court something the witness does not appear capable of.&nbsp; Moreover, wanting to spare a son from being prosecuted and punished is not a sufficient motivation for a wife and mother to want to have her husband put in prison or punished with the supreme penalty of death.&nbsp; The ordinary functioning of the human mind and human emotion does not seem to work that way.&nbsp; It could probably happen in moments of desperation as when there is no other way to save her son.&nbsp; The sequence of events as shown by the evidence does not bear this out. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The record likewise shows that the complaint was filed on April 19, 2002 or only 9 days after the children were examined and were found to have signs of having been sexually abused.&nbsp; During this span of time, it is inconceivable for "CCC" to have decided to fabricate a rape charge against the accused much less convince or coach her children to testify falsely against their father.&nbsp; Moreover, all these could have been uncovered during cross examination. As it is, despite the rigid cross examination by counsel for the accused, "BBB" and "AAA" did not falter in pointing to their father as the one who did something wrong to their vaginas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>Finally, the courts below correctly disposed of appellant's contention that "EEE" was the real culprit.&nbsp; Both "AAA" and "BBB" were consistent in pointing out that it was appellant who committed the sexual acts against them.&nbsp; Despite the suggestion from appellant's counsel, both remained steadfast that their father was the one who raped them.&nbsp; Lending credence to the fact that appellant was indeed guilty of the crimes attributed against him were his own actuations at the time material to this case.&nbsp; By appellant's own admission, he did nothing upon learning that his own daughters "AAA" and "BBB" were sexually molested allegedly by "EEE."&nbsp; Instead, he just went to sleep upon learning of the abuses committed against his own daughters.&nbsp; When his wife, "CCC," insisted on bringing "AAA" and "BBB" to the hospital to undergo medical examination, appellant got angry.&nbsp; He sold their personal effects and even destroyed their house.&nbsp; He also made himself scarce.&nbsp; Even after hearing over the radio that he was the one accused of raping his two daughters, he did not come forward to clear his name.&nbsp; Instead, he went on hiding until his capture two years later.&nbsp; "[T]he flight of an accused is an indication of his guilt or of a guilty mind."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>We thus agree with the observation of the court <i>a quo </i>that:<br><br><blockquote>The facts as testified to by the accused on the other hand do not seem to jibe with the normal habits of man.&nbsp; For instance, according to the accused, despite having heard that his child "BBB" was sexually abused by his stepson, he did nothing about it.&nbsp; It does not take much education to feel the protective instincts of a father whose child has been violated.&nbsp; He did not confront his stepson nor did he report the matter to the barangay.&nbsp; Not even when he learned over the radio that he was being accused of raping his own daughters did he come forward with what he believed was the truth.&nbsp; Instead, the accused made himself scarce until he was finally apprehended in the year 2004.&nbsp; Such actuations do not appear consistent with the actuations of an innocent man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>It might have been a bit more believable if say the accused reported the matter to the barangay captain or warned ["CCC"] that he would report the matter to the authorities.
