				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> under Rule 65 of 
the 1997 Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Ombudsman's 
Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
dated October 16, 2000, dismissing the criminal complaint (docketed as 
OMB-0-97-1138, entitled <i>Salvador v. Tabasondra, et 
al.</i>) against private respondents Ulpiano Tabasondra, Enrique 
M. Herbosa, P.O. Domingo, Zosimo C. Malabanan, Arsenio S. Lopez, Romeo 
V. Reyes, Nilo Roa, Heradeo Guballa, Florita T. Shotwell, Benigno del 
Rio, Juan F. Trivino, Salvador B. Zamora II, and John Does<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> for violation of 
Section 3(e) and (g) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019 (otherwise known as 
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). Petitioner Presidential Ad 
Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans also prays that we reverse 
the Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
dated February 27, 2001, of the Ombudsman denying petitioner's Motion 
for Reconsideration of November 24, 2000.<br><br>The 
petitioner is a government agency created under Administrative Order No.
 (<i>AO</i>) 13 on October 8, 1992 by then President Fidel 
V. Ramos.&nbsp; It was tasked to inventory all behest loans, 
determine the parties involved and recommend the appropriate actions 
that should be taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Under the law, behest loans entail both civil 
and criminal liabilities. President Ramos later issued Memorandum Order 
No. (<i>MO</i>) 61, dated November 9, 1992, expanding the 
functions of the Committee to include the inventory and review of all 
non-performing loans, whether behest or non-behest. The memorandum also 
provided the following criteria for determining a behest 
loan:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>It is 
undercollaterized (<i>sic</i>). </li><li>The 
borrower corporation is undercapitalized. </li><li>Direct or
 indirect endorsement by high government officials like presence of 
marginal notes. </li><li>Stockholders, officers or agents of
 the borrower corporation are identified as cronies. 
</li><li>Deviation of use of loan proceeds from the purpose 
intended. </li><li>Use of corporate layering. 
</li><li>Non-feasibility of the project for which financing 
is being sought. </li><li>Extra-ordinary speed in which the 
loan release was made.</li></ol><br>Pursuant to its 
mandate under AO 13 and MO 61, the petitioner investigated a loan 
guarantee agreement between Coco-Complex Philippines, Inc. 
(<i>CCPI</i>), a domestic corporation in the business of 
manufacturing oil, and the National Investment Development Corporation 
(<i>NIDC</i>), the investment subsidiary of the Philippine 
National Bank (<i>PNB</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The CCPI sought to have NIDC guarantee a loan 
payable to Fried Krupp of Germany for the turn-key purchase of an oil 
mill. On January 17, 1968, the NIDC issued Board Resolution No. 26 
approving a guarantee agreement in favor of CCPI for the amount of 
DM7.4M plus interest at the annual rate of 6 1/4 %, or a total amount of
 P9,277,080.00. On March 12, 1969, the parties signed the Guaranty 
Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> As 
of March 31, 1992, the Statement of Deficiency Claim disclosed that CCPI
 had an outstanding obligation of 
P205,889,545.76.<br><br>The petitioner, through Atty. 
Orlando Salvador, filed a Sworn Statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated June 5, 1997, before the Ombudsman 
against Ulpiano Tabasondra, Enrique M. Herbosa, Zosimo C. Malabanan, 
P.O. Domingo, and/or all officers and members of the Board of Directors 
of the Development Bank of the Philippines 
(<i>DBP</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Makati City; and Arsenio S. Lopez, Romeo V. 
Reyes, Nilo Roa, Heradeo Guballa, Benigno del Rio, Juan Triviño, and/or 
all officers and stockholders of CCPI.&nbsp; The petitioner alleged 
that the processing of the original loan was attended with haste 
considering that the CCPI was incorporated on July 12, 1967, and the 
Letter of Guarantee was approved in principle by the NIDC Board of 
Directors as early as September 20, 1967.&nbsp; It also claimed that
 the loan was without sufficient collateral at the time the loan 
guarantee was approved. CCPI's existing assets of P495,300.00 and assets
 to be acquired (turn-key cost of coconut mill) amounting to 
P6,986,031.00 had an aggregate sum of P7,481,331.00. Nevertheless, the 
NIDC considered this sufficient collateral for a loan of P9,277,080.00. 
The petitioner also pointed out that the loan was undercapitalized since
 at the time the NIDC granted the loan guarantee, the paid-up capital 
was only P2,111,000.00.<br><br>The petitioner further 
relayed in its Complaint that the NIDC granted CCPI an additional loan, 
restructuring and equity conversion of outstanding obligations, without 
sufficient collateral and adequate capital to ensure CCPI's viability 
and its ability to repay its loans. On November 25, 1970, the NIDC 
issued Board Resolution No. 361 which restructured CCPI's loan and 
increased it to DM12.2M, inclusive of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; It also alleged that the 
NIDC board issued, on December 2, 1970, Board Resolution No. 373, 
allowing the conversion of P7.07M out of a total P17.95M advances into 
CCPI common stocks.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, on June 9, 1971, the NIDC
 approved Board Resolution No. 183, permitting a further conversion of 
P14.2M of CCPI's advances into equity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The petitioner also alleged that the NIDC 
agreed to guarantee CCPI's P4.5M credit line with PNB, through Board 
Resolution No. 40, dated February 10, 1972. And on February 10, 1972, 
the NIDC issued Board Resolution No. 48, granting CCPI a guarantee loan 
of $750,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On September 5, 1997, the 
Office of the Ombudsman issued the Resolution dismissing the Complaint 
on the ground of prescription of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; However, we reversed this
 ruling in G.R. No. 130140,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>where we held that the crime had not yet 
prescribed and ordered the Ombudsman to conduct a preliminary 
investigation.<br><br>On February 16, 2000, petitioner filed
 a Manifestation and Request for Issuance of <i>Subpoena Duces 
Tecumu</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> due to previous difficulties in obtaining 
records from the PNB.&nbsp; It specifically sought from the PNB the 
names of the NIDC directors who issued particular NIDC Board 
Resolutions, the specific dates they were issued, and the amount of 
money involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; However, the Ombudsman failed to act 
on this request.<br><br>On October 16, 2000, the Ombudsman 
promulgated a resolution dismissing the complaint for the failure of the
 petitioner to furnish the names of the NIDC officials who should be 
indicted.&nbsp; Instead, the respondents named in the complaint 
appeared to be DBP officers and board members who should not be 
implicated since the loan did not even pass through the DBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On
 November 24, 2000, the petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration 
(With Motion for Leave to Admit Amended Complaint).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the Amended Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the petitioner 
identified respondents Tabasondra, Herbosa, Domingo and Malabanan as 
officers and/or Board Members of PNB/NIDC, not the DBP; the mistake made
 in the original complaint was a mere typographical error.&nbsp; The
 officers and/or stockholders of CCPI - Shotwell, Roa, Zamora, Trivino, 
Lopez, Reyes, Guballa, and del Rio - were also included as respondents. 
However, the petitioner clarified that other individuals may still be 
included as respondents. The petitioner repeated its allegation that the
 loan granted to CCPI was under-collateralized, while CCPI was 
undercapitalized; these findings were reflected in a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (dated January 17, 
1968) submitted by NIDC Vice President Mario Consing to its Board of 
Directors. It added that the Executive Summary and the documents 
attached in the original complaint were made an integral part of the 
Amended Complaint.<br><br>In the assailed Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of February 27, 2001,
 the Ombudsman denied the Motion for Reconsideration for lack of 
merit.&nbsp; He noted that there were no other documents attached to
 the Amended Complaint to prove that the respondents were liable for the
 acts complained of.&nbsp; He stated that the petitioner failed to 
provide copies of the resolution that the PNB/NIDC officials allegedly 
processed and approved. Thus, he considered the motion as a mere scrap 
of paper.<br><br>On June 7, 2001, the petitioner filed this 
Petition for Certiorari which assails the assailed Resolution and Order 
on the following 
grounds:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE
 HONORABLE OMBUDSMAN GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN ISSUING HIS SAID 
RESOLUTION AND ORDER PROMULGATED ON NOVEMBER 13, 2000 (sic) AND MARCH 
23, 2001 (<i>sic</i>) RESPECTIVELY. MORE PARTICULARLY, HE 
GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION IN HOLDING THAT "APART FROM THE FOREGOING 
ENUMERATION, NO OTHER DOCUMENT WAS ATTACHED TO THE SAME TO PROVE THE 
ALLEGATION THAT INDEED THE SAID RESPONDENTS WERE LIABILE FOR THE ACTS 
COMPLAINED 
OF."<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE
 ALLEGED INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE WAS DUE TO THE OMBUDSMAN'S GROSS 
NEGLIGENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES, SPECIFICALLY HIS FAILURE TO
 ISSUE SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM AS REQUESTED BY PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><u><b>Ruling
 of the Court</b></u></center><br><br>We 
find the petition meritorious.<br><br>Ordinarily, the Court 
does not interfere with the Ombudsman's determination of the existence 
or non-existence of probable cause.&nbsp; The rule, however, does 
not apply if there is grave abuse of discretion, or if the action is 
done in a manner contrary to the dictates of the Constitution, law or 
jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; In these exceptional cases, the 
Ombudsman's action becomes subject to judicial 
review.<br><br>The Ombudsman, in dismissing a complaint - 
whether for want of palpable merit or after the conduct of a preliminary
 investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 - carries the duty of explaining the basis for his action; he must 
determine that the complainant had failed to establish probable 
cause.<br><br>The probable cause that a complainant has to 
establish need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt or
 evidence of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. <i> It simply implies 
probability of guilt and requires more than a bare suspicion but less 
than evidence that would justify a conviction</i>.&nbsp; A 
finding of probable cause need only rest on evidence showing that more 
likely than not, a crime has been committed and was committed by the 
suspects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Given this quantum of 
evidence, we find that the Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion when 
he immediately dismissed the Amended Complaint for being insufficient. 
We find it particularly unsettling that the Ombudsman dismissively set 
aside the petitioner's voluminous exhibits with only one paragraph, and 
failed to discuss whether&nbsp; the questioned transactions bore the
 characteristics of a behest loan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and whether the respondents - those whose names
 were identified and those who were identified merely as directors and 
officers of the entities involved - were probably guilty of violating 
Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019. Lastly, the elements of the offenses 
charged should have been examined and discussed, before a conclusion 
regarding the existence or non-existence of probable cause is arrived 
at.<br><br>In the present case, the Ombudsman dismissed the 
Amended Complaint because he considered fatal the petitioner's failure 
to provide copies of the resolutions duly approved by the officers and 
directors of the PNB and the NIDC, showing that they were responsible 
for the processing and the eventual approval of the questioned 
loan.&nbsp; In its own words 
-<br><br><blockquote>Apart from the aforementioned 
enumeration no other document was attached to the same to prove the 
allegation that indeed the said respondents were liable for the acts 
complained of. There were no copies of the resolution duly approved by 
said officials of the PNB/NIDC showing that they were responsible for 
the processing and eventual approval of the questioned loan. To our 
mind, the enumerations, standing alone, is (<i>sic</i>) not 
sufficient to establish sufficient basis to proceed with the conduct of 
preliminary investigation against said respondents. In other words, this
 motion is no more than a mere scrap of paper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>In his 
Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the 
Ombudsman added that instead of burdening the Office of the Ombudsman 
with the issuance of the <i>subpoena duces tecum</i>, the 
petitioner should have asked the Presidential Commission on Good 
Government (PCGG) to subpoena the required documents, 
<i>i.e.</i>, the relevant board resolutions, as it was 
charged with the investigation of graft and corruption cases and it was 
empowered to issue subpoenas under Section 3 of Executive Order 
(<i>EO</i>) No. 1.<br><br><b><i>The 
questioned transactions bear the <br>characteristics of behest 
loans.</i></b><br><br>We find that despite the 
petitioner's failure to attach the relevant board resolutions in this 
case, the records provide ample support to the petitioner's claim that 
the officers and directors of the PNB and the NIDC had approved, in 
favor of CCPI, a loan that qualifies with at least three criteria of 
behest loans - (1) the borrower was undercapitalized; (2) the loan 
accommodation was under-collateralized; and (3) the NIDC Board of 
Directors approved the loan accommodation with extraordinary 
haste.<br><br><i><b>There is prima facie proof 
that CCPI <br>was undercapitalized when it applied for 
and<br> was granted the loan 
guarantee.</b></i><br><br>Under MO 61, one of 
the criteria for determining a behest loan is an undercapitalized 
borrower corporation. Undercapitalization is the financial condition of a
 firm that does not have capital to carry on its business. Related to 
this concept is that of thin capitalization - the financial condition of
 a firm that has a high ratio of liabilities to capital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Guaranty Agreement 
between CCPI and the NIDC, which was attached to the Amended Complaint, 
clearly shows that (1) the amount of the loan guarantee was 
P9,277,080.00 and (2) the amount of the paid-in capital at the time CCPI
 applied for the loan was P400,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The Guaranty Agreement 
sought to address the wide discrepancy between the amount of the loan 
guarantee and CCPI's paid-in capital by adding the provision, included 
among the "Borrower's Covenants," that requires CCPI to pay in cash 
P1.7M as paid-in capital before the agreement is signed, and to pay cash
 installments of P600,000.00, P400,000.00 and P500,000.00 on the 9th, 
12th, and 18th month after the signing of the agreement; these sums are 
over and above the paid-in capital of P400,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Under the terms of the agreement, 
the paid-in capital, even after the cash installments were made, would 
still be less than half of the amount of the loan accommodation applied 
for.<br><br>Nevertheless, CCPI failed to comply with the 
lenient terms of the agreement. The NIDC Credit Investigation Report, 
dated August 14, 1970, stated that CCPI refused to show its stock and 
transfer book and books of account, and its paid-up capital as of 
December 31, 1969, or nine months after the parties signed the 
agreement, was only P2,111,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; This means that the P600,000.00 
installment due on the 9th' month after March 12, 1969 had not been 
complied with.<br><br>The NIDC's unexplained response to 
violations of these terms further proves the behest character of the 
loan. Under the agreement, CCPI could have been considered as having 
defaulted, and the obligations of CCPI would have been immediately due 
and payable as early as 1970.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Instead of taking the appropriate legal action 
to protect NIDC's interests, its directors issued Board Resolution No. 
361 on November 25, 1970, which restructured CCPI's loan and increased 
it to DM12.2M, inclusive of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This further increased the already irregular 
debt to equity ratio. There was no reason for NIDC to be confident that 
CCPI would be able to pay its obligations; NIDC had to advance the 
payment of the first amortization of DM600,000.00 to the supplier of the
 equipment on June 1, 1970.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; It should also be noted that in 1970,
 the project, which should have started operations in April 1969, was 
not even operational.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; It was only on May 10, 1978 that the 
NIDC directors issued Board Resolution No. 64 which approved the 
management's recommendation to institute legal action against 
CCPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; And in 1981, when CCPI's liability to
 the NIDC had ballooned to P69,492,000.00, respondent Tabasondra, the 
Acting Senior Vice President and General Manager of NIDC, belatedly 
recommended the foreclosure of CCPI's insufficient collateral.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b><i>There is 
prima facie evidence that <br>the loan guarantee was<br> 
under-collateralized.</i></b><br><br>Before the 
parties signed the agreement, NIDC's Board of Directors had already been
 informed of the insufficiency of CCPI's collateral.&nbsp; The 
Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> 
dated January 17, 1968, of NIDC Vice President Mario Consing, addressed 
to the Board of Directors, valued the assets allegedly used as 
collateral at P9.4M, the purported acquisition value of the assets. Even
 Consing characterized the valuation of the assets as "liberal,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> for what should have 
been used in this case was the appraisal value of the assets, instead of
 the market value or the acquisition value.&nbsp; As the appraised 
value is only 80% of the acquisition value, the assets were overstated 
by at least 25%. Nevertheless, he found the overvalued collateral of 
P9.4M to be insufficient and recommended that additional collateral of 
real estate worth P5.2M be raised to fully secure NIDC's P9.3M exposure.
 The pertinent part of his Memorandum 
reads:<br><br><blockquote>Based on the more liberal 
interpretation of NIDC's valuation policy (normally, the loan value is 
based on the appraised value which is equivalent to 80% of the market 
value or acquisition cost; in this case, however, the market value was 
used as the base for computing loan value), the above properties would 
have an approximate loan value of only P5.1M, covering roughly 55% of 
the client's guarantee application. Additional collaterals with a market
 value of at least P5.3 million (in the form of real estate) should be 
offered in order to fully secure NIDC's exposure of P9.3 million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>However, the 
records do not show that CCPI complied with the additional real estate 
collateral required. The NIDC Credit Investigation Report, dated August 
14, 1970, identified the collateral as a first mortgage on two parcels 
of land with a total appraised value of P495,300.00, and a first 
mortgage on all assets to be acquired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The same report valued CCPI's fixed assets 
(including land) at P9,139,069.83.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, even if we assume that all of CCPI's 
fixed assets, as of the end of 1969, were used as collateral,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the amount of the 
loan accommodation would still be higher than the total value of the 
collateral.&nbsp; This clearly shows that the loan was 
under-collateralized.<br><br>By issuing Board Resolution No.
 361 on November 25, 1970, which restructured CCPI's loan and increased 
it to DM12.2M, the NIDC directors only increased the risk exposure of 
PNB, and necessarily of the government, when it should have never even 
approved a loan accommodation with insufficient 
collateral.<br><br><i><b>The loan accommodation 
was <br>approved with extraordinary 
speed.</b></i><br><br>The NIDC Board of 
Directors approved the loan accommodation on January 17, 1968 (through 
Board Resolution No. 26), the same date Vice President Mario Consing had
 submitted his report to the board, stating that CCPI had insufficient 
collateral and capital.&nbsp; This clearly shows that the NIDC 
officers prematurely approved the loan accommodation, contrary to 
acceptable lending practices, as it was done before they were assured 
that the company, whose loan they resolved to guarantee, could 
reasonably be expected to meet its obligations. Matters were made worse 
when CCPI failed to comply with the capital and collateral requirements 
even after the parties signed their agreement; again, the board 
prematurely approved the restructuring that increased CCPI's loan 
accommodation and provided a longer period to comply with its 
obligations.<br><br><b><i>The petitioner's 
expertise in identifying<br> behest loans should be given due 
respect.</i></b><br><br>The petitioner's 
allegation that the questioned transactions fall under "behest loans" 
should not be lightly dismissed. It is worth mentioning that in our 2008
 and 2009 decisions also entitled <i>Presidential Ad Hoc 
Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we found it proper to
 accord the petitioner's findings with healthy respect, as they were 
precisely formed to determine the existence of behest loans. On account 
of its special knowledge in the field of banking, it is in a position to
 determine whether standard banking practices were followed in the 
approval of a loan, including the adequacy of the security for a given 
loan or similar transaction.<br><br><b><i>The 
petitioner's failure to name <br>the PNB/NIDC directors involved 
should <br>not result in the outright dismissal of the<br> 
amended complaint.</i></b><br><br>The Ombudsman 
dismissed the Amended Complaint because the petitioner failed to provide
 copies of the board resolutions that would show that the respondents 
were the officers and directors of PNB/NIDC who approved the questioned 
transactions. We find this position 
untenable.<br><br>Section 6 of RA 1300, the PNB charter, 
provides that the business affairs and the property of the PNB shall be 
managed and preserved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors 
consists of the bank president, one vice-president, and five members who
 shall be elected. From this, we may reasonably infer that the grant of 
the loan accommodation in CCPI's favor was accomplished through the 
approval of the PNB/NIDC Board of Directors.<br><br>Ideally,
 the petitioner should have obtained copies of the board resolutions, 
approving the questioned transactions, to determine who voted favorably 
on these acts; this would enable petitioner to name the proper 
respondents. However, the Ombudsman did not act on its motion for the 
issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. Given this situation, the petitioner
 was able to identify some of the respondents by name and the others 
were merely denominated as John Does,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> in accordance with Section 7, Rule 110 of the 
Rules of Court:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. Name of the
 accused. - The complaint or information must state the name and surname
 of the accused or any appellation or nickname by which he has been or 
is known. If his name cannot be ascertained, he must be described under a
 fictitious name with a statement that his true name is 
unknown.<br><br>If the true name of the accused is 
thereafter disclosed by him or appears in some other manner to the 
court, such true name shall be inserted in the complaint or information 
and record. </blockquote> Thus, even if the Ombudsman found that 
the Amended Complaint against the named NIDC officers should be 
dismissed, the complaint against the unnamed NIDC officers remains 
valid. We further note that none of the named respondents denied being 
PNB/NIDC board members during the relevant period, or approximately from
 1967 to 1970. Moreover, respondents Domingo and Herbosa, who filed 
their Comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> failed to deny that they were NIDC officers 
during this period or that they had not assented to the questioned 
transactions; they merely stated that their names had not appeared in 
any of the petitioner's exhibits pertaining to those dates. Nor should 
we overlook the case against the CCPI directors who were all named in 
the Amended Complaint.<br><br>In his Comment, the Ombudsman 
justified his failure to issue a <i>subpoena duces tecum 
</i>by stating that the PCGG should have issued the subpoena, as 
it was empowered to do so under Section 3(e) of EO No. 1, dated February
 28, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We 
find this argument flimsy.<br><br>The PCGG's power to issue a
 subpoena under EO No. 1 is pursuant to its power to investigate cases 
of graft and corruption. In this case the complaint was referred to the 
Ombudsman, not the PCGG, for preliminary investigation. Under Section 
15(1) of RA 6770, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate and 
prosecute offenses involving public officers and employees. In 
<i>Cojuangco, Jr. v. Presidential Commission on Good 
Government</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> we emphasized that the Ombudsman has the 
primary jurisdiction over cases involving public officers and employees,
 even as we recognized the PCGG's concurrent jurisdiction.&nbsp; 
Nothing in EO No. 1 would have prevented the Ombudsman from exercising 
his powers under Section 15(8) of RA 6770 to "[ajdminister oaths, issue 
subpoena x x x including the power to examine and have access to bank 
accounts and records," especially since the complaint was filed before 
him.<br><br>Even assuming that his position is correct, the 
Ombudsman should have immediately denied the petitioner's motion to 
issue a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i>.&nbsp; He should 
have informed the petitioner that he was not issuing the subpoena as it 
was the PCGG which should issue the subpoena, and thus giving the 
petitioner an opportunity to act on the matter. Instead, the Ombudsman 
did not act on the motion, only to issue a resolution dismissing the 
Amended Complaint for its failure to produce the documents that were the
 subject of the subpoena.&nbsp; By acting in this manner, he went 
against his mandate, decreed under Section 13 of RA 6770, to "act 
promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against officers or 
employees of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency or 
instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled 
corporations, and enforce their administrative, civil and criminal 
liability in every case where the evidence warrants in order to promote 
efficient service by the Government to the 
people."<br><br><b><i>The elements of violations
 under <br>Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) o<br>f RA 3019 
were sufficiently alleged <br>in the amended 
complaint.</i></b><br><br>In the Amended 
Complaint, the petitioner sought to charge the respondents with 
violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019, which 
reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.<i> Corrupt 
practices of public officers</i>. - In addition to acts or 
omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the 
following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and 
are hereby declared to be 
unlawful:<br><br><blockquote><center>x x x 
x<br><br></center> (e) Causing any undue injury to any
 party, including the Government, or giving any private party any 
unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his 
official administrative or judicial functions through manifest 
partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This 
provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government
 corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other 
concessions.<br><br><center>x x x 
x<br></center><br>(g) Entering, on behalf of the 
Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly 
disadvantageous to the same, whether or not the public officer profited 
or will profit 
thereby.</blockquote></blockquote><br>The elements of 
the offense in Section 3(e) are: (1) that the accused are public 
officers or private persons charged in conspiracy with the public 
officers; (2) that said public officers committed the prohibited acts 
during the performance&nbsp; of their official&nbsp; duties or 
in relation to their public positions; (3) that they caused undue injury
 to any party, whether the Government or a private party; (4) that such 
injury was caused by giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or 
preference to such parties; and (5) that the public officers have acted 
with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable 
negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the 
elements of the offense in Section 3(g) are: (1) that the accused is a 
public officer; (2) that he entered into a contract or transaction on 
behalf of the Government; and (3) that such contract or transaction is 
grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>It
 was properly alleged in the Amended Complaint that the respondent 
officers and directors of PNB/NIDC, a government-owned and controlled 
corporation, in conspiracy with the respondent directors and officers of
 CCPI, granted CCPI a loan accommodation that bore the characteristics 
of behest loans. The government suffered injury when the loan, which 
ballooned to over P205M, remained unpaid. The terms of the loan 
accommodation were manifestly disadvantageous to the government that the
 NIDC directors' assent to this transaction could only be attended by 
gross inexcusable negligence, if not evident bad faith or manifest 
partiality. Moreover, these allegations were properly supported by the 
records.<br><br>Thus, the Ombudsman should not have 
immediately denied the motion for reconsideration, but should have 
proceeded with the preliminary investigation, by requiring the 
respondents to file their comments, and resolved the case based on the 
evidence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition 
is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Ombudsman's Resolution dated October 
16, 2000 and Order dated February 27, 2001 in OMB-0-97-1138 are hereby 
<b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The 
Ombudsman is ordered (1) to conduct <i><b>with utmost

Amended Complaint; (2) to immediately issue the required subpoena for 
the production of Board Resolution Nos. 26 and 361, dated January 17, 
1968 and November 25, 1970, and other relevant documents; and (3) to 
promptly evaluate the arguments of all the parties after having heard 
them. No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED
