				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i>  under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeking to nullify  Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9355, otherwise known as <i>An Act Creating the Province of Dinagat Islands</i>, for being unconstitutional.<br><br>Petitioners Rodolfo G. Navarro, Victor F. Bernal, and Rene O. Medina aver that they are taxpayers and residents of the Province of Surigao del Norte. They have served the Province of Surigao del Norte once as Vice- Governor and members of the Provincial Board, respectively. They claim to have previously filed a similar petition, which was dismissed on technical grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  They allege that the creation of the Dinagat Islands as a new province, if uncorrected, perpetuates an illegal act of Congress, and unjustly deprives the people of Surigao del Norte of a large chunk of its territory, Internal Revenue Allocation and rich resources from the area.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>The mother province of Surigao del Norte was created and established under R.A.  No. 2786 on June 19, 1960. The province is composed of three main groups of islands: (1) the Mainland and Surigao City; (2)  Siargao Island and Bucas Grande; and (3) Dinagat Island, which is composed of seven municipalities, namely, Basilisa, Cagdianao, Dinagat, Libjo, Loreto, San Jose, and Tubajon.<br><br>Based on the official 2000 Census of Population and Housing conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the population of the Province of Surigao del Norte as of May 1, 2000 was 481,416, broken down as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table width="80%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="50%"><div align="justify">Mainland </div></td> <td valign="top" width="16%"><div align="right">281,111</div></td> <td width="34%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Surigao City </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right">118,534</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Siargao Island &amp; Bucas Grande </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right">93,354</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>Dinagat Island </b></div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right"><b>106,951</b></div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>Under Section 461 of R.A. No. 7610, otherwise known as <i>The Local Government Code</i>, a province may be created if it has an average annual income of not less than P20 million based on 1991 constant prices as certified by the Department of Finance, and a population of not less than 250,000 inhabitants as certified by the NSO, or a contiguous territory of at least 2,000 square kilometers as certified by the Lands Management Bureau. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities, which do not contribute to the income of the province.<br><br>On  April 3, 2002, the Office of the President, through its Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs, advised the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of the Province of  Surigao del Norte of the deficient population  in the proposed Province of Dinagat Islands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In July 2003, the Provincial Government of Surigao del Norte conducted a special census, with the assistance of an NSO District Census Coordinator, in the Dinagat Islands to determine its actual population in support of the house bill creating the Province of Dinagat Islands. The special census yielded a population count of 371,576 inhabitants in the proposed province. The NSO, however, did not certify the result of the special census. On July 30, 2003, Surigao del Norte Provincial  Governor Robert Lyndon S. Barbers issued Proclamation No. 01, which declared as official, for all purposes,  the 2003 Special Census in  Dinagat Islands showing a population of 371,576.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The Bureau of Local Government Finance certified that the average annual income of the proposed Province of Dinagat Islands for calendar year 2002 to 2003 based on the 1991 constant prices was P82,696,433.23.  The land area of the proposed province is 802.12 square kilometers.<br><br>On August 14, 2006 and August 28, 2006, the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, passed the  bill creating the Province of Dinagat Islands.  It was approved and enacted into law as R.A. No. 9355 on October 2, 2006 by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.<br><br>On December 2, 2006,  a plebiscite was held in the mother Province of Surigao del Norte to determine whether the local government units directly affected approved of  the creation of the Province of Dinagat Islands into a distinct and independent province comprising the municipalities of Basilisa, Cagdianao, Dinagat, Libjo (Albor), Loreto, San Jose, and Tubajon. The result of the plebiscite yielded 69,943 affirmative votes and 63,502 negative votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On December 3, 2006, the Plebiscite Provincial Board of Canvassers proclaimed that the creation of Dinagat Islands into a separate and distinct province was ratified and approved by the majority of the votes cast in the plebiscite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On January 26, 2007, a new set of provincial officials took their oath of office following their appointment by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Another set of provincial officials was elected during the synchronized national and local elections held on May 14, 2007.  On July 1, 2007, the elected provincial officials took their oath of office; hence, the Province of Dinagat Islands began its corporate existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioners contended that the creation of the Province of Dinagat Islands under R.A. No. 9355 is not valid because it failed to comply with either the  population or land area requirement prescribed by the Local Government Code.<br><br>Petitioners prayed that R.A. No. 9355 be declared unconstitutional, and that all subsequent appointments and elections to the new vacant positions in the newly created Province of Dinagat Islands be declared null and void.  They also prayed for the return of the municipalities of the Province of Dinagat Islands and the return of the former districts to the mother Province of Surigao del Norte.<br><br>Petitioners raised the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9355, CREATING THE NEW PROVINCE OF DINAGAT ISLANDS, COMPLIED WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 461 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7160, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE CREATION OF DINAGAT AS A NEW PROVINCE BY THE RESPONDENTS IS AN ACT OF GERRYMANDERING. <br><br><center>III<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE RESULT OF THE PLEBISCITE IS CREDIBLE AND TRULY REFLECTS THE MANDATE OF THE PEOPLE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </blockquote><br>In her Memorandum, respondent Governor Geraldine B. Ecleo-Villaroman of the Province of Dinagat Islands raises procedural issues.  She contends that petitioners do not have the legal standing to question the constitutionality of the creation of the Province of Dinagat, since they have not been directly  injured by its creation and are without  substantial interest over the matter in controversy. Moreover, she alleges that the petition is moot and academic because the existence of the Province of Dinagat Islands has already commenced; hence, the petition should be dismissed.<br><br>The contention is without merit.<br><br>In <i>Coconut Oil Refiners Association, Inc. v. Torres</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court held that in cases of paramount importance where serious constitutional questions are involved, the standing requirements may be relaxed and a suit may be allowed to prosper even where there is no direct injury to the party claiming the right of judicial review. In the same vein, with respect to other alleged procedural flaws, even assuming the existence of such defects, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, brushes aside these technicalities and takes cognizance of the petition considering its importance and in keeping with the duty to determine whether the other branches of the government have kept themselves within the limits of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Further, supervening events, whether intended or accidental, cannot prevent the Court from rendering a decision if there is a grave violation of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  The courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is capable of repetition, yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The main issue is whether or not R.A. No. 9355 violates Section 10, Article X of the Constitution.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the proposed Province of Dinagat Islands is not qualified to become a province because it failed to comply with the land area or the population requirement, despite its compliance with the income requirement.  It has a total land area of only 802.12 square kilometers, which falls short of the statutory requirement of at least 2,000 square kilometers.  Moreover, based on the NSO 2000 Census of Population, the total population of the proposed Province of Dinagat Islands is only 106,951, while the statutory requirement is a population of at least 250,000 inhabitants.<br><br>Petitioners allege that  in enacting R.A. No. 9355 into law, the House of Representatives and the Senate  erroneously relied on paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991, which states that "<i>[t]he land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The preceding italicized provision contained in the Implementing Rules and Regulations is not expressly or impliedly stated as an exemption to the land area requirement in Section 461 of the Local Government Code.  Petitioners assert that when the Implementing Rules and Regulations conflict with the law that they seek to implement, the law prevails.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents contend in their respective Memoranda that the Province of Dinagat Islands met the legal standard for its creation.<br><br>First, the Bureau of Local Government Finance certified that the average annual income of the proposed Province of Dinagat Islands for the years 2002 to 2003 based on the 1991 constant prices was P82,696,433.25.<br><br>Second, the Lands Management Bureau certified that though the land area of the Province of Dinagat Islands is 802.12 square kilometers, it is composed of one or more islands; thus, it is exempt from the required land area of 2,000 square kilometers under paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code.<br><br>Third, in the special census conducted by the Provincial Government of Surigao del Norte, with the assistance of a District Census Coordinator of the NSO, the number of inhabitants in the Province of  Dinagat Islands as of 2003, or almost three years before the enactment of R.A. No. 9355 in 2006, was 371,576, which is more than the minimum requirement of 250,000 inhabitants.<br><br>In his Memorandum, respondent Governor Ace S. Barbers contends that although the result of the special census conducted by the Provincial Government of Surigao del Norte on December 2, 2003 was never certified by the NSO, it is credible since it was conducted with the aid of a representative of the NSO. He alleged that the lack of certification by the NSO was cured by the presence of NSO officials, who testified during the deliberations on House Bill No. 884 creating the Province of Dinagat Islands, and who questioned neither the conduct of the special census nor the validity of the result.<br><br><center><b><i>The Ruling of the Court</i></b><br></center><br>The petition is granted.<br><br>The constitutional provision on the creation of a province in Section 10, Article X of the Constitution states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 10.  No province, city, municipality, or barangay may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundary substantially altered, except <b>in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code</b> and subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Pursuant to the Constitution, the Local Government Code of 1991 prescribed the criteria for the creation of a province, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 461. <i>Requisites for Creation</i>. -- (a) A province may be created if it has an average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of not less than Twenty million pesos (P20,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices <b>and <u>either</u> </b><b>of the following requisites</b>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(i) a <b>contiguous territory</b> of at  least<b> two thousand (2,000) square kilometers</b>, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau; or<br><br>(ii)  a population of not less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office:<br></div><br><i>Provided</i>, That, the creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population, and income of the original unit or units at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein.<br><br>(b) <b>The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two </b><b>(2) or more islands</b> or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province.<br><br>(c) The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of special funds, trust funds, transfers, and non-recurring income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>As a clarification of the territorial requirement, the Local Government Code requires <b>a <u>contiguous</u> territory of at least 2,000 square kilometers</b>, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau. However, <b>the territory <u>need not be contiguous</u> if it comprises two (2) or more islands</b><b> </b><b>or is separated by </b><b>a chartered city or cities that do not contribute to the income of the province</b>.<br><br>If a proposed province is composed of two or more islands, does "territory,"  under Sec. 461 of the Local Government Code,  include not only the land mass above the water, but also that which is beneath it?<br><br>To answer the question above, the discussion in <i>Tan v. Commission on Elections</i> <i>(COMELEC)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  is enlightening.<br><br>In <i>Tan v. COMELEC</i>, petitioners therein contended that Batas Pambansa  Blg.  885, creating the new Province of Negros del Norte, was unconstitutional for it was not in accord with Art. XI, Sec. 3 of the Constitution, and Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, the former Local Government Code.  Although what was applicable then was the 1973 Constitution and the former Local Government Code, the  provisions pertinent to the case  are substantially similar to the provisions in this case.<br><br>Art. XI, Sec. 3 of the 1973 Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 3.  No province, city, municipality or barrio (barangay in the 1987 Constitution) may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundary substantially altered except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code, and subject to the approval by a majority of the votes in a plebiscite in the unit or units affected.</blockquote><br>The requisites for the creation of a province in Sec. 197 of  Batas Pambansa Blg. 337  are similar to the requisites in Sec. 461 of the Local Government Code of 1991, but the requirements for population and territory/land area are lower now, while the income requirement is higher. Sec. 197 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, the former Local Government Code, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 197.--<i>Requisites for Creation</i>.--A province may be created if it has <b>a territory</b> of at least three thousand five hundred square kilometers, <b>a population</b> of at least five hundred thousand persons, an average estimated <b>annual income</b>, as certified by the Ministry of Finance, of not less than ten million pesos for the last three consecutive years, and its creation shall not reduce the population and income of the mother province or provinces at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements under this section.  <b>The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two or more islands</b>.<br><br>The average estimated annual income shall include the income allotted for both the general and infrastructure funds, exclusive of trust funds, transfers and nonrecurring income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Tan v. COMELEC</i>, petitioners therein filed a  case for Prohibition for the purpose of stopping the COMELEC from conducting the plebiscite scheduled on January 3, 1986. Since the Court was in recess, it was unable to consider the petition on time. Petitioners filed a supplemental pleading, averring that the plebiscite sought to be restrained by them was held as scheduled, but there were still serious issues raised in the case affecting the legality, constitutionality and validity of such exercise which should properly be passed upon and resolved by the Court.<br><br>At issue in <i>Tan</i> was the land area of the new Province of Negros del Norte, and the validity of  the plebiscite, which did not include voters of the parent Province of Negros Occidental, but only those living within the territory of the new Province of Negros del Norte.<br><br>The Court held that the plebiscite should have included the people living in the area of the proposed new province and those living in the parent province. However, the Court did not direct the conduct of a new plebiscite, because the factual and legal basis for the creation of the new province did not exist as it failed to satisfy the land area requirement; hence, Batas Pambansa Blg. 885, creating the new Province of Negros del Norte, was declared unconstitutional. The Court found that the land area of the new province was only about 2,856 square kilometers, which was below the statutory requirement then of 3,500 square kilometers.<br><br>Respondents in <i>Tan</i> insisted that when the Local Government Code speaks of the required territory of the province to be created, what is contemplated is not only the land area, but also the land and water over which the said province has jurisdiction and control.  The respondents submitted that in this regard, the marginal sea within the three mile limit should be considered in determining the extent of the territory of the new province.<br><br>The Court stated that "[s]uch an interpretation is strained, incorrect and fallacious."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  It held:<br><br><blockquote>The last sentence of the first paragraph of Section 197 is most revealing. As so stated therein the "<i>territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two or more islands</i>." <b>The use of the word <i><u>territory</u></i> in this particular provision of the Local Government Code and in the very last sentence thereof, clearly, reflects that "<i>territory</i>" as therein used, has reference only to the mass of land area and <u>excludes the waters over which the political unit exercises control</u></b>.<br><br>Said sentence states that the "territory need not be contiguous." Contiguous means (a) in physical contact; (b) touching along all or most of one side; (c) near, [n]ext, or adjacent (Webster's New World Dictionary, 1972 Ed., p. 307). <b>"Contiguous," when employed as an adjective, as in the above sentence, is only used when it describes physical contact, or a touching of sides of two solid masses of matter</b>. The meaning of particular terms in a statute may be ascertained by reference to words associated with or related to them in the statute (Animal Rescue League vs. Assessors, 138 A.L.R., p. 110). Therefore, in the context of the sentence above, what need not be "contiguous" is the "territory" -- the physical mass of land area. <b>There</b> <b>would arise no need for the legislators to use the word contiguous if they had intended that the term "territory" embrace not only land area but also territorial waters</b>. <b>It can be safely concluded that the word territory in the first paragraph of Section 197 is meant to be synonymous with "land area" only.</b> The words and phrases used in a statute should be given the meaning intended by the legislature (82 C.J.S., p. 636). The sense in which the words are used furnished the rule of construction (In re Winton Lumber Co., 63 p. 2d., p. 664).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>The discussion of the Court in <i>Tan</i> on the definition and usage  of  the terms "territory," and "contiguous," and the meaning of the provision, "The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two or more islands," contained in Sec. 197 of  the  former Local Government Code, which  provides for the requisites in  the creation of a new province, is applicable  in this case since there is no reason for a change in their respective definitions, usage, or meaning in its counterpart provision in the present Local Government Code contained in Sec. 461 thereof.<br><br>The territorial requirement in the Local Government Code is adopted in the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991 (IRR),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> thus:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 9.  <i>Provinces</i>.--(a) Requisites for creation--A province shall not be created unless the following requisites on income and either population or land area are present:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Income -- An average annual income of not less than Twenty Million Pesos (P20,000,000.00) for the immediately preceding two (2) consecutive years based on 1991 constant prices, as certified by DOF.  The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of special funds, special accounts, transfers, and nonrecurring income; and<br><br>(2) Population or land area - Population which shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants, as certified by National Statistics Office; or <b>land area which must be contiguous with an area of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by LMB. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province</b>. <b><i>The land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands</i></b>. The territorial jurisdiction of a province sought to be created shall be properly identified by metes and bounds.</blockquote>  </blockquote><br>However, the  IRR went beyond the criteria prescribed by Section 461 of the Local Government Code when it added the italicized portion above stating that  "[t]he land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands." Nowhere in the Local Government Code is the said provision stated or implied.  Under Section 461 of the Local Government Code, the only instance when the territorial or land area requirement need not be complied with is when there is already compliance with the population requirement. The Constitution requires that the criteria for the creation of a province, <b>including any exemption from such criteria</b>, must all be written in the Local Government Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  There is no dispute that in case of discrepancy between the basic law and the rules and regulations implementing the said law, the basic law prevails, because the rules and regulations cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the basic law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Hence, the Court holds that the provision in Sec. 2, Art. 9 of the IRR stating that "[t]he land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands" is null and void.<br><br>Respondents, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, argue that rules and regulations have the force and effect of law as long as they are germane to the objects and purposes of the law.  They contend that the exemption from the land area requirement of 2,000 square kilometers is germane to the purpose of the Local Government Code to develop political and territorial subdivisions into self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> They assert  that in <i>Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Defensor</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  the Court declared as valid the implementing rules and regulations of a statute, even though the administrative agency added certain provisions in the implementing rules that were not found in the law.<br><br>In <i>Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Defensor</i>, the provisions in the implementing rules and regulations, which were questioned by petitioner therein,<i> </i>merely filled in the details in accordance with a known standard. The law that was questioned was R.A. No. 9207, otherwise known as "National Government Center (NGC) Housing and Land Utilization Act of 2003."  It was therein declared that the "policy of the State [was] to secure the land tenure of the urban poor. Toward this end, lands located in the NGC, Quezon City shall be utilized for housing, socioeconomic, civic, educational, religious and other purposes." Section 5 of R.A. No. 9207 created the National Government Center Administration Committee, which was tasked to administer, formulate the guidelines and policies and implement the land disposition of the areas covered by the law.<br><br>Petitioners therein contended that while Sec. 3.2 (a.1)  of  the IRR fixed the selling rate of a lot at P700.00 per sq. m., R.A. No. 9207 did not provide for the price. In addition, Sec. 3.2 (c.1) of the IRR penalizes a beneficiary who fails to execute a contract to sell within six (6) months from the approval of the subdivision plan by imposing a price escalation, while there is no such penalty imposed by R.A. No. 9207. Thus, they conclude that the assailed provisions conflict with R.A. No. 9207 and should be nullified.<br><br>In <i>Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc.</i>, the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>Where a rule or regulation has a provision not expressly stated or contained in the statute being implemented, that provision does not necessarily contradict the statute. A legislative rule is in the nature of subordinate legislation, designed to implement a primary legislation by providing the details thereof. <b><u>All that is required</u> is that the regulation should be germane to the objects and purposes of the law; <u>that the regulation be not in contradiction to but in conformity with the standards prescribed by the law</u></b>.<br><br>In Section 5 of R.A. No. 9207, the Committee is granted the power to administer, <i>formulate guidelines and policies</i>, and implement the disposition of the areas covered by the law. Implicit in this authority and the statute's objective of urban poor housing is the power of the Committee to formulate the manner by which the reserved property may be allocated to the beneficiaries. Under this broad power, the <u>Committee is mandated to <i>fill in the details</i> such as the qualifications of beneficiaries, the selling price of the lots, the terms and conditions governing the sale and other key particulars necessary to implement the objective of the law. These details are purposely omitted from the statute and their determination is left to the discretion of the Committee</u> because the latter possesses special knowledge and technical expertise over these matters.<br><br>The Committee's authority to fix the selling price of the lots may be likened to the rate-fixing power of administrative agencies. <u>In case of a delegation of rate-fixing power, the only standard which the legislature is required to prescribe for the guidance of the administrative authority is that the rate be reasonable and just</u>. However, it has been held that even in the absence of an express requirement as to reasonableness, this standard may be implied. In this regard, petitioners do not even claim that the selling price of the lots is unreasonable.<br><br>The provision on the price escalation clause as a penalty imposed to a beneficiary who fails to execute a contract to sell within the prescribed period is also within the Committee's authority to formulate guidelines and policies to implement R.A. No. 9207. The Committee has the power to lay down the terms and conditions governing the disposition of said lots, provided that these are reasonable and just.  There is nothing objectionable about prescribing a period within which the parties must execute the contract to sell.

Galarosa was the incumbent president of the <i>Katipunang Bayan</i> or Association of <i>Barangay</i> Councils (ABC) of the Municipality of Sorsogon, Province of Sorsogon; and was appointed as a member of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> (SB) of Sorsogon pursuant to Executive Order No. 342 in relation to Sec. 146 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, the former Local Government Code.<br><br>Sec. 494 of the Local Government Code of 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> states that the duly elected presidents of the <i>liga</i> [<i>ng mga barangay</i>] at the municipal, city and provincial levels, including the component cities and municipalities of Metropolitan Manila, shall serve as <i>ex officio</i> members of the <i>sangguniang bayan, sangguniang panglungsod, and sangguniang panlalawigan</i>, respectively. They shall serve as such only during their term of office as presidents of the <i>liga </i>chapters which, in no case, shall be beyond the term of office of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned.  The section, however, does not fix the specific duration of their term as <i>liga</i> president. The Court held that this was left to the by-laws of the <i>liga </i>pursuant to Art. 211(g) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991.  Moreover, there was no indication that Secs. 491<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and 494 should be given retroactive effect to adversely affect the presidents of the ABC; hence, the said provisions were to be applied prospectively.<br><br>The Court stated that there is no law that prohibits ABC presidents from holding over as members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i>. On the contrary, the IRR, prepared and issued by the Oversight Committee upon specific mandate of Sec. 533 of the Local Government Code, expressly recognizes and grants the hold-over authority to the ABC presidents under Art. 210, Rule XXIX.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  The Court upheld the application of the hold-over doctrine in the provisions of the IRR and the issuances of the DILG, whose purpose was to prevent a hiatus in the government pending the time when the successor may be chosen and inducted into office.<br><br>The Court held that Sec. 494 of the Local Government Code could not have been intended to allow a gap in the representation of the <i>barangays</i>, through the presidents of the ABC, in the <i>sanggunian</i>. Since the term of office of the <i>punong barangays</i> elected in the March 28, 1989 election and the term of office of the presidents of the ABC had  not yet expired, and taking into account the special role conferred upon, and the broader powers and functions vested in the <i>barangays</i> by the Code,  it  was  inferred that the Code never intended to deprive the <i>barangays</i> of their representation in the <i>sangguniang bayan</i> during the interregnum when the <i>liga</i> had yet to be formally organized with the election of its officers.<br><br>Under the circumstances prevailing in <i>Galarosa</i>, the Court considered the relevant provisions in the IRR formulated by the Oversight Committee and the pertinent issuances of the DILG in the nature of executive construction, which were entitled to great weight and respect.<br><br>Courts determine the intent of the law from the literal language of the law within the law's four corners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> If the language of the law is plain, clear and unambiguous, courts simply apply the law according to its express terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  If a literal application of the law results in absurdity, impossibility or injustice, then courts may resort to extrinsic aids of statutory construction like the legislative history of the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  or may consider the implementing rules and regulations and pertinent executive issuances in the nature of executive construction.<br><br>In this case, the requirements for the creation of a province contained in Sec. 461 of the Local Government Code are clear, plain and unambiguous, and its literal application does not result in absurdity or injustice. Hence, the provision in Art. 9(2) of the IRR exempting a proposed province composed of one or more islands from the land-area requirement cannot be considered an executive construction of the criteria prescribed by the Local Government Code.

Now, in terms of the land area, Dinagat Island[s] is exempted because xxx the area is composed of more than one island.

I register my dissent to the <i>ponencia</i> for I find this judicial interference unnecessary and, in fact, unwarranted in law. Petitioners have not presented a genuine constitutional issue requiring this Court's intervention. In petitioners' earlier and similarly-worded petition--G. R. No. 175158¾the Court found no compelling reason to brush aside technicalities of procedure and resolve the merits of the case. Just like G.R. No. 175158, the present petition deserves the same dismissive treatment from the Court.<br><br>I begin with a brief restatement of the pertinent antecedent events.<br><br>On October 2, 2006, the President of the Republic approved Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9355,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the law creating the province of Dinagat Islands. On December 3 of the same year, the Commission on Elections conducted the plebiscite for the ratification of the said creation. This yielded 69,943 affirmative votes and 63,502 negative votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Having gotten the nod of the people, the President appointed the interim set of provincial officials who consequently took their oath of office on January 26, 2007. Thereafter, in the May 14, 2007 National and Local Elections, the Dinagatnons elected their new set of provincial officials who assumed office on July 1, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Not amenable to the advancement of their locality, petitioners, former politicians in the mother province of Surigao del Norte, filed before this Court, on November 10, 2006, G.R. No. 175158, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition assailing the constitutionality of the creation of the province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> As aforementioned, the Court dismissed the petition on technical grounds--defect in the verification and certification of non-forum shopping and failure by the petitioners' counsel to indicate an updated Integrated Bar of the Philippines official receipt. On motion for reconsideration, the Court rejected petitioners' entreaty for liberality in the application of procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Unperturbed, petitioners filed their new petition, the instant case, contending in the main that R.A. No. 9355 is unconstitutional. They posit that the creation of Dinagat Islands did not meet either the land area or the population requirement for the creation of a province. At the time of the passage of the law, the land area of the locality was only 802.12 square kilometers, and its population, only 106,951.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It is petitioners' submission that the enactment of R.A. No. 9355 violates Section 461 of R.A. No. 7160 or the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Section 10, Article X of the Constitution.<br><br>I find no merit in petitioners' contention.<br><br>Article X, Section 10 of the Constitution provides that--<br><br><blockquote>Section. 10. No province, city, municipality, or barangay may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundary substantially altered, except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code and subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected.</blockquote><br>For the creation of a province, the LGC provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 461. <i>Requisites for Creation.</i>--(a) A province may be created if it has an average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of not less than Twenty million pesos (P20,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices and either of the following requisites:<br><br>(i) a contiguous territory of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau; or<br><br>(ii) a population of not less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office:<br><br><i>Provided</i>, That, the creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population and income of the original unit or units at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein.<br><br>(b) The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province.<br><br>(c) The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of special funds, trust funds, transfers, and non-recurring income.</blockquote><br>Here, the Department of Finance certified that the province of Dinagat Islands has an average annual income of P82,696,433.22 based on 1991 constant prices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As it already meets the primordial income criterion for a province, Dinagat Islands needed only to comply with either the land area or the population criterion.<br><br>At this point, I concur with the <i>ponencia </i>that Dinagat Islands does not satisfy the 250,000 population requirement. When the law for its creation was passed in 2006, the province only had a population of 106,951 inhabitants (based on the 2000 Census of Population and Housing) as certified by the National Statistics Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Further, the 2007 Census of Population reveals that it has only 120,813 inhabitants as of August 1, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>I cannot, however, subscribe to the <i>ponencia</i>'s holding that Dinagat Islands fails to comply with the territorial requirement because it only has an aggregate land area of 802.12 sq km. Let it be emphasized that the province is comprised of the municipalities of Basilisa, Cagdianao, Dinagat, Libjo (Albor), Loreto, San Jose and Tubajon, and includes Hibuson Island and approximately 47 islets under the jurisdiction of the said municipalities. This fact relieves it from complying with the criterion that its territory must be contiguous and at least 2,000 sq km in area. Article 9(a)(2) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing (IRR) the LGC of 1991 pertinently provides that the territory need not be contiguous and the land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of islands, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 9. <i>Provinces</i>.--(a) Requisites for creation--A province shall not be created unless the following requisites on income and either population or land area are present:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) Population or land area--Population which shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants, as certified by NSO; or land area which must be contiguous with an area of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by LMB. <b>The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province. <u>The land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands</u>.</b> The territorial jurisdiction of a province sought to be created shall be properly identified by metes and bounds.<br><br>The creation of a new province shall not reduce the land area, population, and income of the original LGU or LGUs at the time of said creation to less than the prescribed minimum requirements. All expenses incidental to the creation shall be borne by the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>The <i>ponencia</i>, however, declares that the portion in the IRR, which reads, "[t]he land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands," is null and void for going beyond the standard or criterion prescribed by Section 461 of the LGC, and, thus, cannot be used as basis for Dinagat Islands' compliance with the territorial requirement. The <i>ponencia</i> suggests that for the creation of a province, even one composed of islands like the one in this petition, the 2,000-sq km territorial area requirement should still be met despite the reality that its territory is not contiguous, precisely because portions of its territory are separated by bodies of water.<br><br>I do not agree with the <i>ponencia</i>'s proposition. The province of Dinagat Islands, composed as it is of a group of islands, is exempt from compliance not only with the territorial contiguity requirement but also with the 2,000-sq km land area criterion. This proceeds from no less than Section 461 of the LGC, which, for ready reference, I again quote--<br><br><blockquote>Section 461. <i>Requisites for Creation.</i>--(a) A province may be created if it has an average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of not less than Twenty million pesos (P20,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices and either of the following requisites:<br><br>(i) a contiguous territory of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau; or<br><br>(ii) a population of not less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office:<br><br><i>Provided</i>, That, the creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population and income of the original unit or units at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein.<br><br>(b) <u>The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province.</u><br><br>(c) The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of special funds, trust funds, transfers, and non-recurring income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>Significant in the provision is paragraph (b), underscored above, as it provides for an exemption from the territorial criterion mentioned in paragraph (a).<br><br>The stipulation in paragraph (b), however, qualifies not merely the word "contiguous" in paragraph (a)(i) in the same provision, but rather <b>the entirety of the latter paragraph</b>. Paragraph (a)(i) of the provision, for ready reference, reads:<br><br><blockquote>(i) a <b>contiguous territory of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers</b>, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>This whole paragraph on contiguity and land area, I repeat for emphasis, is the one being referred to in the exemption from the territorial requirement in paragraph (b). Thus, if the province to be created is composed of islands, like the one in this case, then, its territory need not be contiguous and need not have an area of at least 2,000 sq km. This is because, as the law is worded, <b>contiguity and land area are not two distinct and separate requirements</b>. They qualify each other. For instance, a territory which is contiguous but which is less than 2,000 sq km in land area will not qualify for provincehood and, conversely, a territory which is 2,000 sq km in area but which is not contiguous cannot become a province, following the general rule in paragraph (a)(1).  In other words, contiguity and land area are <b>two components of a single requirement</b>--<i>one cannot exist and serve no purpose without the other, <b>so much so that a release from compliance with one component results, naturally and logically, in the corresponding exemption from the other</b></i>.<br><br>Indeed, an exemption from one of the two component requirements in paragraph (a)(i) necessitates an exemption from the other component requirement because the nonattendance of one results in the absence of a reason for the other component requirement to effect a qualification. In other words, a component requirement cannot apply without the other because they qualify each other--<b>one cannot be dissociated from the other</b>.<br><br>By rough analogy, the two components are like dicephalic conjoined twins--two heads are attached to a single body. If one head is separated from the other, then the twins die.  In the same manner, the law, by providing in paragraph (b) of Section 461 that <i>the territory need not be contiguous if the same is comprised of islands</i>, <b>must be interpreted as intended to exempt such territory from the land area component requirement of 2,000 sq km.</b> Because the two component requirements are inseparable, the elimination of contiguity from the territorial criterion has the effect of a coexistent eradication of the land area component. The territory of the province of Dinagat Islands, therefore, comprising the major islands of Dinagat and Hibuson, and approximately 47 islets, need not be contiguous and need not have an area of at least 2,000 sq km following Section 461 of the LGC.<br><br>It will result in superfluity, if not absurdity, if paragraph (b) of the provision is interpreted as referring only to the component requirement of contiguity and not to both component requirements of contiguity and land area. This is because contiguity does not always mean in contact by land. Thus, in so far as islands are concerned, they are deemed contiguous although separated by wide spans of navigable deep waters,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> with the exception of the high seas, because all lands separated by water touch one another, in a sense, beneath the water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The provision, then, as worded, only means that the exemption in paragraph (b) refers to both the component requirements on territory, that is, contiguity and land area, and not merely to the first, standing alone. For, indeed, why will the law still exempt the islands from the requirement of contiguity when they are already legally contiguous?<br><br>By inference, Section 461, in effect, signifies that, if the proposed province is composed of islands, its territory includes not only the land mass above the water but that which is beneath it. Indeed, theoretically, if this entire territory is measured--the one above and beneath the water, then the 2,000 sq km land area would be met with facility. Separate units of measure are, however, used to calculate dry land and that which is covered by water. For expediency, the law, in providing for the criteria for the creation of a province, has exempted groups of islands from the territorial requirement, and this exemption includes the two component requirements of contiguity and land area.<br><br>Parenthetically, the Court, more than two decades ago, in <i>Tan v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> declared in passing that territory means only the mass of land area and excludes the waters over which a political unit exercises control. This pronouncement in <i>Tan</i> is an <i>obiter dictum</i>, the main issue in the petition for prohibition being the propriety of excluding from the plebiscite for the ratification of the creation of Negros del Norte the inhabitants of the mother province of Negros Occidental. Therefore, <i>Tan</i> does not preclude the proper interpretation of Section 461 of the LGC as exempting groups of islands from the territorial requirement for the creation of provinces.<i> </i><br><br>This interpretation of Section 461 is further in line with the law's thrust of enabling the territorial and political subdivisions of the state to attain their fullest development in order to make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Philippines is composed of 7,107 islands, most of them are small and surrounded by vast bodies of water. The constitution of provinces is aimed at administrative efficiency, effective governance, more equitable delivery of basic services, and economic development.  If this Court is to prevent a group of islands, with skyrocketing revenues, from organizing themselves into a province on account alone of their small aggregate land mass, then it would be impeding their advancement as self-reliant communities and, in the process, would hamper the growth of the national economy--an eventuality obviously not envisioned by both the Constitution and the LGC.<br><br>Congress, in fact, during its deliberations on what would later on be enacted as the LGC, had paid, if at all it did, little attention to the territorial requirement for the creation of provinces. Instead, it focused on the income requirement and acknowledged the same to be the primordial criterion of viability, thus--<br><br><blockquote>HON. ALFELOR: Income is mandatory. We can even have this doubled because we thought...<br><br>CHAIRMAN CUENCO: In other words, the primordial consideration here is the economic viability of the new local government unit, the new province?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>HON. LAGUADA: The reason why we are willing to increase the income, double than the House version, because we also believe that economic viability is really a minimum. Land area and population are functions really of the viability of the area, because where you have an income level which would be the trigger point for economic development, population will naturally increase because there will be an immigration. However, if you disallow the particular area from being converted into a province because of population problems in the beginning, it will never be able to reach the point where it could become a province simply because it will never have the economic take off for it to trigger off that economic development.<br><br>Now, we're saying that maybe Fourteen Million Pesos is a floor area where it could pay for overhead and provide a minimum of basic services to the population. Over and above that, the provincial officials should be able to trigger off economic development which will attract immigration, which will attract new investments from the private sector. This is now the concern of the local officials. But if we are going to tie the hands of the proponents, simply by telling them, "Sorry, you are now at 150 thousand or 200 thousand," you will never be able to become a province because nobody wants to go to your place. Why? Because you never have any reason for economic viability.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>CHAIRMAN PIMENTEL: Okay, what about land area?<br><br>HON. LUMAUIG: 1,500 square kilometers<br><br>HON. ANGARA: Walang problema `yon, in fact that's not very critical, `yong land area because...<br><br>CHAIRMAN PIMENTEL: Okay, ya, our, the Senate version is 3.5, 3,500 square meters, ah, square kilometers.<br><br>HON. LAGUADA: Ne, Ne. A province is constituted for the purpose of administrative efficiency and delivery of basic services.<br><br>CHAIRMAN PIMENTEL: Right.<br><br>HON. LAGUADA: Actually, when you come down to it, when government was instituted, there is only one central government and then everybody falls under that. But it was later on subdivided into provinces for purposes of administrative efficiency.<br><br>CHAIRMAN PIMENTEL: Okay.<br><br>HON. LAGUADA: Now, what we're seeing now is that the administrative efficiency is no longer there precisely because the land areas that we are giving to our governors is so wide that no one man can possibly administer all of the complex machineries that are needed.<br><br>Secondly, when you say "delivery of basic services," as pointed out by Cong. Alfelor, there are sections of the province which have never been visited by public officials, precisely because they don't have the time nor the energy anymore to do that because it's so wide. Now, by compressing the land area and by reducing the population requirement, we are, in effect, trying to follow the basic policy of why we are creating provinces, which is to deliver basic services and to make it more efficient in administration.<br><br>CHAIRMAN PIMENTEL: Yeah, that's correct, but on the assumption that the province is able to do it without being a burden to the national government. That's the assumption.<br><br>HON. LAGUADA: That's why we're going into the minimum income level. As we said, if we go on a minimum income level, then we say, "this is the trigger point at which this administration can take place."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Verily, economic viability is the primordial consideration in the constitution of provinces, not population or territory. As to a province composed of a group of islands separated by stretches of water, like the one in this case, the proposition must apply with greater force.  A contrary position would prove to be growth-retardant to an economically viable group of islands which have not yet politically separated from the larger mass of land where the provincial capital sits.  In a practical sense, it would also be too cumbersome for the inhabitants to travel great lengths and over unpredictable waters just to reach the capital, do their business and avail of basic government services and facilities that ordinarily do not reach beyond the immediate outskirts of the capital. Thus, Section 461, as discussed above, exempts a proposed province composed of several islands from complying with both the contiguity and land area components of the territorial requirement for its creation. It is this interpretation that, logically, impelled both the executive and legislative departments to enact R.A. No. 9355, the law creating the province of Dinagat Islands. We must accord persuasive effect to this contemporaneous interpretation by the two equal branches of government, and abide by the clear intent of the framers of the law.<br><br><i>Cawaling, Jr. v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><i> </i>fittingly instructs that every statute enjoys the presumption of constitutionality, owing to the doctrine of separation of powers which imposes upon the three coordinate departments of the Government a becoming courtesy for each other's acts.  Every law, being the joint act of the Legislature and the Executive, has passed careful scrutiny to ensure that it is in accord with the fundamental law. Of course, the Court may, nevertheless, declare a law, or portions thereof, unconstitutional, where a petitioner has shown that there is a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not merely a doubtful or argumentative one. Here, as revealed in the above discussion, petitioners have not shown that Dinagat Islands does not meet the criteria laid down in Section 461 of the LGC for the creation of a province; thus, they cannot assert that R.A. No. 9355 clearly and unequivocally breaches Article X, Section 10 of the Constitution. Absent a genuine constitutional issue, the petition fails in substance. The petition also breaches procedural standards because when the inquiry is focused on the legal existence of a body politic, the action is reserved to the State in a proceeding for <i>quo warranto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> not through a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>In light of the above disquisition, I vote for the dismissal of the petition.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on August 28, 2006 and August 14, 2006, respectively.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 124-127.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 143.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
