				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The administration of justice is circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. It requires that everyone involved in its dispensation — from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk — live up to the strictest standards of competence, honesty, and integrity in the public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Any impression of impropriety, misdeed, or negligence in the performance of official functions must be avoided. The Court shall not countenance any conduct, act, or omission on the part of those involved in the administration of justice that violates the norm of public accountability and diminishes the faith of the people in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Indeed, public confidence in our courts is vital to the effective functioning of the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Bearing these tenets in mind, the Court proceeds to determine the ultimate liabilities of a presiding judge, her branch clerk of court, and her process server in connection with an anomaly involving the approval of bail bonds in criminal cases.<br><br>An anonymous "Concerned Filipino Citizen" sent to then Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. a letter dated October 22, 2003 requesting the investigation of Judge Marilou D. Runes-Tamang, Presiding Judge of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) in Pateros and Acting Presiding Judge of the MeTC in San Juan, Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The letter-sender complained that Judge Tamang, through the connivance of the arresting officer and court employees of MeTC at San Juan, had been indiscriminately approving fake bonds for a fee of P1,000.00 "<i>per count ng kaso." </i>The letter-sender also requested the investigation of Judge Tamang's husband, a sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Pasig and an alleged drug addict.<br><br>The letter prompted the Court to treat it as an administrative complaint. On November 4, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Chief Justice Davide, Jr. referred the letter to then Deputy Court Administrator Christopher O. Lock (DCA Lock) for appropriate action.<br><br><center><b>Initial Investigation and Report<br>by the Office of the Court Administrator</b><br></center><br>The office of DCA Lock conducted a discreet investigation on the reported impropriety.  The investigation revealed that Judge Tamang had approved bail bonds issued by Covenant Assurance Company, Inc (Covenant), despite Covenant having been blacklisted since December 20, 2002 in the RTC in Pasig City.<br><br>It appears that the RTC, Branch 153, in Pasig City furnished to the OCA a copy of its order dated October 22, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> revoking the "unethical Orders of Release" issued by Judge Tamang in various criminal cases assigned to that branch. The order stated that Judge Tamang had approved the bail bonds issued by a blacklisted company without any showing of the unavailability of all the RTC Judges in Pasig, considering that the accused persons posting the bail bonds were charged in criminal cases pending before the RTC in Pasig and were detained in the Pasig City Jail.<br><br>In his memorandum dated May 12, 2004, DCA Lock recommended that the Assistant Court Administrator in charge of the area where Judge Tamang was stationed be directed to conduct further investigation of the irregularities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On May 18, 2004, the Court approved the recommendation, and  endorsed the matter to then Assistant Court Administrator Antonio H.

As earlier stated, Covenant was a blacklisted company at the time of issuance of the bail bonds. She was thereby guilty of a neglect of duty, for, according to <i>Judicial Audit and Physical Inventory of Confiscated Cash, Surety and Property Bonds at RTC, Tarlac City, Brs. 63, 64 &amp; 65</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the judge is still bound to review the supporting documents before approving the bail bonds, even if it is the Clerk of Court who has the duty to ascertain that the bail bonds are in order, and that all requisites for approval have been complied with. The Court concurred with the OCA's following observation submitted in said case, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Although the duty to ensure compliance with the requisites of the bail bond application rests mainly with the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized personnel and the task of the Judge is only to approve the same, said task has an accompanying responsibility on the part of the approving Judge to review or determine its validity. Understandably, he should be employing the minimum standard the rules require the clerks of court to observe. Considering the seriousness of the purpose in the posting of bail bond, approval thereof should pass through strict scrutiny and with utmost caution on the part of both the Clerk of Court (or his duly authorized personnel) and the approving Judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br><i>  </i>Indeed, in <i>Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 4, Dolores, Eastern Samar</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and <i>Padilla v.

Honrado,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> a judge is inexcusably negligent if he fails to observe in the performance of his duties that diligence, prudence and circumspection that the law requires in the rendition of any public service.<br><br>Judge Tamang's excuse of simply relying on the representation of the court personnel who unfortunately took advantage of her leniency and kindness betrayed a deficiency in that requisite degree of circumspection demanded of all those who don the judicial robe. She cannot now thereby exculpate herself, or take refuge behind that excuse, for, in fact, such reliance was actually her admission of being neglectful and of lacking the diligent care in paying attention to the judicial matters brought to her for signature. A carelessness of that kind and degree ran contrary to the competence expected of her as a dispenser of justice and as a visible representation of the law.<br><br><b>  </b>Section 17 (a), Rule 114 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> governs the approval of bail bonds for criminal cases pending outside the judge's territorial jurisdiction, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 17. <i>Bail, where filed</i>.— (a) Bail in the amount fixed may be filed with the court where the case is pending, or in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with any regional trial judge, metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit trial judge in the province, city, or municipality.

It is worth noting that at the time of the subject bail applications, there was still no RTC Judge stationed in San Juan and Pateros.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>However, Judge Tamang did not substantiate her explanation that  she had approved the bail applications of the accused detained in Pasig City and had issued the corresponding release orders after office hours on Fridays because no RTC Judges had been available in Pasig City. Aside from the affidavits attesting that she had stayed and worked in her office until 9 <i>p.m.</i> and that the orders of release had been immediately served on the jail warden concerned, she offered no proof to justify her approval of the questioned bonds. Thus, her explanation did not exculpate her, for, truly, her approvals of the bail bonds constituted an irregularity arising from her lack of the authority to do so.<br><br>The OCA classified Judge Tamang's acts as simple misconduct<i>, </i>and recommended a fine of P10,000.00 to be imposed on her.<br><br>Although her approval of the bail bonds and her issuance of the orders of release manifested a degree of incompetence on her part, we should not find Judge Tamang guilty of simple misconduct, a less serious charge under Section 9, Rule 140, <i>Rules of Court</i>. Instead, we find her guilty of simple neglect of duty, a light charge under Section 10, Rule 140, <i>Rules of Court,</i> for we are all too aware of the pitfalls that a judge like her frequently stumbles into when detailed in another station. She became an unwitting victim of the continuing illegal activities of Medrano, who took advantage of her being too busy with her judicial and administrative duties and tasks to have noticed and prevented his illegal activities.<br><br>Nonetheless, several circumstances properly mitigated her administrative liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><i>First</i>: Medrano admitted his liability and totally exonerated Judge Tamang of any participation in or knowledge of the anomalous scheme of submitting blacklisted bonds for approval. In his <i>Tugon/Salaysay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> he confessed:<br><br><blockquote><i>Tungkol po sa bond na inyong napirmahan, akin pong inaamin na marami dito ang ipinadaan sa akin.

He also declared:<br><br><blockquote><i>Inaamin ko din po na ang iba dito ay kulang sa papeles at kung pagkaminsan ay kumpleto nga ngunit mga xerox copies lamang ang mga dokumento naka -attach. Sa ganitong mga pagkakataong ay pinasasabi ko na lamang sa mga staff na sabihin sa inyo kapag kayo ay nagtatanong na kumpleto ang lahat at walang prublema at ikakabit ko na lamang sa bond kinabukasan o kapag ito ay dadalhin na sa korte.</i><br><br><i>Maari pong sabihin na akin nga pong naabuso at nasamantala ang kabaitan at pagtitiwala ninyo sa amin, dahil naipalusot ko ang mga nasabing bonds, nang hindi ko sinsabi sa inyo ang katotohanan.

Gusto ko lamang pong malaman ninyo na ako ay biktima lamang ng mga taong nakiusap sa akin na dahil sa tiwala at kumpyansa sa kanila, kapag sinabi nila sa akin na ayos ang lahat ng papeles at ang mga nasabing bonds at alam na ng kinauukulang husgado, akin po itong tinatanggap at pinadadala sa inyong lamesa para mapirmahan.</i><br></blockquote><br><i>Second</i>: It is undisputed that upon learning about the anomaly in August 2003 Judge Tamang immediately took steps to frontally deal with it by conducting an investigation, and directing Sorio at first and Medrano later to explain their participations in the uncovered anomaly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Her measures were sincerely taken a few months before the Court received the denunciatory anonymous letter in November 2003. The taking of such measures were probably what convinced Executive Judge Manalastas as Investigating Judge to observe in her report on the investigation that there appeared "no evidence to support a finding of bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or deliberate intent to do injustice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>: The offense is Judge Tamang's first administrative charge as a judge. According to <i>Concerned Boholanos for Law and Order v.

Censure;<br><br>3. <u><b>Reprimand</b></u>;<br><br>4. Admonition with warning.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>II</b><br><b>Liability of Ellen Sorio</b><br></center><br>The OCA recommended that Sorio be found guilty of gross negligence, which Subsection A(2), Section 52, Rule IV of the <i>Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</i> punishes with dismissal from the service.<br><br>The 2002 <i>Revised Manual for Clerks of Court</i> requires that all applications for bail and judicial bonds shall be coursed, before their approval by the Judge concerned, through the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized personnel, who shall see to it that the bonds are in order. In accepting surety bonds, the Clerk of Court should see to it that all the requisites are complied with; otherwise, the bonds should be rejected. Every bond shall be accompanied by a clearance from the Supreme Court showing that the issuing company is qualified to transact business, which clearance is valid only for 30 days from the date of its issuance.<br><br>In response to Judge Tamang's Memorandum Order No 001-03, Sorio categorically averred that she had personally scrutinized the documents before these were brought to the judge's table for her signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  Insisting that there was no single defective or anomalous bond from among the documents that had passed through her, Sorio stated:<br><br><blockquote>It's true that all orders and other documents including bail bonds pass through the undersigned before they are presented to you for signature. The idea was for me to check whether the documents to be signed by you are in order. To my recollection, all bail bonds which passed through undersigned for scrutiny/examination were all in order before they were presented to you for your signature. After your signature on bail bonds, corresponding endorsement letters were made to the court where the accused may have pending case and we have these transmittal on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Sorio's insistence notwithstanding, there were still spurious bail bonds that had reached the hands of Judge Tamang, and that the latter ultimately signed. Thus, although Sorio denied any knowledge of or participation in such anomalous bail bonds, we find her liable.<br><br>As the Branch Clerk of Court of the MeTC in San Juan, Sorio was the administrative officer of the branch who had the control and supervision of all court records, exhibits, documents, properties and supplies. With her responsibilities as such, Sorio should have ensured that all bail bonds and their supporting documents were in order before endorsing them to Judge Tamang for approval. Sorio should have rejected the bail bonds of Covenant due to the latter's blacklisting and its lack of clearance from the Supreme Court to issue such bail bonds. She cannot now simply feign ignorance and escape liability upon the implausible pretext that some bail bonds did not pass through her.<br><br>Likewise, Sorio did not explain the non-transmittal of some approved bail bonds and their supporting documents to the courts, before which the criminal cases of the accused concerned had been filed and pending. Based on the record, Judge Tamang had given instructions to Sorio and Medrano to immediately release the bail bonds upon her approval of them.  However, during the hearing before the Investigating Judge, Sorio admitted her failure to see to their immediate release, although such was her primary responsibility as the Branch Clerk of Court, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>COURT: No, first explain to me why these documents were not transmitted... (interrupted)<br><br>MS. SORIO: Upon approval <i>yon ni</i> Judge Tamang, after approval I gave everything to the one in-charge in transmitting the bonds.<br><br>COURT: Who is the one in-charge?<br><br>MS. SORIO: The interpreter, Your Honor, then I presumed that everything will be transmitted by her.<br><br>COURT: You have administrative responsibility over the personnel of the Court.<br><br>MS. SORIO: Yes, Your Honor, <i>alam ko po yon kaya naman po pag  nagpa ano na ho sya hindi ko na po alam kung alin-alin po yong kanyang mga pinadala at hindi niya pinadala</i>. And then <i>ngayon, silang dalawa (2) nalang ho ni</i> Ronnie and <i>nag-uusap ho kung ano pa pong kulang</i>.<br><br>COURT:  <i>Eh pano yan di</i> command responsibility <i>din sayo yan</i> because these documents were never transmitted by your subordinate.<br><br>MS. SORIO: <i>Basta binigyan ko po sila ng</i> instruction <i>lagi talaga na itransmit nyo kaagad yan</i>.<br><br>COURT: But they were never transmitted, the fact is, they were never transmitted.<br><br>MS. SORIO: I don't know... (interrupted)<br><br>COURT: So who should be responsible?<br><br>MS. SORIO: <i>Hindi ko po talaga alam kung natransmit ho nila lahat yon ma'am.</i><br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>COURT: So why they were not transmitted and why did you not find out until this investigation?<br><br>MS. SORIO: I do believe, Your Honor, that they will follow my instructions.<br><br>COURT: And you never follow it up? You never ask them?<br><br>MS. SORIO: I am always following up, Your Honor, the instruction to them.<br><br>COURT: That's not enough apparently, you're the clerk of court <i>eh kasi lalo na yon</i> it's a vacant Court <i>walang</i> judge you should be responsible. <i>Ano bang ginagawa ninyo pag walang</i> judge <i>dyan</i>? You know command responsibility you're the highest official in that Court.<br><br>MS. SORIO: Yes, Your Honor, I'm doing my best, Your Honor, <i>lahat po iniuutos ko sa kanila, lahat ng dapat nilang gawin pinagagawa ko</i> but unfortunately (interrupted)<br><br>COURT: <i>Oo</i> it is not enough <i>na iuutos mo tapos hindi naman gagawin di  ba</i><br><br>MS. SORIO: <i>Tsinetsek ko naman po sa kanila eh</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>Sorio's passing on the blame to her subordinates, as the foregoing excerpt of her testimony indicates, did not justify her failure to ensure that the approved bail bonds be forthwith transmitted to the courts concerned. Her obligation did not end with the initial verification and signing of the documents, but extended until the bail bonds and their supporting documents were transmitted to the courts concerned for appropriate action.<br><br>Thus, we cannot exonerate Sorio. As the Branch Clerk of Court, she was an essential and ranking officer of the judicial system who performed delicate administrative functions vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Her responsibility went beyond a perfunctory and superficial supervision of her subordinates. As the Court pointed out in <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Saa</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><blockquote>xxx Clerks of Court are required to be persons of competence, honesty, and probity since they are specifically imbued with the mandate of safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings, to earn and preserve respect therefor, to maintain loyalty thereto and to the judge as a superior officer, to maintain the authenticity and correctness of court records and to uphold the confidence of the public in the administration of justice. xxx</blockquote><br>The degree of diligence expected of Sorio as the Branch Clerk was high. According to <i>Escobar Vda. de Lopez v. Luna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><i> </i>the Clerks of Court:<br><br><blockquote>xxx [a]re the hubs of adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and like concerns. Their responsibilities are vital to the prompt and sound administration of justice. They cannot be allowed to slacken on their work. They should be officers of competence; they should safeguard the integrity of the court and its proceedings; they should uphold the confidence of the public in the administration of justice; and they should help ensure that the cause of justice is done without delay.<br></blockquote>Sorio was remiss in the performance of her duties. Aside from taking her responsibilities as the Branch Clerk of Court for granted, she also fell short of the task of effective supervision of the court staff. The recommendation of the OCA that Sorio be administratively sanctioned for gross negligence of duty was, therefore, proper, considering that, as the OCA aptly put it:<br><blockquote>Respondent Sorio was grossly negligent in her duties as clerk of court as shown by her insistence, during the hearing conducted by the investigating judge that she knew nothing of what was happening in the Court. Being the Branch Clerk of Court, she cannot just feign ignorance, considering that she is the administrative assistant of the presiding judge with the duty to assist in the management of all matters not involving the exercise of discretion or judgment of the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>The OCA observed, however, that it found no evidence of bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or deliberate intent to do injustice on the part of Sorio. Although her participation in the anomaly was sufficiently established, we give due consideration to the fact that this offense was her first administrative liability in the 35 years she worked in the Judiciary by appreciating this fact as a mitigating circumstance in her favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> We impose suspension from the service for two months without pay.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br><b>Liability of Ronnie Medrano</b><br></center><br>We cannot be as compassionate towards Medrano, who categorically admitted his offense, giving the simple explanation of having thereby accommodated ill-intentioned people.

He thereby converted his employment in the court into an income-generating activity.<br><br>We find him guilty of grave misconduct,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> because he fell short of his accountability to the people as a public employee. The Court explains in <i>Imperial v.
