				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When the evidence received by the trial court are irrelevant to the issue of just compensation and in total disregard of the requirements provided under Section 17 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the Court is left with no evidence on record that could aid in the proper resolution of the case. While remand is frowned upon for obviating the speedy dispensation of justice, it becomes necessary to ensure compliance with the law and to give everyone - the landowner, the farmers, and the State - their due.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review under Rule 45, assailing the August 30, 2005 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA), as well as its December 5, 2005 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in CA-GR SP No. 83138.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated January 29, 2004 and the Order dated March 16, 2004 of the RTC, Branch 56, Angeles City in Civil Case No. 10405 are hereby AFFIRMED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>Petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) is the government financial institution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> established to aid in the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) as well as to act as financial intermediary of the Agrarian Reform Fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Respondent Enrique Livioco (Livioco) was the owner of 30.6329 hectares of sugarland<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> located in Dapdap, Mabalacat, Pampanga.&nbsp; Sometime between 1987 and 1988,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Livioco offered his sugarland to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) for acquisition under the CARP at P30.00 per square meter, for a total of P9,189,870.00.&nbsp; The voluntary-offer-to-sell (VOS) form<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> he submitted to the DAR indicated that his property is adjacent to residential subdivisions and to an international paper mill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The DAR referred Livioco's offer to the LBP for valuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Following Section 17 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6657 and DAR Administrative Order No. 17, series of 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as amended by Administrative Order No. 3, series of 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the LBP set the price at P3.21 per square meter or a total of P827,943.48 for 26 hectares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Livioco was then promptly informed of the valuation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and that the cash portion of the claim proceeds have been "kept in trust pending [his] submission of the [ownership documentary] requirements."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It appears however that Livioco did not act upon the notice given to him by both government agencies.&nbsp; On September 20, 1991, LBP issued a certification to the Register of Deeds of Pampanga that it has earmarked the amount of P827,943.48 as compensation for Livioco's 26 hectares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>It was only two years later<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that Livioco requested for a reevaluation of the compensation on the ground that its value had already appreciated from the time it was first offered for sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; The request was denied by Regional Director Antonio Nuesa on the ground that there was already a perfected sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The DAR proceeded to take possession of Livioco's property.&nbsp; In 1994, the DAR awarded Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) covering Livioco's property to 26 qualified farmer-beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Livioco filed separate complaints to cancel the CLOAs and to recover his property but the same proved futile.&nbsp; The first case he filed in 1995 was for quieting of title, recovery of possession and damages against the DAR, LBP, Register of Deeds, and the farmer-beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; In its final and executory Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the CA sustained the validity of the CLOAs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The relevant portions of the Decision read:<br><br><blockquote>What matters most is the fact that the requirements for "Compulsory Acquisition" of private lands, especially the indispensable ones, to wit: (1) valuation of the subject property by the proper government agency which is the LBP; (2) DAR's "Notice of Land Valuation" to petitioner and; (3) most importantly, the deposit of the amount of land valuation in the name of petitioner after he rejected the said amount, were substantially complied with in the instant case.<br><br>Considering therefore that there was material and substantial compliance with the requirements for the "Compulsory Acquisition" of the subject land, the acquisition of the same is indubitably in order and in accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Livioco then filed in 1998 a petition for reconveyance before the DAR Regional Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; The case eventually reached the CA, which dismissed the petition on the ground that the validity of the compulsory acquisition had already been decided with finality in the earlier CA case, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>As the disputed property was eventually acquired through Compulsory Acquisition, its reconveyance to the petitioners was properly disallowed by the DAR.&nbsp; The certifications by other government agencies that the land was identified as a resettlement area [are] of no avail as the DAR is vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and has exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Indeed, it is to the best interest of the public that the litigation regarding the reconveyance of the disputed property between the same parties for the same grounds must come to an end, the matter having [been] already fully and fairly adjudicated by the DAR, this Court and the Supreme Court which had declined to disturb the judgment of this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Upon the request of DAR, LBP made two amendments to the valuation.&nbsp; At first, they reduced the acquired area from 30.6329 hectares to 23.9191 hectares.&nbsp; Later, they increased the acquired area to 24.2088 hectares.&nbsp; The remaining 6.4241 hectares of the property was determined as not compensable because this comprised a residential area, a creek, road, and a chapel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The total value for 24.2088 hectares was P770,904.54. Livioco was informed on August 8, 2001 that the payment was already deposited in cash and agrarian reform bonds and may be withdrawn upon submission of the documentary requirements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Unable to recover his property but unwilling to accept what he believes was an outrageously low valuation of his property, Livioco finally filed a petition for judicial determination of just compensation against DAR, LBP, and the CLOA holders before Branch 56 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Angeles City on December 18, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; He maintained that between 1990 and 2000, the area where his property is located has become predominantly residential hence he should be paid his property's value as such. To prove that his property is now residential, Livioco presented a Certification from the Office of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator of the Municipality of Mabalacat that, as per zoning ordinance, Livioco's land is located in an area where the dominant land use is residential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; He also presented certifications from the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Mt. Pinatubo Commission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and the National Housing Authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that his property is suitable for a resettlement area or for socialized housing.&nbsp; None of these plans pushed through.<br><br>Livioco then presented evidence to prove the value of his property as of 2002. According to his sworn valuation, his property has a market value of P700.00/square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; He also presented the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) zonal value for residential lands in Dapdap, as ranging from P150.00 to P200.00/square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; He then presented Franklin Olay (Olay), chief appraiser of the Rural Bank of Mabalacat, who testified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and certified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that he valued the property at P800.00 per square meter, whether or not the property is residential.&nbsp; Olay explained that he arrived at the said value by asking the buyers of adjacent residential properties as to the prevailing selling price in the area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; There was also a certification from the Pinatubo Project Management Office that Livioco's property was valued at P300.00/square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Livioco prayed that just compensation be computed at P700.00/square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Only LBP filed its Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and participated in the trial.&nbsp; It justified the P3.21/square meter valuation of the property on the ground that it was made pursuant to the guidelines in RA 6657 and DAR Administrative Order No. 3, series of 1991.&nbsp; LBP objected to respondent's theory that his property should be valued as a residential land&nbsp; because the same was acquired for agricultural purposes, not for its potential for conversion to other uses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; LBP presented its agrarian affairs specialist who testified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that, due to the increase in the acquired area, she was assigned to amend the claim of Livioco.&nbsp; She computed the total value thereof at P770,904.54, using the DAR Administrative Order No. 3, series of 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The only other witness of LBP was its lawyer, who explained the legal basis for the DAR administrative orders and the factors for land valuation provided in Section 17 of RA 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>Apparently aware that neither party presented relevant evidence for the proper computation of the just compensation, the trial court issued its April 2, 2003 Order requiring the reception of additional evidence:<br><br><blockquote>A perusal of the record of this case as well as the evidence adduced by the parties shows that the facts required for the proper computation and/or determination of just compensation for the plaintiff's property i.e., land value of the property in accordance with the Listasaka, capitalized net income, comparable sales and market value pursuant to the corresponding tax declaration, are unavailable and insufficient.<br><br>WHEREFORE, for the Court to properly determine and fix the just compensation to be accorded to [respondent's] property, the reopening of this case for the purpose of the presentation of additional evidence is hereby ordered.<br><br>Let the reception of aforesaid additional evidence be set on April 22, 2003 at 8:30 am.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Based on the records, the next hearing took place on July 10, 2003 where none of the parties presented additional evidence, whether testimonial or documentary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Nevertheless, the trial court proceeded to rule in favor of Livioco:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the [respondent], Enrique Livioco, and against the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Land Bank of the Philippines with a determination that the just compensation of Livioco's property, consisting of 24.2088 hectares located at Mabalacat, Pampanga is worth Php700.00 per square meter.<br><br>Defendants Department of Agrarian Reform and Land Bank of the Philippines are, therefore, ordered to pay [respondent] the amount of Php700.00 per square meter multiplied by 24.2088 hectares representing the entire area taken by the government from the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court was of the opinion that Livioco was able to prove the higher valuation of his property with a preponderance of evidence. In contrast, there was a dearth of evidence to support LBP's P3.21 per square meter valuation of the property. Not a single documentary evidence was presented to substantiate its valuation.<br><br>LBP sought a reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the adverse decision arguing that the court should have considered the factors appearing in Section 17.&nbsp; It stressed that in failing to consider the property's productive capacity (capitalized net income), the court placed the farmer-beneficiaries in a very difficult position.&nbsp; They would not be able to pay off the just compensation for their lands because it is valued way beyond its productive capacity.&nbsp; The same was denied by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Upon respondent's motion, the lower court ordered LBP on March 29, 2004 to release as initial cash down payment the amount of P827,943.48, inclusive of legal interest accruing from the time of&nbsp; taking on September 20, 1991 (the date when LBP informed the Register of Deeds that it has earmarked the said amount in favor of Livioco).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>LBP sought a reconsideration of the said order.&nbsp; It clarified that the just compensation deposited by LBP in the account of respondent was only P770,904.54 for the 24.2088 hectares.&nbsp; It likewise asked that the release of the deposit be subject to respondent's compliance with the release requirements of the ownership documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; The records are silent as to the court's action on the motion as well as to the execution of this order.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Petitioner turned to the CA to no avail.&nbsp; The CA affirmed the trial court's decision <i>in toto</i>.&nbsp; First it held that factual findings of the trial courts are entitled to respect.&nbsp; It held that the factors for determining just compensation, set out in Section 17 of RA 6657, were all considered by the trial court in arriving at its decision. It stated that among the relevant evidence considered were Livioco's sworn valuation, tax declarations, zonal value, actual use of the property, and the socio-economic benefits contributed by the government to the property.&nbsp; It likewise noted that the taking of Livioco's property coincided with the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991, which event affected its valuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Pursuant to Section 18(1)(b) of RA 6657, the CA ordered LBP to pay 30% of the purchase price in cash, while the balance may be paid in government financial instruments negotiable at any time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>A motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> was filed on September 29, 2005, which was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated December 5, 2005.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner's arguments</i></b><br><br>In this Petition before us, LBP assails the CA's assent to the valuation of Livioco's property as a residential land.&nbsp; It maintains that it is not the State's policy to purchase residential land. Since the property was acquired under the CARP, it had to be valued as an agricultural land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the assumption that Livioco's property has a residential use is entirely speculative and baseless because none of the government plans to use it as a residential land was carried out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>LBP also assails the Decision of the trial court which valued the land as of 1997 when the rule is that just compensation must be valued at the time of taking, which in this case was in 1988.&nbsp; By considering events that transpired after 1988, the court obviously relied on factors that were not in existence at the time of taking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>LBP further argues that the trial court should have given more weight to its land valuation because it is the authorized agency recognized by the legislature as having expertise on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>LBP insists that the Claim Valuation and Processing Form that it presented before the appellate court "clearly established the area covered, the land use or crop planted, the average price/hectare and the total value of the subject land." LBP describes this document as clear and convincing evidence of the correctness of its valuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>LBP likewise assails the lower courts' valuation on the ground that they disregarded the factors set out in Section 17 of RA 6657 for the determination of just compensation.&nbsp; It argues that the factors stated in that provision are exclusive and the courts cannot consider factors that are not included therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent's arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent argues that by seeking a review of the just compensation, LBP is raising a question of fact, which entails an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> He points out that LBP is merely reiterating the arguments already presented in its motion for reconsideration before the CA, which makes the instant petition dilatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Respondent then argues that, with respect to the determination of just compensation, courts are not bound by the findings of administrative agencies such as LBP.&nbsp; Courts are the final authority in this matter.&nbsp; LBP's valuation is only preliminary and it has the duty to prove to the trial courts the veracity of its valuation.&nbsp; In the instant case, the trial court decided based on the evidence presented but found LBP's valuation unsubstantiated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; He then prays for the dismissal of the instant petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br><div style="text-align: center;">Was the compensation for respondent's property<br>determined in accordance with law?<br></div><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>For purposes of just compensation, the fair market value of an expropriated property is determined by its character and its price at the time of taking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; There are three important concepts in this definition - the character of the property, its price, and the time of actual taking.&nbsp; Did the appellate court properly consider these three concepts when it affirmed the trial court's decision?&nbsp; We find that it did not.<br><br><i>As to the character of the property </i><br><br>The trial and appellate courts valued respondent's property as a <i>residential</i> land worth P700.00 per square meter.&nbsp; They considered the use for the property as having changed from agricultural in 1988 (when Livioco offered it to DAR) to residential by 2002 (allegedly due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo).&nbsp; Both courts erred in treating the land as residential and accepting the change in the character of the property, without any proof that authorized land conversion had taken place.<br><br>In expropriation cases (including cases involving lands for agrarian reform), the property's character refers to its actual use at the time of taking,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> not its potential uses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Respondent himself admitted that his property was <i>agricultural</i> at the time he offered it for sale to DAR in 1988. In his letter to the DAR in 1988, respondent manifested that his land is agricultural and suitable for agricultural purposes, although it stood adjacent to residential properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, it has been conclusively decided by final judgment in the earlier cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> filed by respondent that his property was validly acquired under RA 6657 and validly distributed to agrarian reform beneficiaries. Since the coverage of RA 6657 only extends to agricultural lands, respondent's property should be conclusively treated as an <i>agricultural</i> land and valued as such.<br><br>The lower courts erred in ruling that the character or use of the property has changed from agricultural to residential, because there is no allegation or proof that the property was approved for conversion to other uses by DAR.&nbsp; It is the DAR that is mandated by law to evaluate and to approve land use conversions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> so as to prevent fraudulent evasions from agrarian reform coverage. Even reclassification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and plans for expropriation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> by local government units (LGUs) will not <i>ipso facto</i> convert an agricultural property to residential, industrial or commercial.&nbsp; Thus, in the absence of any DAR approval for the conversion of respondent's property or an actual expropriation by an LGU, it cannot be said that the character or use of said property changed from agricultural to residential.&nbsp; Respondent's property remains agricultural and should be valued as such.&nbsp; Hence, the CA and the trial court had no legal basis for considering the subject property's value as <i>residential</i>.<br><br>Respondent's evidence of the value of his land as <i>residential</i> property (which the lower courts found to be preponderant) could, at most, refer to the potential use of the property.&nbsp; While the potential use of an expropriated property is sometimes considered in cases where there is a great improvement in the general vicinity of the expropriated property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> it should never control the determination of just compensation (which appears to be what the lower courts have erroneously done).&nbsp; The potential use of a property should not be the principal criterion for determining just compensation for this will be contrary to the well-settled doctrine that the fair market value of an expropriated property is determined by its character and its price at the time of taking, not its potential uses.&nbsp; If at all, the potential use of the property or its "adaptability for conversion in the future is a factor, not the ultimate in determining just compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>The proper approach should have been to value respondent's property as an <i>agricultural</i> land, which value may be adjusted in light of the improvements in the Municipality of Mabalacat.&nbsp; Valuing the property as a <i>residential</i> land (as the lower courts have done) is not the correct approach, for reasons explained above.&nbsp; It would also be contrary to the social policy of agrarian reform, which is to free the tillers of the land from the bondage of the soil without delivering them to the new oppression of exorbitant land valuations.&nbsp; Note that in lands acquired under RA 6657, it is the farmer-beneficiaries who will ultimately pay the valuations paid to the former land owners (LBP merely advances the payment).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; If the farmer-beneficiaries are made to pay for lands valued as residential lands (the valuation for which is substantially higher than the valuation for agricultural lands), it is not unlikely that such farmers, unable to keep up with payment amortizations, will be forced to give up their landholdings in favor of the State or be driven to sell the property to other parties.&nbsp; This may just bring the State right back to the starting line where the landless remain landless and the rich acquire more landholdings from desperate farmers.<br><br>The CA also erroneously considered the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 as converting the use for respondent's property from agricultural to residential. We find no basis for the appellate court's conclusion.&nbsp; First, as already explained, there was no conversion order from DAR, or even an application for conversion with DAR, to justify the CA's decision to treat the property as residential.&nbsp; Second, respondent himself testified that his property was not affected by the volcanic ashfall,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> which can only mean that its nature as an agricultural land was not drastically affected.&nbsp; The Mt. Pinatubo eruption only served to make his property attractive to government agencies as a resettlement area, but none of these government plans panned out; hence, his property remained agricultural.&nbsp; Third, the circumstance that respondent's property was surrounded by residential subdivisions was already in existence when he offered it for sale sometime between 1987 and 1988.&nbsp; The VOS form that respondent accomplished described his property as being located adjacent to residential subdivisions.&nbsp; It was not therefore a drastic change caused by volcanic eruption.&nbsp; All together, these circumstances negate the CA's ruling that the subject property should be treated differently because of the natural calamity.<br><br><i>As to the price: Applying Section 17 of RA 6657</i><br><br>The trial and appellate courts also erred in disregarding Section 17 of RA 6657<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> in their determination of just compensation. Section 17 of RA 6657 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation</i>. -- In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of the like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessments made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.<br></blockquote><br>Jurisprudence is replete with reminders to special agrarian courts to strictly adhere to the factors set out in Section 17 of RA 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>By issuing its April 2, 2003 Order requiring the reception of additional evidence, the trial court revealed its awareness of the importance of adhering to Section 17 of RA 6657.&nbsp; It recognized that the evidence presented by the parties were insufficient to arrive at the just compensation and that the necessary evidence were unavailable for its consideration.&nbsp; For some reason, however, the trial court proceeded to rule on the case without actually receiving such relevant evidence.&nbsp; Instead, the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, ruled in favor of respondent based on preponderance of evidence, regardless of the fact that the evidence presented by respondent were not really relevant to the factors mentioned in section 17 of RA 6657.<br><br>The CA ruled that the trial court took into account all the factors in Section 17 of RA 6657.&nbsp; We disagree. Going over the factors in Section 17, it is clear that almost all were not properly considered and some positively ignored.&nbsp; For instance: (a) The "<b><i>cost of acquisition</i></b>" was not even inquired into.&nbsp; It would not have been difficult to require respondent to present evidence of the property's price when he acquired the same. (b) As to the "<b><i>nature</i></b>" of the property, it has already been explained that the lower courts erroneously treated it as residential rather than agricultural. (c) Also, no heed was given to the "<b><i>current value of like properties</i></b>."&nbsp; Since respondent's property is agricultural in nature, "like properties" in this case would be agricultural lands, preferably also sugarcane lands, within the municipality or adjacent municipalities.&nbsp; But the chief appraiser of the Rural Bank of Mabalacat testified that he considered the value of adjacent <i>residential</i> properties, not "like properties" as required under the law. Comparing respondent's agricultural property to residential properties is not what the law envisioned.&nbsp; (d) The factor of "<b><i>actual use and income of the property</i></b>" was also ignored;&nbsp; what was instead considered was the property's potential use.<br><br>Thus, we cannot accept the valuation by the lower courts, as it is not in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657.&nbsp; It was based on respondent's evidence which were irrelevant or off-tangent to the factors laid down by Section 17.<br><br>However, we also cannot accept the valuation proffered by LBP for lack of proper substantiation.<br><br>LBP argues that its valuation should be given more weight because it is the recognized agency with expertise on the matter, but this same argument had been struck down in <i>Landbank of the Philippines v.

No. 132477, August 31, 2005, 468 SCRA 471, 478-483) explains the effect of reclassification and the necessity for conversion in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>After the passage of Republic Act No. 6657, otherwise known as Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, agricultural lands, <i>though reclassified,</i> have to go through the process of conversion, jurisdiction over which is vested in the DAR. However, agricultural lands already reclassified before the effectivity of Rep. Act No. 6657 are exempted from conversion.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The requirement that agricultural lands must go through the process of conversion despite having undergone reclassification was underscored in the case of <i>Alarcon v. Court of Appeals,</i> where it was held that reclassification of land does not suffice:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, there is no final order of conversion. The subject landholding was merely reclassified. Conversion is different from reclassification. Conversion is the act of changing the current use of a piece of agricultural land into some other use as approved by the Department of Agrarian Reform. Reclassification, on the other hand, is the act of specifying how agricultural lands shall be utilized for non-agricultural uses such as residential, industrial, commercial, as embodied in the land use plan, subject to the requirements and procedure for land use conversion. Accordingly, a mere reclassification of agricultural land does not automatically allow a landowner to change its use and thus cause the ejectment of the tenants. He has to undergo the process of conversion before he is permitted to use the agricultural land for other purposes.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br><br>The authority of the DAR to approve conversions of agricultural lands covered by Rep. Act No. 6657 to non-agricultural uses has <i>not</i> been pierced by the passage of the Local Government Code. The Code explicitly provides that "nothing in this section shall be construed as repealing or modifying in any manner the provisions of Rep. Act No. 6657."&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> A DAR Conversion Clearance is no longer necessary when the LGUs expropriate agricultural lands for a public purpose&nbsp; (<i>Province of Camarines Sur v.

The expropriation of agricultural lands by LGUs was further clarified by DAR in its Administrative Order No. 2, series of 2009, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>17. Pursuant to Section 4 of RA 9700, an LGU may, through its Chief Executive and/or an ordinance, exercise the power of eminent domain on agricultural lands for public use, purpose or welfare of the poor and the landless, upon payment of just compensation to agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) on these lands, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and pertinent laws.&nbsp; The power of eminent domain may not be exercised unless a valid and definite offer has been previously made to the ARBs, and such offer was not accepted.&nbsp; In cases where the land sought to be acquired has been issued with a Notice of Coverage or is already subject to voluntary offer to sell (with letter-offer submitted to the DAR) the concerned LGU shall suspend the exercise of its power of eminent domain until after the LAD process has been completed and the title to the property has been transferred to ARBs.</blockquote><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> <i>National Power Corporation v.

The owner of private property should be compensated only for what he actually loses; it is not intended that his compensation shall extend beyond his loss or injury.&nbsp; And what he loses is only the actual value of his property at the time it is taken.&nbsp; This is the only way that compensation to be paid can be truly just, i.e., `just not only to the individual whose property is taken,' but to the public, which is to pay for it."<br></blockquote><br>Although there are agrarian cases which hold that just compensation should be valued at the "time of payment," (<i>Office of the President v.

No. 180803, October 23, 2009, 604 SCRA 373, 380-381) these decisions are not applicable in the case at bar.&nbsp; Said cases involved the issue of choosing between an earlier law (Presidential Decree No. 27, by which the property was acquired) and a later law (RA 6657, which was enacted while the issue of just compensation in these cases was still pending). The Court ruled that the seizure of the properties covered by PD No. 27 did not occur upon the effectivity of PD 27 but upon the actual payment of just compensation.&nbsp; Since the prevailing law at the time of payment was already RA 6657, the landowners have the right to be compensated under the new law.&nbsp; As aptly summarized in <i>Landbank of the Philippines v.

Court of Appeals, </i>we ruled that the seizure of the landholding did not take place on the date of effectivity of PD 27 but would take effect on the payment of just compensation.<br><br>Under the factual circumstances of this case, the agrarian reform process is still incomplete as the just compensation to be paid private respondents has yet to be settled.&nbsp; Considering the passage of Republic Act No. 6657 (RA 6657) before the completion of this process, the just compensation should be determined and the process concluded under the said law. x x x"</blockquote><br><br>Unlike the above-cited cases, Livioco's property was acquired and to be paid under only one law, i.e., RA 6657.&nbsp; There is no situation here which requires the Court to choose between the law prevailing at the time of acquisition and the law prevailing at the time of payment.<br><br>Since Livioco's property was acquired under RA 6657 and will be valued under RA 6657, the question regarding the "time of taking" should follow the general rule in expropriation cases where the "time of taking" is the time when the State took possession of the same and deprived the landowner of the use and enjoyment of his property.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Decision in CA-GR SP No. 45486, p. 4; Plaintiff's Formal Offer of Evidence, p. 5.&nbsp; The Court cannot consider September 20, 1991 (the date when LBP informed the Register of Deeds that it has earmarked the amount in favor of Livioco) as the date of taking because there is no indication on record that Livioco's title was cancelled and a new one issued in favor of the Republic on that date.&nbsp; What is clear from the records is the year when CLOAs were awarded, which conclusively shows an actual "taking" of Livioco's property.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> A.
