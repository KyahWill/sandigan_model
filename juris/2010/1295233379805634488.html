Perez, issued a Memorandum adopting and endorsing for approval by this Court the foregoing recommendations of the OCA Audit Team.<br><br>The Court, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 1, 2009, approved and adopted the recommendations of the Court Administrator.<br><br>Pursuant to said Resolution, Presiding Judge Sheila Marie S. Geronimo-Orquillas (Judge Geronimo-Orquillas) informed the Court that she had taken the following actions:&nbsp; 1) she designated as OIC Ms. Belinda E. Salazar (Salazar), Court Stenographer, to assume the duties and responsibilities of the Clerk of Court in view of Banag's preventive suspension; 2) she photocopied certain original official receipts; and 3) she devised means to further enhance the management of judiciary funds in close coordination with the designated Clerk of Court to prevent further violations.<br><br>Galvez filed on June 30, 2009 a Motion for Extension of Time in which she prayed that she be given an extension of at least 15 days from June 30, 2009 or until July 15, 2009 within which to file her answer, as she had to locate other documents for the preparation of the same.&nbsp; The extension was granted by the Court in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 27, 2009.<br><br>On July 21, 2009, Judge Geronimo-Orquillas requested for a detailed and complete listing of properties under the account of the MTC so she may determine and clarify the properties under Banag's accountability and avoid any question that might arise from the outcome of the administrative case.&nbsp; She also informed the Court that she, together with OIC-Clerk of Court Salazar, would conduct an inventory of the properties of the MTC, and thus requested for a representative from the Commission on Audit (COA) to witness the inventory.&nbsp; Also on July 21, 2009, Judge Geronimo-Orquillas asked that a special financial audit and examination of the MTC be conducted by the OCA to determine if there are any additional shortages in Judiciary funds from September 2008 (when the first financial audit was concluded) to June 17, 2009 (when Judge Geronimo-Orquillas received the Resolution dated June 1, 2009 of this Court).<br><br>In compliance with the directive of the Court, Banag submitted her Manifestation and Answer on July 27, 2009.&nbsp; She alleged that on August 27, 2008, prior to the arrival of the OCA Audit Team that same day, she had requested Court Aide Fidelito Viquiera (Viquiera) to deposit the MTC collections amounting to P38,628.00 at the Land Bank of the Philippines, Malolos Branch, Bulacan, which is seven kilometers away from the court.&nbsp; The OCA Audit Team was already at the MTC at around 3:30 to 4:00 p.m. when Viquiera returned to inform Banag that he was not able to deposit the MTC collections.&nbsp; Viquiera encountered heavy flow of traffic on his way to Land Bank and the bank was already closed by the time he got there.&nbsp; Banag denied that she deposited the amount of P38,628.00 on August 28, 2009 only after she was directed to do so by the OCA Audit Team. Banag averred that she failed to deposit the accumulated collections of the MTC for the period of May to August 2008 in the bank due to work overload, time constraint, and multi-tasking she had to contend with everyday.&nbsp; In the meantime, the accumulated collections were kept in the vault.<br><br>Banag further claimed that there was no basis for the finding of the OCA Audit Team of fund shortage amounting to P4,766.40 for the periods of October to December 2001 and February to July 2008, as the same had been deposited in the bank as shown by the attached bank deposit slips.<br><br>As to the undated duplicate/triplicate copies of Official Receipts with serial numbers 8076025, 8076028, 8076030, 8076031, 8076032, 8076033, 8076034 and 8076036, Banag explained that the corresponding amounts were duly accounted for.&nbsp; Because of the heavy caseload of her office, she unintentionally failed to indicate the dates on the receipts.<br><br>Lastly, Banag pointed out that she could not verify the entries in the SUFF and SUSTF and return the said records to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office, OCA, duly signed by the concerned signatories, as these covered the collections for the period 2002 to January 2008 for which Galvez was responsible as OIC-Clerk of Court.<br><br>Professing honest inadvertence and human failure due to the heavy caseload of her office, and seeking humane consideration, Banag prays for the lifting of her preventive suspension.<br><br>In a Motion for Second Extension of Time to Submit Explanation, dated July 15, 2009 and received by the OCA on August 4, 2009, Galvez sought another extension of 30 days within which to comply with the June 1, 2009 Resolution of this Court, as she needed ample time to produce the subject amount corresponding to the alleged shortages and to submit the explanation required pertaining to the alleged tampered machine validation of deposit slips.&nbsp; Said motion was granted by the Court in a Resolution dated October 28, 2009, provided that this would be the last extension.&nbsp; However, up until the resolution of the instant administrative case against her, Galvez has not complied with any of the resolutions of the Court.<br><br>Acting on Judge Geronimo-Orquillas' letter dated July 21, 2009, an OCA Audit Team conducted another field audit in July 2010.&nbsp; As a result of this recent field audit, the OCA Audit Team submitted to Court Administrator Jose Midas P.

Fortaleza,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court stressed the responsibility and accountability of Clerks of Court for the collected legal fees in their custody, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Clerks of court are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts; with regard to the collection of legal fees, they perform a delicate function as judicial officers entrusted with the correct and effective implementation of regulations thereon. Even the undue delay in the remittances of amounts collected by them at the very least constitutes misfeasance. On the other hand, a vital administrative function of a judge is the effective management of his court and this includes control of the conduct of the court's ministerial officers. It should be brought home to both that the safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly administration of justice and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the Circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds."<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Navallo v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court held that an accountable officer may be convicted of malversation even in the absence of direct proof of misappropriation as long as there is evidence of shortage in his accounts which he is unable to explain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Those who work in the judiciary, such as Galvez and Banag, must adhere to high ethical standards to preserve the court's good name and standing. They should be examples of responsibility, competence and efficiency, and they must discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence since they are officers of the court and agents of the law. Indeed, any conduct, act or omission on the part of those who would violate the norm of public accountability and diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary shall not be countenanced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The conduct required of court personnel, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, must always be beyond reproach and circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. As forerunners in the administration of justice, they ought to live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity, considering that their positions primarily involve service to the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Court has already given Galvez more than enough opportunity to be heard.&nbsp; On two occasions, on July 27, 2009 and October 28, 2009, the Court granted Galvez's motions for extension of time to comply with the Resolution dated June 1, 2009 of this Court ordering her to submit her explanation, accounting, and receipts.&nbsp; Still, Galvez failed to submit said explanation during the extended period.&nbsp; Galvez's refusal to face head-on the charges against her is contrary to the principle that the first impulse of an innocent person, when accused of wrongdoing, is to express his/her innocence at the first opportune time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Galvez's silence and non-participation in the present administrative proceedings, despite due notice and directives of this Court for her to submit documents in her defense strongly indicate her guilt.&nbsp; It was only after the second extended period expired that Galvez partially complied with the directives of this Court in its June 1, 2009 Resolution by depositing the amount of P70,000.00 on March 18, 2010 to the Fiduciary Fund Account of the MTC, coursed through OIC-Clerk of Court Salazar.<br><br>On the other hand, the Court finds Banag's explanation unsatisfactory. Heavy caseload and time constraints are not sufficient excuses.&nbsp; These are problems most Clerks of Court all over the country must contend with.&nbsp; It is up to Banag to devise an effective and efficient system for her office so that it can attend to all the administrative matters of the MTC, including the deposit in due time of court collections.<br><br>Given the results of the OCA audit and investigation, Galvez and Banag have evidently failed to live up to the high ethical standards expected of court employees.&nbsp; They violated the trust reposed in them as Clerks of Court and disbursement officers of the judiciary as shown by Galvez's failure to remit the amount of P660,072.35, representing shortages in the JDF, SAJF, STF, FF, Mediation Fund, and COCGF; and for Banag's non-remittance of P240,913.05, representing shortages in the JDF, SAJF, FF, and Mediation Fund.<br><br>In<i> Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao Del Norte,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> we held that the failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds collected by the Municipal Treasurer constitutes gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
