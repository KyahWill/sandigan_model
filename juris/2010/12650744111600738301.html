The parties, however, manifested that they have exhausted their arguments before the CA and, thus, will no longer file any supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The antecedent facts are culled from the records of this case.  Consistent with our ruling in <i>People v. Cabalquinto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and <i>People v.

The trial court found the 38-year old AAA as a credible witness and her testimony candid and truthful despite her "moderate mental retardation" or intellectual quotient of a 7 to 8-year old child.  In contrast, the trial court found that the defenses of denial and alibi of the accused-appellant were flimsy and farfetched.  It further ruled that the child conceived and delivered by AAA was fathered by the accused-appellant.  The dispositive portion of the judgment reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused MARLON ABELLA y BARSAGA guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Rape, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Accused is likewise directed to recognize [xxx] as his illegitimate daughter, and provide for her support as soon as his financial means permit.  Furthermore, he is hereby ordered to pay complainant the sum of P75,000.00 as indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.  With costs de officio.<br><br>Considering that the accused has been undergoing detention during the pendency of the trial of this case, the same is hereby credited in the service of his sentence.</blockquote><br>The decision of the RTC was directly elevated to this Court.  The accused-appellant filed his <i>Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on August 23, 2005 while the plaintiff-appellee filed its <i>Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> on December 19, 2005.  In a <i>Minute Resolution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated February 15, 2006, we transferred this case to the CA for appropriate action conformably with our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The CA summarized the evidence of the parties as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>Dr. Emelito Alegre</b>, a radiologist and sonologist, testified that he had conducted an ultrasound examination on AAA on 10 July 2000.  Through the conduct of the necessary measurements and ultrasound examination, he confirmed AAA's pregnancy.  At the time of the examination, AAA was already 30.7 weeks pregnant.  The testimony of the Municipal health Officer, <b>Dr. Marietta Alcantara</b>, in turn, was dispensed with on account of the admission of the defense of the existence and genuineness of the medical certificate that she had executed in relation to the instant case.<br><br><b>Dr. Imelda Escuadra</b> of the Women and Children Protection Unit of Bicol Medical Center, Naga City, and a specialist in the field of psychiatry testified that AAA was referred to her clinic for examination and evaluation by the Department of Social Work and Development (DSWD).  During the first examination, she noticed that AAA was pregnant, was coughing, but responsive, coherent and relevant with no auditory nor visual hallucinations or delusions shown.  AAA, as she had observed, was not psychotic at the time of the examination.<br><br>Dr. Escuadra added that AAA had recurrent thoughts of the rape incident and the threats to kill her if she would divulge the matter.  It was also observed that AAA was not oriented as regards to persons and dates and that she showed poor grasp of general information.  During the last examination on 24 July 2000, AAA looked depressed and claimed that her baby was moving.<br><br>Dr. Escuadra further testified that AAA's mental ability particularly on the arithmetic aspect was poor, as she could not even count from 1-100.  She concluded that although AAA's chronological age was 38 years old, she manifested a mental age of between 7-8 years old.  AAA's intelligence quotient was only 51, which is classified as moderate mental retardation.  Aside from her mental disadvantage, AAA also suffers from dwarfism being only three (3) feet and eight (8) inches tall.<br><br><b>Corazon Alipante</b>, a psychologist of the Bicol Medical Center who conducted the psychological testing on AAA, confirmed that the latter's mental capacity is functioning within the moderate mental retardation level with an average intelligent quotient of 51 and that her perception of reality is impaired.<br><br><b>AAA</b> testified that she knew the appellant personally since he was a child because they lived in the same neighborhood.  She narrated that sometime at around 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon while she was alone at home the appellant entered their house and started molesting her.  Appellant pulled down her shorts with his left hand while covering her mouth with his right hand.  Appellant then placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina.  At that time, she did not shout as the appellant was holding a knife.  AAA recalled that when appellant inserted his penis into her vagina, she had felt pain.  Afraid for her life, she did not tell her parents about the rape incident.<br><br>Continuing with her narration, AAA stated that several months after the incident, her stomach became big.  Thinking that she was just ill, she drank some bitter solution upon her mother's instruction.  As her stomach continued to grow, AAA was forced to tell her mother about the rape incident.  Thereafter, AAA consulted a doctor who confirmed that she was pregnant. Consequently she gave birth to a baby girl.<br><br><b>BBB</b>, AAA's mother, on the other hand, testified that the appellant is the cousin of her husband.  She claimed that she noticed her daughter becoming pale and thinner. She also noticed that AAA's stomach was getting bigger and thus decided to bring her to a doctor, who in turn informed her that her daughter might be pregnant.  An ultrasound examination confirmed that AAA was indeed pregnant. BBB then asked her daughter who was responsible for her pregnancy, AAA replied that it was the appellant.<br><br>BBB further claimed that prior to the confirmation of the pregnancy, the appellant had given her some mahogany seeds which he said AAA should take so that she will have her menstruation.  But since the mahogany seeds made AAA weaker, BBB discontinued it and decided to consult a doctor instead.  Upon learning that it was the appellant who had raped her daughter, BBB immediately reported the matter to the Municipal Hall of Pamplona.  Thereafter, the appellant was arrested.<br><br>BBB also testified that appellant's parents had tried to settle the case by offering the sum of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00).  They however declined said offer, as it was not even commensurate to the expenses they have already spent for their daughter and her child.  AAA gave birth to a baby girl on 16 August [2000] but the appellant and his family had never given them any financial support.<br><br>Aside from the testimony of the <b>[accused]-appellant</b>, the defense also called <b>Danilo Abella</b>, appellant's father, to the stand.  Both testimonies were principally anchored on denial, and attributed that the filing of this case against the accused was ill motivated and was due to the bad blood and personal animosities between their family and that of the complainant. Appellant contends that a certain Mang Ben, a construction worker of the China Geo, was the one responsible in impregnating the complainant.</blockquote><br>After its review of the evidence, the CA agreed with the findings of the RTC and affirmed the conviction of the accused-appellant.  However, as prayed for by the plaintiff-appellee, the appellate court deleted the award of exemplary damages in favor of AAA for lack of basis, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the assailed Decision is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the award for exemplary damages is DELETED.  No costs.</blockquote><br>The accused-appellant did not move for the reconsideration of the appellate court's judgment.  He instead elevated for review his conviction before us.<br><br>Accused-appellant reiterates the issues and arguments he has raised before the courts below as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>The trial court gravely erred in failing to consider the motive behind the filing of the instant case against the accused-appellant.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>The court a quo gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant of the crime charged although his actual participation in the alleged act was not proven with certainty.</blockquote><br>Accused-appellant asserts that he should be acquitted of the crime charged.  AAA allegedly testified unsurely as to the identity of her assailant and that she testified incoherently as to the details surrounding the rape incident.  Accused-appellant points out that AAA mentioned that she was raped by a certain <i>Mang Ben</i>.  AAA then testified that the accused-appellant was holding a knife while her pants were being pulled by him with his left hand and her mouth being covered with his right hand.  She also allegedly said that the accused-appellant opened his knife when he was about to molest her but he left after opening the knife.<br><br>Accused-appellant insists that AAA was coached to testify against him in furtherance of the hostility between their families.  He claims that AAA's mental disability made her so subservient to her parents that she would believe everything that they tell her.  He further argues that the alleged P20,000.00 offer of accused-appellant's family to settle this criminal case happened before this case was actually filed which proves that the said offer was either concocted by AAA's family or they were extorting money.<br><br>The plaintiff-appellee maintains that the prosecution has proven the guilt of the accused-appellant of the crime charged.  AAA allegedly testified clearly and convincingly that she was raped by accused-appellant.  The plaintiff-appellee points out that AAA clarified on the witness stand that it was accused-appellant, and not <i>Mang Ben</i>, who raped her; that she did not say that the accused-appellant simultaneously pointed a knife at her, covered her mouth, and pulled down her pants - she rather testified that, after her mouth was covered and pants pulled down, the accused-appellant forced her to lay down and then drew a knife; and that AAA said that the accused-appellant left after raping her.  Assuming there were inconsistencies in AAA's testimony, the same pertain to insignificant details which rather support, not destroy, her credibility.<br><br>The plaintiff-appellee claims that the contention that the crime charged against the accused-appellant was prompted by revenge or ill-motive on the part of AAA's family was baseless and that the mental disability of AAA did not affect her credibility and veracity of her testimony. The psychiatric evaluation of AAA allegedly proves that she was generally "coherent and relevant" and that her extensive examination on the witness stand shows that she could distinguish good from bad and truth from lies.<br><br>We affirm the conviction of the accused-appellant.<br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code provides that the crime of rape is committed by a man having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (1) through force, threat or intimidation; (2) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; (3) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and (4) when the offended party is under 12 years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. In <i>People v. Andaya</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> it was held that "sexual intercourse with a woman who is a mental retardate with the mental age of a child below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape" with or without the attendance of force, threat, or intimidation.<br><br>In the case before us, the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA, a demented person, through force, threat or intimidation.  AAA was psychiatrically evaluated as an adult woman with the mental age of a 7 to 8-year old child and that she gave birth to a child despite her mental inability to give her consent to a sexual relationship.  These facts support the allegation of sexual abuse.  AAA also identified without uncertainty the accused-appellant as her attacker and related distinctly that he forcibly laid her down, held her at knifepoint, and sexually abused her.  She testified on direct examination as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

Santos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this policy has been emphasized as follows:<br><br><blockquote>We stress the well-settled doctrine that the lower court's assessment of the credibility of a witness is accorded great respect owing to its direct opportunity to observe the latter's demeanor during trial. In <i>People v. Ayuda</i>, we held:<br><br><blockquote>"<b>It is doctrinally settled that the factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of the rape victim, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.</b>  This is so because the trial court has the advantage of observing the victim through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion, the sudden pallor of a discovered lie, the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer, the forthright tone of a ready reply, the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, or the carriage and mien. ..." [Emphasis ours]</blockquote></blockquote><br>The foregoing doctrine is more stringently applied if the trial court is sustained by the appellate court.<br><br>It has been stressed, moreover, that the bare denials and uncorroborated alibis of an accused cannot overcome the positive identification of the accused and straightforward recounting of the accused's commission of a crime.  In <i>People v. Nieto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>It is an established jurisprudential rule that a mere denial, without any strong evidence to support it, can scarcely overcome the positive declaration by the victim of the identity and involvement of appellant in the crimes attributed to him. The defense of <i>alibi</i> is likewise unavailing.  <i>Firstly</i>, <i>alibi</i> is the weakest of all defenses, because it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.  Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law.  <i>Secondly</i>, <i>alibi</i> is unacceptable when there is a positive identification of the accused by a credible witness.  <i>Lastly</i>, in order that alibi might prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused has been somewhere else during the commission of the crime; it must also be shown that it would have been impossible for him to be anywhere within the vicinity of the crime scene.</blockquote><br>In the present case, we do not perceive any cogent reason to justify the reversal of the trial and appellate courts' high regard of the truthfulness of AAA's testimony and we find the bare denials and uncorroborated alibis of the accused-appellant devoid of any evidentiary value.  We quote with approval the pertinent disquisitions of the trial court on the testimonies of the witnesses as follows:<br><br><blockquote>By the very nature of the crime of rape, the same precludes any eyewitness to the incident, except the victim and the perpetrator.  Hence, to prove the same will depend largely from the testimony of the victim, and the acquittal of the accused will not lie on the strength of his defense.  Thus, the case for the prosecution will rise or fall on the basis of the victim's testimony, which the court will consider with utmost caution.<br><br>In the instant case, victim AAA was a mental retardate, which the court finds, not only on the basis of the expert testimony of Dr. Escuadra but also on the basis of its observations.  It noted that even if the victim had a mental age of a 7 to 8 year-old child, yet, she was candid, sincere, straightforward and simple in her testimony in court despite the grueling cross-examination conducted by Atty. Manlangit.  The aforesaid demeanor of the complainant only showed that she was telling the truth.  Complainant never wavered in her testimony, that it was Marlon who raped her, the circumstances or details under which she was raped; and in positively identifying Marlon in court.  The court likewise noted the limited mental ability and poor aptitude of the complainant when she was extensively grilled and cross-examined, and even upon clarificatory questions from the court, thus giving the impression to the court that she was just being obedient and was coached by her parents in filing this instant case against Marlon.  She likewise admitted that a certain Mang Ben also raped her, but, later corrected herself. Such was understandable.  Even Atty. Manlangit noted that the victim was already tired and exhausted while testifying in court. (TSN, p. 43, Sept. 24, 2002)  Besides, there was no testimony from the complainant that she was merely instructed by her parents to file the rape case against Marlon even if the same were not true. The court considered the inconsistencies in complainant's testimony as minor inconsistencies which even strengthen her testimony.  Xxx xxx xxx</blockquote><br>The Court notes that the appellate court's own evaluation of the evidence concurred with the findings and conclusions of the trial court as follows:<br><br><blockquote>We likewise find no merit in the insinuations made by the [accused]-appellant that the instant complaint was motivated by the malevolent design of the complainant's family to put him down or the greedy scheme of the latter to extort money from his family.  At best, these insinuations, trivial and inane, are merely conclusory and unfounded. It cannot tarnish AAA's account of how the [accused]-appellant had sexually assaulted her.<br><br>As aptly observed by the court a quo, it is hard to fathom that a parent would use her children as engines of malice, especially if the same would subject them to humiliation, nay stigma.  No mother would expose her child to possible public ridicule if the only motive is to get back at the [accused]-appellant.  Said the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>"Marlon and his father, Danilo, attributed ill-will, personal animosities and bad blood between their family and that of the complainant as the reasons behind why a fabricated case was filed against Marlon.  It is incomprehensible to the mind of the court that because at one time or another Marlon chased complainant's father with a hoe, or the complainant's brothers unlawfully entered the premises of the accused, or that they peeped or pried upon Marlon's privacy, causing the latter to chase them with a bolo as the reasons why, out of revenge, a rape case was concocted and filed against him.  Such are flimsy excuses, which do not deserve belief from any reasonable being.  This Court could not, in the exercise of sound judgment, accept the flimsy reasons advanced by the accused that the victim, a mental retardate, was only coached by her parents in implicating the accused as the person responsible for the crime.  A mother will never compromise the reputation of her daughter in order to implicate a person with a crime he did not commit.  Besides, it was quite absurd and illogical that families in feud would make their mental retardate a tool to give a scripted and concocted testimony in court that she was raped just to send her family's enemy to jail. It is unnatural for a parent to use his offspring as an engine of malice especially if it will subject a daughter to embarrassment and even stigma.  No parent in their right mind would possibly stoop so low as to subject their daughter to the hardship and shame concomitant to a rape just to assuage their own hurt feelings." [Citations omitted]</blockquote></blockquote><br>The criminal information failed to allege the qualifying circumstance that the accused-appellant knew of the mental disability of the private offended party, thus, his conviction of statutory or simple rape committed with the use of a deadly weapon, instead of qualified rape, is in order.<br><br>We also accord high respect to the ruling of the trial court, as well as to the appellate court's deference thereto, that the accused-appellant was the biological father of the two-year old daughter of AAA as a result of the rape incident and in view of their "striking facial similarities and features."  The order to acknowledge and support accused-appellant's offspring is in accordance with Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>This Court, however, modifies the award of civil indemnity and damages in favor of AAA.  In line with recent case laws, the compensation to be awarded in favor of the private offended party in cases of statutory rape or simple rape committed with the use of a deadly weapon should be in the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P75,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  Exemplary or corrective damages are imposed by way of example or correction for the public good and when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  According to current jurisprudence, exemplary damages should be awarded in favor of the private offended party in the amount of P30,000.00 in statutory or simple rape cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  In the present case, the award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P75,000.00 as moral damages in favor of AAA is appropriate.
