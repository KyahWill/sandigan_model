According to the CTA, the CIR himself admitted that the export sales of Toshiba were subject to zero percent (0%) VAT based on Section 100(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended. Toshiba could then claim tax credit or refund of input VAT paid on its purchases of goods, properties, or services, directly attributable to such zero-rated sales, in accordance with Section 4.102-2 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.

The CIR invoked the following statutory and regulatory provisions -<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <br></div><br><blockquote>SECTION 24.  <i>Exemption from Taxes Under the National Internal Revenue Code</i>. - Any provision of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed on business establishments operating within the ECOZONE.  In lieu of paying taxes, five percent (5%) of the gross income earned by all businesses and enterprises within the ECOZONE shall be remitted to the national government. x x x.<br></blockquote><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Section 103(q) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended </b><br></div><br><blockquote>Sec. 103.  <i>Exempt transactions</i>. - The following shall be exempt from the value-added tax:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(q)  Transactions which are exempt under special laws, except those granted under Presidential Decree Nos. 66, 529, 972, 1491, and 1950, and non-electric cooperatives under Republic Act No. 6938, or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory.</blockquote><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Section 4.103-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95</b><br></div><br><blockquote>SEC. 4.103-1.  <i>Exemptions.</i>  - (A) <i>In general.</i> - An exemption means that the sale of goods or properties and/or services and the use or lease of properties is not subject to VAT (output tax) and the seller is not allowed any tax credit on VAT (input tax) previously paid.<br><br>The person making the exempt sale of goods, properties or services shall not bill any output tax to his customers because the said transaction is not subject to VAT.  On the other hand, a VAT-registered purchaser of VAT-exempt goods, properties or services which are exempt from VAT is not entitled to any input tax on such purchase despite the issuance of a VAT invoice or receipt.</blockquote><br>The CIR contended that under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916, a special law, all businesses and establishments within the ECOZONE were to remit to the government five percent (5%) of their gross income earned within the zone, in lieu of all taxes, including VAT.  This placed Toshiba within the ambit of Section 103(q) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended, which exempted from VAT the transactions that were exempted under special laws.  Following Section 4.103-1(A) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, the VAT-exemption of Toshiba meant that its sale of goods was not subject to output VAT and Toshiba as seller was not allowed any tax credit on the input VAT it had previously paid.<br><br>On January 17, 2001, the CTA issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> denying both Motions for Reconsideration of Toshiba and the CIR.<br><br>The CTA took note that the pieces of evidence referred to by Toshiba in its Motion for Reconsideration were insufficient substantiation, being mere schedules of input VAT payments it had purportedly paid for the first and second quarters of 1997.  While the CTA gives credence to the report of its commissioned certified public accountant (CPA), it does not render its decision based on the findings of the said CPA alone.  The CTA has its own CPA and the tax court itself conducts an investigation/examination of the documents presented.  The CTA stood by its earlier disallowance of the amount of P1,887,545.65 as tax credit/refund because it was not supported by VAT invoices and/or official receipts.<br><br>The CTA refused to consider the argument that Toshiba was not entitled to a tax credit/refund under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916 because it was only raised by the CIR for the first time in his Motion for Reconsideration.  Also, contrary to the assertions of the CIR, the CTA held that Section 23, and not Section 24, of Republic Act No. 7916, applied to Toshiba.  According to Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7916 -<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 23.  <i>Fiscal Incentives.</i>  - Business establishments operating within the ECOZONES shall be entitled to the fiscal incentives as provided for under Presidential Decree No. 66, the law creating the Export Processing Zone Authority, or those provided under Book VI of Executive Order No. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987.<br><br>Furthermore, tax credits for exporters using local materials as inputs shall enjoy the benefits provided for in the Export Development Act of 1994.<br></blockquote><br>Among the fiscal incentives granted to PEZA-registered enterprises by the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 was the income tax holiday, to wit -<br><br><blockquote>Art. 39. <i>Incentives to Registered Enterprises.</i> - All registered enterprises shall be granted the following incentives to the extent engaged in a preferred area of investment: <br> <br>(a) <i>Income Tax Holiday</i>. --<br><br>(1) For six (6) years from commercial operation for pioneer firms and four (4) years for non-pioneer firms, new registered firms shall be fully exempt from income taxes levied by the national government.  Subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by the Board, the income tax exemption will be extended for another year in each of the following cases:<br><br>(i) The project meets the prescribed ratio of capital equipment to number of workers set by the Board;<br><br>(ii) Utilization of indigenous raw materials at rates set by the Board;<br><br>(iii) The net foreign exchange savings or earnings amount to at least US$500,000.00 annually during the first three (3) years of operation.<br><br>The preceding paragraph notwithstanding, no registered pioneer firm may avail of this incentive for a period exceeding eight (8) years.<br><br>(2) For a period of three (3) years from commercial operation, registered expanding firms shall be entitled to an exemption from income taxes levied by the National Government proportionate to their expansion under such terms and conditions as the Board may determine: <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, That during the period within which this incentive is availed of by the expanding firm it shall not be entitled to additional deduction for incremental labor expense.<br><br>(3) The provision of Article 7(14) notwithstanding, registered firms shall not be entitled to any extension of this incentive.</blockquote><br>The CTA pointed out that Toshiba availed itself of the income tax holiday under the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987, so Toshiba was exempt only from income tax but not from other taxes such as VAT.  As a result, Toshiba was liable for output VAT on its export sales, but at zero percent (0%) rate, and entitled to the credit/refund of the input VAT paid on its purchases of goods and services relative to such zero-rated export sales.<br><br>Unsatisfied, the CIR filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 63047.<br><br>In its Decision dated August 29, 2002, the Court of Appeals granted the appeal of the CIR, and reversed and set aside the Decision dated October 16, 2000 and the Resolution dated January 17, 2001 of the CTA.  The appellate court ruled that Toshiba was not entitled to the refund of its alleged unused input VAT payments because it was a tax-exempt entity under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916.  As a PEZA-registered corporation, Toshiba was liable for remitting to the national government the five percent (5%) preferential rate on its gross income earned within the ECOZONE, in lieu of all other national and local taxes, including VAT.<br><br>The Court of Appeals further adjudged that the export sales of Toshiba were VAT-exempt, not zero-rated, transactions. The appellate court found that the Answer filed by the CIR in CTA Case No. 5762 did not contain any admission that the export sales of Toshiba were zero-rated transactions under Section 100(a)(2)(A) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended.  At the least, what was admitted by the CIR in said Answer was that the Tax Code provisions cited in the Petition for Review of Toshiba in CTA Case No. 5762 were correct.  As to the Joint Stipulation of Facts and Issues filed by the parties in CTA Case No. 5762, which stated that Toshiba was subject to zero percent (0%) VAT on its export sales, the appellate court declared that the CIR signed the said pleading through palpable mistake.  This palpable mistake in the stipulation of facts should not be taken against the CIR, for to do otherwise would result in suppressing the truth through falsehood. In addition, the State could not be put in estoppel by the mistakes or errors of its officials or agents.<br><br>Given that Toshiba was a tax-exempt entity under Republic Act No. 7916, a special law, the Court of Appeals concluded that the export sales of Toshiba were VAT-exempt transactions under Section 109(q) of the Tax Code of 1997, formerly Section 103(q) of the Tax Code of 1977. Therefore, Toshiba could not claim refund of its input VAT payments on its domestic purchases of goods and services.<br><br>The Court of Appeals decreed at the end of its August 29, 2002 Decision -<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA Case No. 5762, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one is hereby rendered finding [Toshiba], being a tax exempt entity under R.A. No. 7916, not entitled to refund the VAT payments made in its domestic purchases of goods and services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Toshiba filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the aforementioned Decision, anchored on the following arguments: (a) the CIR never raised as an issue before the CTA that Toshiba was tax-exempt under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916; (b) Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916, subjecting the gross income earned by a PEZA-registered enterprise within the ECOZONE to a preferential rate of five percent (5%), in lieu of all taxes, did not apply to Toshiba, which availed itself of the income tax holiday under Section 23 of the same statute; (c) the conclusion of the CTA that the export sales of Toshiba were zero-rated was supported by substantial evidence, other than the admission of the CIR in the Joint Stipulation of Facts and Issues; and (d) the judgment of the CTA granting the refund of the input VAT payments was supported by substantial evidence and should not have been set aside by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In a Resolution dated February 19, 2003, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Reconsideration of Toshiba since the arguments presented therein were mere reiterations of those already passed upon and found to be without merit by the appellate court in its earlier Decision.  The Court of Appeals, however, mentioned that it was incorrect for Toshiba to say that the issue of the applicability of Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916 was only raised for the first time on appeal before the appellate court.  The said issue was adequately raised by the CIR in his Motion for Reconsideration before the CTA, and was even ruled upon by the tax court.<br><br>Hence, Toshiba filed the instant Petition for Review with the following assignment of errors -<br><br><blockquote>5.1 THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT [TOSHIBA], BEING A PEZA-REGISTERED ENTERPRISE, IS EXEMPT FROM VAT UNDER SECTION 24 OF R.A. 7916, AND FURTHER HOLDING THAT [TOSHIBA'S] EXPORT SALES ARE EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS UNDER SECTION 109 OF THE TAX CODE.<br><br>5.2 THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO DISMISS OUTRIGHT AND GAVE DUE COURSE TO [CIR'S] PETITION NOTWITHSTANDING [CIR'S] FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY RAISE IN ISSUE DURING THE TRIAL IN THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS THE APPLICABILITY OF SECTION 24 OF R.A. 7916 TO [TOSHIBA'S] CLAIM FOR REFUND.<br><br>5.3 THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN [IT] RULED THAT THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS' FINDINGS, WITH REGARD [TOSHIBA'S] EXPORT SALES BEING ZERO RATED SALES FOR VAT PURPOSES, WERE BASED MERELY ON THE ADMISSIONS MADE BY [CIR'S] COUNSEL AND NOT SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.<br><br>5.4 THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT REVERSED THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS GRANTING [TOSHIBA'S] CLAIM FOR REFUND[;]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>and the following prayer -<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, Petitioner TOSHIBA INFORMATION EQUIPMENT (PHILS.), INC. most respectfully prays that the decision and resolution of the Honorable Court of Appeals, reversing the decision of the CTA in CTA Case No. 5762, be set aside and further prays that a new one be rendered AFFIRMING AND UPHOLDING the Decision of the CTA promulgated on October 16, 2000 in CTA Case No. 5762.<br><br>Other reliefs, which the Honorable Court may deem just and equitable under the circumstances, are likewise prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>The Petition is impressed with merit.<br><br><b><i>The CIR did not timely raise before<br> the CTA the issues on the VAT-<br>exemptions of Toshiba and its export<br> sales.</i></b><br><br>Upon the failure of the CIR to timely plead and prove before the CTA the defenses or objections that Toshiba was VAT-exempt under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7916, and that its export sales were VAT-exempt transactions under Section 103(q) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended, the CIR is deemed to have waived the same.<br><br>During the pendency of CTA Case No. 5762, the proceedings before the CTA were governed by the Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> while the Rules of Court were applied suppletorily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Rule 9, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.  <i>Defenses and objections not pleaded.</i> - Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived.

The Pre-Trial Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of the CIR was equally bereft of such allegations or arguments.

The liberal interpretation and application of rules apply only in proper cases of demonstrable merit and under justifiable causes and circumstances.  While it is true that litigation is not a game of technicalities, it is equally true that every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure to ensure an orderly and speedy administration of justice.

The CIR began to aver the existence of a palpable mistake only after the Court of Appeals made such a declaration in its Decision dated August 29, 2002.<br><br>Despite the absence of allegation and evidence by the CIR, the Court of Appeals, on its own, concluded that the admissions of the CIR in the Joint Stipulation were due to a palpable mistake based on the following deduction -<br><br><blockquote>Scrutinizing the Answer filed by [the CIR], we rule that the Joint Stipulation of Facts and Issues signed by [the CIR] was made through palpable mistake.  Quoting paragraph 4 of its Answer, [the CIR] states:<br><br><blockquote>"4.

The appellate court failed to appreciate that the CIR, through counsel, Atty. Biazon, also signed the Joint Stipulation; and that absent evidence to the contrary, Atty.

It was submitted by the parties after the pre-trial conference held by the CTA, and subsequently approved by the tax court.  If there was any discrepancy between the admissions of the CIR in his Answer and in the Joint Stipulation, the more logical and reasonable explanation would be that the CIR changed his mind or conceded some points to Toshiba during the pre-trial conference which immediately preceded the execution of the Joint Stipulation.  To automatically construe that the discrepancy was the result of a palpable mistake is a wide leap which this Court is not prepared to take without substantial basis.<br><br><b><i>The judicial admissions of the CIR<br> in the Joint Stipulation are not <br>intrinsically false, wrong, or illegal, <br>and are consistent with the ruling on<br> the VAT treatment of PEZA-<br>registered enterprises in the<br> previous Toshiba case.</i></b><br><br>There is no basis for believing that to bind the CIR to his judicial admissions in the Joint Stipulation - that Toshiba was a VAT-registered entity and its export sales were zero-rated VAT transactions - would result in "falsehood, unfairness and injustice."

The Court explained in the <i>Toshiba case</i> that -<br><br><blockquote>PEZA-registered enterprise, which would necessarily be located within ECOZONES, are VAT-exempt entities, not because of Section 24 of Rep. Act No. 7916, as amended, which imposes the five percent (5%) preferential tax rate on gross income of PEZA-registered enterprises, in lieu of all taxes; but, rather, because of Section 8 of the same statute which establishes the fiction that ECOZONES are foreign territory.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Philippine VAT system adheres to the Cross Border Doctrine, according to which, no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority.

Of particular interest to the present Petition is Section 3 thereof, which reads -<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 3.  <b>Tax Treatment of Sales Made by a VAT Registered Supplier from the Customs Territory, to a PEZA Registered Enterprise.</b> -<br><br>(1) If the Buyer is a PEZA registered enterprise which is subject to the 5% special tax regime, in lieu of all taxes, except real property tax, pursuant to R.A.

Accordingly, all sales of goods or property to such enterprise made by a VAT registered supplier from the Customs Territory shall be treated subject to 0% VAT, pursuant to Sec. 106(A)(2)(a)(5), NIRC, in relation to ART. 77(2) of the Omnibus Investments Code, while all sales of services to the said enterprises, made by VAT registered suppliers from the Customs Territory, shall be treated effectively subject to the 0% VAT, pursuant to Section 108(B)(3), NIRC, in relation to the provisions of R.A. No. 7916 and the "Cross Border Doctrine" of the VAT system.<br><br>This Circular shall serve as a sufficient basis to entitle such supplier of goods, property or services to the benefit of the zero percent (0%) VAT for sales made to the aforementioned ECOZONE enterprises and shall serve as sufficient compliance to the requirement for prior approval of zero-rating imposed by Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 effective as of the date of the issuance of this Circular.<br><br>Indubitably, no output VAT may be passed on to an ECOZONE enterprise since it is a VAT-exempt entity.x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br>The Court, nevertheless, noted in the <i>Toshiba case</i> that the rule which considers any sale by a supplier from the Customs Territory to a PEZA-registered enterprise as export sale, which should not be burdened by output VAT, was only clearly established on <b>October 15, 1999</b>, upon the issuance by the BIR of <b>RMC No. 74-99</b>.  Prior to October 15, 1999, whether a PEZA-registered enterprise was exempt or subject to VAT depended on the type of fiscal incentives availed of by the said enterprise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  The old rule, then followed by the BIR, and recognized and affirmed by the CTA, the Court of Appeals, and this Court, was described as follows -<br><br><blockquote>According to the old rule, Section 23 of Rep. Act No. 7916, as amended, gives the PEZA-registered enterprise the option to choose between two sets of fiscal incentives: (a) The five percent (5%) preferential tax rate on its gross income under Rep. Act No. 7916, as amended; and (b) the income tax holiday provided under Executive Order No. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987, as amended.<br><br>The five percent (5%) preferential tax rate on gross income under Rep. Act No. 7916, as amended, is in lieu of all taxes. Except for real property taxes, no other national or local tax may be imposed on a PEZA-registered enterprise availing of this particular fiscal incentive, not even an indirect tax like VAT.<br><br>Alternatively, Book VI of Exec. Order No. 226, as amended, grants income tax holiday to registered pioneer and non-pioneer enterprises for six-year and four-year periods, respectively.  Those availing of this incentive are exempt only from income tax, but shall be subject to all other taxes, including the ten percent (10%) VAT.<br><br>This old rule clearly did not take into consideration the Cross Border Doctrine essential to the VAT system or the fiction of the ECOZONE as a foreign territory. It relied totally on the choice of fiscal incentives of the PEZA-registered enterprise. Again, for emphasis, the old VAT rule for PEZA-registered enterprises was based on their choice of fiscal incentives: (1) If the PEZA-registered enterprise chose the five percent (5%) preferential tax on its gross income, in lieu of all taxes, as provided by Rep. Act No. 7916, as amended, then it would be VAT-exempt; (2) If the PEZA-registered enterprise availed of the income tax holiday under Exec. Order No. 226, as amended, it shall be subject to VAT at ten percent (10%). Such distinction was abolished by RMC No. 74-99, which categorically declared that all sales of goods, properties, and services made by a VAT-registered supplier from the Customs Territory to an ECOZONE enterprise shall be subject to VAT, at zero percent (0%) rate, regardless of the latter's type or class of PEZA registration; and, thus, affirming the nature of a PEZA-registered or an ECOZONE enterprise as a VAT-exempt entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>To recall, Toshiba is herein claiming the refund of unutilized input VAT payments on its local purchases of goods and services attributable to its export sales for the <b>first and second quarters of 1997</b>.  Such export sales took place <b>before October 15, 1999</b>, when the old rule on the VAT treatment of PEZA-registered enterprises still applied.  Under this old rule, it was not only possible, but even acceptable, for Toshiba, availing itself of the income tax holiday option under Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7916, in relation to Section 39 of the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987, to be subject to VAT, both indirectly (as purchaser to whom the seller shifts the VAT burden) and directly (as seller whose sales were subject to VAT, either at ten percent [10%] or zero percent [0%]).<br><br>A VAT-registered seller of goods and/or services who made zero-rated sales can claim tax credit or refund of the input VAT paid on its purchases of goods, properties, or services relative to such zero-rated sales, in accordance with Section 4.102-2 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, which provides -   <br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4.102-2. <i>Zero-rating</i>. - (a) <i>In general</i>. - A zero-rated sale by a VAT-registered person, which is a taxable transaction for VAT purposes, shall not result in any output tax. However, the input tax on his purchases of goods, properties or services related to such zero-rated sale shall be available as tax credit or refund in accordance with these regulations.</blockquote><br>The BIR, as late as July 15, 2003, when it issued RMC No. 42-2003, accepted applications for credit/refund of input VAT on purchases prior to RMC No. 74-99, filed by PEZA-registered enterprises which availed themselves of the income tax holiday.  The BIR answered Question Q-5(1) of RMC No. 42-2003 in this wise -<br><br><blockquote>Q-5:Under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 74-99, purchases by PEZA-registered firms automatically qualify as zero-rated without seeking prior approval from the BIR effective October 1999.<br><br>1) Will the OSS-DOF Center <b>still accept applications from PEZA-registered claimants</b> who were allegedly billed VAT by their suppliers before and during the effectivity of the RMC by issuing VAT invoices/receipts?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>A-5(1):If the PEZA-registered enterprise is paying the 5% preferential tax in lieu of all other taxes, the said PEZA-registered taxpayer cannot claim TCC or refund for the VAT paid on purchases.

RMC No. 42-2003 contains an express acknowledgement by the BIR that prior to RMC No. 74-99, there were PEZA-registered enterprises liable for VAT and entitled to credit/refund of input VAT paid under certain conditions.<br><br>This Court already rejected in the <i>Toshiba case</i> the argument that sale transactions of a PEZA-registered enterprise were VAT-exempt under Section 103(q) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended, ratiocinating that -<br><br><blockquote>Section 103(q) of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended, relied upon by petitioner CIR, relates to VAT-exempt transactions. These are transactions exempted from VAT by special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory.

Thus, during trial, Toshiba concentrated on presenting evidence to establish that it incurred P3,875,139.65 of input VAT for the first and second quarters of 1997 which were directly attributable to its export sales; that said amount of input VAT were not carried over to the succeeding quarters; that said amount of input VAT has not been applied or offset against any output VAT liability; and that said amount of input VAT was properly substantiated by official receipts and invoices.<br><br>After what truly appears to be an exhaustive review of the evidence presented by Toshiba, the CTA made the following findings -<br><br>(1)  The amended quarterly VAT returns of Toshiba for 1997 showed that it made no other sales, except zero-rated export sales, for the entire year, in the sum of P2,083,305,000.00 for the first quarter and P5,411,372,000.00 for the second quarter.  That being the case, all input VAT allegedly incurred by Toshiba for the first two quarters of 1997, in the amount of P3,875,139.65, was directly attributable to its zero-rated sales for the same period.<br><br>(2)  Toshiba did carry-over the P3,875,139.65 input VAT it reportedly incurred during the first two quarters of 1997 to succeeding quarters, until the first quarter of 1999.  Despite the carry-over of the subject input VAT of P3,875,139.65, the claim of Toshiba was not affected because it later on deducted the said amount as "VAT Refund/TCC Claimed" from its total available input VAT of P6,841,468.17 for the first quarter of 1999.<br><br>(3)  Still, the CTA could not allow the credit/refund of the total input VAT of P3,875,139.65 being claimed by Toshiba because not all of said amount was actually incurred by the company and duly substantiated by invoices and official receipts.  From the <b>P3,875,139.65</b> claim, the CTA <b>deducted</b> the amounts of (a) <b>P189,692.92</b>, which was in excess of the P3,685,446.23 input VAT Toshiba originally claimed in its application for credit/refund filed with the DOF One-Stop Shop; (b) <b>P396,882.58</b>, which SGV &amp; Co., the commissioned CPA, disallowed for being improperly substantiated, <i>i.e.</i>, supported only by provisional acknowledgement receipts, or by documents other than official receipts, or not supported by TIN or TIN VAT or by any document at all; (c) <b>P1,887,545.65</b>, which the CTA itself verified as not being substantiated in accordance with Section 4.104-5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, in relation to Sections 108<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and 238<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of the Tax Code of 1977, as amended; and (d) <b>P15,736.42</b>, which Toshiba already applied to its output VAT liability for the fourth quarter of 1998.<br><br>(4)  Ultimately, Toshiba was entitled to the credit/refund of unutilized input VAT payments attributable to its zero-rated sales in the amounts of P1,158,016.82 and P227,265.26, for the first and second quarters of 1997, respectively, or in the total amount of <b>P1,385,282.08</b>.<br><br>Since the aforementioned findings of fact of the CTA are borne by substantial evidence on record, unrefuted by the CIR, and untouched by the Court of Appeals, they are given utmost respect by this Court.<br><br>The Court will not lightly set aside the conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its functions, is dedicated exclusively to the resolution of tax problems and has accordingly developed an expertise on the subject unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>  In <i>Barcelon, Roxas Securities, Inc.

Such findings can only be disturbed on appeal if they are not supported by substantial evidence or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the Tax Court.
