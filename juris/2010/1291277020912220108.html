				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Tan Tiong Bio (respondent) had fully paid the installment payments of a 683-square-meter lot in the Manila Southwoods Residential Estates, a project of Fil-Estate Golf &amp; Development, Inc. (Fil-Estate) in Carmona, Cavite, but Fil-Estate failed to deliver to him the title covering the lot, despite repeated demands.&nbsp; Fil-Estate also failed to heed the demand for the refund of the purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Respondent, later learning that the lot "sold" to him was inexistent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed a complaint for Estafa against Fil-Estate officials including its Corporate Secretary Atty. Alice Odchigue-Bondoc (petitioner) and other employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In her Counter-Affidavit, petitioner alleged that, <i>inter alia,</i><br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>5.&nbsp; I had no participation at all in the acts or transactions alleged in the Complaint-Affidavit. As a Corporate Secretary, I have never been involved in the management and day-to-day operations of [Fil-Estate]. x x x<br><br>x x x x.<br><br>7.&nbsp; x x x. [Herein respondent] alleges:<br><br>"<b>The letter showed that the request was approved by [herein petitioner]</b>, provided that the transfer fee was paid, and that there be payment of full downpayment, with the balance payable in two years."<br><br>8)&nbsp;&nbsp; The handwritten approval and endorsement, however, are not mine.&nbsp; <b><u>I have never transacted, either directly or indirectly</u>, with</b> Mrs. Ona or <b>[<u>herein respondent</u>]</b>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (emphasis partly in the original, partly supplied; underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>On the basis of petitioner's above-quoted allegations in her Counter-Affidavit, respondent filed a complaint for Perjury against petitioner, docketed as I.S. No. PSG 03-07-11855 before the Pasig City Prosecutor's Office, which dismissed it by Resolution of June 17, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for insufficiency of evidence, and denied respondent's Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On petition for review, the Department of Justice (DOJ), by Resolution of July 20, 2005 signed by the Chief State Prosecutor for the Secretary of Justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>motu proprio </i>dismissed the petition on finding that there was no showing of any reversible error, following <b>Section 12(c) of Department Circular No. 70 dated July 3, 2000 (National Prosecution Service [NPS] Rule on Appeal).&nbsp; </b><br><br>Respondent's motion for reconsideration having been denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> by Resolution of January 23, 2006, he filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals which, by Decision of September 5, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>set aside </i>the DOJ Secretary's Resolution, holding that it committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its Resolution dismissing respondent's petition for review without therein expressing clearly and distinctly the facts on which the dismissal was based, in violation of Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The appellate court went on to hold that the matter of disposing the petition outright is clearly delineated, not under Section 12 but, under Section 7 of the NPS Rule on Appeal which categorically directs the Secretary to dismiss outright an appeal or a petition for review filed after arraignment;&nbsp; and that under Section 7, the Secretary may dismiss the petition outright if he finds the same to be patently without merit, or manifestly intended for delay, or when the issues raised are too unsubstantial to require consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration having been denied by the appellate court, she filed the present petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>Petitioner asserts that the requirement in Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution applies only to decisions of "courts of justice"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>;&nbsp; that, citing <i>Solid Homes, Inc. v. Laserna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the constitutional provision does not extend to decisions or rulings of executive departments such as the DOJ; and that Section 12(c) of the NPS Rule on Appeal allows the DOJ to dismiss a petition for review <i>motu proprio</i>, and the use of the word "outright" in the DOJ Resolution simply means "altogether," "entirely" or "openly."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In his Comment, respondent counters that the constitutional requirement is not limited to courts, citing <i>Presidential Ad hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as it extends to quasi-judicial and administrative bodies, as well as to preliminary investigations conducted by these tribunals.<br><br>Further, respondent, citing <i>Adasa v. Abalos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> argues that the DOJ "muddled" the distinction between Sections 7 and 12 of the NPS Rule on Appeal and that an "outright" dismissal is not allowed since the DOJ must set the reasons why it finds no reversible error<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in an assailed resolution.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>A preliminary investigation is not a quasi-judicial proceeding since "the prosecutor in a preliminary investigation does not determine the guilt or innocence of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; [A prosecutor] does not exercise adjudication nor rule-making functions.&nbsp; <b><u>Preliminary investigation is merely inquisitorial</u>,</b> and is often the only means of discovering the persons who may be reasonably charged [of] a crime and to enable the [prosecutor] to prepare his complaint or information.&nbsp; It is not a trial of the case on the merits and has no purpose except that of determining whether a crime has been committed and whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty thereof. <b><u>While the [prosecutor] makes that determination, he cannot be said to be acting as a quasi-court, for it is the courts, ultimately, that pass judgment on the accused, not the [prosecutor]</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>A preliminary investigation thus partakes of an <i>investigative </i>or<i> inquisitorial power</i> for the sole purpose of obtaining information on what future action of a judicial nature may be taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><i>Balangauan v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in fact iterates that even the action of the Secretary of Justice in reviewing a prosecutor's order or resolution via appeal or petition for review cannot be considered a quasi-judicial proceeding since the "DOJ is not a quasi-judicial body."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution does not thus extend to resolutions issued by the DOJ Secretary.<br><br>Respondent posits, however, that <i>Balangauan</i> finds no application in the present case for, as the Supreme Court stated, the DOJ "rectified the shortness of its first resolution by issuing a lengthier one when it resolved [the therein] respondent['s] . . . motion for reconsideration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent's position fails.<br><br>Whether the DOJ in <i>Balangauan</i> issued an extended resolution in resolving the therein respondent's motion for reconsideration is immaterial.&nbsp; The extended resolution did not detract from settling that the DOJ is not a quasi-judicial body.<br><br>Respondent's citation of <i>Presidential Ad hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans</i> is misplaced as the Ombudsman dismissed the therein subject complaint <i>prior</i> to any preliminary investigation.&nbsp; The Ombudsman merely evaluated the complaint pursuant to Section 2, Rule II of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2.&nbsp; Evaluation.--<b>Upon evaluating the complaint, the investigating officer shall recommend whether it may be:&nbsp; </b><br><br>a) dismissed outright for want of palpable merit;<br><br>b) referred to respondent for comment;<br><br>c) indorsed to the proper government office or agency which has jurisdiction over the case;<br><br>d) forwarded to the appropriate officer or official for fact-finding investigation;<br><br>e) referred for administrative adjudication; or<br><br>f) <b>subjected to a preliminary investigation</b>.&nbsp; (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Respecting the action of the Secretary of Justice on respondent's petition for review under Section 12 of the NPS Rule on Appeal, respondent posits that "outright" dismissal is not sanctioned thereunder but under Section 7.&nbsp; Respondent's position similarly fails.<br><br>That the DOJ Secretary used the word "outright" in dismissing respondent's petition for review under Section 12 of the Rule which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 12.&nbsp; Disposition of the appeal.--The Secretary may reverse, affirm or modify the appealed resolution.&nbsp; He may, <b><i><u>motu proprio</u></i></b> or upon motion, dismiss the petition for review on any of the following grounds:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(a) That there is <u>no showing of any reversible error;</u><br><br>x x x x (italics in the original;&nbsp; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>does not dent his action.&nbsp; To be sure, the word "outright" was merely used in conjunction with the <i>motu proprio</i> action.<br><br>Section 7 has an altogether different set of grounds for the outright dismissal of a petition for review.&nbsp; These are (a) when the petition is patently without merit; (b) when the petition is manifestly intended for delay; (c) when the issues raised therein are too unsubstantial to require consideration; and (d) when the accused has already been arraigned in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>When the Secretary of Justice is convinced that a petition for review does not suffer any of the infirmities laid down in Section 7,&nbsp; it can decide what action to take (i.e., reverse, modify, affirm or dismiss the appeal altogether), conformably with Section 12. In other words, Sections 7 and 12 are part of a two-step approach in the DOJ Secretary's review power.<br><br>As for respondent's reliance on <i>Adasa, </i>it too fails for, unlike in the case of <i>Adasa, </i>herein petitioner has not been arraigned as in fact no Information has been filed against her.<br><br><u>In the absence of grave abuse of discretion</u> on the part of a public prosecutor who alone determines the sufficiency of evidence that will establish probable cause in filing a criminal information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> courts will not interfere with his findings; otherwise, courts would be swamped with petitions to review the exercise of discretion on his part each time a criminal complaint is dismissed or given due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on certiorari is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</b> and the Resolutions of July 20, 2005 and January 23, 2006 of the Secretary of Justice are <b>REINSTATED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Brion, Bersamin,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member per raffle dated January 18, 2010 in lieu of Justice Martin S.
