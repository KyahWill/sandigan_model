Vicente and Maxima left no will and no debts.<br><br>On June 24, 2004, five (5) months after the death of Leonardo, petitioners initiated&nbsp; a petition for intestate proceedings, entitled "<i>In Re: Intestate Proceedings of the Estate of Sps.

The RTC was justified in doing so considering that such disagreement caused undue delay in the issuance of letters of administration, pursuant to Section 1 of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court. Initially, the RTC, on June 15, 2006, appointed Renato and Dalisay as joint special administrators, imposing upon each of them the obligation to post an administrator's bond of P200,000.00. However, taking into account the arguments of respondents that Dalisay was incompetent and unfit to assume the office of a special administratrix and that Dalisay, in effect, waived her appointment when petitioners nominated Biñan Rural Bank as special administrator, the RTC, on February 16, 2007, revoked Dalisay's appointment and substituted her with Erlinda.<br><br>A special administrator is an officer of the court who is subject to its supervision and control, expected to work for the best interest of the entire estate, with a view to its smooth administration and speedy settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; When appointed, he or she is not regarded as an agent or representative of the parties suggesting the appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The principal object of the appointment of a temporary administrator is to preserve the estate until it can pass to the hands of a person fully authorized to administer it for the benefit of creditors and heirs, pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>While the RTC considered that respondents were the nearest of kin to their deceased parents in their appointment as joint special administrators, this is not a mandatory requirement for the appointment.&nbsp; It has long been settled that the selection or removal of special administrators is not governed by the rules regarding the selection or removal of regular administrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The probate court may appoint or remove special administrators based on grounds other than those enumerated in the Rules at its discretion, such that the need to first pass upon and resolve the issues of fitness or unfitness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and the application of the order of preference under Section 6 of Rule 78,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> as would be proper in the case of a regular administrator, do not obtain.&nbsp; As long as the discretion is exercised without grave abuse, and is based on reason, equity, justice, and legal principles, interference by higher courts is unwarranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The appointment or removal<br><br>of special administrators, being discretionary, is thus interlocutory and may be assailed through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Granting the <i>certiorari</i> petition, the CA found that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in revoking respondents' appointment as joint special administrators, and for failing to first resolve the pending Motion for Exemption to File Administrators' Bond, ratiocinating that the posting of the administrators' bond is a pre-requisite to respondents' entering into the duties and responsibilities of their designated office.&nbsp; This Court disagrees.<br><br>It is worthy of mention that, as early as October 11, 2005, in their Motion for Appointment as Joint Special Administrators, respondents already prayed for their exemption to post bond should they be assigned as joint special administrators.&nbsp; However, the RTC effectively denied this prayer when it issued its June 15, 2006 Order, designating Renato and Dalisay as special administrators and enjoining them to post bond in the amount of P200,000.00 each.&nbsp; This denial was, in effect, reiterated when the RTC rendered its February 16, 2007 Order substituting Dalisay with Erlinda as special administratrix.<br><br>Undeterred by the RTC's resolve to require them to post their respective administrators' bonds, respondents filed anew a Motion for Exemption to File Administrators' Bond on May 22, 2007, positing that it would be to the best interest of the estate of their deceased parents and all the heirs to spare the estate from incurring the unnecessary expense of paying for their bond premiums since they could not raise the money themselves.&nbsp; To note, this Motion was filed only after petitioners filed a Motion for an Inventory and to Render Account of the Estate on April 23, 2007.&nbsp; Respondents then argued that they could not enter into their duties and responsibilities as special administrators in light of the pendency of their motion for exemption. In other words, they could not yet submit an inventory and render an account of the income of the estate since they had not yet posted their bonds.<br><br>Consequently, the RTC revoked respondents' appointment as special administrators for failing to post their administrators' bond and to submit an inventory and accounting as required of them, tantamount to failing to comply with its lawful orders.&nbsp; Inarguably, this was, again, a denial of respondents' plea to assume their office <i>sans</i> a bond.&nbsp; The RTC rightly did so.<br><br>Pursuant to Section 1 of Rule 81, the bond secures the performance of the duties and obligations of an administrator namely: (1) to administer the estate and pay the debts; (2) to perform all judicial orders; (3) to account within one (1) year and at any other time when required by the probate court; and (4) to make an inventory within three (3) months.&nbsp; More specifically, per Section 4 of the same Rule, the bond is conditioned on the faithful execution of the administration of the decedent's estate requiring the special administrator to (1) make and return a true inventory of the goods, chattels, rights, credits, and estate of the deceased which come to his possession or knowledge; (2) truly account for such as received by him when required by the court; and (3) deliver the same to the person appointed as executor or regular administrator, or to such other person as may be authorized to receive them.<br><br>Verily, the administration bond is for the benefit of the creditors and the heirs, as it compels the administrator, whether regular or special, to perform the trust reposed in, and discharge the obligations incumbent upon, him.&nbsp; Its object and purpose is to safeguard the properties of the decedent, and, therefore, the bond should not be considered as part of the necessary expenses chargeable against the estate, not being included among the acts constituting the care, management, and settlement of the estate.&nbsp; Moreover, the ability to post the bond is in the nature of a qualification for the office of administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Hence, the RTC revoked respondents' designation as joint special administrators, especially considering that respondents never denied that they have been in possession, charge, and actual administration of the estate of Vicente and Maxima since 2002 up to the present, despite the assumption of Melinda as regular administratrix.&nbsp; In fact, respondents also admitted that, allegedly out of good faith and sincerity to observe transparency, they had submitted a Statement of Cash Distribution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> for the period covering April 2002 to June 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> where they indicated that Renato had received P4,241,676.00, Erlinda P4,164,526.96, and petitioners P2,486,656.60, and that the estate had advanced P2,700,000.00 for the hospital and funeral expenses of Leonardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The latter cash advance was questioned by petitioners in their motion for revocation of special administration on account of the demand letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated June 20, 2007 of Asian Hospital and Medical Center addressed to Dalisay, stating that there still remained unpaid hospital bills in the amount of P2,087,380.49 since January 2004.&nbsp; Undeniably, respondents had already been distributing the incomes or fruits generated from the properties of the decedents' estate, yet they still failed to post their respective administrators' bonds despite collection of the advances from their supposed shares. This state of affairs continued even after a considerable lapse of time from the appointment of Renato as a special administrator of the estate on June 15, 2006 and from February 16, 2007 when the RTC substituted Erlinda, for Dalisay, as special administratrix.<br><br>What is more, respondents' insincerity in administering the estate was betrayed by the Deed of Conditional Sale dated January 12, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> discovered by petitioners.&nbsp; This Deed was executed between respondents, as the only heirs of Maxima, as vendors, thus excluding the representing heirs of Leonardo, and Spouses Marcus Jose B. Brillantes and Amelita Catalan-Brillantes, incumbent lessors, as vendees, over a real property situated in Biñan, Laguna, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-332305 of the Registry of Deeds of Laguna, for a total purchase price of P2,700,000.00.&nbsp; The Deed stipulated for a payment of P1,500,000.00 upon the signing of the contract, and the balance of P1,200,000.00 to be paid within one (1) month from the receipt of title of the vendees. The contract also stated that the previous contract of lease between the vendors and the vendees shall no longer be effective; hence, the vendees were no longer obligated to pay the monthly rentals on the property.&nbsp; And yet there is a purported Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> over the same realty between respondents, and including Leonardo as represented by Dalisay, as vendors, and the same spouses, as vendees, for a purchase price of only P1,500,000.00.&nbsp; Notably, this Deed of Absolute Sale already had the signatures of respondents and vendee-spouses.&nbsp; Petitioners claimed that respondents were coaxing Dalisay into signing the same, while respondents said that Dalisay already got a share from this transaction in the amount of P500,000.00.&nbsp; It may also be observed that the time of the execution of this Deed of Absolute Sale, although not notarized as the Deed of Conditional Sale, might not have been distant from the execution of the latter Deed, considering the similar Community Tax Certificate Numbers of the parties appearing in both contracts.<br><br>Given these circumstances, this Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC when it revoked the appointment of respondents as joint special administrators, the removal being grounded on reason, equity, justice, and legal principle.&nbsp; Indeed, even if special administrators had already been appointed, once the probate court finds the appointees no longer entitled to its confidence, it is justified in withdrawing the appointment and giving no valid effect thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Court finds the RTC's designation of Melinda as regular administratrix improper and abusive of its discretion.<br><br>In the determination of the person to be appointed as regular administrator, the following provisions of Rule 78 of the Rules of Court, state -<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. <i>Who are incompetent to serve as executors or administrators.</i> - No person is competent to serve as executor or administrator who:<br><br>(a) Is a minor;<br><br>(b) Is not a resident of the Philippines; and<br><br>(c) Is in the opinion of the court unfit to execute the duties of the trust by reason of drunkenness, improvidence, or want of understanding or integrity, or by reason of conviction of an offense involving moral turpitude.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 6. <i>When and to whom letters of administration granted.</i> - If no executor is named in the will, or the executor or executors are incompetent, refuse the trust, or fail to give bond, or a person dies intestate, administration shall be granted:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) To the surviving husband or wife, as the case may be, or next of kin, or both, in the discretion of the court, or to such person as such surviving husband or wife, or next of kin, requests to have appointed, if competent and willing to serve;<br><br>(b) If such surviving husband or wife, as the case may be, or next of kin, or the person selected by them, be incompetent or unwilling, or if the husband or widow, or next of kin, neglects for thirty (30) days after the death of the person to apply for administration or to request that administration be granted to some other person, it may be granted to one or more of the principal creditors, if competent and willing to serve;<br><br>(c) If there is no such creditor competent and willing to serve, it may be granted to such other person as the court may select.</div></blockquote><br>Further, on the matter of contest for the issuance of letters of administration, the following provisions of Rule 79 are pertinent -<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Contents of petition for letters of administration.</i> - A petition for letters of administration must be filed by an interested person and must show, so far as known to the petitioner:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) The jurisdictional facts;<br><br>(b) The names, ages, and residences of the heirs, and the names and residences of the creditors, of the decedent;<br><br>(c) The probable value and character of the property of the estate;<br><br>(d) The name of the person for whom letters of administration are prayed.<br></div><br>But no defect in the petition shall render void the issuance of letters of administration.<br><br>Sec. 3. <i>Court to set time for hearing. Notice thereof.</i> - When a petition for letters of administration is filed in the court having jurisdiction, such court shall fix a time and place for hearing the petition, and shall cause notice thereof to be given to the known heirs and creditors of the decedent, and to any other persons believed to have an interest in the estate, in the manner provided in Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 76.<br><br>Sec. 4. <i>Opposition to petition for administration.</i> - Any interested person may, by filing a written opposition, contest the petition on the ground of the incompetency of the person for whom letters are prayed therein, or on the ground of the contestant's own right to the administration, and may pray that letters issue to himself, or to any competent person or persons named in the opposition.<br><br>Sec. 5. <i>Hearing and order for letters to issue.</i> - At the hearing of the petition, it must first be shown that notice has been given as herein-above required, and thereafter the court shall hear the proofs of the parties in support of their respective allegations, and if satisfied that the decedent left no will, or that there is no competent and willing executor, it shall order the issuance of letters of administration to the party best entitled thereto.</blockquote><br>Admittedly, there was no petition for letters of administration with respect to Melinda, as the prayer for her appointment as co-administrator was embodied in the motion for the termination of the special administration. Although there was a hearing set for the motion on November 5, 2007, the same was canceled and reset to February 8, 2008 due to the absence of the parties' counsels.&nbsp; The February 8, 2008 hearing was again deferred to March 10, 2008 on account of the ongoing renovation of the Hall of Justice. Despite the resetting, petitioners filed a Manifestation/Motion dated February 29, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> reiterating their prayer for partition or for the appointment of Melinda as regular administrator and for the revocation of the special administration.&nbsp; It may be mentioned that, despite the filing by respondents of their Opposition and Comment to the motion to revoke the special administration, the prayer for the appointment of Melinda as regular administratrix of the estate was not specifically traversed in the said pleading.&nbsp; Thus, the capacity, competency, and legality of Melinda's appointment as such was not properly objected to by respondents despite being the next of kin to the decedent spouses, and was not threshed out by the RTC acting as a probate court in accordance with the above mentioned Rules.<br><br>However, having in mind the objective of facilitating the settlement of the estate of Vicente and Maxima, with a view to putting an end to the squabbles of the heirs, we take into account the fact that Melinda, pursuant to the RTC Order dated March 13, 2008, already posted the required bond of P200,000.00 on March 26, 2008, by virtue of which, Letters of Administration were issued to her the following day, and that she filed an Inventory of the Properties of the Estate dated April 15, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; These acts clearly manifested her intention to serve willingly as administratrix of the decedents' estate, but her appointment should be converted into one of special administration, pending the proceedings for regular administration.&nbsp; Furthermore, since it appears that the only unpaid obligation is the hospital bill due from Leonardo's estate, which is not subject of this case, judicial partition may then proceed with dispatch.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED.&nbsp; </b>The Decision dated December 16, 2008 and the Resolution dated April 30, 2009 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 104683 are <b>AFFIRMED </b>with the <b>MODIFICATION </b>that the Order dated March 13, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 24, Biñan, Laguna, with respect to the revocation of the special administration in favor of Renato M.
