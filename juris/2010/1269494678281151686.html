				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Herein appellants Felipe Ronquillo (Ronquillo) and Gilbert Torres (Torres) were charged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Ballesteros, Cagayan of homicide under an Information reading<br><br><blockquote><center>x x x x<br></center><br>That on or about June 23, 2001 in the [M]unicipality of Ballesteros, [P]rovince of Cagayan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, Felipe Ronquillo y Guillermo and Gilber[t] Torres y Natal[i]a, armed with shovel and bamboo, conspiring together and helpin[g] each other, with intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and hit with the said shovel and bamboo one Edgar Ronquillo y Paranaque, inflicting upon him wounds on his head which caused his death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><center>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></center></blockquote>The following facts are established.<br><br>On June 23, 2001 at 5:30 p.m., while appellants, together with Alejandro Rivera (Rivera), were drinking near the store of Henry Ugale, Edgar Ronquillo (the victim), a first cousin of appellant Ronquillo, passed by as he repaired to the store to buy cigarettes.  As Ronquillo followed the victim at the store, a heated argument ensued between them during which the two boxed each other.  Ronquillo thereafter twice kicked the victim who drew out his knife which hit Ronquillo at his left thigh.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Torres joined the fray and struck the victim on the nape with a shovel.  As the victim lay unconscious on the ground, Ronquillo repeatedly hit him with a bamboo pole on the head and on different parts of his body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  The victim died the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The death certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the victim showed the following:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>CAUSES OF DEATH<br>Immediate cause<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>a.  </b><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Brain herniation</b><br>Antecedent cause<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.  </b><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Intracranial hemorrhage</b><br>Underlying cause<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><b>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mauling</span></b><br>Other significant<br>conditions contributing<br>to death &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Closed fracture M/3rd humerus (L)</span></b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote><br>Ronquillo and Torres, interposing self-defense, gave the following version:<br><br>A heated argument arose when the victim called Ronquillo's father a "wicked witch."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  With a knife, the victim chased Ronquillo for about ten minutes around the store's premises,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> after which the victim turned towards Torres to attack him, hence, Torres repaired to a parked truck where he got a shovel which he used to hit the victim on the nape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Unaffected by the blow, the victim again ran after Ronquillo who was trying to pull a bamboo peg beside the road.  At that instant, the victim stabbed the left thigh of Ronquillo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> who retaliated by striking the victim with the bamboo pole.<br><br>Ruling out self-defense, the trial court held, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The testimony of the two accused is not credible. If the victim chased Gilbert with a knife, [the victim] could have inflicted injuries on [Gilbert].  <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If it is true that Gilbert struck [the victim] at the nape...why did the victim still go to Felipe who is away from him and stabbed him on his thigh.  [The victim] could have stabbed Gilbert first because he was the one who clubbed him</span>.</b> The testimony of the accused is unnatural.  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>By Decision of June 30, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the trial court thus convicted petitioners of homicide, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered[,] the prosecution having proven the guilt of the accused Felipe Ronquillo and Gilbert Torres beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, the Court sentences the accused Felipe Ronquillo and Gilbert Torres to suffer a penalty of eight (8) years and four (4) months to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months and to pay the heirs of the victim solidarily in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil [indemnity] due to the death of the victim, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as actual damages and to pay the cost.<br><br>The accused are entitled in full of their preventive imprisonment.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>By Decision of July 27, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court of Appeals <i>affirmed</i> the findings of the trial court but <i>modified</i> the penalty and ordered the payment of temperate damages in lieu of actual damages.  Thus the appellate court disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 33, Ballesteros, Cagayan, in Criminal Case No. 33-483-2001 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.  Accused-appellants Felipe Ronquillo y Guillermo and Gilbert Torres y Natalia are hereby sentenced to suffer <b>the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum.</b> Accused-appellants are also hereby ordered to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of the victim Edgar Ronquillo, <b>the amount of P25,000.00 as temperate damages</b> in lieu of actual damages which is hereby DELETED.  The appealed Decision is AFFIRMED in all other respects.  The damages awarded herein and those affirmed in the appealed judgment are to be paid, jointly and severally, by both accused-appellants.<br><br>SO ORDERED.  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Hence, the present petition for review.<br><br>Justifying their actions, petitioners assert that unlawful aggression emanated from the victim who was armed with a knife; that the means adopted by them were reasonably necessary to repel the victim's aggression; and that they did not provoke the victim whom they merely invited for a drink.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>And petitioners contend that there was no sufficient, direct and clear evidence to establish conspiracy in the killing of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>As did the trial and appellate courts, the Court finds that petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proving the circumstances to justify their actions.<br><br>It is a statutory and doctrinal requirement that the presence of unlawful aggression is a condition <i>sine qua non </i>for self-defense to be warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The testimony of the lone prosecution witness Rivera that the aggression emanated not from the victim but from petitioner Ronquillo himself impresses the Court.

The victim in fact drew out his knife after he was twice kicked by Ronquillo.<br><br>That the injury Ronquillo sustained was not serious or severe dovetails with the narration of prosecution witness Rivera that the victim used his knife to parry the second kick of Ronquillo.<br><br>In stark contrast, the victim sustained severe head injuries that resulted in hernia and hemorrhage, and a fracture on his humerus or upper arm.  The gravity, location, and number of injuries he sustained undoubtedly negate self-defense on petitioners' part.<br><br>Further denting Ronquillo's defense is his admission that he had been harboring a grudge against the victim.<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">In what occasion then did Edgar Ronquillo called [<i>sic</i>] your father a witch?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The first time he told me that my father is a witch was when we had a drinking spree at the same place [in] Cabaritan, Sir.</span> </b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Not on that incident?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Therefore, when you saw Edgar Ronquillo at the time of the incident, Edgar Ronquillo has already called your father a witch?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">At that time I asked him why he told me that my father is a witch so we had a heated argument, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:<b></b></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are then harboring an ill feeling against Edgar Ronquillo because of his statement? </span></b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yes Sir, a little</span>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <b> </b>(emphasis and underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Respecting Torres' claim that he was attacked by the victim, the testimony of the prosecution witness who has not been shown to be a biased witness belies the same:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">And Gilbert Torres only went to get the shovel after he was attacked by Edgar, am I correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No sir, Edgar never attacked Gilbert Torres.</span> </b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">At any rate, Gilbert Torres went to the aid of Felipe Ronquillo[?]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>But even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that unlawful aggression initially came from the victim, the aggression ceased when the victim already lay prostate on the ground at which time there was no longer any need to further inflict injuries on him.  For there was no longer any imminent risk to petitioners' lives or personal safety.<br><br>Besides, petitioners had the opportunity to run away from the victim as, by their claim, he was even walking "groggily" due to drunkenness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Particularly with respect to Ronquillo, since he claimed that the victim chased him for about ten minutes around the store and then turned his attention to Torres, he could have run away.  But he did not.<br><br>It bears noting that petitioners enjoyed superiority in number (two) over the victim.  And the means they used was out of proportion to the means of defense available to the victim.<br><br>The Court finds then that unlawful aggression was not present on the victim's part.  Discussion of the rest of the elements of self-defense is thus rendered unnecessary.<br><br>On the issue of conspiracy, the Court finds well-taken the appellate court's appreciation of the presence thereof, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Considering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that herein [petitioners] already admitted the killing of Edgar Ronquillo</span>, the issue therefore of conspiracy is irrelevant simply because the participation of the [petitioners] in the killing of Edgar Ronquillo has already been established. For even if conspiracy was not proven, the fact that the two accused <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each inflicted a serious wound which contributed to the death of the victim makes them co-principals</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Finally, since petitioners invoke justifying circumstances to exonerate themselves, any discussion on conspiracy is extraneous as these two concepts are incompatible with each other.  For conspiracy presupposes a community of criminal intent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> while invocation of justifying circumstances presupposes lack of criminal intent such that there is no crime and no criminal to speak of.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, June 14, 2002, pp. 4-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 11-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Records, p. 6;  Exhibit "A."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, November 8, 2004, pp. 4-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 4-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> TSN, May 30, 2005, pp. 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, November 8, 2004, pp. 9-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Records, pp. 173-183.
