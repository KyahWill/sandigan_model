SP No. 51834 dated August 22, 2000 as well as in its <b>Resolution</b> dated March 27, 2001 of petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, petitioner is now before this Court to seek the reversal of the questioned Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Petitioner's main contention in this claim for refund is that the tax base for the documentary stamp tax on the Amended Subscription Agreement should have been only the shares of stock in RGHC, PGCI, and UCPB that petitioner had transferred to JEC as payment for its subscription to the JEC shares, and should not have included the cash portion of its payment, based on <b>Section 176</b> of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, as amended by Republic Act No. 7660, or the New Documentary Stamps Tax Law (the 1994 Tax Code), the law applicable at the time of the transaction.&nbsp; Petitioner argues that the cash component of its payment for its subscription to the JEC shares, totaling Three Hundred Seventy Million Seven Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Pesos (P370,766,000.00) should not have been charged any documentary stamp tax.&nbsp; Petitioner claims that there was overpayment because the tax due on the transferred shares was only Five Hundred Ninety-Three Thousand Five Hundred Twenty-Eight and 15/100 Pesos (P593,528.15), as indicated in the certifications issued by RDO Esquivias.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges that it is entitled to a refund for the overpayment, which is the&nbsp; difference in the amount it had actually paid (P1,003,895.65) and the amount of documentary stamp tax due on the transfer of said shares (P593,528.15), or a total of Four Hundred Ten Thousand Three Hundred Sixty-Seven Pesos (P410,367.00).<br><br>Petitioner contends that both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Tax Appeals erroneously relied on respondent's (Commissioner of Internal Revenue's) assertions that it had paid the documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of the shares of stock of JEC<i> </i>under <b>Section 175</b> of the 1994 Tax Code.<br><br>Petitioner explains that in this instance where shares of stock are used as subscription payment, there are two documentary stamp tax incidences, namely, the documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of the shares subscribed (the JEC shares), which is imposed under Section 175; and the documentary stamp tax on the shares transferred in payment of such subscription (the transfer of the RGHC, PGCI and UCPB shares of stock from petitioner to JEC), which is imposed under Section 176 of the 1994 Tax Code. Petitioner argues that the documentary stamp tax imposed under Section 175 is due on original issuances of certificates of stock and is computed based on the aggregate par value of the shares to be issued; and that these certificates of stock are issued only upon full payment of the subscription price such that under the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (BIR's) Revised Documentary Stamp Tax Regulations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> it is stated that the documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of certificates of stock is imposed on fully paid shares of stock only.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges that it is the issuing corporation which is primarily liable for the payment of the documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of shares of stock.&nbsp; Petitioner further argues that the documentary stamp tax on Section 176 of the 1994 Tax Code is imposed for every transfer of shares or certificates of stock, computed based on the par value of the shares to be transferred, and is due whether a certificate of stock is actually issued, indorsed or delivered pursuant to such transfer.&nbsp; It is the transferor who is liable for the documentary stamp tax on the transfer of shares.<br><br>Petitioner claims that the documentary stamp tax under Section 175 attaches to the certificate/s of stock to be issued by virtue of petitioner's subscription while the documentary stamp tax under Section 176 attaches to the Amended Subscription Agreement, since it is this instrument that evidences the transfer of the RGHC, PGCI and UCPB shares from petitioner to JEC.<br><br>Petitioner contends that at the time of the execution of the Amended Subscription Agreement, the JEC shares or certificates subscribed by petitioner could not have been issued by JEC because the same were yet to be sourced from the increase in authorized capital stock of JEC, which in turn had yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp; Petitioner thus reasons that the documentary stamp tax under Section 175 could not have accrued at the time the Amended Subscription Agreement was executed because no right to the shares had neither been nor could be established in favor of the petitioner at such time.&nbsp; Petitioner theorizes that the earliest time that the subscription could actually be executed would be when the SEC approves the increase in the authorized capital stock of JEC.&nbsp; On the other hand, upon the execution of the Amended Subscription Agreement, the assignment or the transfer of RGHC, PGCI and UCPB shares in favor of JEC (which is evidenced by said agreement), is deemed immediately enforceable as this is a necessary requirement of the SEC.<br><br>Petitioner points out that Section 175 of the 1994 Tax Code imposes a documentary stamp tax on every original issuance of <b><u>certificates</u> of stock</b>, whereas Republic Act No. 8424, the Tax Reform Act of 1997 (the 1997 Tax Code), amended this provision and imposed a documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of <b><u>shares</u> of stock.&nbsp; </b>Petitioner argues that under Section 175 of the 1994 Tax Code, there was no documentary stamp tax due on the mere execution of a subscription agreement to shares of stock, and the tax only accrued upon issuance of the certificates of stock.&nbsp; In this case, the change in wording introduced by the 1997 Tax Code cannot be made applicable to the Amended Subscription Agreement, which was executed in 1994, because it is a well-settled doctrine in taxation that a law must have prospective application.<br><br>Lastly, petitioner alleges that it is entitled to refund under the NIRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In his <b>Comment (To Petition for Review)</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> respondent avers that the lower courts did not err in denying petitioner's claim for refund, and that petitioner is raising issues in this petition which were not raised in the lower courts.<br><br>Respondent maintains that the documentary stamp tax imposed in this case is on the original issue of certificates of stock of JEC on the subscription by the petitioner of the P508,806,200.00 shares out of the increase in the authorized capital stock of the former pursuant to Section 175 of the NIRC.&nbsp; The documentary stamp tax was not imposed on the shares of stock owned by petitioner in RGHC, PGCI, and UCPB, which merely form part of the partial payment of the subscribed shares in JEC. Respondent avers that the amounts indicated in the Certificates of RDO Esquivias are the amounts of documentary stamp tax representing the equivalent of each group of shares being applied for payment.&nbsp; Considering that the amount of documentary stamp tax represented by the shares of stock in the aforementioned companies amounted only to P593,528.15, while the basic documentary stamp tax for the entire subscription of P508,806,200.00 was computed by respondent's revenue officers to the tune of P803,116.72, exclusive of the penalties, leaving a balance of P209,588.57, is a clear indication that the payment made with the shares of stock is insufficient.<br><br>Respondent claims that the certifications were issued by RDO Esquivias purposely to allow the registration of transfer of the shares of stock used in payment of the subscribed shares in the name of JEC from petitioner by the Corporate Secretary of the UCPB and are not evidence of the payment of the documentary stamp tax on the issuance of the increased shares of stocks of JEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that the documentary stamp tax attaches upon acceptance by the corporation of the stockholder's subscription in the capital stock of the corporation, and that the term "original issue" of the certificate of stock means "the point at which the stockholder acquires and may exercise attributes of ownership over the stocks."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent further argues that the stocks can be alienated; the dividends or fruits derived therefrom can be enjoyed; and they can be conveyed, pledged, or encumbered; that the certificate, irrespective of whether or not it is in the actual constructive possession of the stockholder, is considered issued because it is with value and, hence, the documentary stamp tax must be paid; and concludes that a person may own shares of stock without possessing a certificate of stock.&nbsp; Respondent cites <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Construction Resources of Asia, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> where the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>The delivery of the certificates of stocks to the private respondent's stockholders whether actual or constructive, is not essential for the documentary and science stamps taxes to attach. What is taxed is the privilege of issuing shares of stock and, therefore, the taxes accrue at the time the shares are issued. The only question before us is whether or not said private respondents issued the certificates of stock covering the paid-in-capital of P17,880,000.00.<br></blockquote><br>Respondent claims that it is well-settled as a general rule of Corporation Law that a subscriber for stock in a corporation or purchaser of stock becomes a stockholder as soon as his subscription is accepted by the corporation whether a certificate of stock is issued to him or not, and although he may have no certificate, he is thereupon entitled to all the rights and is subject to all the liabilities of a stockholder.<br><br>Respondent argues, based on the above, that the contention of petitioner that the documentary stamp tax under Section 175 of the 1994 Tax Code could not have accrued at the time the Amended Subscription Agreement was executed since the increase in capital stock of JEC had yet to be approved by the SEC was inaccurate.&nbsp; He states that it is evident from the Amended Subscription Agreement that the subscribed shares from the increase in JEC's stock were fully paid through cash and shares of stock.<br><br>Respondent submits that the change in wording, from "certificates" to "shares" of stock, introduced to Section 175 by the 1997 Tax Code, was a mere clarification and codification of the foregoing principle or policy.<br><br>Respondent stresses that the documentary stamp tax can be levied or collected from the person making, signing, issuing, accepting, or transferring the obligation or property, as provided in Section 173 of the Tax Code.<br><br>In its <b>Reply to Respondent's Comment to the Petition</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> petitioner contends that respondent erroneously insists that the documentary stamp tax sought to be refunded is the one imposed on the subscription by petitioner to P508,806,200.00 new shares of JEC.&nbsp; Petitioner further contends that since the documentary stamp tax due on the issuance of new shares or on original shares is P2.00 for every P200 under Section 175 of the Tax Code, then the documentary stamp tax on petitioner's subscription to JEC shares should amount to P5,088,062.00, which is much higher than the P803,116.72 basic documentary stamp tax paid under ATAP No. 1511920.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner argues that at the time the documentary stamp tax was paid, before a taxpayer was allowed to pay the taxes due, a BIR revenue officer would first compute the tax due and then issue an authority to accept payment (ATAP) and it was very unlikely that the revenue officer could have made such a glaring mistake.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that there is no BIR certification requirement prior to the issuance of original shares of stock; and that it is only upon the regular annual audit of the books of a corporation that the BIR determines if the documentary stamp tax on new or original issuances of shares, if any were issued, had in fact been paid.&nbsp; If not, then a deficiency assessment, with penalties and surcharges, would then be made by the BIR.&nbsp; Petitioner further alleges that, on the other hand, before the transfer of issued and outstanding shares to a new owner is recorded in the books of a corporation, the capital gains tax thereon and the documentary stamp tax on the transfer must first be paid, and a BIR certification must be presented to the Corporate Secretary authorizing the corporation to record the transfer, otherwise, the corporate secretary shall be subjected to penalties.<br><br>Petitioner claims that the three BIR certifications in this case specifically allow the registration of the UCPB, RGHC, and PGCI shares in the name of JEC, the transferee, and that said certifications evidence payment of the taxes due on the transfer of the shares from petitioner to JEC, not on the original issuance of shares of JEC.<br><br>The parties' respective memoranda contained reiterations of the allegations raised in their respective pleadings as discussed above.<br><br><b>The sole issue to be resolved is whether petitioner is entitled to a partial refund of the documentary stamp tax and surcharges it paid on the execution of the Amended Subscription Agreement.</b><br><br>In claims for refund, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to prove entitlement to such refund.&nbsp; As we held in <i>Compagnie Financiere Sucres Et Denrees</i><i> v</i><i>.

It is not imposed upon the business transacted but is an excise upon the privilege, opportunity or facility offered at exchanges for the transaction of the business. It is an excise upon the facilities used in the transaction of the business separate and apart from the business itself.&nbsp; Documentary stamp taxes are levied on the exercise by persons of certain privileges conferred by law for the creation, revision, or termination of specific legal relationships through the execution of specific instruments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Thus, we have held that <b>documentary stamp taxes are levied independently of the legal status of the transactions giving rise thereto</b>.

The DST, as an excise tax, is levied upon the privilege, the opportunity and the facility of issuing shares of stock. In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Construction Resources of Asia, Inc</i>., this Court explained that <b>the DST attaches upon acceptance of the stockholder's subscription in the corporation's capital stock regardless of actual or constructive delivery of the certificates of stock</b>. Citing <i>Philippine Consolidated Coconut Ind., Inc. v. Collector of Internal Revenue</i>, the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>The documentary stamp tax under this provision of the law may be levied only once, that is upon the original issue of the certificate. The crucial point therefore, in the case before Us is the proper interpretation of the word 'issue'. In other words, when is the certificate of stock deemed 'issued' for the purpose of imposing the documentary stamp tax? Is it at the time the certificates of stock are printed, at the time they are filled up (in whose name the stocks represented in the certificate appear as certified by the proper officials of the corporation), at the time they are released by the corporation, or at the time they are in the possession (actual or constructive) of the stockholders owning them?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Ordinarily, when a corporation issues a certificate of stock (representing the ownership of stocks in the corporation to fully paid subscription) the certificate of stock can be utilized for the exercise of the attributes of ownership over the stocks mentioned on its face. The stocks can be alienated; the dividends or fruits derived therefrom can be enjoyed, and they can be conveyed, pledged or encumbered. The certificate as issued by the corporation, irrespective of whether or not it is in the actual or constructive possession of the stockholder, is considered issued because it is with value and hence the documentary stamp tax must be paid as imposed by Section 212 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.</blockquote><br>In Section 176 of the Tax Code, DST is imposed on the sales, agreements to sell, memoranda of sales, deliveries or transfer of shares or certificates of stock in any association, company, or corporation, or transfer of such securities by assignment in blank, or by delivery, or by any paper or agreement, or memorandum or other evidences of transfer or sale whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such certificates of stock, or to secure the future payment of money, or for the future transfer of certificates of stock. In <i>Compagnie Financiere Sucres et Denrees v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>, this Court held that under Section 176 of the Tax Code, sales to secure the future transfer of due-bills, certificates of obligation or certificates of stock are subject to documentary stamp tax.<br><br>Revenue Memorandum Order No. 08-98 (RMO 08-98) provides the guidelines on the corporate stock documentary stamp tax program. RMO 08-98 states that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>All existing corporations shall file the Corporation Stock DST Declaration, and the DST Return, if applicable <b>when DST is still due on the subscribed share issued by the corporation</b>, on or before the tenth day of the month following publication of this Order.<br></li></ol><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br><ol start="3"><li>All existing corporations with authorization for increased capital stock shall file their Corporate Stock DST Declaration, together with the DST Return, if applicable <b>when DST is due on subscriptions made after the authorization</b>, on or before the tenth day of the month following the date of authorization. (Boldfacing supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>RMO 08-98, reiterating Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 47-97 (RMC 47-97), also states that what is being taxed is the privilege of issuing shares of stock, and, therefore, the taxes accrue at the time the shares are issued. RMC 47-97 also defines issuance as the point in which the stockholder acquires and may exercise attributes of ownership over the stocks.<br><br>As pointed out by the CTA, Sections 175 and 176 of the Tax Code contemplate a subscription agreement in order for a taxpayer to be liable to pay the DST. A subscription contract is defined as any contract for the acquisition of unissued stocks in an existing corporation or a corporation still to be formed.&nbsp; A stock subscription is a contract by which the subscriber agrees to take a certain number of shares of the capital stock of a corporation, paying for the same or expressly or impliedly promising to pay for the same. (Emphases ours.)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner claims overpayment of the documentary stamp tax but its basis for such is not clear at all.&nbsp; While insisting that the documentary stamp tax it had paid for was not based on the original issuance of JEC shares as provided in Section 175 of the 1994 Tax Code, petitioner failed in showing, even through a mere basic computation of the tax base and the tax rate, that the documentary stamp tax was based on the transfer of shares under Section 176 either.&nbsp; It would have been helpful for petitioner's cause had it submitted proof of the par value of the shares of stock involved, to show the actual basis for the documentary stamp tax computation.&nbsp; For comparison, the original Subscription Agreement ought to have been submitted as well.<br><br>All that petitioner submitted to back up its claim were the certifications issued by then RDO Esquivias.&nbsp; As correctly pointed out by respondent, however, the amounts in the RDO certificates were the amounts of documentary stamp tax representing the equivalent of each group of shares being applied for payment.&nbsp; The purpose for issuing such certifications was to allow registration of transfer of shares of stock used in partial payment for petitioner's subscription to the original issuance of JEC shares.&nbsp; It should not be used as evidence of payment of documentary stamp tax. Neither should it be the lone basis of a claim for a documentary stamp tax refund.<br><br>The fact that it was petitioner and not JEC that paid for the documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of shares is of no moment, as Section 173 of the 1994 Tax Code states that the documentary stamp tax shall be paid by the person making, signing, issuing, accepting or transferring the property, right or obligation.<br><br>Lastly, we deem it appropriate to reiterate the well-established doctrine that as a matter of practice and principle, this Court will not set aside the conclusion reached by an agency, like the Court of Tax Appeals, especially if affirmed by the Court of Appeals. By the very nature of its function, it has dedicated itself to the study and consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority on its part, which we find is not present here.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Del Castillo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Justice Delilah Vidallon-Magtolis with Associate Justices Eloy R.
