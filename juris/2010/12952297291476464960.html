Debunking petitioners' contention that the branded LPG cylinders are already owned by consumers who are free to do with them as they please, the law is clear that the stamped markings on the LPG cylinders show who are the real owners thereof and they cannot be refilled sans authority from Pilipinas Shell, Petron or Total, as the case may be.&nbsp; On the underfilling of one LPG cylinder, the findings of LPG Inspector Navio of the LPGIA were uncontroverted by petitioners.<br><br>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was denied through a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> by the Office of the Chief State Prosecutor issued on May 3, 2006.<br><br>In time, petitioners appealed to the Office of the Secretary of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote><b>The Ruling of the DOJ Secretary</b><br><b>in I.S.

Being an isolated case, it ruled that there was no showing of a clear pattern of deliberate underfilling.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, on the alleged violation of refilling branded LPG cylinders sans written authority, it found no sufficient basis to hold petitioners responsible for violation of Sec. 2 (c) of BP 33, as amended, since there was no proof that the branded LPG cylinders seized from Omni belong to another company or firm, holding that the simple fact that the LPG cylinders with markings or stamps of other petroleum producers cannot by itself prove ownership by said firms or companies as the consumers who take them to Omni fully owned them having purchased or acquired them beforehand.<br><br>Agent De Jemil moved but was denied reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> through another Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated December 14, 2006 prompting him to repair to the CA via a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, docketed as CA-G.R.

The CA relied on the affidavits of Agents De Jemil and Kawada, the certifications from various LPG producers that Omni is not authorized to refill their branded LPG cylinders, the results of the test-buy operation as attested to by the NBI agents and confirmed by the examination of LPG Inspector Navio of the LPGIA, the letter-opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Department of Energy (DOE) to Pilipinas Shell confirming that branded LPG cylinders are properties of the companies whose stamp markings appear thereon, and Department Circular No. 2000-05-007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the DOE on the required stamps or markings by the manufacturers of LPG cylinders.<br><br>After granting the appeal of Agent De Jemil, however, the motions to intervene filed by Petron and NACI were simply noted by the appellate court.<br><br>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was rebuffed by the CA through the equally assailed March 14, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Thus, the instant petition.<br><br><blockquote><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br><ol type="I"><li> WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENTS WERE ENTITLED TO THE SPECIAL CIVIL ACTION OF CERTIORARI IN THE COURT OF APPEALS.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT PETITIONERS VIOLATED SECTION 2(A) OF BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 33, AS AMENDED.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT PETITIONERS VIOLATED SECTION 2(C) OF BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 33, AS AMENDED.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT PETITIONERS CAN BE HELD LIABLE UNDER BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 33, AS AMENDED, FOR BEING MERE DIRECTORS, NOT ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS OF THE CORPORATION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>The foregoing issues can be summarized into two core issues:&nbsp; <i>first</i>, whether probable cause exists against petitioners for violations of Sec. 2 (a) and (c) of BP 33, as amended; and <i>second</i>, whether petitioners can be held liable therefor.&nbsp; We, however, will tackle at the outset the sole procedural issue raised:&nbsp; the propriety of the petition for certiorari under Rule 65 availed of by public respondent Agent De Jemil to assail the resolutions of the Office of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br><b>Petron's Comment-in-Intervention</b><br><br>On April 14, 2009, Petron entered its appearance by filing a Motion for Leave to Intervene and to Admit Comment-in-Intervention<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and its Comment-in-Intervention [To petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> dated 13 May 2008].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; It asserted vested interest in the seizure of several <i>Gasul</i> LPG cylinders and the right to prosecute petitioners for unauthorized refilling of its branded LPG cylinders by Omni.&nbsp; Petitioners duly filed their Comment/Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> to Petron's motion to intervene.&nbsp; It is clear, however, that Petron has substantial interest to protect in so far as its business relative to the sale and refilling of <i>Petron Gasul</i> LPG cylinders is concerned, and therefore its intervention in the instant case is proper.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>We partially grant the petition.<br><br><b>Procedural Issue:&nbsp; Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 Proper</b><br><br>Petitioners raise the sole procedural issue of the propriety of the legal remedy availed of by public respondent Agent De Jemil.&nbsp; They strongly maintain that the Office of the Secretary of Justice properly assumed jurisdiction and did not gravely abuse its discretion in its determination of lack of probable cause--the exercise thereof being its sole prerogative--which, they lament, the appellate court did not accord proper latitude.&nbsp; Besides, they assail the non-exhaustion of administrative remedies when Agent De Jemil immediately resorted to court action through a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 before the CA without first appealing the resolutions of the Office of the Secretary of Justice to the Office of the President (OP).<br><br>We cannot agree with petitioners.<br><br>For one, while it is the consistent principle in this jurisdiction that the determination of probable cause is a function that belongs to the public prosecutor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and, ultimately, to the Secretary of Justice, who may direct the filing of the corresponding information or move for the dismissal of the case;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> such determination is subject to judicial review where it is established that grave abuse of discretion tainted the determination.<br><br>For another, there is no question that the Secretary of Justice is an alter ego of the President who may opt to exercise or not to exercise his or her power of review over the former's determination in criminal investigation cases.&nbsp; As aptly noted by Agent De Jemil, the determination of probable cause by the Secretary of Justice is, under the doctrine of qualified political agency, presumably that of the Chief Executive unless disapproved or reprobated by the latter.<br><br><i>Chan v. Secretary of Justice</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> delineated the proper remedy from the determination of the Secretary of Justice.&nbsp; Therein, the Court, after expounding on the policy of non-interference in the determination of the existence of probable cause absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the public prosecutor and the Secretary of Justice, however, concluded, citing <i>Alcaraz v. Gonzalez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and <i>Preferred Home Specialties, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><i> </i>that an aggrieved party from the resolution of the Secretary of Justice may directly resort to judicial review on the ground of grave abuse of discretion, thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he <b>findings of the Justice Secretary may be reviewed through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65</b> based on the allegation that he <b><u>acted with grave abuse of discretion</u></b>.&nbsp; <b>This remedy is available to the aggrieved party</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>It is thus clear that Agent De Jemil, the aggrieved party in the assailed resolutions of the Office of the Secretary of Justice, availed of and pursued the proper legal remedy of a judicial review through a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 in assailing the latter's finding of lack of probable cause on the ground of grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><center><b>First Core Issue:&nbsp; Existence of Probable Cause</b><br></center><br>Petitioners contend that there is no probable cause that Omni violated Sec. 2 (a), in relation to Secs. 3 (c) and 4 of BP 33, as amended, prohibiting the refilling of another company's or firm's LPG cylinders without its written authorization.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, the branded LPG cylinders seized were not traded by Omni as its representative annotated in the NBI receipt of seized items that the filled LPG cylinders came from customers' trucks and the empty ones were taken from the warehouse or swapping section of the refilling plant and not from the refilling section.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, the branded LPG cylinders are owned by end-user customers and not by the major petroleum companies, i.e., Petron, Pilipinas Shell and Total.&nbsp; And even granting arguendo that Omni is selling these LPG cylinders, still there cannot be a <i>prima facie</i> case of violation since there is no proof that the refilled branded LPG cylinders are owned by another company or firm.<br><br><i>Third</i>, granting that Petron, Total and Pilipinas Shell still own their respective branded LPG cylinders already sold to consumers, still such fact will not bind third persons, like Omni, who is not privy to the agreement between the buying consumers and said major petroleum companies. Thus, a subsequent transfer by the customers of Petron, Total and Pilipinas Shell of the duly marked or stamped LPG cylinders through swapping, for example, will effectively transfer ownership of the LPG cylinders to the transferee, like Omni.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, LPG cylinder exchange or swapping is a common industry practice that the DOE recognizes.&nbsp; They point to a series of meetings conducted by the DOE for institutionalizing the validity of swapping of all and any kind of LPG cylinders among the industry players.&nbsp; The meetings resulted in a draft Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which unfortunately was not signed due to the withdrawal of petroleum major players Petron, Total and Pilipinas Shell.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the non-signing of the MOA does not diminish the fact of the recognized industry practice of cylinder exchange or swapping.&nbsp; Relying on Republic Act No. (RA) 8479,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> petitioners maintain that said law promotes and encourages the entry of new participants in the petroleum industry such as Omni.&nbsp; And in furtherance of this mandate is the valid practice of cylinder exchange or swapping in the LPG industry.<br><br>We are not persuaded by petitioners' strained rationalizations.<br><br><b>Probable violation of Sec. 2 (a) of BP 33, amended</b><br><br><b>First</b>.&nbsp; The test-buy conducted on April 15, 2004 by the NBI agents, as attested to by their respective affidavits, tends to show that Omni illegally refilled the eight branded LPG cylinders for PhP 1,582.&nbsp; This is a clear violation of Sec. 2 (a), in relation to Secs. 3 (c) and 4 of BP 33, as amended.&nbsp; It must be noted that the criminal complaints, as clearly shown in the complaint-affidavits of Agent De Jemil, are not based solely on the seized items pursuant to the search warrants but also on the test-buy earlier conducted by the NBI agents.<br><br><b>Second</b>.&nbsp; The written certifications from Pilipinas Shell, Petron and Total show that Omni has no written authority to refill LPG cylinders, embossed, marked or stamped <i>Shellane</i>, <i>Petron Gasul</i>, <i>Totalgaz</i> and <i>Superkalan Gaz</i>.&nbsp; In fact, petitioners neither dispute this nor claim that Omni has authority to refill these branded LPG cylinders.<br><br><b>Third</b>.&nbsp; Belying petitioners' contention, the seized items during the service of the search warrants tend to show that Omni illegally refilled branded LPG cylinders without authority.<br><br>On April 29, 2004, the NBI agents who served the search warrants on Omni seized the following:<br><br><blockquote><table ¬†="" width="80%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Quantity/Unit</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="50%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Description<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">7 LPG cylinders</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Totalgaz</i>, 11.0 kg [filled]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1 LPG cylinder</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Petron Gasul</i>, 11.0 kg [filled]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1 LPG cylinder </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Shellane</i>, 11.0 kg [filled]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">29 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Superkalan Gaz</i>, 2.7 kg [empty]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">17 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Petron Gasul</i>, 11.0 kg [emptly]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">8 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Marked as <i>Omnigas</i> with <i>Shell</i> emboss, 11.0 kg [empty]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">5 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Marked as <i>Omnigas</i> with <i>Totalgaz</i> emboss, 11.0 kg [empty]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">23 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Shellane</i>, 11.0 kg [empty]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Marked as <i>Omnigas</i> with <i>Gasul</i> emboss, 11.0 kg [empty]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">21 LPG cylinders </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Totalgaz</i>, 11.0 kg [empty]</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The foregoing list is embodied in the NBI's Receipt/Inventory of Property/Item Seized<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> signed by NBI Agent Edwin J.

LPG Refillers Association of the Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the Court affirmed the validity of DOE Circular No. 2000-06-010 which <b>provided penalties on a per cylinder basis for each violation</b>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>B.P. Blg. 33, as amended, criminalizes <b>illegal trading</b>, adulteration, <b>underfilling</b>, hoarding, and overpricing of petroleum products.&nbsp; Under this general description of what constitutes criminal acts involving petroleum products, the Circular merely lists the various modes by which the said criminal acts may be perpetrated, namely: no price display board, no weighing scale, no tare weight or incorrect tare weight markings, <b>no authorized LPG seal</b>, no trade name, unbranded LPG cylinders, no serial number, no distinguishing color, no embossed identifying markings on cylinder, <b>underfilling LPG cylinders</b>, <b>tampering LPG cylinders</b>, and unauthorized decanting of LPG cylinders.&nbsp; These specific acts and omissions are obviously within the contemplation of the law, which seeks to curb the pernicious practices of some petroleum merchants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Moreover, in denying the motion for reconsideration of the LPG Refillers Association of the Philippines, Inc., the Court upheld the basis of said DOE Circular No. 2000-06-010 on the <b>imposition of penalties on a per cylinder basis</b>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Respondent's position is untenable.&nbsp; The Circular is not confiscatory in providing penalties on a per cylinder basis.&nbsp; Those penalties do not exceed the ceiling prescribed in Section 4 of B.P. Blg. 33, as amended, which penalizes "<i>any person who commits <b>any act</b> [t]herein prohibited</i>."&nbsp; Thus, violation on a per cylinder basis falls within the phrase "<i>any act</i>" as mandated in Section 4.&nbsp; To provide the same penalty for one who violates a prohibited act in B.P. Blg. 33, as amended, regardless of the number of cylinders involved would result in an indiscriminate, oppressive and impractical operation of B.P. Blg. 33, as amended. <i> </i>The equal protection clause demands that "<i>all persons subject to such legislation shall be treated alike, <b>under like circumstances</b> and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court made it clear that a violation, like underfilling, on a per cylinder basis falls within the phrase of <b>any act</b> as mandated under Sec. 4 of BP 33, as amended.&nbsp; Ineluctably, the underfilling of one LPG cylinder constitutes a clear violation of BP 33, as amended.&nbsp; The finding of underfilling by LPG Inspector Navio of the LPGIA, as aptly noted by Manila Assistant City Prosecutor Catalo who conducted the preliminary investigation, was indeed not controverted by petitioners.<br><br>On the issue of manifest bias and partiality, suffice it to say that aside from the allegation by petitioners, they have not shown that LPG Inspector Navio is neither an expert nor qualified to determine underfilling.&nbsp; Besides, it must be noted that the inspection by LPG Inspector Navio was conducted in the presence of NBI agents on April 23, 2004 who attested to that fact through their affidavits.&nbsp; Moreover, no rules require and petitioners have not cited any that the inspection be conducted in the presence of DOE representatives.<br><br><center><b>Second Core Issue:&nbsp; Petitioners' Liability for Violations</b><br></center><br>Sec. 4 of BP 33, as amended, provides for the penalties and persons who are criminally liable, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4.

Ty who is indisputably the President of Omni.<br><br>It may be noted that Sec. 4 above enumerates the persons who may be held liable for violations of the law, viz:&nbsp; (1) the president, (2) general manager, (3) managing partner, (4) such other officer charged with the management of the business affairs of the corporation or juridical entity, or (5) the employee responsible for such violation.&nbsp; A common thread of the first four enumerated officers is the fact that they manage the business affairs of the corporation or juridical entity.&nbsp; In short, they are operating officers of a business concern, while the last in the list is self-explanatory.<br><br>It is undisputed that petitioners are members of the board of directors of Omni at the time pertinent.&nbsp; There can be no quibble that the enumeration of persons who may be held liable for corporate violators of BP 33, as amended, excludes the members of the board of directors.&nbsp; This stands to reason for the board of directors of a corporation is generally a policy making body.&nbsp; Even if the corporate powers of a corporation are reposed in the board of directors under the first paragraph of Sec. 23<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> of the Corporation Code, it is of common knowledge and practice that the board of directors is not directly engaged or charged with the running of the recurring business affairs of the corporation. Depending on the powers granted to them by the Articles of Incorporation, the members of the board generally do not concern themselves with the day-to-day affairs of the corporation, except those corporate officers who are charged with running the business of the corporation and are concomitantly members of the board, like the President.&nbsp; Section 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the Corporation Code requires the president of a corporation to be also a member of the board of directors.<br><br>Thus, the application of the legal maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, which means the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another thing not mentioned.&nbsp; If a statute enumerates the thing upon which it is to operate, everything else must necessarily and by implication be excluded from its operation and effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; The fourth officer in the enumerated list is the catch-all "such other officer charged with the management of the business affairs" of the corporation or juridical entity which is a factual issue which must be alleged and supported by evidence.<br><br>A scrutiny of the GIS reveals that among the petitioners who are members of the board of directors are the following who are likewise elected as corporate officers of Omni:&nbsp; (1) Petitioner Arnel U. Ty (Arnel) as President; (2) petitioner Mari Antonette Ty as Treasurer; and (3) petitioner Jason Ong as Corporate Secretary.&nbsp; Sec. 4 of BP 33, as amended, clearly indicated firstly the president of a corporation or juridical entity to be criminally liable for violations of BP 33, as amended.<br><br>Evidently, petitioner Arnel, as President, who manages the business affairs of Omni, can be held liable for probable violations by Omni of BP 33, as amended.&nbsp; The fact that petitioner Arnel is ostensibly the operations manager of Multi-Gas Corporation, a family owned business, does not deter him from managing Omni as well. It is well-settled that where the language of the law is clear and unequivocal, it must be taken to mean exactly what it says.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; As to the other petitioners, unless otherwise shown that they are situated under the catch-all "such other officer charged with the management of the business affairs," they may not be held liable under BP 33, as amended, for probable violations.
