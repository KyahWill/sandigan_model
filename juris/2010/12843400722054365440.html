				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For review is the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated February 20, 2008 and its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 8, 2008 in CA-G.R. CEB-SP No. 01641. The assailed decision affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 34, Iloilo City in Civil Case No. 04-28093; while the assailed resolution denied petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The undisputed facts are as follows:<br><br>Respondents Rizalina Gustilo Barrido and the Heirs of Romeo Barrido are the registered owners of a parcel of land with an area of 89,204 square meters covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 0-6318, situated in Barangay Apologista, Sara, Iloilo. On April 30, 2003, the government expropriated a portion of the property consisting of 43,461<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> sq m for distribution to the farmer-beneficiaries under the Land Reform Program. Petitioner offered respondents a total amount of P60,385.49 as just compensation, but respondents rejected the offer. Respondents instituted an original action before the RTC for the judicial determination of just compensation. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 04-28093.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In their separate Answers, petitioner and the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) insisted that the valuation made is correct, it being based on the formula laid down in Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27 as supplemented by Executive Order (E.O.) No. 228.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Under these issuances, the prescribed formula is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Land Value = Average Gross Production (AGP) x 2.5 x Government Support Price (GSP)<br></blockquote><br>On December 8, 2005, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> fixing the just compensation at P94, 797.09 per hectare, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered fixing the just compensation of land at P94,797.09 per hectare and ordering the LBP to pay plaintiffs Rizalina Gustilo Barrido and Heirs of Romeo Barrido the total sum of P411,997.63 as just compensation for the 4.3461 hectares taken by the government pursuant to P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 plus 12% interest per annum from March 21, 2003 until full payment.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC arrived at the valuation by taking the average between the amount found by the DAR using the formula prescribed by E.O. No. 228 and the market value of the property which is P175,700.00 per hectare. In addition, the court also awarded 12% interest in the form of damages in view of the delay in the payment of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied on March 1, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed the RTC decision in its entirety. Hence, the instant petition for review which assigns the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE DECISION DATED DECEMBER 8, 2005 AND ORDER DATED MARCH 1, 2006 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF ILOILO CITY, BRANCH 34 IN CIVIL CASE NO. 04-28093, FINDING THAT THE APPLICABLE LAW IN THE INSTANT CASE IS R.A. NO. 6657 AND NOT P.D. NO. 27 AND E.O. NO. 228.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>ASSUMING <i>ARGUENDO</i> THAT R.A. NO. 6657 IS THE APPLICABLE LAW, STILL THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE SAID DECISION AND ORDER OF THE TRIAL COURT THAT FIXED THE JUST COMPENSATION WHICH IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF R.A. NO. 6657 AS TRANSLATED INTO A BASIC FORMULA UNDER DAR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 5, SERIES OF 1998.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE SUBJECT DECISION AND ORDER OF THE TRIAL COURT THAT AWARDED IN FAVOR OF THE RESPONDENT TWELVE PERCENT (12%) INTEREST PER ANNUM FOR ALLEGED DELAY IN PAYMENT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The issues raised in the instant case are not novel. We have ruled in a number of cases that if just compensation is not settled prior to the passage of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657, it should be computed in accordance with said law even if the property was acquired under P.D. No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The fixing of just compensation should, therefore, be based on the parameters prescribed in R.A. No. 6657, with P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 having only suppletory effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Specifically, Section 17<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of R.A. 6657 is the principal basis of the computation for just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The factors set forth in this section have been translated into a basic formula outlined in DAR Administrative Order No. 5, series of 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> thus: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A. There shall be one basic formula for the valuation of lands covered by VOS or CA:<br><br>LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br><br>Where: LV = Land Value<br><br>CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br><br>CS = Comparable Sales<br><br>MV= Market Value per Tax Declaration<br><br>The above formula shall be used if all three factors are present, relevant and applicable.<br><br>A1. When the CS factor is not present and CNI and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br>LV = (CNI x 0.9) + (MV x 0.1)<br><br><br> A2. When the CNI factor is not present, and CS and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br>LV = (CS x 0.9) + (MV x 0.1)<br><br><br> A3. When both the CS and CNI are not present and only MV is applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br>LV = MV x 2<br><br>In no case shall the value of the land using the formula MV x 2 exceed the lowest value of land within the same estate under consideration or within the same <i>barangay</i> or municipality (in that order) approved by LBP within one (1) year from receipt of claimfolder.</blockquote><br>While the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function vested in the RTC acting as a Special Agrarian Court, the judge cannot abuse his discretion by not taking into full consideration the factors specifically identified by law and implementing rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Special Agrarian Courts are not at liberty to disregard the formula laid down in DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998, because unless an administrative order is declared invalid, courts have no option but to apply it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The courts cannot ignore, without violating the agrarian law, the formula provided by the DAR for the determination of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In this case, the RTC adopted a different formula in determining land valuation by considering the average between the findings of the DAR using the formula laid down in E.O. 228 and the market value of the property as stated in the tax declaration. This is obviously a departure from the mandate of the law and the DAR administrative order.<br><br>As the RTC based its valuation on a different formula and without taking into consideration the factors set forth in Section 17 of R.A. 6657, we are constrained to remand the case to the RTC for the determination of just compensation in accordance with this formula and applicable DAR regulations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the February 20, 2008 Decision and July 8, 2008 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
