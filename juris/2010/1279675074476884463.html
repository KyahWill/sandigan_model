Tolentino-Fuentes and Galindez, respectively, submitted the case for resolution based on the pleadings filed.<br><br>The Court finds Galindez liable for simple neglect of duty.<br><br>As a process server, Galindez has the duty to ensure that court notices are properly served to the parties.&nbsp; In <i>Atty. Dajao v. Lluch</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>The duty of a process server is vital to the machinery of the justice system. His primary duty is "to serve court notices" which precisely requires utmost care on his part by seeing to it that all notices assigned to him are duly served upon the parties.&nbsp; Thus, respondent should have carefully examined each of the "voluminous notices" assigned to him, scanning and reading every page to ensure that every notice to the party concerned will be served properly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the present case, Galindez failed to serve court notices properly:&nbsp; (1) Atty. Tolentino-Fuentes received a copy of the 15 March 2005 notice canceling the 29 March 2005 hearing only on 4 April 2005; (2) Atty. Tolentino-Fuentes received a copy of the 21 February 2006 order canceling the 6 and 14 March 2006 hearings only on 29 March 2006; (3) Atty. Tolentino's client received a copy of the 8 November 2005 order setting the preliminary hearing on 18 November 2005 only on 7 December 2005; (4) Atty. Tolentino's client received a copy of the 18 November 2005 order setting the formal offer of exhibits in evidence on 28 November 2005 only on 7 December 2005; (5) Atty. Tolentino-Fuentes received a copy of the 10 March 2006 notice canceling the 28 March 2006 hearing only on 29 March 2006; and (6) Atty. Tolentino-Fuentes received a copy of the 14 March 2006 notice canceling the 29 March 2006 hearing only on 29 March 2006.&nbsp; Because of Galindez's failure to serve court notices properly, Atty. Tolentino-Fuentes and her client incurred unnecessary expenses and had their time wasted. Also, Atty. Tolentino-Fuentes' other client was unable to participate in the presentation of evidence and cross-examination of witness.<br><br>Galindez's excuses for his failure to serve court notices properly are weak and unpersuasive.&nbsp; In <i>Seangio v. Parce</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court held that having a heavy workload is not a compelling reason to justify failure to perform one's duties properly.&nbsp; "Otherwise, every government employee charged with negligence and dereliction of duty [would] always proffer a similar excuse to escape punishment, to the great prejudice of public service."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; And in <i>Rodrigo-Ebron v. Adolfo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court held that financial difficulty is solely the employee's problem and the court should not be burdened by it.<br><br>In <i>Collado-Lacorte v.

Pablico</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and several other cases, the Court found process servers liable for simple neglect of duty for failure to serve court notices properly.&nbsp; Simple neglect of duty is failure to give proper attention to a required task.&nbsp; It signifies disregard of duty due to carelessness or indifference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Section 52(B)(1) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> classifies simple neglect of duty as a less grave offense punishable by one month and one day to six months suspension for the first offense.&nbsp; Section 54 states that the medium period of the penalty shall be imposed when there are no mitigating and aggravating circumstances.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds Michael Patrick A. Galindez, Process Server, Regional Trial Court, Branch 33, Davao City, <b>GUILTY</b> of simple neglect of duty.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Court <b>SUSPENDS</b> him from office for three (3) months without pay and <b>STERNLY WARNS</b> him that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br>Carpio, J., Chairperson, Nachura, Leonardo-De Castro,* Peralta, And
