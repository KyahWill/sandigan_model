Antonieta claimed that in 1946, she had entered into an agreement with Conchita and Buenaventura Remotigue, Rafael Jarantilla, and Rosita and Vivencio Deocampo to engage in business.&nbsp; Antonieta alleged that the initial contribution of property and money came from the heirs' inheritance, and her subsequent annual investment of seven thousand five hundred pesos (P7,500.00) as additional capital came from the proceeds of her farm.&nbsp; Antonieta also alleged that from 1946-1969, she had helped in the management of the business they co-owned without receiving any salary.&nbsp; Her salary was supposedly rolled back into the business as additional investments in her behalf.&nbsp; Antonieta further claimed co-ownership of certain properties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (the subject real properties) in the name of the defendants since the only way the defendants could have purchased these properties were through the partnership as they had no other source of income.<br><br>The respondents, including petitioner herein, in their Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> denied having formed a partnership with Antonieta in 1946.&nbsp; They claimed that she was in no position to do so as she was still in school at that time.

For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact. Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Since the Court of Appeals did not fully adopt the factual findings of the RTC, this Court, in resolving the questions of law that are now in issue, shall look into the facts only in so far as the two courts <i>a quo</i> differed in their appreciation thereof.<br><br>The RTC found that an unregistered partnership existed since 1946 which was affirmed in the 1957 document, the "Acknowledgement of Participating Capital."&nbsp; The RTC used this as its basis for giving Antonieta Jarantilla an 8% share in the three businesses listed therein and in the other businesses and real properties of the respondents as they had supposedly acquired these through funds from the partnership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, agreed with the RTC as to Antonieta's 8% share in the business enumerated in the Acknowledgement of Participating Capital, but not as to her share in the other corporations and real properties.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ruled that Antonieta's claim of 8% is based on the "Acknowledgement of Participating Capital," a duly notarized document which was specific as to the subject of its coverage.&nbsp; Hence, there was no reason to pattern her share in the other corporations from her share in the partnership's businesses.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also said that her claim in the respondents' real properties was more "precarious" as these were all covered by certificates of title which served as the best evidence as to all the matters contained therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Since petitioner's claim was essentially the same as Antonieta's, the Court of Appeals also ruled that petitioner be given his 6% share in the same businesses listed in the Acknowledgement of Participating Capital.<br><br>Factual findings of the trial court, when confirmed by the Court of Appeals, are final and conclusive except in the following cases: (1) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (2) when there is a grave abuse of discretion; (3) when the finding is grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (4) when the judgment of the Court of Appeals is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) when the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; and (10) when the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In this case, we find no error in the ruling of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Both the petitioner and Antonieta Jarantilla characterize their relationship with the respondents as a co-ownership, but in the same breath, assert that a verbal partnership was formed in 1946 and was affirmed in the 1957 Acknowledgement of Participating Capital.<br><br>There is a co-ownership when an undivided thing or right belongs to different persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; It is a partnership when two or more persons bind themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The Court, in <i>Pascual v.

The Collector of Internal Revenue<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></b> </i>to further elucidate on the distinctions between a co-ownership and a partnership, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>I wish however to make the following observation: Article 1769 of the new Civil Code lays down the rule for determining when a transaction should be deemed a partnership or a co-ownership.&nbsp; Said article paragraphs 2 and 3, provides;<br><br>(2) Co-ownership or co-possession does not itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners or co-possessors do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property;<br><br>(3) The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived;<br><br><i>From the above it appears that the fact that those who agree to form a co- ownership share or do not share any profits made by the use of the property held in common does not convert their venture into a partnership. Or the sharing of the gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership whether or not the persons sharing therein have a joint or common right or interest in the property. This only means that, aside from the circumstance of profit, the presence of other elements constituting partnership is necessary, such as the clear intent to form a partnership, the existence of a juridical personality different from that of the individual partners, and the freedom to transfer or assign any interest in the property by one with the consent of the others.</i><br><br><i>It is evident that an isolated transaction whereby two or more persons contribute funds to buy certain real estate for profit in the absence of other circumstances showing a contrary intention cannot be considered a partnership.</i><br><br>Persons who contribute property or funds for a common enterprise and agree to share the gross returns of that enterprise in proportion to their contribution, but who severally retain the title to their respective contribution, are not thereby rendered partners. They have no common stock or capital, and no community of interest as principal proprietors in the business itself which the proceeds derived.<br><br>A joint purchase of land, by two, does not constitute a co-partnership in respect thereto; nor does an agreement to share the profits and losses on the sale of land create a partnership; the parties are only tenants in common.<br><br>Where plaintiff, his brother, and another agreed to become owners of a single tract of realty, holding as tenants in common, and to divide the profits of disposing of it, the brother and the other not being entitled to share in plaintiff's commission, no partnership existed as between the three parties, whatever their relation may have been as to third parties.<br><br><i>In order to constitute a partnership inter sese there must be: (a) An intent to form the same; (b) generally participating in both profits and losses; (c) and such a community of interest, as far as third persons are concerned as enables each party to make contract, manage the business, and dispose of the whole property.&nbsp; x x x.</i><br><br>The common ownership of property does not itself create a partnership between the owners, though they may use it for the purpose of making gains; and they may, without becoming partners, agree among themselves as to the management, and use of such property and the application of the proceeds therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Under Article 1767 of the Civil Code, there are two essential elements in a contract of partnership: <i>(a) an agreement to contribute money, property or industry to a common fund; and (b) intent to divide the profits among the contracting parties</i>.&nbsp; The first element is undoubtedly present in the case at bar, for, admittedly, all the parties in this case have agreed to, and did, contribute money and property to a common fund.&nbsp; <i>Hence, the issue narrows down to their intent in acting as they did</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; It is not denied that all the parties in this case have agreed to contribute capital to a common fund to be able to later on share its profits.&nbsp; They have admitted this fact, agreed to its veracity, and even submitted one common documentary evidence to prove such partnership - the Acknowledgement of Participating Capital.<br><br>As this case revolves around the legal effects of the Acknowledgement of Participating Capital, it would be instructive to examine the pertinent portions of this document:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF </b><br><b>PARTICIPATING CAPITAL</b><br></center><br>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:<br><br>That we, the spouses Buenaventura Remotigue and Conchita Jarantilla de Remotigue, both of legal age, Filipinos and residents of Loyola Heights, Quezon City, P.I. hereby state:<br><br>That the Manila Athletic Supply at 712 Raon, Manila, the Remotigue Trading of Calle Real, Iloilo City and the Remotigue Trading, Cotabato Branch, Cotabato, P.I., all dealing in athletic goods and equipments, and general merchandise are recorded in their respective books with Buenaventura Remotigue as the registered owner and are being operated by them as such:<br><br>That they are not the only owners of the capital of the three establishments and their participation in the capital of the three establishments together with the other co-owners as of the year 1952 are stated as follows:<br><br><table  ="" width="90%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="80%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1.

Ramirez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court held that since a partnership is a separate juridical entity, the shares to be paid out to the partners is necessarily limited only to its total resources, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Since it is the partnership, as a separate and distinct entity, that must refund the shares of the partners, the amount to be refunded is necessarily limited to its total resources.&nbsp; In other words, it can only pay out what it has in its coffers, which consists of all its assets.&nbsp; However, before the partners can be paid their shares, the creditors of the partnership must first be compensated.

In turn, implied trusts are either resulting or constructive trusts. Resulting trusts are based on the equitable doctrine that valuable consideration and not legal title determines the equitable title or interest and are presumed always to have been contemplated by the parties. They arise from the nature or circumstances of the consideration involved in a transaction whereby one person thereby becomes invested with legal title but is obligated in equity to hold his legal title for the benefit of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On proving the existence of a trust, this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Respondent has presented only bare assertions that a trust was created. Noting the need to prove the existence of a trust, this Court has held thus:<br><br><blockquote>"As a rule, the burden of proving the existence of a trust is on the party asserting its existence, and such proof must be clear and satisfactorily show the existence of the trust and its elements. While implied trusts may be proved by oral evidence, the evidence must be trustworthy and received by the courts with extreme caution, and should not be made to rest on loose, equivocal or indefinite declarations. Trustworthy evidence is required because oral evidence can easily be fabricated." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>The petitioner has failed to prove that there exists a trust over the subject real properties.&nbsp; Aside from his bare allegations, he has failed to show that the respondents used the partnership's money to purchase the said properties. Even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that <b>some</b> partnership income was used to acquire these properties, the petitioner should have successfully shown that these funds came from his share in the partnership profits.&nbsp; After all, by his own admission, and as stated in the Acknowledgement of Participating Capital, he owned a mere 6% equity in the partnership.<br><br>In essence, the petitioner is claiming his 6% share in the subject real properties, by relying on his own self-serving testimony and the equally biased testimony of Antonieta Jarantilla.&nbsp; Petitioner has not presented evidence, other than these unsubstantiated testimonies, to prove that the respondents did not have the means to fund their other businesses and real properties without the partnership's income.&nbsp; On the other hand, the respondents have not only, by testimonial evidence, proven their case against the petitioner, but have also presented sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate their claims, allegations and defenses.&nbsp; They presented preponderant proof on how they acquired and funded such properties in addition to tax receipts and tax declarations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; It has been held that "while tax declarations and realty tax receipts do not conclusively prove ownership, they may constitute strong evidence of ownership when accompanied by possession for a period sufficient for prescription."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, it is a rule in this jurisdiction that testimonial evidence cannot prevail over documentary evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; This Court had on several occasions, expressed our disapproval on using mere self-serving testimonies to support one's claim.&nbsp; In <i>Ocampo v. Ocampo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> a case on partition of a co-ownership, we held that:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners assert that their claim of co-ownership of the property was sufficiently proved by their witnesses -- Luisa Ocampo-Llorin and Melita Ocampo.&nbsp; We disagree. Their testimonies cannot prevail over the array of documents presented by Belen.&nbsp; A claim of ownership cannot be based simply on the testimonies of witnesses; much less on those of interested parties, self-serving as they are.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>It is true that a certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership or title over the particular property described therein. Registration in the Torrens system does not create or vest title as registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership; hence, this cannot deprive an aggrieved party of a remedy in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; However, petitioner asserts ownership over portions of the subject real properties on the strength of his own admissions and on the testimony of Antonieta Jarantilla. As held by this Court in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Orfinada, Sr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>: <br><br><blockquote>Indeed, a Torrens title is generally conclusive evidence of ownership of the land referred to therein, and a strong presumption exists that a Torrens title was regularly issued and valid. A Torrens title is incontrovertible against any <i>informacion possessoria</i>, of other title existing prior to the issuance thereof not annotated on the Torrens title. Moreover, persons dealing with property covered by a Torrens certificate of title are not required to go beyond what appears on its face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>As we have settled that this action never really was for partition of a co-ownership, to permit petitioner's claim on these properties is to allow a collateral, indirect attack on respondents' admitted titles. In the words of the Court of Appeals, "such evidence cannot overpower the conclusiveness of these certificates of title, more so since plaintiff's [petitioner's] claims amount to a collateral attack, which is prohibited under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, the Property Registration Decree."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><blockquote>SEC. 48. <i>Certificate not subject to collateral attack</i>. - A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack.&nbsp; It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law.</blockquote><br>This Court has deemed an action or proceeding to be "an attack on a title when its objective is to nullify the title, thereby challenging the judgment pursuant to which the title was decreed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Aguilar v. Alfaro</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> this Court further distinguished between a direct and an indirect or collateral attack, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A collateral attack transpires when, in another action to obtain a different relief and as an incident to the present action, an attack is made against the judgment granting the title. This manner of attack is to be distinguished from a direct attack against a judgment granting the title, through an action whose main objective is to annul, set aside, or enjoin the enforcement of such judgment if not yet implemented, or to seek recovery if the property titled under the judgment had been disposed of.&nbsp; x x x.</blockquote><br>Petitioner's only piece of documentary evidence is the Acknowledgement of Participating Capital, which as discussed above, failed to prove that the real properties he is claiming co-ownership of were acquired out of the proceeds of the businesses covered by such document. Therefore, petitioner's theory has no factual or legal leg to stand on.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED </b>and the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
