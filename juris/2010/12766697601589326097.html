				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The parties to this Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> seek this Court's approval of their Compromise Agreement.<br><br>On April 1, 2002, respondent Vicente T. Manuel filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for ejectment with damages against Alfredo Zabala before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Balanga, Bataan. Respondent alleged that he was in actual and peaceful possession of a fishpond (Lot No. 1483) located in Ibayo, Balanga City. On October 15, 2001, Zabala allegedly entered the fishpond without authority, and dumped soil into the fishpond without an Environment Compliance Certificate. Zabala continued such action until the time of the filing of the Complaint, killing the crabs and the <i>bangus</i> that respondent was raising in the fishpond. Thus, respondent asked that Zabala be restrained from touching and destroying the fishpond; that Zabala be ejected therefrom permanently; and for actual and moral damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>Zabala promptly moved for the dismissal of the Complaint for non-compliance with the requirement under the Local Government Code to bring the matter first to <i>barangay</i> conciliation before filing an action in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondent subsequently filed a Motion for Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on the ground of petitioner's failure to file a responsive pleading or answer.<br><br>The MTCC, in an Order dated May 27, 2003, granted Zabala's motion and dismissed the Complaint, holding that respondent indeed violated the requirement of <i>barangay</i> conciliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Respondent then appealed the ruling to the Balanga, Bataan Regional Trial Court (RTC).<br><br>In a decision dated March 30, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the RTC reversed the MTCC's May 27, 2003 Order and rendered judgment directing Zabala, his heirs or subalterns to immediately vacate Lot No. 1483 and restore respondent to his peaceful possession thereof. The RTC also directed Zabala to pay respondent actual damages, moral damages, and attorney's fees. The RTC found that Zabala did not, in fact, file an answer to the Complaint. Thus, under Section 6 of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, respondent was entitled to judgment on the pleadings. Based on the allegations in respondent's Complaint, the RTC held that respondent was entitled to the reliefs prayed for.<br><br>Zabala then filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>On December 19, 2008, the CA promulgated a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> upholding the RTC's reversal of the MTCC's Order. The CA held that, based on the allegations in the Complaint, the requirement for prior conciliation proceedings under the Local Government Code was inapplicable to the suit before the MTCC, the action being one for ejectment and damages, with application for a writ of preliminary injunction, even without the use of those actual terms in the Complaint. However, the CA granted Zabala's prayer for the deletion of the awards for actual and moral damages, and for attorney's fees.<br><br>Zabala filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the CA denied in a Resolution dated August 26, 2009.<br><br>On October 9, 2009, Zabala's heirs filed this Verified Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They prayed for the annulment of the CA's December 19, 2008 Decision and August 26, 2009 Resolution, and for the reinstatement of the MTCC's May 27, 2003 Order. In the alternative, they prayed that the Court remand the records to the MTCC, so that they could file their Answer, and that due proceedings be undertaken before judgment.<br><br>In a Resolution dated November 18, 2009, respondents were required to file their Comment on the Petition.<br><br>The parties now present before this Court a Compromise Agreement, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">COMPROMISE AGREEMENT</b><br></div><br>THE PARTIES represented by their lawyers, respectfully submit the following compromise agreement:<br><br>1.
