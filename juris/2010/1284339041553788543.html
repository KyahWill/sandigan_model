Petitioner further claims that since respondent did not file the claim on behalf of Prism, it has no legal standing to claim the refund. To rule otherwise would result to the unjust enrichment of respondent, who never shelled-out any amount to pay the royalty taxes.&nbsp; Petitioner, thus, posits that the real party-in-interest to file a claim for refund of the erroneously withheld taxes is Prism.&nbsp; He cites as basis the case of <i>Silkair (Singapore) Pte, Ltd. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><i> </i>where it was ruled that the proper party to file a refund is the statutory taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, assuming that respondent is the proper party, petitioner counters that it is still not entitled to any refund because the payments made to Prism are taxable as royalties, having been made in consideration for the use of the programs owned by Prism.<br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that it is the proper party to file a claim for refund as it has the statutory and primary responsibility and liability to withhold and remit the taxes to the BIR.&nbsp; It points out that under the withholding tax system, the agent-payor becomes a payee by fiction of law because the law makes the agent personally liable for the tax arising from the breach of its duty to withhold.&nbsp; Thus, the fact that respondent is not in any way related to Prism is immaterial.<br><br>Moreover, respondent asserts that the payments made to Prism do not fall under the definition of royalties since the agreements are for programming and consultancy services only, wherein Prism undertakes to perform services for the creation, development or the bringing into existence of software applications solely for the satisfaction of the peculiar needs and requirements of respondent.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br><b><i>Withholding agent may file a claim for refund</i></b><br><br>Sections 204(c) and 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) provide:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 204. Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate, and Refund or Credit Taxes. - The Commissioner may -<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(C)&nbsp; Credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally received or penalties imposed without authority, refund the value of internal revenue stamps when they are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and, in his discretion, redeem or change unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for use and refund their value upon proof of destruction. No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed <b>unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner a claim for credit or refund within two (2) years after the payment of the tax or penalty:</b> Provided, however, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 229.&nbsp; Recovery of Tax Erroneously or Illegally Collected. - No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected, <b>until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner;</b> but such suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.<br><br>In any case, no such suit or proceeding shall be filed after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty regardless of any supervening cause that may arise after payment: Provided, however, That the Commissioner may, even without a written claim therefor, refund or credit any tax, where on the face of the return upon which payment was made, such payment appears clearly to have been erroneously paid.<i> </i>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Pursuant to the foregoing, the person entitled to claim a tax refund is the taxpayer.&nbsp; However, in case the taxpayer does not file a claim for refund, the withholding agent may file the claim.<br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Procter &amp; Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><i> </i>a withholding agent was considered a proper party to file a claim for refund of the withheld taxes of its foreign parent company.&nbsp; Pertinent portions of the Decision read:<br><br><blockquote>The term "taxpayer" is defined in our NIRC as referring to "any person subject to tax imposed by the Title [on Tax on Income]."&nbsp; It thus becomes important to note that under Section 53(c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the NIRC, the withholding agent who is "required to deduct and withhold any tax" is made "personally liable for such tax" and indeed is indemnified against any claims and demands which the stockholder might wish to make in questioning the amount of payments effected by the withholding agent in accordance with the provisions of the NIRC. The withholding agent, P&amp;G-Phil., is directly and independently liable for the correct amount of the tax that should be withheld from the dividend remittances. The withholding agent is, moreover, subject to and liable for deficiency assessments, surcharges and penalties should the amount of the tax withheld be finally found to be less than the amount that should have been withheld under law.<br><br>A "person liable for tax" has been held to be a "person subject to tax" and properly considered a "taxpayer."&nbsp; The terms "liable for tax" and "subject to tax" both connote legal obligation or duty to pay a tax. <b>It is very difficult, indeed conceptually impossible, to consider a person who is statutorily made "liable for tax" as not "subject to tax." By any reasonable standard, such a person should be regarded as a party in interest, or as a person having sufficient legal interest, to bring a suit for refund of taxes he believes were illegally collected from him.</b><br><br>In <i>Philippine Guaranty Company, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>, this Court pointed out that a withholding agent is in fact the agent both of the government and of the taxpayer, and that the withholding agent is not an ordinary government agent:<br><br><blockquote>"The law sets no condition for the personal liability of the withholding agent to attach. The reason is to compel the withholding agent to withhold the tax under all circumstances. In effect, the responsibility for the collection of the tax as well as the payment thereof is concentrated upon the person over whom the Government has jurisdiction. Thus, the withholding agent is constituted the agent of both the Government and the taxpayer. With respect to the collection and/or withholding of the tax, he is the Government's agent. In regard to the filing of the necessary income tax return and the payment of the tax to the Government, he is the agent of the taxpayer. The withholding agent, therefore, is no ordinary government agent especially because under Section 53 (c) he is held personally liable for the tax he is duty bound to withhold; whereas the Commissioner and his deputies are not made liable by law."</blockquote><br>If, as pointed out in <i>Philippine Guaranty</i>, <b>the withholding agent is also an agent of the beneficial owner of the dividends with respect to the filing of the necessary income tax return and with respect to actual payment of the tax to the government, such authority may reasonably be held to include the authority to file a claim for refund and to bring an action for recovery of such claim. </b>This implied authority is especially warranted where, as in the instant case, the withholding agent is the wholly owned subsidiary of the parent-stockholder and therefore, at all times, under the effective control of such parent-stockholder. In the circumstances of this case, it seems particularly unreal to deny the implied authority of P&amp;G-Phil. to claim a refund and to commence an action for such refund.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We believe and so hold that, under the circumstances of this case, P&amp;G-Phil. is properly regarded as a "taxpayer" within the meaning of Section 309,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> NIRC, and as impliedly authorized to file the claim for refund and the suit to recover such claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Petitioner, however, submits that this ruling applies only when the withholding agent and the taxpayer are related parties, <i>i.e</i>., where the withholding agent is a wholly owned subsidiary of the taxpayer.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Although such relation between the taxpayer and the withholding agent is a factor that increases the latter's legal interest to file a claim for refund, there is nothing in the decision to suggest that such relationship is required or that the lack of such relation deprives the withholding agent of the right to file a claim for refund. Rather, what is clear in the decision is that a withholding agent has a legal right to file a claim for refund for two reasons.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, he is considered a "taxpayer" under the NIRC as he is personally liable for the withholding tax as well as for deficiency assessments, surcharges, and penalties, should the amount of the tax withheld be finally found to be less than the amount that should have been withheld under law.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, as an agent of the taxpayer, his authority to file the necessary income tax return and to remit the tax withheld to the government impliedly includes the authority to file a claim for refund and to bring an action for recovery of such claim.<br><br>In this connection, it is however significant to add that while the withholding agent has the right to recover the taxes erroneously or illegally collected, he nevertheless has the obligation to remit the same to the principal taxpayer.&nbsp; As an agent of the taxpayer, it is his duty to return what he has recovered; otherwise, he would be unjustly enriching himself at the expense of the principal taxpayer from whom the taxes were withheld, and from whom he derives his legal right to file a claim for refund.<br><br>As to <i>Silkair (Singapore) Pte, Ltd. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> cited by the petitioner, we find the same inapplicable as it involves excise taxes, not withholding taxes.&nbsp; In that case, it was ruled that the proper party to question, or seek a refund of, an indirect tax "is the statutory taxpayer, the person on whom the tax is imposed by law and who paid the same even if he shifts the burden thereof to another."<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find no error on the part of the CTA in upholding respondent's right as a withholding agent to file a claim for refund.<br><br><b><i>The payments for the CM and the SIM Application Agreements constitute </i></b><br><br><b><i>"business profits" </i></b><br><br>Under the RP-Malaysia Tax Treaty, the term royalties is defined as payments of any kind received as consideration for: "(i) the use of, or the right to use, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (ii) the use of, or the right to use, cinematograph films, or tapes for radio or television broadcasting."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; These are taxed at the rate of 25% of the gross amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Under the same Treaty, the "business profits" of an enterprise of a Contracting State is taxable only in that State, unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The term "permanent establishment" is defined as a fixed place of business where the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; However, even if there is no fixed place of business, an enterprise of a Contracting State is deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State if it carries on supervisory activities in that other State for more than six months in connection with a construction, installation or assembly project which is being undertaken in that other State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, it was established during the trial that Prism does not have a permanent establishment in the Philippines. Hence, "business profits" derived from Prism's dealings with respondent are not taxable.&nbsp; The question is whether the payments made to Prism under the SDM, CM, and SIM Application agreements are "business profits" and not royalties.<br><br>Paragraph 1.3 of the Programming Services (Schedule A) of the SDM Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote>1.3 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)<br><br>The SDM shall be installed by PRISM, including the SDM Libraries, <b>the IPR of which shall be retained by PRISM</b>.
