But just because they have agreed to the amount thereof fixed by the RARAD does not, however, mean that his decision has become final and executory. It must be remembered that the law requires the consensus of three (3) parties in the determination of just compensation: the landowner's, the DAR's and the LBP's. Since the LBP did not agree with the DAR's decision, then it had a right to invoke the court a quo's jurisdiction. The RARAD's decision will not serve to bar this subsequent suit for the simple reason that said decision has not attained finality as not all the parties concerned agreed to the amount of just compensation he had fixed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote><br><u><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center></u><br>Petitioners raise the following arguments:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>WHETHER THE SUMMARY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING BEING CONDUCTED BY THE DARAB FOR THE DETERMINATION FOR JUST COMPENSATION OF LANDS PLACED UNDER THE COVERAGE OF CARP IS IN ACTUALITY A SALE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE LANDOWNERS AND DAR WHICH CAN BE CONCLUDED AND CONSUMMATED BY THE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE DECISION OF THE RARAD DATED 29 MARCH 2000 FIXING THE JUST COMPENSATION FOR PETITIONER'S PROPERTY AT P32,965,408.46 HAD BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY UPON FAILURE OF RESPONDENT LAND BANK TO INTERPOSE AN APPEAL WITH THE SUPREME COURT AS MANDATED BY SECTION 60 OF R.A.

And since it was the DARAB, through the RARAD, which first assumed jurisdiction on the issue of just compensation for petitioners' land, then the SAC is precluded from assuming jurisdiction on the same issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Convinced that only the landowners can invoke the jurisdiction of the SAC when they do not agree to the amount of just compensation proposed by DAR, petitioners also question LBP's personality to institute the petition with the SAC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Petitioners also accuse LBP of forum shopping for trifling with the RARAD's decision which petitioners claim to have attained finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As a new theory in this petition for review, petitioners submit that when they accepted the RARAD's decision of 29 March 2000 fixing the just compensation of the land at P32,965,408.46, that acceptance was the operative act that consummated the contract/agreement involving the voluntary sale of their property to the Republic of the Philippines under CARP Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>LBP claims that SAC has original and exclusive jurisdiction in just compensation cases, and, as LBP has timely filed an original action for determination of just compensation with the SAC, the decision of the RARAD was <i>ipso facto </i>vacated. In sum, the original action filed by LBP with the SAC automatically barred the RARAD's decision from attaining finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><u><center><b><i>New issues cannot be raised for the first time on appeal</i></b><br></center></u><br>The records show that petitioners were declared in default in the SAC case for their failure to file an answer to the complaint. Hence, the SAC proceeded on hearing LBP's evidence <i>ex parte</i>. After due trial, the SAC rendered its decision dated 15 August 2001, which was the subject of petitioners' appeal to the CA.<br><br>In its petition for review with the CA, petitioners never put as an issue the alleged existence of a consummated sale between the DAR and the petitioners under RA 6657. What petitioners questioned was SAC's jurisdiction over determination of just compensation cases involving lands covered by RA 6657. Furthermore, petitioners insist that LBP has no legal personality to institute a case for determination of just compensation against landowners with the SAC. It is only in the present petition for review that petitioners raised the alleged existence of a consummated sale between the DAR and petitioners.<br><br>The argument that a consummated sale between the DAR and petitioners existed upon petitioners' acceptance of the valuation made in the RARAD's decision of 29 March 2000 is an issue being raised for the first time. Section 15, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules of Court provides that the appellant "may include in his assignment of errors any question of law or fact that has been raised in the court below and which is within the issues framed by the parties."<br><br>A perusal of the questions raised in the SAC and the CA shows that the issue on the existence of a consummated sale between the DAR and petitioners was not among the issues therein. Hence, this issue is being raised for the first time on appeal.<br><br>It is a fundamental rule that this Court will not resolve issues that were not properly brought and ventilated in the lower courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Questions raised on appeal must be within the issues framed by the parties and, consequently, issues not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>An issue, which was neither averred in the complaint nor raised during the trial in the lower courts, cannot be raised for the first time on appeal because it would be offensive to the basic rule of fair play and justice, and would be violative of the constitutional right to due process of the other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><u><center><b><i>Jurisdiction of the SAC in just compensation cases</i></b><br></center></u><br>The second, fourth, and fifth issues, being inter-related, will be discussed together, in relation to the jurisdiction of the SAC in just compensation cases.<br><br>Petitioners insist that the RARAD, in exercising quasi-judicial powers, has concurrent jurisdiction with the SAC in just compensation cases. Hence, the RARAD's decision, being a final determination of the appraisal of just compensation by the DARAB, should be appealed to this Court and not the SAC.<br><br>For its part, LBP insists that the RARAD/DARAB decision is merely a preliminary valuation, since the courts have the ultimate power to decide the question on just compensation.<br><br>The procedure for the determination of just compensation under RA 6657, as summarized by this Court in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Banal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> commences with LBP determining the value of the lands under the land reform program. Using LBP's valuation, the DAR makes an offer to the landowner through a notice sent to the landowner, pursuant to Section 16(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of RA 6657. In case the landowner rejects the offer, the DAR adjudicator<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> conducts a summary administrative proceeding to determine the compensation for the land by requiring the landowner, the LBP and other interested parties to submit evidence as to the just compensation for the land. A party who disagrees with the decision of the DAR adjudicator may bring the matter to the RTC designated as a Special Agrarian Court for final determination of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioners' argument, the PARAD/RARAD/DARAB do not exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the SAC in just compensation cases. The determination of just compensation is judicial in nature.<br><br>The original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SAC in just compensation cases is not a novel issue. This has been extensively discussed in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Belista</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sections 50 and 57 of RA No. 6657 provide:<br><br>Section 50. <i>Quasi-judicial Powers of the DAR</i>. - The DAR is hereby vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) x x x<br><br>Section 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction</i>. - The Special Agrarian Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. x x x<br><br>The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision.<br><br>Clearly, under Section 50, DAR has primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DA and the DENR. Further exception to the DAR's original and exclusive jurisdiction are all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under RA No. 6657, which are within the jurisdiction of the RTC sitting as a Special Agrarian Court. Thus, jurisdiction on just compensation cases for the taking of lands under RA No. 6657 is vested in the courts.<br><br>In <i>Republic v. CA</i>, the Court explained:<br><br>Thus, Special Agrarian Courts, which are Regional Trial Courts, are given original and exclusive jurisdiction over two categories of cases, to wit: (1) "all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners" and (2) "the prosecution of all criminal offenses under [R.A. No. 6657]." The provisions of §50 must be construed in harmony with this provision by considering cases involving the determination of just compensation and criminal cases for violations of R.A. No. 6657 as excepted from the plenitude of power conferred on the DAR. Indeed, there is a reason for this distinction. The DAR is an administrative agency which cannot be granted jurisdiction over cases of eminent domain (for such are takings under R.A. No. 6657) and over criminal cases. Thus, in <i>EPZA v. Dulay</i> and <i>Sumulong v. Guerrero</i> - we held that the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which cannot be vested in administrative agencies, while in <i>Scoty's Department Store v. Micaller</i>, we struck down a law granting the then Court of Industrial Relations jurisdiction to try criminal cases for violations of the Industrial Peace Act. <br><br>In a number of cases, the Court has upheld the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the RTC, sitting as SAC, over all petitions for determination of just compensation to landowners in accordance with Section 57 of RA No. 6657.<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco</i>, the Court upheld the RTC's jurisdiction over Wycoco's petition for determination of just compensation even where no summary administrative proceedings was held before the DARAB which has primary jurisdiction over the determination of land valuation. The Court held:<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>, the landowner filed an action for determination of just compensation without waiting for the completion of DARAB's re-evaluation of the land. This, notwithstanding, the Court held that the trial court properly acquired jurisdiction because of its exclusive and original jurisdiction over determination of just compensation, thus -<br><br>... It is clear from Sec. 57 that the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has "original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners." This "original and exclusive" jurisdiction of the RTC would be undermined if the DAR would vest in administrative officials original jurisdiction in compensation cases and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions. Thus, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from Sec. 57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into an appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Sec. 57 and, therefore, would be void. Thus, direct resort to the SAC [Special Agrarian Court] by private respondent is valid.<br><br>x x x<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad</i>, wherein Land Bank questioned the alleged failure of private respondents to seek reconsideration of the DAR's valuation, but instead filed a petition to fix just compensation with the RTC, the Court said:<br><br>At any rate, in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank v. CA</i>, we held that there is nothing contradictory between the DAR's primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, which includes the determination of questions of just compensation, and the original and exclusive jurisdiction of regional trial courts over all petitions for the determination of just compensation. The first refers to administrative proceedings, while the second refers to judicial proceedings.<br><br>In accordance with settled principles of administrative law, primary jurisdiction is vested in the DAR to determine in a preliminary manner the just compensation for the lands taken under the agrarian reform program, but such determination is subject to challenge before the courts. The resolution of just compensation cases for the taking of lands under agrarian reform is, after all, essentially a judicial function.<br><br>Thus, the trial court did not err in taking cognizance of the case as the determination of just compensation is a function addressed to the courts of justice.<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada</i>, where the issue was whether the SAC erred in assuming jurisdiction over respondent's petition for determination of just compensation despite the pendency of the administrative proceedings before the DARAB, the Court stated that:<br><br>It would be well to emphasize that the taking of property under RA No. 6657 is an exercise of the power of eminent domain by the State. The valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies. Consequently, the SAC properly took cognizance of respondent's petition for determination of just compensation.</blockquote><br>We do not agree with petitioners' submission that the SAC erred in assuming jurisdiction over the petition for determination of just compensation filed by LBP after the RARAD rendered its 29 March 2000 decision. In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we had the occasion to rule that the SAC acquired jurisdiction over the action for the determination of just compensation even during the pendency of the DARAB proceedings, for the following reason:<br><br><blockquote>It is clear from Sec. 57 that the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has "original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners." This "original and excusive" jurisdiction of the RTC would be undermined if the DAR would vest in administrative officials original jurisdiction in compensation cases and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions. Thus, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from Sec. 57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into an appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Sec. 57 and therefore would be void. Thus, direct resort to the SAC by private respondent is valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote> <br>In fact, RA 6657 does not make DAR's valuation absolutely binding as the amount payable by LBP. A reading of Section 18 of RA 6657 shows that the courts, and not the DAR, make the final determination of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is well-settled that the DAR's land valuation is only preliminary and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party. The courts will still have the right to review with finality the determination in the exercise of what is admittedly a judicial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>It must be emphasized that the taking of property under RA 6657 is an exercise of the State's power of eminent domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> When the parties cannot agree on the amount of just compensation, only the exercise of judicial power can settle the dispute with binding effect on the winning and losing parties. On the other hand, the determination of just compensation in the RARAD/DARAB requires the voluntary agreement of the parties. Unless the parties agree, there is no settlement of the dispute before the RARAD/DARAB, except if the aggrieved party fails to file a petition for just compensation on time before the RTC.<br><br>LBP thus correctly filed a petition for determination of just compensation with the SAC, which has the original and exclusive jurisdiction in just compensation cases under RA 6657. DAR's valuation, being preliminary in nature, could not have attained finality, as it is only the courts that can resolve the issue on just compensation. Consequently, the SAC properly took cognizance of LBP's petition for determination of just compensation.<br><br><center><b><i>Legal personality of LBP to contest the DAR decision</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioners submit that LBP has no legal personality and has no cause of action to institute the agrarian case before the SAC. Petitioners argue that LBP cannot on its own, separate and independent of DAR, file an original action for determination of just compensation against the RARAD and petitioners, because it is a usurpation of the exclusive authority of DAR to initiate and prosecute expropriation proceedings. Petitioners thus insist that in land acquisition cases, the only real parties-in-interest are the landowners and the government, the latter acting through the DAR.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Section 18 of RA 6657 states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 18. <i>Valuation and Mode of Compensation. -- </i>The LBP shall compensate the landowner in such amount as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and the LBP x x x, or as may be finally determined by the court as the just compensation for the land.<br></blockquote><br>This provision clearly states that there should be a consensus among the landowner, the DAR, and the LBP on the amount of just compensation. Therefore, LBP is not merely a nominal party in the determination of just compensation. RA 6657 directs LBP to pay the DAR's land valuation <u>only if the landowner, the DAR and LBP agree</u> on the amount of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The DAR proceedings are but preliminary, and becomes final only when the parties have all agreed to the amount of just compensation fixed by the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> However, should a party disagree with the amount fixed by DAR, then the jurisdiction of the SAC may be invoked for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>There is likewise no merit in petitioners' allegation that LBP lacks <i>locus standi</i> to file a case with the SAC, separate and independent from the DAR. In <i>Heirs of Roque F. Tabuena v. Land Bank of the Philippines,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> we ruled that the LBP is an indispensable party in expropriation proceedings under RA 6657, and thus, has the legal personality to question the determination of just compensation, independent of the DAR:<br><br><blockquote>LBP is an agency created primarily to provide financial support in all phases of agrarian reform pursuant to Section 74 of Republic Act (RA) No. 3844<sup> </sup>and Section 64 of RA No. 6657.<sup> </sup>It is vested with the primary responsibility and authority in the valuation and compensation of covered landholdings to carry out the full implementation of the Agrarian Reform Program.<sup> </sup>It may agree with the DAR and the land owner as to the amount of just compensation to be paid to the latter and may also disagree with them and bring the matter to court for judicial determination.<br><br>Once an expropriation proceeding for the acquisition of private agricultural lands is commenced by the DAR, the indispensable role of LBP begins, which clearly shows that there would never be a judicial determination of just compensation absent respondent LBP's participation. Logically, it follows that respondent is an indispensable party in an action for the determination of just compensation in cases arising from agrarian reform program; as such, it can file an appeal independently of DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. AMS Farming Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we ruled that LBP is a real party-in-interest which could file its own appeal in agrarian reform cases, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The Court of Appeals was indeed in error for denying LBP its right to file an appeal on the ground that it was not a real party-in-interest, since it did not stand to lose or gain anything from the RTC Decision dated 11 March 2003 in Special Agrarian Case No. 61-2000. It is worthy to note that in making its pronouncement that LBP was a mere depositary of the Agrarian Reform Fund and the financial intermediary for purposes of the CARL, the appellate court was unable to cite any statutory or jurisprudential basis therefor.<br><br>To the contrary, the Court had already recognized in <i>Sharp International Marketing v. Court of Appeals</i> that the LBP plays a significant role under the CARL and in the implementation of the CARP, thus:<br><br><blockquote>As may be gleaned very clearly from EO 229, the LBP is an <b>essential part</b> of the government sector with regard to the payment of compensation to the landowner. It is, after all, the instrumentality that is charged with the disbursement of public funds for purposes of agrarian reform. It is therefore part, an indispensable cog, in the governmental machinery that fixes and determines the amount compensable to the landowner. Were LBP to be excluded from that intricate, if not sensitive, function of establishing the compensable amount, there would be no amount "to be established by the government" as required in Sec. 6, EO 229. This is precisely why the law requires the [Deed of Absolute Sale (DAS)], even if already approved and signed by the DAR Secretary, to be <b>transmitted still to the LBP for its review, evaluation and approval</b>.<br><br>It needs no exceptional intelligence to understand the implications of this transmittal. It simply means that if LBP agrees on the amount stated in the DAS, after its review and evaluation, it becomes its duty to sign the deed. But not until then. For, it is only in that event that the amount to be compensated shall have been "established" according to law. Inversely, if the LBP, after review and evaluation, refuses to sign, it is because as a party to the contract it does not give its consent thereto. This <b>necessarily implies the exercise of judgment on the part of LBP, which is not supposed to be a mere rubber stamp in the exercise.</b> Obviously, were it not so, LBP could not have been made a distinct member of [Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC)], the super body responsible for the successful implementation of the CARP. Neither would it have been given the power to review and evaluate the DAS already signed by the DAR Secretary. If the function of the LBP in this regard is merely to sign the DAS without the concomitant power of review and evaluation, its duty to "review/evaluate" mandated in Adm. Order No. 5 would have been a mere surplus age, meaningless, and a useless ceremony.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Even more explicit is R.A. 6657 with respect to the indispensable role of LBP in the determination of the amount to be compensated to the landowner. Under Sec. 18 thereof, "the LBP shall compensate the landowner in <b>such amount as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and LBP</b>, in accordance with the criteria provided in Secs. 16 and 17, and other pertinent provisions hereof, or as may be finally determined by the court, as the just compensation for the land."<br><br>Without the signature of the LBP President, there was simply no contract between Sharp and the Government. The Deed of Absolute Sale dated January 9, 1989, was incomplete and therefore had no binding effect at all. Consequently, Sharp cannot claim any legal right thereunder that it can validly assert in a petition for mandamus. (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br>The issue of whether LBP can file an appeal on its own, separately and independently of the DAR, in land valuation and just compensation cases, had been squarely addressed by the Court in <i>Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>, <i>(G.R. No. 148223, 25 November 2004, 444 SCRA 176, 186-188),</i><sup> </sup>where it ruled:<br><br><blockquote>It must be observed that once an expropriation proceeding for the acquisition of private agricultural lands is commenced by the DAR, the <b>indispensable role of Land Bank</b> begins.<br><br>x x x<br></blockquote><br>It is evident from the afore-quoted jurisprudence that the role of LBP in the CARP is more than just the ministerial duty of keeping and disbursing the Agrarian Reform Funds. As the Court had previously declared, the LBP is primarily responsible for the valuation and determination of compensation for all private lands. It has the discretion to approve or reject the land valuation and just compensation for a private agricultural land placed under the CARP. In case the LBP disagrees with the valuation of land and determination of just compensation by a party, the DAR, or even the courts, the LBP not only has the right, but the duty, to challenge the same, by appeal to the Court of Appeals or to this Court, if appropriate. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It is thus beyond question that LBP has the legal personality to file the petition for determination of just compensation with the SAC.<br><br><center><u><b><i>LBP did not commit forum shopping</i></b></u><br></center><br>Petitioners also submit that LBP is guilty of forum shopping because after LBP invoked the jurisdiction of the SAC of Santiago City, Isabela, and obtained a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), LBP filed a petition for certiorari with the DARAB  (DSCA No. 0213) to prevent the execution of the Order of the RARAD. The DARAB eventually issued a TRO, and later, a writ of preliminary injunction, directed against the implementation of the RARAD's decision.<br><br>Petitioners' argument is mislaid.<br><br>In <i>Canuto, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> we held that forum shopping is manifest whenever a party "repetitively avail[s] of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in, or already resolved adversely by, some other court." It has also been defined as "an act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum of seeking and possibly getting a favorable opinion in another forum, other than by appeal or the special civil action of certiorari, or the institution of two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition." Considered a pernicious evil, it adversely affects the efficient administration of justice since it clogs the court dockets, unduly burdens the financial and human resources of the judiciary, and trifles with and mocks judicial processes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In <i>Veluz v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> we held:<br><br><blockquote>There is forum shopping when, in the two or more cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action and relief sought. Forum shopping exists where the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present or when a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other. For <i>litis pendentia</i> to exist, the following requisites must be present:<br><br><ol><li>Identity of parties, or at least such parties as those representing the same interests in both actions;<br><br></li><li>Identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the reliefs being founded on the same facts;<br><br></li><li>Identity with respect to the two preceding particulars in the two cases, such that any judgment that may be rendered in the pending case, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Reviewing the facts of this case, the SAC, after hearing the parties regarding the propriety of issuing the injunctive writ against the execution of the RARAD's decision, found that it had no jurisdiction to resolve the matter. Hence, LBP filed a petition for certiorari with the DARAB (DSCA No. 0213) seeking the issuance of a TRO and preliminary injunction.<br><br>It is thus seen that there is no forum shopping because the SAC had no jurisdiction on the issuance of an injunctive writ against the RARAD's decision. As the SAC had no jurisdiction over such matter, any ruling it renders is void and of no legal effect. Thus, LBP's act of filing the petition for certiorari with the DARAB, which has the correct jurisdiction for the remedy sought, does not amount to forum shopping.<br><br><u><center><b><i>Computation of just compensation for the subject lands</i></b><br></center></u><br>The only question that remains for resolution is the value of just compensation to be paid to petitioners.<br><br>Petitioners maintain that it is the valuation made by RARAD in its decision dated 29 March 2000, fixing the just compensation for the subject property at P32,965,408.46, which should be awarded to them considering that the same is supported by substantial evidence. On the other hand, respondent argues that just compensation should be computed on the revalued appraisal of P5,626,723.47.<br><br>Pertinently, Section 17 of RA 6657 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation</i>. -- In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessments made by government assessors shall be considered.
