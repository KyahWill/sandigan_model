She was born to the couple on 22 September 1994. The family resides at <i>Sitio</i> XXX, XXX, XXX, where the accused is a neighbour with only five houses separating them. AAA was 9 years old and a grade III pupil at the XXX Central School at the time of the rapes complained of.&nbsp; One afternoon between the hours of 12:00 o'clock and 1:00 o'clock p.m. during the second week of March, 2004, AAA was on her way to school when she met the accused.&nbsp; The accused kissed AAA on the forehead several times, held her hand, and brought her inside his house.&nbsp; He removed his pants and brief and then forcibly removed the pants and underwear of AAA.&nbsp; He laid her on the sofa, mounted her, and inserted his hard penis into her vagina. AAA felt pain in her vagina. After satisfying himself, the accused gave AAA P5.00 and warned her not to tell her mother about what happened.<br><br>On 25 March 2004, in the afternoon thereof, the accused again sexually abused AAA.&nbsp; He brought AAA inside the <i>"at-atoan"</i> and after undressing her and himself, he mounted her.&nbsp; He pushed his erect penis into the girl's vagina after which the latter felt pain and something sticky in her private organ.&nbsp; The accused then put on his clothes and threatened AAA with harm if she would tell her mother about the incident.<br><br>CCC, AAA's mother, came to know of what happened to her child from her neighbour, Primitiva Tumayab, to whom AAA revealed that the accused had sexually molested her.&nbsp; CCC also received related information from Leticia Bondad and Lonjean Valdez (Valdez).&nbsp; Valdez testified that sometime on the second week of March, 2004, while she was at their rooftop terrace harvesting <i>sili</i>, she saw the accused and AAA enter the house of the accused through the backdoor.&nbsp; The accused's house is only 1Â½ meters from Valdez's house.<br><br>On 15 May 2004, CCC confronted her daughter AAA about the information she received and AAA confirmed that the accused raped her.&nbsp; The following day, CCC reported the matter to the police who took her and AAA's sworn statements. On 17 May 2004, AAA and one BBB who would turn out to be another complainant, were examined at the Bontoc General Hospital by Dr. Alma T. Lusad (Dr. Lusad).<br><br>Regarding her findings on AAA, Dr. Lusad explained that there was <i>erythema</i> or redness at the area of the <i>labia majora</i> and <i>labia minora</i> but there were no hymenal lacerations.&nbsp; According to the doctor, the <i>erythema</i> or redness could have been caused by an erect penis that touched the <i>labia.</i><br><br>With regard to her findings on BBB, Dr. Lusad testified that there was likewise no hymenal laceration but there was "<i>erythema</i>" of the perihymenal area at the 3:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock positions.&nbsp; The physician explained that the <i>erythema</i> could have been caused by a hard object including an erect penis.<br><br>BBB, the other complainant, is the four-year old daughter of the spouses EEE and FFF.&nbsp; She is the youngest of their six children.&nbsp; BBB's mother, EEE, is blind.&nbsp; The family resides at XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX.<br><br>In the afternoon of 8 May 2004, BBB and her neighbour, Myrna Isilen, were playing in the house of a certain <i>Lola</i> Pelaw when the accused whom BBB calls as "<i>Lolo</i> Caldo" came and told BBB to come with him so he will give her money to buy candy.&nbsp; The accused took BBB by the hand and brought her to the bedroom on the second floor of the house.&nbsp; He undressed himself and likewise removed BBB's shorts and panties.&nbsp; He laid her down on the bed and went on top of her.&nbsp; BBB felt pain when the accused put his hard penis on her vagina.&nbsp; Afterwards, the accused told BBB not to tell her parents about what he did.&nbsp; He got up and dressed himself when he heard a loud knocking on his door.<br><br>When BBB's playmate, Myrna Isilen (Myrna) saw the accused bring BBB inside his house, she went to tell <i>Lola</i> Pelaw about it.&nbsp; Myrna also relayed the information to BBB's mother, EEE, who was then washing dishes at their house.&nbsp; Myrna and EEE proceeded immediately to the house of the accused.&nbsp; GGG, BBB's sister followed them.&nbsp; They knocked loudly on the door of the accused but the latter did not open the door.&nbsp; It was only when GGG told Myrna to call the police that the accused opened the door, whereupon she entered the house and fetched BBB from the second floor.&nbsp; There was nobody in the house except BBB and the accused.&nbsp; GGG asked BBB what happened and the child replied that the accused removed her clothes, undressed himself, went on top of her, and inserted his penis inside her vagina. When GGG, who was carrying BBB, came out of the house, EEE asked BBB what the accused did to her.&nbsp; BBB replied that the accused removed her shorts and that the latter undressed himself and went on top of her.&nbsp; Upon hearing this, EEE went to report the matter to the police who took her and BBB's sworn statements.<br><br>The defense presented seven witnesses: Antonio Bolinget, Asuncion Galleo, Eugenia L. Roux, Nenita Daling, Felomina Gonzaga, Pablo Gogo (Gogo) and the accused himself.&nbsp; Based on their testimonies, the defense version<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the facts is as follows:<br><br>On the last week of February, 2004, the accused went to Caboan, Capangdanan, Sabangan and stayed there up to the first week of April, 2004, before he returned to Poblacion, Sabangan.&nbsp; The accused worked on his ricefields, preparing them for planting.&nbsp; He called fifteen people to help him work thereon. The accused stayed in his house which was made of wood and <i>G.I</i>. sheets.&nbsp; Pablo Gogo (Gogo) testified that he stayed at his farm in Caboan from 2 March 2004 to 4 April 2004, and likewise stayed in his "<i>ab-abong"</i> which is five meters from the shanty of the accused.&nbsp; Gogo declared that the shanties were made of <i>cogon</i> and not <i>G.I</i>. sheets.&nbsp; Caboan is about three kilometers from Poblacion, Sabangan, and it can be hiked in less than an hour.&nbsp; The testimony of Gogo likewise shows that some farmers work in their fields and then go back home to Sabangan at day's end.&nbsp; They do not spend the night there.&nbsp; Gogo avers that the accused was one of those who stayed at Caboan.<br><br>On 8 May 2004, the accused was at Kaaligan, Sabangan from 8:00 o'clock in the morning until 11:00 o'clock in the evening.&nbsp; He was there with many others to wait for the cadaver of one Rodrigo Galeo to be brought home from Cervantes, Ilocos Sur.&nbsp; Antonio Bolinget and Nenita Daling testified that indeed the accused was at Kaaligan on aforesaid date, and that the accused was one of those who brought Galeo's body to his house at Dogo, Sabangan at about 11:00 o'clock at night.<br><br>Eugenia L. Roux testified that she was the teacher of complainant AAA in grade III at the XXX Central School during the school year 2003-2004.&nbsp; She claimed that AAA was present during the entire second week of March 2004 and on 25 March 2004 as per her record.&nbsp; She further testified that she has not observed any behavioral changes in or unusual behavior of her pupil.<br><br>The accused denied knowing the complainants and avers he came to know them only when he was detained at the Bauko Municipal Jail.<br><br>On 24 March 2006, the RTC rendered a consolidated judgment finding the accused guilty of three counts of statutory rape as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the accused Leonardo Degay alias Caldo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of STATUTORY RAPE, a Consolidated Judgment is hereby rendered sentencing him to suffer -<br><br>1.&nbsp; The penalty of reclusion perpetua and ordering him to pay AAA the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) PESOS as civil indemnity and another Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) PESOS as moral damages for each count of STATUTORY RAPE in Crim. Cases No. 1849 and 1850.<br><br>2.&nbsp; The penalty of reclusion perpetua and ordering him to pay the private complainant BBB, the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) PESOS as indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> and another Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) PESOS as moral damages in Crim. Case No. 1851 for Statutory Rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On 27 September 2007, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Before this Court now on appeal, the parties opted to no longer file supplemental briefs, manifesting that they had exhaustively discussed their arguments in the briefs they filed before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the accused assigns the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO, GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT FOR THREE (3) COUNTS OF STATUTORY RAPE.<br><br><center>II.</center><br><br>THE COURT A QUO, OVERWHELMED BY THE NUMBER OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED CULPABLE FOR THREE (3) COUNTS OF STATUTORY RAPE.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO, GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE PLAUSIBLE ALIBI OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOT WORTHY OF CREDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the RTC decision convicting the accused of three counts of statutory rape?<br><br>The accused argues that his acts of showing his penis to BBB and the touching of AAA's vagina, mashing of her breasts and letting his penis touch her vagina constitute lascivious conduct and not statutory rape, citing Section 2(h) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases, Republic Act No. 7610,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which defines lascivious conduct as "the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals on pubic area of a person."&nbsp; He cites that the lascivious conduct is supported by the medico-legal findings on AAA and BBB, when it was found that there was no hymenal laceration on their organs.&nbsp; The accused further faults the RTC for not giving credence to his plausible <i>alibi</i> that he was in another place on 8 May 2004 and it was impossible for him to have brought BBB to his house and raped her.<br><br>On the other hand, the prosecution, through the Office of the Solicitor General, in its brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> argues that it had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed statutory rape and not just acts of lasciviousness.&nbsp; It cited the categorical and straightforward testimonies of AAA and BBB as corroborated by the medical findings showing both victims suffered <i>erythema</i> or redness in the areas of their <i>labias minora </i>and<i> majora</i>.&nbsp; It pointed out that this Court had held in <i>People v. De la Cuesta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that absence of hymenal lacerations on the private organs of the victims does not negate rape.&nbsp; It stressed that the RTC correctly convicted the accused of three counts of statutory rape since the accused had sexual intercourse with the victims who are both under 12 years of age.&nbsp; It finally argued that the accused cannot exculpate himself from liability by alleging that from the last week of February, 2004 to the first week of April, 2004, he was in Caboan, Capangdanan because Caboan is only three kilometers away from Sabangan and could be traversed in an hour or less.&nbsp; It was therefore not physically impossible for the accused to be at the crime scenes.<br><br>After review, we uphold the rulings of the appellate court and the RTC.<br><br>As correctly assessed by the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote>Dr. Alma Lusad testified that <i>erythema</i> or redness of the <i>labia</i> <i>minora</i> and <i>labia majora</i> shows that there is an inflammation or infection in said areas, as the normal color thereof is pinkish, which could have been caused by the rubbing of [a] hard object, like an erect penis, on the area.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Pruna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> it was held that the absence of hymenal laceration does not preclude the finding of rape, especially when the victim is of tender age.&nbsp; Rape is consummated by the slightest penile penetration of the <i>labia</i> or pudendum of the female.&nbsp; The presence of hyperemia in the vaginal opening is a clear indication that the penis of the accused indeed touched the <i>labia</i> or pudendum of the complainants.<br><br>As explained in <i>People v. Boromeo:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <br><br>Proof of hymenal laceration is not an element of rape.&nbsp; An intact hymen does not negate a finding that the victim was raped.&nbsp; To sustain a conviction for rape, full penetration of the female genital organ is not necessary.&nbsp; It is enough that there is proof of entry of the male organ into the <i>labia of the pudendum</i> of the female organ.&nbsp; Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the vagina, even without laceration of the hymen, is enough to constitute rape, and even the briefest of contact is deemed rape.&nbsp; As long as the attempt to insert the penis results in contact with the lips of the vagina, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, the rape is consummated. x x x.<br><br>The defense of alibi interposed by accused-appellant cannot prevail over the positive identification by AAA and BBB that he was the one who raped them.&nbsp; Accused-appellant admitted that Caboan, Capangdanan, where he allegedly stayed from the last week of February 2004 until the first week of April, 2004, is only about three (3) kilometers away from Sabangan, while Kaaligan, where he stayed from morning until evening of May 8, 2004, is only one (1) kilometer away from Sabangan.&nbsp; Pablo Gogo, who was allegedly with accused-appellant in Caboan from March 2, 2004 to April 4, 2004, stated that the distance of three (3) kilometers from said place to Sabangan could be negotiated in less than one hour.&nbsp; It was not, therefore, physically impossible for accused-appellant to be in Sabangan on the dates and time of the incidents complained of by AAA and BBB.&nbsp; As between the accused-appellant's denial and his positive identification by AAA and BBB as the person who raped them, the court a quo did not err in according weight to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In line with recent jurisprudence, however, the awards of moral and exemplary damages are increased to P75,000.00 and P30,000.00, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 27 September 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
