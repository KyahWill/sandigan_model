				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Norlito Sambahon y Nueva (appellant) was charged and convicted of rape of his 13 year-old stepdaughter, AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by the Regional Trial Court (Branch 63), Calabanga, Camarines Sur by Decision of February 15, 2006 which was affirmed with modification by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Information against appellant reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the <u>12</u><sup>th</sup><u> day of August 2003</u>, at around eight o'clock in the evening in Barangay San Ramon, Tinambac, Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, through force or intimidation, had carnal knowledge with complainant, <u>[AAA]</u>, fifteen (15)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> years old and the stepdaughter of the accused, against her will, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>The crime is committed with the following attendant aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>The victim is <u>under eighteen years of age</u> and the offender is her <u>stepfather</u>.<br><br>ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br>Naga City, Philippines, April 12, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>During the pre-trial of the case, appellant <u>admitted</u> that on August 12, 2003, AAA was <u>13 years old</u> as she was born on December 15, 1989 to her mother BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and the latter's late common-law husband CCC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> as evidenced by a certified true copy of her birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Exhibit "A"); that AAA is his stepdaughter, having married BBB on June 5, 1996 as evidenced by a certified true copy of their Certificate of Marriage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Exhibit "C"); and that on the day of the incident, he, AAA and BBB were residing in their house at San Ramon, Tinambac, Camarines Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Culled from the testimonies of AAA, BBB and Dr. Augusto M. Quilon, Jr. is the following version of the prosecution:<br><br>In the afternoon of August 12, 2003, BBB and appellant left their house in San Ramon, Tinambac and proceeded to their store at Sitio Bayang, also in Tinambac, to sell merchandise, leaving behind AAA and her three young siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Appellant returned to their house in the early evening of the same day purportedly to get some merchandise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> At past 8:00 that night, appellant approached AAA who was then sleeping in the room of BBB and appellant, telling her not to make any noise.&nbsp; He immediately removed AAA's skirt and panties and tied her hands, after which he parted her legs and inserted his penis into her vagina, drawing her to cry as he made a push and pull movement.&nbsp; Before he returned to the store, he warned her not to tell her siblings and her mother about what he did to her, otherwise, he would kill all of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>About five months later or sometime in the first week of January, 2004, appellant brought AAA to the Bicol Medical Center, Naga City for medical check-up where she was found to be pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; She left home the following day and stayed at the house of her maternal grandmother at Sitio Bayang to whom she revealed the sexual abuse committed by appellant. AAA later also revealed the matter to her mother.&nbsp; The rape was thereafter reported to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>When Dr. Augusto M. Quilon, Jr., a physician at the Bicol Medical Center, examined AAA on January 20, 2004, she complained that she was raped by appellant on August 12, 2003, around 8:00 p.m., at San Ramon, Tinambac.&nbsp; The doctor issued the following findings:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="15%"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Abdomen:&nbsp;</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Slightly globular, FH - 26 cm.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="75%"><div align="justify">Fetal heart tune - 146/min.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">External Genitalia:</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Normal looking external genitalia; <u><b>(+) </b>Old hymenal laceration at 4, 6 and 9 o'clock position;<br> Admits 2 fingers with ease.<br><br></u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">A) Pregnancy uterine, 27-28 wks. gestation, G1PPO.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">UTS (ultrasound): Pregnancy uterine, 30 wks. gestation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (underscoring supplied), </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>and opined that AAA was about 6 to 7 months pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Appellant, interposing <i>alibi</i>, denied being at their house around 8:00 p.m. when the alleged rape of AAA took place on August 12, 2003.&nbsp; He claimed that at 5:30 p.m. until 10:00 that evening, he had a drinking spree with one Rolando Ponis and his (appellant's) brother-in-law at the latter's house, which is just in front of their house.&nbsp; On returning home drunk that night, AAA was still studying.&nbsp; He then slept in their living room at past 10:00 p.m., while his wife BBB was already asleep in their room as they had a new-born baby whose name he could not, however, furnish.&nbsp; Why AAA - whom he "considered as [his] own child" and who, in turn, treated him as if he were her natural father - would charge him with rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> he could not fathom.<br><br>By Decision of February 15, 2006, the trial court convicted appellant of qualified rape as charged, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the prosecution having proven the guilt of accused Norlito Sambahon y Nueva beyond reasonable doubt, he is found guilty of the crime of Qualified Rape as charged in the information. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH. He is also ordered to pay the private complainant [AAA] the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P50,000.00 as moral damages; P25,000.00 as exemplary damages. He is likewise meted the accessory penalties under Article 40 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>No pronouncement as to cost[s].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>Before the Court of Appeals to which appellant appealed, he faulted the trial court<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>... IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMOMY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT; AND<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>... IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED.</blockquote><br>The appellate court, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of November 5, 2007, <u>affirmed</u> the factual findings of the trial court but modified the penalty to <i>reclusion</i> <i>perpetua</i>, following the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and reduced the award of civil indemnity from P75,000.00 to P50,000.00:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision dated February 15, 2006 rendered by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Calabanga, Camarines Sur, Branch 63, in Criminal Case No. RTC'04-921 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> <b>with modification </b>imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> on accused-appellant and reducing the award of civil indemnity from P75,000.00 to P50,000.00.&nbsp; The rest of the decision stands.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>Hence, appellant's present appeal. In separate Manifestations, appellant and the OSG found it no longer necessary to file their respective supplemental briefs.<br><br>In his Appellant's Brief filed before the appellate court, appellant contended that AAA's testimony cannot be relied upon because: <b>a)</b> she made inconsistent statements by declaring during the preliminary examination that she was raped by appellant <i>in the room where she and her siblings were sleeping</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> but in her testimony in court she stated that the rape&nbsp; occurred <i>in the room of her mother and appellant</i>; <b>b)</b> she did not call for help when sexually assaulted; and <b>c)</b> it took her about five months from the time of rape before she revealed the incident to her grandmother and the police.<br><br>From a review of the transcript of stenographic notes, the Court finds AAA's testimony to bear the hallmarks of a credible witness. As appellant himself conceded, he could not advance any reason why AAA would impute such a serious charge against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Even BBB claimed that AAA and appellant had a good relation.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

[A] rape victim's testimony against her parent is entitled to great weight since, customarily, Filipino children revere and respect their elders.&nbsp; These values are so deeply ingrained in Filipino families that it is unthinkable for a daughter to concoct brazenly a story of rape against her father if such were not true.&nbsp; Indeed, courts usually give greater weight to the testimony of a girl who fell victim to sexual assault, especially a minor, particularly in incestuous rape as in this case, because no woman would be willing to undergo a public trial and bear the concomitant shame, humiliation, and dishonor of exposing her own degradation were it not for the purpose of condemning injustice and ensuring that the offender is punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Respecting AAA's inconsistent statements, harped upon by appellant, during the preliminary examination and at the witness stand relative to the <i>location of the room</i> where she was ravished, the defense oddly did not call attention thereto to afford her the opportunity to explain or clarify it as called for under Rule 132, Section 13 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 13. <i>How witness impeached by evidence of inconsistent statements</i>. - Before a witness can be impeached by evidence that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony, the statements must be related to him, with the circumstances of the times and places and the persons present, and he must be asked whether he made such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them. If the statements be in writing they must be shown to the witness before any question is put to him concerning them.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><i>Apropos </i>is this Court's ruling in <i>People v. Relucio</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>. . . <u>every witness is presumed to be truthful and perjury is not to be readily inferred just because apparent inconsistencies are evinced in parts of his testimony.&nbsp; Every effort to reconcile the conflicting points should first be exerted before any adverse conclusion can be made therefrom. These considerations lie at the base of the familiar rule requiring the laying of a predicate, which in essence means simply that it is the duty of a party trying to impugn the testimony of a witness by means of prior or, for that matter, subsequent inconsistent statements, whether oral or in writing, to give the witness a chance to reconcile his conflicting declarations, such that it is only when no reasonable explanation is given by him that he should be deemed impeached</u>.&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In any event, the questioned inconsistency does not impinge on the <i>essential elements </i>of the offense charged. What is important is that AAA's narration (both in the preliminary examination and during the trial) of how she was forced and intimidated by appellant into submission to his bestial cravings was indisputably consistent, direct, positive and unwavering.<br><br>That AAA, when sexually assaulted by appellant, did not call her young siblings for help and that she kept mum on the incident for about five months are quite understandable.&nbsp; The moral and physical ascendancy of appellant, her stepfather, who was living with them, sufficed to cow her into yielding to his bestial desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>As for appellant's alibi, it fails for it was not physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time of its commission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> he having been merely in his brother-in-law's house fronting the scene of the crime.<br><br>The Court modifies the challenged decision, however, in that <b>a)</b> appellant is not eligible for parole;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and, <b>b) </b>consistent with prevailing jurisprudence, the award by the trial court of civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00, which was reduced by the appellate court to P50,000.00, should be reinstated; and his liability for moral and exemplary damages should be increased to P75,000.00 and P30,000.00, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Court of Appeals Decision of&nbsp; November 5, 2007 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02083 is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with <b>MODIFICATION</b> in that appellant Norlito Sambahon y Nueva is not eligible for parole; and he is ordered to pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.
