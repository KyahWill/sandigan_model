				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In our Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> promulgated on December 18, 2008, we set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated December 12, 2005 rendered by the First Division; recalled the Entry of Judgment recorded on May 2, 2006; reversed and set aside the Amended Decisions dated November 7, 2003 and March 12, 2004 in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 66700 and 66642, respectively; and remanded to the Court of Appeals (CA) for further proceedings these cases which shall be raffled immediately. <b> </b><br><br>The CA was specifically directed to receive evidence with primary focus on whether the Manotoks can trace their claim of title to a valid alienation by the Government of Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate, which was a Friar Land. On that evidence, this Court may ultimately decide whether annulment of the Manotok title is warranted, similar to the annulment of the Cebu Country Club title in <i>Alonso v. Cebu Country Club</i>, <i>Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; The Barques and Manahans were likewise allowed to present evidence on their respective claims "which may have an impact on the correct determination of the status of the Manotok title."&nbsp; On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) was directed to secure all the relevant records from the Land Management Bureau (LMB) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).&nbsp; If the final evidence on record "definitively reveals the proper claimant to the subject property, the Court would take such fact into consideration as it adjudicates final relief."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>After concluding the proceedings in which all the parties participated and presented testimonial and documentary evidence, as well as memoranda setting forth their respective arguments, the CA's Special Former First Division rendered a Commissioners' Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> consisting of 219 pages on April 12, 2010.&nbsp; Upon receipt of the sealed Report submitted to this Court, the parties were no longer furnished copies thereof in order not to delay the promulgation of the Court's action and the adjudication of these cases, and pursuant to our power under Section 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court to adopt any suitable process or mode of proceeding which appears conformable to the spirit of the Rules "to carry into effect all auxiliary processes and other means necessary to carry our jurisdiction into effect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The evidence adduced by the parties before the CA, which are exhaustively discussed in the Commissioners' Report, including the judicial affidavits and testimonies presented during the hearings conducted by the CA's Special Former Special Former First Division, are herein summarized. But first, a brief restatement of the antecedents set forth in our Resolution.<br><br><center><b><i>Antecedents</i></b><br></center><br>Lot No. 823 is a part of the Piedad Estate, Quezon City, a Friar Land acquired by the Philippine Government from the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Ltd., La Sociedad Agricola de Ultramar, the British-Manila Estate Company, Ltd., and the Recoleto Order of the Philippine Islands on December 23, 1903, as indicated in Act No. 1120 (Friar Lands Act) enacted on April 26, 1904.&nbsp; The Piedad Estate has been titled in the name of the Government under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 614 and was placed under the administration of the Director of Lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Controversy arising from conflicting claims over Lot 823 began to surface after a fire gutted portions of the Quezon City Hall on June 11, 1988 which destroyed records stored in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City.&nbsp; That fire has attained notoriety due to the numerous certificates of title on file with that office, which were destroyed as a consequence.&nbsp; The resulting effects of that blaze on specific property registration controversies have been dealt with by the Court in a number of cases since then. The present petitions are perhaps the most heated, if not the most contentious of those cases thus far.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 1990, a petition for administrative reconstitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 372302 in the name of the Manotoks covering Lot No. 823 with an area of 342,945 square meters was filed by the Manotoks with the Land Registration Authority (LRA) which granted the same, resulting in the issuance of TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in 1991. In 1996, eight (8) years after the fire which razed the Quezon City Hall building, the Barques filed a petition with the LRA for administrative reconstitution of the original of TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer Barque and covering Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, Quezon City, alleged to be among those titles destroyed in the fire.&nbsp; In support of their petition, the Barques submitted copies of the alleged owner's duplicate of TCT No. 210177, real estate tax receipts, tax declarations and a Plan Fls 3168-D covering the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Learning of the Barques' petition, the Manotoks filed their opposition thereto, alleging that TCT No. 210177 was spurious.&nbsp; Although both titles of the Manotoks and the Barques refer to land belonging to Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate situated in the then Municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, TCT No. 210177 actually involves two (2) parcels with an aggregate area of 342,945 square meters, while TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) pertains only to a single parcel of land, with a similar area of 342,945 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On June 30, 1997, Atty. Benjamin M. Bustos, the reconstituting officer, denied Barques' petition declaring that Lot No. 823 is already registered in the name of the Manotoks and covered by TCT No. 372302 which was reconstituted under Adm. Reconstitution No. Q-213 dated February 1, 1991, and that the submitted plan Fls 3168-D is a spurious document as categorically declared by Engr. Privadi J.G. Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Surveys Division of the LMB.&nbsp; The Barques' motion for reconsideration having been denied, they appealed to the LRA. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The LRA reversed the ruling of Atty. Bustos and declared that the Manotok title was fraudulently reconstituted.&nbsp; It ordered that reconstitution of TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer L. Barque shall be given due course after cancellation of TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of the Manotoks upon order of a competent court of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The LRA denied the Manotoks' motion for reconsideration and the Barques' prayer for immediate reconstitution.&nbsp; Both the Manotoks and the Barques appealed the LRA decision to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the petition for review filed by the Barques (CA-G.R. SP No. 66700), Felicitas Manahan filed a motion to intervene and sought the dismissal of the cases in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and CA-G.R. SP No. 66642 as she claimed ownership of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>By Decision of September 13, 2002, the CA's Second Division denied the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and affirmed the LRA Resolution. Subsequently, in an Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated November 7, 2003, the Special Division of Five of the Former Second Division&nbsp; reconsidered its Decision dated September 13, 2002 and directed the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of the Manotoks and to reconstitute the Barques' "valid, genuine and existing" TCT No. 210177.&nbsp; The Manotoks filed a motion for reconsideration but this was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As to Manotoks' petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 66642), the CA's Third Division rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> on October 29, 2003 which affirmed the resolution of the LRA. The Barques filed a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; As what happened in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, the CA's Third Division granted the Barques' motion for reconsideration and on February 24, 2004, promulgated its Amended Decision wherein it reconsidered the decision dated October 29, 2003, and ordered the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of the Manotoks and the LRA to reconstitute the Barques' TCT No. 210177.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved by the outcome of the two (2) cases in the CA, the Manotoks filed the present separate petitions (G.R. Nos. 162605 and 162335) which were ordered consolidated on August 2, 2004.&nbsp; On December 12, 2005, this Court's First Division rendered its Decision affirming the two (2) decisions of the CA.&nbsp; The Manotoks filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court's First Division denied in a Resolution dated April 19, 2006.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Manotoks filed a Motion for Leave to File a Second Motion for Reconsideration, with their Motion for Reconsideration attached.&nbsp; The Court denied the same in a Resolution dated June 19, 2006 and eventually entry of judgment was made in the Book of Entries of Judgment on May 2, 2006.&nbsp; In the meantime, the Barques filed multiple motions with the First Division for execution of the judgment, while the Manotoks filed an Urgent Motion to Refer Motion for Possession to the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> (with prayer to set motion for oral arguments). In a Resolution dated July 19, 2006, the Special First Division referred these cases to the Court <i>en banc</i>, and on July 26, 2006, the Court <i>en banc </i>promulgated a Resolution accepting the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On September 7, 2006, Felicitas Manahan and Rosendo Manahan filed a motion to intervene, to which was attached their petition in intervention. They alleged that their predecessor-in-interest, Valentin Manahan, was issued Sale Certificate No. 511 covering Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate and attached to their petition the findings of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) that the documents of the Manotoks were not as old as they were purported to be.&nbsp; Consequently, the Director of the Legal Division of the LMB recommended to the Director of the LMB that "steps be taken in the proper court for the cancellation of TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) and all its derivative titles so that the land covered may be reverted to the State."&nbsp; In compliance with the directive of this Court, the OSG filed its Comment and oral arguments were held on July 24, 2007.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Court required the parties, the intervenors and the Solicitor General to submit their respective memoranda.<br><br>As already mentioned, the December 12, 2005 Decision of the Court's First Division was set aside, entry of judgment recalled and the CA's Amended Decisions in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 66642 and 66700 were reversed and set aside, pursuant to our Resolution promulgated on December 18, 2008 wherein we ordered the remand of the cases to the CA for further proceedings.<br><br><center><b>Evidence Submitted to the CA</b><br></center><br>A.&nbsp; <b><i>OSG </i></b><br><br><b>Engr.

She explained that there is no discrepancy because the lot description "64.45" appearing in Exhibit 28-OSG should read "644.5" (as reflected in Exhibit 29-OSG [DENR]) and they used this computation as otherwise the polygon will not close.&nbsp; Sketch/Special Plans (Exhibits 30 and 31-OSG [DENR]) were prepared for Felicitas Manahan after she had purchased Lot No. 823 of Piedad Estate.&nbsp; As land investigator, she made a thorough research of the property and she was able to see only the sale certificate of the Manahans (Exhibit 2-OSG [LMB]) but not those of the Manotoks and the Barques.

Bernabe</b>, a geodetic engineer who had worked in both public and private sectors and was hired as consultant in cases involving disputed lots, examined the survey plans and titles covering Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate.&nbsp; Using coordinate geometry and/or computer aided design, he plotted the technical descriptions of Lot No. 823 based on the technical descriptions appearing in OCT No. 614, Manotoks' TCT No. RT-22481 and Barques' TCT No. 210177.&nbsp; He found that although both titles indicate that Lot No. 823 was originally registered under OCT No. 614, they contain significantly different technical descriptions of the same property.&nbsp; The Manotoks' title indicates an unsubdivided Lot No. 823 with the following boundaries:&nbsp; on the East by Payatas Estate, on the Southeast by the Tuazon Estate, and on the West by Lots 824-A, 818-A and 818-C. On the other hand, the Barques' title describes Lot 823 as subdivided into Lots 823-A and 823-B bounded on the Northeast and Southeast by the property of Diez Francisco, on the Southwest by Lot 824, and on the Northwest by Lot 826. However, the southeast and northeast boundaries of Lot No. 823 as indicated in the Barques' title are not mentioned in OCT No. 614.&nbsp; Using Google Earth, Lot 826 is actually located far north of Lot 823 based on the Lot Description Sheet (Exh. 43<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>) certified correct and reconstructed on December 17, 1979 by&nbsp; the Director of Lands. Lot 818 is the correct lot to the west of Lot 823 together with Lot 824, as shown in the various approved survey plans in the area (such as Psd-16296, Psd-16489, Psd-6737, Psd-22842 and Psd-291211), but as shown in the Barques' title, Lots 824 and 826 are cited as adjacent lots to the west of Lot 823.&nbsp; He found some unusual irregularities in the Barques' Subdivision Plan Fls-3168-D dated June 21, 1940 (Exh. 45<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>), prepared for Emiliano Setosta.&nbsp; When he compared Subdivision Plan Fls-3004-D dated February 16, 1941, the lot he surveyed covering Lot 290-B which is a portion of Lot 290 of the Piedad Estate covered by TCT No. RT-120665, he noticed that Fls-3168-D dated June 21, 1940 is more than six (6) months ahead of the date of survey on February 16, 1941 for Fls-3004-D.&nbsp; It is highly irregular that a survey executed at a later date would have a lower plan number since the plan numbers are issued consecutively by the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp; He likewise found that the errors and discrepancies pertaining to Fls-3168-D show that the regular procedures and requirements for preparing subdivision plans were not followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Engr.&nbsp; Bernabe pointed out that his examination of Survey Plan for Lot 824-A done in 1947 (Exh. 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>) showed that to the east of Lot 824-A is <i>undivided </i>Lot 823 (Exh. 46-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>); the Survey Plan for Lot 822-A (Exh. 47<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>), which is located north of Lot 823, prepared in 1991 and approved in 1992, shows that Lot 823 is an <i>undivided</i> piece of property (Exh. 47-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>); and Survey Plan for Lot 818-A-New (Exh. 48<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>) shows Lots 818-New-A, 818-New-B and 818-C the western boundaries of Lot 823, which is consistent with the description in Manotoks' title.&nbsp; Thus, based on the totality of the documents he examined, Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate is an undivided piece of land with an area of 342,945 square meters, bounded on the East by Payatas Estate, on the Southeast by the Tuazon Estate and on the West by Lots 824-A, 818-A and 818-C, consistent with the technical descriptions appearing in the nine (9) certificates of title of the Manotoks.

Since 1976, she and her husband resided in Manila where they rented a house.&nbsp; In 1974, Hilaria de Guzman told her she wanted to sell Lot 823 and after Hilaria had signed the deed of sale and was paid in cash P350,000.00, she obtained from Hilaria the sale certificate, assignment of sale certificate and a sketch plan. However, when she visited the land in 1981, she was told by an elderly man not to return and aspire to recover the land because it belonged to Imee Manotok.&nbsp; When she went there in 1979, the property was not fenced and it seemed to her there were no occupants.&nbsp; She met Evelyn dela Rosa in March 1979 and again in the year 2000 at the DENR. Evelyn dela Rosa asked questions about the property and her grandfather-in-law Valentin Manahan.&nbsp; Despite having seen Lot 823 vacant in 1979, 1981 and in 1989, she and her husband continued to live in Levytown. She had seen the original copy of Sale Certificate No. 511 mentioned in the 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated February 23, 1999 of Mamerto L.

She gave the owner's duplicate copy of Sale Certificate No. 511 which she got from Hilaria to DENR-NCR Director Pelayo in March 1989 without asking for a receipt. Director Pelayo, however, lost it. The witness clarified that the original copy of Sale Certificate No. 511 mentioned in Exh. XIII refers to the <i>assignment of sale certificate</i>.&nbsp; When Atty. Rogelio Mandar accompanied her for a site inspection of Lot 823 in 1997 or 1998, she saw men with firearms. On that occasion, she tagged along Policeman Fernandez from Parañaque as bodyguard because she knew of the presence of armed men in the property.&nbsp; However, she did not report the matter to the Quezon City Police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup><br><br><b>Atty.

After the assignment of the sale certificate, Hilaria de Guzman and her husband Lucio Manahan were not able to enter Lot 823 because they were prevented by some people.&nbsp; Neighbors told her that Hilaria only visited the land.&nbsp; There was an old man in his 60s, whose name she cannot remember, told her that Lucio and Hilaria lived in Malolos, Bulacan.&nbsp; As to the requirements of an investigation report, these are provided in the Surveying Manual.&nbsp; She maintained that if one (1) already has a sale certificate given by the government, no other individual can claim that property.&nbsp; A report from the field to determine the location of the land is required for the issuance of a deed of conveyance.&nbsp; As to Valentin Manahan's survey plan, Fls-3164, it was approved on December 13, 1939, after which he applied for the purchase of Lot 823.&nbsp; After paying the sum of P2,140.00, Valentin Manahan was issued a sale certificate. She did not conduct another survey of Lot 823 because she is an investigator.&nbsp; Lot 823 was not fenced in 1989; she in fact walked around the property consisting of about thirty four (34) hectares.&nbsp; She cannot anymore remember the number of persons she had interviewed.

XXV-C wherein the edge, the uppermost edge of the document is very very white and clear,&nbsp; and even on the tear that was allegedly torn because of age, it is even clearer than in the inner portion of the document.&nbsp; Uneven discoloration from the edges to the center of the document would indicate that they are not as old as they purport to be; hence they are spurious.&nbsp; Finding No. 10 refers to specimen 2 (Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated March 11, 1919)&nbsp; and specimen 3 (Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated June 7, 1920) - "A signature of an assignor/assignee on specimen number 2 showed a sharply cut line along the letter/s and distinct `scratch/tear' appear along the loop of the signature of one (1) witness on specimen 3 with an adhesive attached to make it firm."&nbsp; The witness noted there are cuts along the line of the ink entries of the signature (Exhs. XXV-I, XXV-J), which are mechanical in nature; a sharp instrument was used to cut a portion of the ink in the signature, to make an impression that the document has aged already. Finding No. 11 states that "[I]nsect bites/tears are superficial in nature especially on specimen 5 (Sale Certificate No. 651 in the name of Ambrosio Berones) and 6 (Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 651 dated April 19, 1930). The witness explained that as paper ages, even in storages, its edges would have insects or mites, insect bites or cuts; in this case, those appear to have been artificially placed on the edges. Finally, on Finding No. 12, it was noted that "[A]ttached/adhering torn sheet/s at the center/topmost portion/back of specimen 2 and on the upper left hand corner of specimen 3 are lighter in color than the document itself." Again, an indication that the documents are not as old as they purport to be and therefore spurious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup><br><br>In contrast, the standard document (Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 511 dated June 24, 1939) was found to have "showed natural aging and discoloration of paper"; it also exhibited a "water mark which is distinct under transmitted light"; "the adhesive tapes were attached along creases and tears"; and "the paper did not exhibit the characteristics which were observed on the questioned documents."&nbsp; The witness thus concluded that Exh. XXV-V and XXV-W is authentic and as old as the date indicated therein.&nbsp; The witness denied having been influenced by anybody in arriving at these findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Ms. Viloria-Magsipoc admitted that while she had attended a training course for questioned documents, she has not done any work under the Questioned Documents Division.&nbsp; This case was assigned to her by the Chief of the Forensic Chemistry Division and it took her about thirty (30) working days to finish the work. Regarding handwritten entries in ballpoint pen ink, she had read an article in the New Encyclopedia Britannica stating that ballpoint pens came in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, and that commercial models appeared in 1895.&nbsp; There is no known method in chemistry to determine the age of ballpen writing. Paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography methods were used only in determining whether the ink was ballpen ink, fountain pen, sign pen and other ink entries.&nbsp; The LMB chose specimen No. 7 (Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 511 dated June 24, 1939) as the reference standard, while specimens 1 to 6 are the questioned documents.&nbsp; She did a comparative analysis of papers and went to the National Library to look at documents which are 5 to 10 years prior to a particular date and 5 to 10 years after said date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup><br><br>The witness declared that when she went to the National Archives, she did not see a copy of the following documents: Sale Certificate No. 1054; Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated March 11, 1919; Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated June 7, 1920; Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated May 4, 1923; Sale Certificate No. 651 in the name of Ambrosio Berones; and Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 651 dated April 19, 1930. Chromatologic analysis was used in this case to determine whether the entries in the questioned documents were written in ballpoint pen ink.&nbsp; She opined that it was possible that tears and creases along the edges of the subject documents are mechanical in nature.&nbsp; As to punch holes and staple wires, these are used to determine the characteristic of paper so that if the marks and holes are clean and clear, they were made recently, regardless of whether the paper is old or new.&nbsp; The marks of staple wire or puncher on a recent document are different from those on an old document.&nbsp; A recently stapled or punched paper has a "very, very firm" impression while an old document would have some tear or a reaction of the mechanical impression, or the hair fiber would be flaky already because of the brittleness of the paper.&nbsp; However, the preservation of paper may be affected by storage conditions and a very old paper can be well-preserved, such that even if created in 1911, it could survive without any insect bites.&nbsp; As to the quality of the impression made by dry seals, it depends on the quality of the seals, the force exerted on the seal lever when the seal is being pressed on paper, and the quality of the paper itself.&nbsp; The discoloration of documents is caused by the reaction of paper to air, as well as to dust and exposure to strong light.&nbsp; It is possible that the torn portions of the document, which were lighter in color than the document itself, were separated or folded in such a way that they were less exposed than the rest of the documents before they were re-attached.&nbsp; Specimen No. 7 does not bear any stamp mark of the LMB-RMD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup><br><br>On redirect examination, Ms. Viloria-Magsipoc pointed out that ball point pens were commercially used in the Philippines in 1953; sign pens came later in the early 60s. She had used paper and thin layer chromatography of the questioned documents in determining the ink entries. Ink strokes are taken from the handwritten entries and they are spotted on a chromatographic plate both in paper and thin layer of silica gel.&nbsp; It is allowed to be diluted to a solvent system and the results would be a chromatogram that would indicate what dyes or what kind of ink is on the ink stroke that is being analyzed.&nbsp; After the chemical examination, she found that the handwritten entries in the questioned documents were all in ballpoint pen ink and sign pen ink.&nbsp; Ballpoint pens and sign pens were not yet commercially used at the time the documents were supposedly executed.&nbsp; She affirmed the findings contained in her Chemistry Report No. C-99-152 (Exh. XXV) and also her conclusion that the questioned documents were not as old as they purport to be.&nbsp; No water marks were found on the documents presented by the Manotoks which she had examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup><br><br>Responding to clarificatory questions from the court, the witness declared that water marks on documents would indicate the possible manufacturing date of the paper. Water mark that is on the manufacturer of the paper is different from the water mark being placed on those government paper for official use only. In determining the possible age of the paper, she had used both physical and chemical examination. Because of their characteristics, she was able to conclude that the questioned documents are of recent paper and they could not have possibly been executed on the dates indicated. As to carbon dating, the witness declared that the NBI does not have carbon dating. Recent document means 10 years or less. As to type of paper, she said that bond paper was used in the questioned documents; she does not know the exact date when bond paper was introduced in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup><br><br>As sur-rebuttal evidence, the Manahans presented the affidavit/deposition of Rosendo Manahan, Atty.

This was the information relayed to him by the custodian of the parish records, Felix Javier.&nbsp; Felix Javier told him he was surprised when Milagros, who borrowed the book as she wanted to photocopy some pages thereof, returned it with the half of pages 147 and 148 already missing.&nbsp; The missing pages cover deaths during the period January 26 to February 16, 1955, as evident in the remaining half-pages 147 and 148 (Exhs.

He also went to the Roman Catholic Cemetery of Malolos City to look at the tombstone (<i>lapida</i>) of his grandfather Valentin Manahan and see the date of his death inscribed thereon.&nbsp; However, the tombstone was freshly vandalized; the date of his death and middle initial of his wife Placida Figueroa Manahan were chiselled off, which he had photographed (Exhs.

Indeed, we have to take further action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[288]</sup><br></blockquote><br>But since the Court recognized there was yet no sufficient evidence to warrant the annulment of the Manotok title, the case had to be remanded to the CA for further reception of evidence for the Manotoks, as well as the Barques and Manahans, to prove a valid acquisition from the Government of Lot No. 823.<br><br>Evaluating the documentary and testimonial evidence adduced by the Manotoks, the CA concluded that they still failed to establish a valid claim over Lot 823.&nbsp; It cited the finding of the NBI Forensic Chemistry Division that the result of the chemical analysis of the documents of Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated March 11, 1919, June 7, 1920, May 4, 1923 and April 19, 1930 executed by the original claimants of Lot 823 in favor of Severino Manotok showed they were not really as old as they purport to be considering that (1) the handwritten entries were found to be made in ballpoint pen and sign pen inks, which were not yet commercially available in the Philippines until 1953 and 1965; and (2) the physical signs in the paper itself such as the uneven discoloration, artificial tears on the edges to make the document appear much older, and other tell-tale marks on the punch and staple wire holes. To contradict the findings of NBI Chemist Magsipoc, the Manotoks presented Dr. Sorra of the PNP Crime Laboratory who testified that she examined the questioned documents of the Manotoks and found them to be genuine and authentic.&nbsp; The CA, however, found Dr. Sorra's opinion of less probative value as it was based merely on the physical appearance of the questioned documents, and she did not subject these to chemical analysis or other more reliable procedures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[289]</sup><br><br>The most fatal defect stressed by the CA in its Commissioners' Report is the lack of signature of the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands (now Director of Lands) on Sale Certificate No. 1054 and approval by the Secretary of Interior/Agriculture and Commerce on the Manotoks' Sale Certificate No. 1054 and Deed of Conveyance No. 29204, as required under Act No. 1120.&nbsp; For being null and void <i>ab initio</i>, Sale Certificate No. 1054 cannot thus be the source of any legal right over Lot 823 and no valid transfer or assignment could have been made by the original claimants in favor of Severino Manotok.&nbsp; The CA found that the Manotoks' documentary evidence even showed a discrepancy since the Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054 marked as Exhs. 11, 12 and 13 showed a signature at the dorsal portion above the printed words "Director of Lands", but such signature is absent in the supposedly certified true copies obtained from the National Archives (Supplemental offer of Rebuttal Evidence, Exhs. 142, 143 and 144).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[290]&nbsp;</sup> As to Manotoks' longtime possession evidenced by tax declarations, tax receipts and buildings constructed on the land as early as 1933, the CA considered these immaterial, the property being friar land which forms part of the State's patrimonial property.<br><br><i>Barques' Claim</i><br><br>With the admission made by Teresita Barque-Hernandez that their Exh. 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[291] </sup>(certified true copy of Deed of Conveyance Record No. 4562 with Sale Certificate No. V-321) is a fake and spurious document, no legal right was acquired over Lot 823 by their predecessor-in-interest Emiliano Setosta who allegedly sold the lot to her father, Homer L. Barque.&nbsp; The CA noted that on its face, this document dated May 6, 1937 is spurious considering that while its heading indicated "Republic of the Philippines Department of Agriculture and Commerce" and the consideration for the conveyance in Japanese war notes, it is of judicial notice that the Republic of the Philippines was established only on July 4, 1946, and the identified owner of Piedad Estate should be "<i>Gobierno de las Islas Filipinas</i>" as stated in OCT No. 614.&nbsp; Moreover, Teresita J.

We quote from our Resolution dated December 18, 2008:<br><br><blockquote>The Barque title, or TCT No. 210177, under which the Barques assert title to Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, states that it was transferred from TCT No. 13900.&nbsp; The Barques assert that they bought the subject property from a certain Setosta.&nbsp; Thus, it could be deduced that TCT No. 13900 should have been registered under the name of Setosta.&nbsp; However, it was not. <i>TCT No. 13900 was registered under the name of Manotok Realty, Inc.</i> This detracts from the Barques' claim that the Manotoks do not have title to the property, as in fact the Barque title was a transfer from a title registered under the name of the Manotoks. The Barques have failed to explain the anomaly.<br><br>The Barques hinge their claim on a purported subdivision plan, FLS-3168-D, made in favor of Setosta.&nbsp; However, based on the records, it appears that there is a conflict as to its actual existence in the files of the government.&nbsp; Revelatory is the exchange of correspondence between the LMB and the LRA.&nbsp; The LMB did not have any copy of FLS-3168-D in the EDP listing, nor did the LMB have a record of the plan.&nbsp; However, a microfilm copy of FLS-3168-D was on file in the Technical Records and Statistical Section of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources - National Capital Region - (DENR-NCR).&nbsp; <i>The copy with the Technical Records and Statistical Section, which bore the stamp of the LMB, was denied by the LMB as having emanated from its office.</i><br><br>Further, the letter dated 2 January 1997 from the LMB stated that the copy of FLS-3168-D as verified from its microfilm file was the same as the copy sent by the Technical Records and Statistics Section of the National Capital Region Lands Management Sector.&nbsp; <i>The LMB, however, denied issuing such letter and stated that it was a forged document</i>.&nbsp; To amplify the forged nature of the document, the LMB sent a detailed explanation to prove that it did not come from its office. In a letter to the administrator of the LRA, the hearing officer concluded that "it is evident that there is an attempt to mislead us into favorable action by submitting forged documents, hence it is recommended that this case [be] referred to the PARAC for investigation and filing of charges against perpetrators as envisioned by this office under your administration."<br><br><i>There are significant differences between the technical description of Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate as stated in FLS-3168-D, the subdivision plan relied on by the Barques, and the technical description provided by the DENR</i>....<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Barques offered no credible explanation for the discrepancy...

The LMB's Geodetic Surveys Division is the depositary of vital records containing information on survey plans. These records consist of, <i>inter alia</i>, (1) the Logbooks for Psu, Psd, Fls, and survey plans containing the survey number, the location, the surveyor, the condition of all plans salvaged after World War II; (2) the Locator Card prepared for each plan contained in the Logbooks (The Locator Card indicates the location of the land, the Survey Number and the Accession Number.&nbsp; The Accession Number stamped on the Locator Card is also stamped on the survey plan before microfilming so that authentic microfilm copies of plans should indicate an Accession Number); (3) the Microfilms of microfilmed survey plans; and (4) the EDP Listing of plans which were salvaged, inventoried, accession numbered and microfilmed (The EDP listing was made before the decentralization of the survey plans to the various offices of the LMS. Hence, <i>if a particular survey plan is not included in the EDP Listing, it simply means that no such plan was decentralized/forwarded to the LMS.</i>)<br><br>9.&nbsp; All these records, which I have thoroughly scrutinized while I was Chief of the Geodetic Surveys Division, revealed that no such Fls-3168-D exists. The Logbook of Fls surveys, more specifically page 351 thereof (attached as Annex K), shows that the portion for Fls-3168-D was left blank.&nbsp; This simply means no Fls-3168-D was salvaged, inventoried and microfilmed by the LMB after World War II.&nbsp; Consequently, <i>no such Fls-3168-D could have been decentralized/forwarded by the LMB to LMS-DENR-NCR and therefore, it is impossible for LMS-DENR-NCR to have a microfilmed copy thereof.</i>&nbsp; Moreover, the deck of Locator Cards does not contain a Locator Card pertaining to Fls-3168-D.&nbsp; Again, this shows that Fls-3168-D was not salvaged after World War II. It should be emphasized that the Locator Card indicates the Accession Number for a particular survey plan so that without the Locator Card, the roll of microfilm containing the survey plan cannot be located.<br><br>10.&nbsp; Previously, I prepared a report which discusses in greater detail why the LMB and the LMS-DENR-NCR did not have, and until now could not have, any genuine microfilm copy or any other genuine copy of Fls-3168-D.&nbsp; A copy of this report is attached as Annex L and forms an integral part of this affidavit.

Dalire, the forwarding of the copy of Fls-3168-D to their office for validation is mandatory under DENR Administrative Order No. 49, series of 1991, and for the repeated failure of LMS-DENR-NCR to comply with the request of Engr.

Lastly, the CA cited the following letter-reply dated 03 October 2005 of Samson G. De Leon, OIC Regional Technical Director, LMS-DENR-NCR addressed to Felicitas B. Manahan (Exh.

Celzo) that Valentin Manahan, as a farmer, took possession of the subject lot in 1908 is not supported by credible evidence. Evelyn de la Rosa conducted the ocular inspection only on May 15, 1989 and her Investigation Report dated July 5, 1989 (Exhibit XV, Manahan) did not mention nor identify the person who allegedly gave her the above information when she conducted an ocular inspection of the subject lot. A closer examination of her Investigation Report narrating specific events in 1948 like the lingering illness of Lucio Manahan who died in 1955 and the alleged reports of caretakers of heavily armed men taking the subject lot by force are tell-tale evidence of a scripted report of Land Investigator Evelyn de la Rosa.&nbsp; Indubitably, the Investigation Report is dovetailed to portray actual possession of the predecessor-in-interest of Felicitas Manahan. It is no coincidence that the Investigation Report is practically a replica or summation of Felicitas Manahan's allegations embodied in her petition (Exhibit "1", Manahans, Rollo, pp. 991-995) for cancellation/reversion of TCT No. RT-22481 in the name of Severino Manotok she filed before the OSG and forwarded to the LMB.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>...the claim of actual possession in 1908 up to about 1948 when allegedly armed men forcibly wrested possession from the caretakers of Lucio Manahan is negated by the absence of tax declarations and receipts showing that the MANAHANS who claimed to be owners of the subject lot declared the subject lot for taxation and paid the real property tax during the said period. One who claim to be the owner of a parcel of land should declare it and pay the corresponding real property tax.&nbsp; Possession of a tax declaration and payment of real property tax will certainly bolster the claim of possession and ownership over a parcel of land.&nbsp; <i>No evidence was even formally offered by the MANAHANS showing that they declared the subject lot for taxation purposes in 1948.</i>&nbsp; The only documentary evidence offered by the MANAHANS is Real Property Tax Bill Receipt No. 712650 (Exhibit IX, Manahans) showing payment of real property tax only for the taxable year 1990-1991 in the sum of P102,319.22.&nbsp; On the other hand, Severino Manotok declared the subject lot for taxation, as shown in various tax declarations (Exhibits 26-A to 26-N, Manotoks), the earliest of which was dated July 28, 1933 per Tax Declaration No. 12265 (Exhibit 26, Manotoks) and paid the real property tax as evidenced by tax bill receipts (Exhibits 27 to 27-KKKKKKK, Manotoks).&nbsp; Thirdly, the Court entertains serious doubt on the existence of "Sale Certificate No. 511" allegedly issued to Valentin Manahan after paying the purchase price of P2,140.00 stated in the Investigation Report of Evelyn de la Rosa.&nbsp; Although, Sale Certificate No. 511 was mentioned as one of the documents attached to the Investigation Report, nonetheless, <i>no certified copy of Sale Certificate No. 511 issued to Valentin Manahan was presented and formally offered as evidence in Court.&nbsp; </i>As a matter of fact, Sale Certificate No. 511 was not among the documents secured from the LMB and DENR by the OSG and formally offered as evidence in Court.&nbsp; Also, Rosendo Manahan declared in Court that he tried on several occasions, after reading the Investigation Report, to secure a certified true copy of Sale Certificate No. 511, but despite a thorough search for the said document, no original or certified true copy is on file in the records of the LMB and DENR (TSN, November 19, 2009, pp. 25-26).&nbsp; <i>Sans a copy of Sale Certificate No. 511 in the files of the LMB and DENR, it is quite perplexing to note where and how Hilaria de Guzman secured a photocopy of Sale Certificate No. 511 dated June 24, 1913</i> (Exhibit XXXVII, Manahans).&nbsp; No explanation was offered by Felicitas Manahan and Rosendo Manahan when they testified in Court.&nbsp; Therefore, We cannot accord probative value on the said photocopy of Sale Certificate No. 511 dated June 24, 1913 as secondary evidence for the simple reason that it is of questionable existence and of dubious origin....<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[306] </sup>(Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>The CA thus assailed the adoption by Attys.

Defensor, the CA ruled that the Manahans, just like the Manotoks, may not invoke it to cure the lack of approval by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce in their respective sale certificate/deed of conveyance, the same being inconsistent with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act No. 1120</span>.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The core issue presented is whether the absence of approval of the Secretary of the Interior/Agriculture and Natural Resources in Sale Certificate No. 1054 and Deed of Conveyance No. 29204 warrants the annulment of the Manotok title.<br><br>From the proceedings in the CA, it was established that while records of the DENR-LMB indicate the original claimant/applicant of Lot 823 as a certain Valentin Manahan, only the Manotoks were able to produce a sale certificate in the name of their predecessors-in-interest, certified by the LMB Records Management Division (Exh. 10). In addition, the Manotoks submitted photocopies of original documents entitled Assignment of Sale Certificate dated March 11, 1919, June 7, 1920 and May 4, 1923 (Exhs. 11, 12 and 13).&nbsp; On the other hand, only two (2) of these documents were submitted by the OSG certified as available in the files of LMB:&nbsp; Assignment of Sale Certificate dated March 11, 1919 and May 4, 1923 (Exhs. 33 and 34-OSG-LMB).<br><br>Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated March 10, 1919 (Exh. 10) was not signed by the Director of Lands nor approved by the Secretary of the Interior.&nbsp; Exhibits 33 and 34-OSG-LMB contained only the signature of the Director of Lands. The Manotoks belatedly secured from the National Archives a certified copy of Deed of Conveyance No. 29204 dated December 7, 1932 (Exh. 51-A) which likewise lacks the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources as it was signed only by the Director of Lands.<br><br>Section 18 of <u>Act No. 1120</u> provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 18.&nbsp; No lease or sale made by Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands under the provisions of this Act shall be valid<b> until approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>It is clear from the foregoing provision that the sale of friar lands shall be valid only if approved by the Secretary of the Interior (later the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce).&nbsp; In <i>Solid State Multi-Products Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[312]</sup> this Court categorically declared that the approval by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce is indispensable for the validity of the sale of friar lands.&nbsp; This was reiterated in <i>Liao v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[313]</sup> where <i>sales certificates</i> issued by the Director of Lands in 1913 were held to be void in the absence of approval by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<br><br>In their Memorandum, the Manotoks pointed out that their photocopy of the original Deed of Conveyance No. 29204 (Exh. 51-A), sourced from the National Archives, shows on the second page a poorly imprinted typewritten name over the words "Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources", which name is illegible, and above it an even more poorly imprinted impression of what may be a stamp of the Secretary's approval.&nbsp; Considering that the particular copy of said deed of conveyance on which the transfer certificate of title was issued by the Register of Deeds in the name of the buyer Severino Manotok is required by law to be filed with and retained in the custody of the Register of Deeds in accordance with Sec. 56 of Act No. 496 and Sec. 56 of P.D. No. 1529, the Manotoks contend that "we can assume that the Manotok deed of conveyance was in fact approved by the Department Secretary because <i>the register of deeds did issue TCT No. 22813</i> in the name of the buyer Severino Manotok."&nbsp; It is also argued that since the Bureau of Lands was required by law to transmit the deed of conveyance <i>directly</i> to the Register of Deeds, said office is legally presumed to have observed the law's requirements for issuing that deed.&nbsp; The presumption of regularity therefore stands as uncontradicted proof, in this case, that "all...requirements for the issuance of" that deed of conveyance had been obeyed. In any event, the Manotoks assert that even if we were to ignore the presumption of validity in the performance of official duty, Department Memorandum Order No. 16-05 issued on October 27, 2005 by then DENR Secretary Michael T. Defensor, supplies the omission of approval by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in deeds of conveyances over friar lands.<br><br>These arguments fail.<br><br>Applying the rule laid down in <i>Solid State Multi-Products Corporation v.

The Manotoks' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the statutorily prescribed transmittal by the Bureau of Lands to the Register of Deeds of their deed of conveyance is untenable. In our Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[315]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners in <i>Alonso v.

Apparently, for the Manotoks, Memorandum Order&nbsp; No. 16 provides the remedy for an inequitable situation where a deed of conveyance "unsigned" by the Department Secretary could defeat their right to the subject lot <i>after </i>having fully paid for it.&nbsp; They point out that the Friar Lands Act itself states that the Government ceases reservation of its title once the buyer had fully paid the price.<br><br>The first paragraph of Section 15 states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 15. The Government hereby reserves the title to each and every parcel of land sold under the provisions of this Act <b>until the full payment of all installments or purchase money and interest by the purchaser has been made</b>, and any sale or encumbrance made by him shall be invalid as against the Government of the Philippine Islands and shall be in all respects subordinate to its prior claim.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>Indeed, in the early case of <i>Director of Lands v.

Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated March 10, 1919 (Exh. 10) purportedly on file with the DENR-LMB, conspicuously lacks the signature of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.&nbsp; In fact, Exh. 10 was not included among those official documents submitted by the OSG to the CA.&nbsp; We underscore anew that friar lands can be alienated only upon proper compliance with the requirements of Sections 11, 12 and 18 of Act No. 1120.&nbsp; It was thus primordial for the Manotoks to prove their acquisition of its title by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[323]</sup>&nbsp; This they failed to do.&nbsp; Accordingly, this Court has no alternative but to declare the Manotok title null and void <i>ab initio</i>, and Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate as still part of the Government's patrimonial property, as recommended by the CA.<br><br>The decades-long occupation by the Manotoks of Lot 823, their payment of real property taxes and construction of buildings, are of no moment.&nbsp; It must be noted that the Manotoks miserably failed to prove the existence of the title allegedly issued in the name of Severino Mantotok after the latter had paid in full the purchase price.&nbsp; The Manotoks did not offer any explanation as to why the only copy of TCT No. 22813 was torn in half and no record of documents leading to its issuance can be found in the registry of deeds.&nbsp; As to the certification issued by the Register of Deeds of Caloocan, it simply described the copy presented (Exh. 5-A) as "DILAPIDATED" without stating if the original copy of TCT No. 22813 actually existed in their records, nor any information on the year of issuance and name of registered owner.&nbsp; While TCT No. 22813 was mentioned in certain documents such as the deed of donation executed in 1946 by Severino Manotok in favor of his children and the first tax declaration (Exh. 26), these do not stand as secondary evidence of an alleged transfer from OCT No. 614.&nbsp; This hiatus in the evidence of the Manotoks further cast doubts on the veracity of their claim.<br><br>As we stressed in <i>Alonso</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Neither may the rewards of prescription be successfully invoked by respondent, as it is an iron-clad <i>dictum</i> that prescription can never lie against the Government. Since respondent failed to present the paper trail of the property's conversion to private property, the lengthy possession and occupation of the disputed land by respondent cannot be counted in its favor, as the subject property being a friar land, remained part of the patrimonial property of the Government.&nbsp; <b>Possession of patrimonial property of the Government, whether spanning decades or centuries, can not <i>ipso facto</i> ripen into ownership.</b>&nbsp; Moreover, the rule that statutes of limitation do not run against the State, unless therein expressly provided, is founded on the "the great principle of public policy, applicable to all governments alike, which forbids that the public interests should be prejudiced by the negligence of the officers or agents to whose care they are confided."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[324]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>With respect to the claim of the Manahans, we concur with the finding of the CA that no copy of the alleged Sale Certificate No. 511 can be found in the records of either the DENR-NCR, LMB or National Archives. Although the OSG submitted a certified copy of Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 511 allegedly executed by Valentin Manahan in favor of Hilaria de Guzman, there is no competent evidence to show that the claimant Valentin Manahan or his successors-in-interest actually occupied Lot 823, declared the land for tax purposes, or paid the taxes due thereon.<br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo </i>the existence and validity of the alleged Sale Certificate No. 511 and Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 511 presented by the Manahans, the CA correctly observed that the claim had become stale after the lapse of eighty six (86) years from the date of its alleged issuance.&nbsp; As this Court held in <i>Liao v.

To deny the reconstitution of the title of Homer L. Barque and to declare TCT No. 210177 null and void <i>ab initio</i>;<br><br>2.

The dispositive portion of the majority opinion states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petitions filed by the Manotoks under Rule 45 of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, as well as the petition-in-intervention of the Manahans, are DENIED.&nbsp; TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of Severino Manotok IV, et al. is hereby declared NULL and VOID, and the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City is hereby ordered to CANCEL the same.&nbsp; Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, Quezon City, legally belongs to the NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, without prejudice to the institution of REVERSION proceedings by the State through the Office of the Solicitor General.<br><br>With costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote><br>I dissent from the opinion of the majority insofar as it declares that the absence of approval by the Secretary of the Interior/Agriculture and Natural Resources of Sale Certificate No. 1054 and Deed of Conveyance No. 29204 warrants the annulment of the Manotoks' title.<br><br>The majority opinion is premised on Section 18 of Act No. 1120,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 18.&nbsp; No lease or sale made by Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands under the provisions of this Act shall be valid until approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</blockquote><br>Under Section 18, any sale of friar land by the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands (now Director of Lands) shall not be valid until approved by the Secretary. This means that the Secretary, under Section 18, approves the sale and thus signs the Deed of Conveyance upon full payment of the purchase price.&nbsp; However, under Section 12 of Act No. 1120, the Director of Lands signs the Sales Certificate upon payment of the first installment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; Section 12 of Act No. 1120 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12.&nbsp; It shall be the duty of the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands by proper investigation to ascertain what is the actual value of the parcel of land held by each settler and occupant, taking into consideration the location and quality of each holding of land, and any other circumstances giving its value. The basis of valuation shall likewise be, so far as practicable, such that the aggregate of the values of all the holdings included in each particular tract shall be equal to the cost to the Government to the entire tract, including the cost of surveys, administration and interest upon the purchase money to the time of sale.&nbsp; <b>When the cost thereof shall have been thus ascertained, <i>the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands shall give the said settler and occupant a certificate</i> which shall set forth in detail that the Government has agreed to sell to such settler and occupant the amount of land so held by him, at the price so fixed, payable as provided in this Act at the office of the Chief of Bureau of Public Lands, in gold coin of the United States or its equivalent in Philippine currency, and that upon the payment of the final installment together with all accrued interest the Government will convey to such settler and occupant the said land so held by him by proper instrument of conveyance, which shall be issued and become effective in the manner provided in section one hundred and twenty-two of the Land Registration Act.</b>&nbsp; The Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands shall, in each instance where a certificate is given to the settler and occupant of any holding, take his formal receipt showing the delivery of such certificate, signed by said settler and occupant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Boldfacing and italicization supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Under Section 12, it is only the Director of Land who signs the Sales Certificate.&nbsp; The Sales Certificate operates as a contract to sell which, under the law, the Director of Lands is authorized to sign and thus bind the Government as seller of the friar land. This transaction is a sale of private property because friar lands are patrimonial properties of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; In short, the law expressly authorizes the Director of Lands to sell private or patrimonial property of Government under a contract to sell.&nbsp; On the other hand, under Section 18, the Secretary signs the Deed of Conveyance because the Secretary must approve the sale made initially by the Director of Lands. The Deed of Conveyance operates as a deed of absolute sale which the Secretary signs upon full payment of the purchase price. The Deed of Conveyance, when presented, is authority for the Register of Deeds to issue a new title to the buyer as provided in Section 122 of&nbsp; the Land Registration Act.<br><br>The majority cite the ruling in <i>Alonso v.

However, <i>Alonso </i>should not be applied to the Manotoks' title because DENR Memorandum Order No. 16-05 was not yet issued when the Court decided <i>Alonso.</i> The absence of the Secretary's signature in the Deed of Conveyance in <i>Alonso</i> was never cured and hence the Court in <i>Alonso </i>voided the Deed of Conveyance.

Memorandum Order No. 16-05 recognizes the formality of the signature of the Secretary of Interior/Agriculture on Deeds on Conveyances. Memorandum Order No. 16-05 complies with Section 18 of Act No. 1120 by ratifying the Deeds of Conveyances that were not signed, for one reason or another, by the Secretary.&nbsp; Memorandum Order No. 16-05 only supplies a formality because as the majority expressly admit, the signature of the Secretary is merely a ministerial act upon full payment of the purchase price. Memorandum Order No. 16-05 does not dispense with the Secretary's signature bur rather cures the absence of such signature by stating that "all Deeds of Conveyance that do not bear the signature of the Secretary are <b>deemed signed</b>."&nbsp; It is as if the DENR Secretary signed each and every Deed of Conveyance that lacked the signature of the Secretary, provided of course that the purchase price had been fully paid.&nbsp; To repeat, Memorandum Order No. 16-05 applies to Deed of Conveyance No. 29204 because the land was already fully paid and the Deed of Conveyance was signed by the Director of Lands but only lacked the signature of&nbsp; the Secretary of Interior/Agriculture.<br><br>The majority assert that Section 18 of Act No. 1120 should be read in conjunction with Section 15 and that "[w]here there is no valid certificate of sale in the first place, the purchaser does not acquire any right of possession and purchase." The majority state that "the existence of a valid certificate of sale must first be established with clear and convincing evidence before a purchaser is deemed to have acquired ownership over a friar land <b><i>notwithstanding</i> the non-issuance</b> <b>by the Government, for some reason or another, of a deed of conveyance after completing the installment payments."</b>&nbsp; The majority grossly misappreciate the facts.&nbsp; Here, the Government issued Deed of Conveyance No. 29204 to the Manotoks, the existence of which the Government does not dispute.&nbsp; Moreover, the existence of the Manotoks' Sale Certificate No. 1054 has been established beyond any doubt by the existence of three succeeding Deeds of Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054.<br><br>While the Land Management Bureau (LMB) has no copy of the original Sale Certificate No. 1054 dated 10 March 1919 in the names of Regina Geronimo, Modesto Zacarias and Felicisimo Villanueva (the original grantees),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; <b>the LMB has on its file the original of <i>Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054</i> between Regina Geronimo, Zacarias Modesto and Felicisimo Villanueva as assignors and Zacarias Modesto as assignee, dated 11 March 1919,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <b>and approved by the Director of Lands on&nbsp; 22 March 1919.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; <b>The National Archives has a copy of the <i>Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 1054</i> dated 7 June 1920</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><b> between Zacarias Modesto as assignor and Severino Manotok and M.

The function of courts, especially that of the Philippine Supreme Court within the State apparatus, is to issue judicial edicts that consistently uphold legitimate expectations to promote stability and not chaos. Thus a decision that introduces instability without an overweening legal reason that has emanated from the people themselves or from the legislature should instinctively be avoided by the Supreme Court. This the majority failed to do.<br><br>The Majority Decision accomplished only the following:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; it introduced a stale, formalistic technical requirement into the system of acquisition of friar lands that trumps satisfaction of all the other elements of lawful, effective possession and ownership thereof; (2)&nbsp; it imbued a rigid meaning into the term "approval" by the Secretary of Agrarian and Natural Resources that ignores the wealth of jurisprudence in administrative law including the notion of operative facts and tacit approval; (3)&nbsp; it enabled forgers of documents to land to take advantage of the antiquity of a land system, or the fact that the land system had endured massive destruction of its records due to fire, to attack land titles made vulnerable by these circumstances; (4)&nbsp; it encouraged a microscopic scrutiny of all the technical requirements 106 years after the system of disposition of friar lands was set up, thus endangering the property rights of all title holders to friar lands; and (5)&nbsp; it left open to attack the established legal principles on sales and perfection of contracts.&nbsp; Contrary to the presumed intent of the majority of my brethren, their opinion has not succeeded in clarifying the legal regime on friar lands but has instead created dangers for the system of property rights in the Philippines.<br><br>Thus, I lend my voice to the Dissenting Opinions of Justices Carpio and Carpio Morales. The majority should have considered the reasoning and objectives behind the Carpio and Carpio Morales Dissenting Opinions as promotive of property rights. Without stability of property rights, the country's economic development process and the pursuit of each man's right to happiness will in the long run be negated. This in turn up-ends expectations on the part of the body politic that transactions between property right holders and transferees of such rights will be respected.&nbsp; This respect for the sanctity of such transactions is supposed in turn to create a virtuous cycle of commerce, the end result being that of a prosperous wealth-creating system.&nbsp; What the Majority Decision did is exactly opposite the intent of our Constitution, when, in various provisions, it makes a stable market mechanism equivalent to economic due process.&nbsp; In Article II, section 5 of the Constitution, the protection of property is deemed essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy.&nbsp; The just and dynamic social order described in Section 9 of the same Article envisions a market system where transactions validly entered upon are upheld by courts. Article II, section 1 in effect guarantees that the possession of all the requisites for title-holding by persons not be disturbed save by superior legal bases.<br><br>Should the legal system fail to promote the stability of property rights, there will be an increase in the uncertainty surrounding economic outcomes.&nbsp; If stability cannot be ensured and there is a lack of credible commitment on the part of the ruling body to safeguard the rights of the right-bearers (<i>i.e </i>the holders of rights to property), the value of property is undermined by risk and there is far less incentive for investment. The choices economic entities make will be severely limited, being hampered by these disincentives, and as a result, economic growth will drop. Unpredictability and uncertainty with regard to future values, as well as the inefficiencies of outcomes brought about by an uneven application of distributive arrangements of property rights, will assail the very foundations of our economic system.&nbsp; The Majority Decision throws into disarray the functional order of property laws.<br><br>When the Court in effect says that the following features of the Manotoks' claims are trumped by the lack of affixation of a signature â”€â”€ which the law in any case pronounces as but ministerial and thus superfluous â”€â”€ it in effect contradicts the logic of the Torrens system and the property rights system on which it is based.&nbsp; For one, it conveys a message to the public that 77-year possession, payment of realty taxes, and a plethora of documentary evidence are not enough to overturn a single technical detail which should have been in the first place supplied by the Government, not by the Manotoks. Secondly, it is simply wrong for the Court to ignore the remedial intent of DENR Memorandum Order No. 16-05, when the Order tries to supply a legal solution to the problems created by the failure of the Secretary of the Interior/Agriculture and Natural Resources to affix his signature to Deeds of Conveyance of friar lands.<br><br>While the private parties are expected to seek reconsideration of the Majority Decision, the Government is faced with a choice created by the unexpected windfall this Court has granted it in the form of the reverted land â”€â”€&nbsp; whether to live with and profit by the Majority Decision, or to seek its reconsideration because of the over-all danger that the decision poses to the system of property rights. It can assert that DENR Memorandum Order No. 16-05 is the State's remedial measure intended to set to rest whatever doubts may have lingered regarding the legal requirements on friar lands. It must carefully and correctly assess&nbsp; the situation arisen from the Majority Decision that now confronts the State. After all, it will be the Government that will need to face the economic fall-out from an unstable property rights regime.<br></div>
