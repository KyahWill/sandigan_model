The physical evidence is hereby forfeited in favor of the government to be disposed of in accordance with law.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In convicting appellant, the trial court gave a one-paragraph ratiocination, <i>viz.</i><br><br><blockquote>With the bare and lame denials of the accused, abjectly uncorroborated and without substantiation, apart from his self-serving attempt at extenuation as against the <u><b>positive testimony</b> of the arresting police officer who enjoys <b>the presumption of regularity</b> in the performance of his official duties,</u> there <u>being <b>no showing of malicious motive</b></u> to testify against the accused, it is the Court's view that the State has successfully discharged its prosecutory function by <u>sufficiently showing the concurrence of the elements of the offense charged.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>On appeal, the appellate court, by Decision of April 30, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>affirmed</i> that of the trial court's but <i>modified</i> the penalty, holding that the nomenclature and periods of the penalties under the Revised Penal Code should not have been used by the trial court in the determination thereof as it (the trial court) should have been guided by the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.&nbsp; Thus the appellate court disposed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the appealed Decision dated October 12, 2005 of the RTC of Cebu City, in Criminal Case No. CBU-68618 convicting accused-appellant Julius Gadiana y Repollo for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165, is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with <b>MODIFICATION. </b>As modified, accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from <u>TWELVE (12) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY&nbsp; as minimum, to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS as maximum</u>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Hence, the present appeal.<br><br>Appellant maintains that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>As reflected above, the trial court credited the "positive" version of PO1 Busico in light of the presumption of regularity in the performance of his official duties and absent a showing of malice.<br><br>Recall, however, that during the pre-trial, the "<u>existence</u> but <u>not the source</u>" of the two sachets was stipulated on by the parties.&nbsp; It was thus incumbent on the prosecution to prove the chain of custody rule.<br><br>Chain of custody establishes the identity of the subject substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; It requires that testimony be presented about every link in the chain, from the moment the item is seized up to the time it is offered in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; When nagging doubts persist on whether the item confiscated is the same specimen examined and established to be prohibited drug,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> there can be no crime of illegal possession of a prohibited drug.<br><br>Except for the charge sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> prepared against appellant which stated that evidence consisted of "two (2) heat-sealed clear plastic sachets containing shabu with markings `JGR-1' and `JGR-2,'" nowhere in the record is a showing that the marking was done in the presence of appellant or his representatives or that a physical inventory and photograph of the seized items were taken as required under paragraph 1, Section 21, Article II of R.A.

Cabahug, PNP</u><br></blockquote><br>Not only was PO1 Busico's testimony that Ferrer prepared the letter-request for laboratory examination hearsay as he did not claim having seen PO3 Dinauanao actually prepare it.&nbsp; The transcripts of stenographic notes do not show that the trial court tested the credibility of witness PO1 Busico and of his testimony.&nbsp; The trial court's conviction of appellant upon its above-quoted one-paragraph ratiocination, which was affirmed by the appellate court, does not thus merit this Court's affirmance.<br><br>Parenthetically, appellant's arrest, not to mention resulting confiscation of the alleged confiscation of the plastic sachets of crystalline substances in his possession, leaves nagging doubts on its validity in light of the fact that what PO1 Busico merely saw was appellant's placing of the plastic sachets in his pocket which, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without more</span>, does not justify his warrantless arrest under the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the April 30, 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE.&nbsp; </b> Appellant, Julius Gadiana y Repollo, is <b>ACQUITTED </b>of the crime charged and ordered immediately <b>RELEASED</b> from custody, unless he is being held for some other lawful cause.<br><br>The Director of the Bureau of Corrections is <b>ORDERED</b> to forthwith implement this decision and to <b>INFORM</b> this Court, within five days from receipt hereof, of action taken.<br><br>Let a copy of this Decision be forwarded to the Secretary of Justice, the PNP Director, and the Director General of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, for information and guidance.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, Del Castillo,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Villarama, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 879 dated August 13, 2010.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit "A," records, p. 5.&nbsp; The form appears to be a photocopy.&nbsp; But the typewritten entries above the blank spaces appear to be original.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The underlined portions appear to have been blank spaces over which the data filled over then were supplied with a different typeset.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Records at 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>People v.
