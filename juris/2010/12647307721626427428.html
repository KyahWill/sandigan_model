				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the November 10, 2006 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and May 18, 2007 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 93610.<br><br>Atty. Franklin V. Tamargo and his eight-year-old daughter, Gail Franzielle, were shot and killed at around 5:15 p.m. of August 15, 2003 along Nueva Street corner Escolta Street, Binondo, Manila. The police had no leads on the perpetrators of the crime until a certain Reynaldo Geron surfaced and executed an affidavit dated September 12, 2003.  He stated that a certain Lucio Columna told him during a drinking spree that Atty. Tamargo was ordered killed by respondent Lloyd Antiporda and that he (Columna) was one of those who killed Atty. Tamargo. He added that he told the Tamargo family what he knew and that the sketch of the suspect closely resembled Columna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>After conducting a preliminary investigation and on the strength of Geron's affidavit, the investigating prosecutor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> issued a resolution dated December 5, 2003 finding probable cause against Columna and three John Does.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  On February 2, 2004, the corresponding Informations for murder were filed against them in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, one assigned to Branch 27 for the death of Atty. Franklin Tamargo, and the other to Branch 29 for the death of the minor Gail Franzielle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  Columna was arrested in the province of Cagayan on February 17, 2004 and brought to Manila for detention and trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 2004, Columna (whose real name was Manuel, Jr.) executed an affidavit wherein he admitted his participation as "look out" during the shooting and implicated respondent Romulo Awingan (alias "Mumoy") as the gunman and one Richard Mecate. He also tagged as masterminds respondent Licerio Antiporda, Jr. and his son, respondent Lloyd Antiporda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The former was the ex-mayor and the latter the mayor of Buguey, Cagayan at that time.  When the killing took place, Licerio Antiporda was in detention for a kidnapping case in which Atty. Tamargo was acting as private prosecutor.<br><br>Pursuant to this affidavit, petitioner Harold V. Tamargo (brother of Atty. Tamargo) filed a complaint against those implicated by Columna in the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On April 19, 2004, Columna affirmed his affidavit before the investigating prosecutor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> who subjected him to clarificatory questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Respondents denied any involvement in the killings.  They alleged that Licerio was a candidate for mayor in Buguey, Cagayan during the May 2004 elections and that the case was instituted by his political opponents in order to derail his candidacy. The Antipordas admitted that Atty. Tamargo was their political rival for the mayoralty post of Buguey.  Atty. Tamargo had been defeated twice by Lloyd and once by Licerio.  Before the killing, Atty. Tamargo filed an election case against Lloyd and a kidnapping case in the Sandiganbayan against Licerio.  However, they claimed that both cases were dismissed as Lloyd emerged as the winner in the elections and Licerio was acquitted by the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>During the preliminary investigation, respondent Licerio presented Columna's unsolicited handwritten letter dated May 3, 2004 to respondent Lloyd, sent from Columna's jail cell in Manila.  In the letter, Columna disowned the contents of his March 8, 2004 affidavit and narrated how he had been tortured until he signed the extrajudicial confession. He stated that those he implicated had no participation in the killings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Respondent Licerio also submitted an affidavit of Columna dated May 25, 2004 wherein the latter essentially repeated the statements in his handwritten letter.<br><br>Due to the submission of Columna's letter and affidavit, the investigating prosecutor set a clarificatory hearing, to enable Columna to clarify his contradictory affidavits and his unsolicited letter.  During the hearing held on October 22, 2004, Columna categorically admitted the authorship and voluntariness of the unsolicited letter. He affirmed the May 25, 2004 affidavit and denied that any violence had been employed to obtain or extract the affidavit<i> </i>from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Thus, on November 10, 2004, the investigating prosecutor recommended the dismissal of the charges. This was approved by the city prosecutor.<br><br>Meanwhile, in another handwritten letter addressed to City Prosecutor Ramon Garcia dated October 29, 2004, Columna said that he was only forced to withdraw all his statements against respondents during the October 22, 2004 clarificatory hearing because of the threats to his life inside the jail. He requested that he be transferred to another detention center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved by the dismissal of the charges, petitioner filed an appeal to the Department of Justice (DOJ).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  On May 30, 2005, the DOJ, through then Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez, reversed the dismissal and ordered the filing of the Informations for murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  He opined that the March 8, 2004 extrajudicial confession was not effectively impeached by the subsequent recantation and that there was enough evidence to prove the probable guilt of respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Accordingly, the Informations were filed and the cases were consolidated and assigned to the RTC of Manila, Branch 29.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>However, on August 12, 2005, Secretary Gonzales granted the Antipordas' motion for reconsideration (MR) and directed the withdrawal of the Informations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  This time, he declared that the extrajudicial confession of Columna was inadmissible against respondents and that, even if it was admissible, it was not corroborated by other evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  As a result, on August 22, 2005, the trial prosecutor filed a motion to withdraw the Informations.  On October 4, 2005, Secretary Gonzalez denied petitioner's MR.<br><br>The RTC, through Judge Cielito Mindaro-Grulla, granted the motion to withdraw the Informations in an order dated October 26, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  Petitioner filed an MR but the judge voluntarily inhibited herself without resolving the same.  The cases were re-raffled to Branch 19, presided by Judge Zenaida R. Daguna. Judge Daguna granted the MR of petitioner in a resolution dated December 9, 2005.  She ruled that, based on Columna's March 8, 2004 affidavit which he affirmed before the investigating prosecutor, there was probable cause to hold the accused for trial.  She denied the MR of the Antipordas in an order dated February 6, 2006.<br><br>Consequently, respondent Awingan filed a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition in the CA docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 93610.  The Antipordas separately filed another certiorari case docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 94188.<br><br>In a decision dated November 10, 2006 in CA-G.R. SP No. 93610, the CA ruled that the RTC judge gravely abused her discretion because she arbitrarily left out of her assessment and evaluation the substantial matters that the DOJ Secretary had fully taken into account in concluding that there was no probable cause against all the accused.  It also held that Columna's extrajudicial confession was not admissible against the respondents because, aside from the recanted confession, there was no other piece of evidence presented to establish the existence of the conspiracy. Additionally, the confession was made only after Columna was arrested and not while the conspirators were engaged in carrying out the conspiracy.<br><br>After this decision was promulgated, CA-G.R. SP No. 93610 was consolidated with CA-G.R. SP No. 94188.  The CA denied reconsideration in a resolution dated May 18, 2007.  In a decision dated August 24, 2007, the CA likewise granted the petition for certiorari of respondents Antiporda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed this petition assailing the decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 93610.  Later on, he filed an amended petition impleading respondents Antiporda and likewise assailing the CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 94188.  The Court treated this as a supplemental petition.<br><br>The main issue for our resolution is whether or not the CA erred in finding that Judge Daguna had committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the withdrawal of the Informations for murder against respondents.<br><br>Petitioner argues that, based on the independent assessment of Judge Daguna, there was probable cause based on the earlier affidavit of Columna.  She considered all the pieces of evidence but did not give credit to Columna's recantation.<br><br>Respondents counter that Judge Daguna committed grave abuse of discretion by limiting her evaluation and assessment only to evidence that supported probable cause while completely disregarding contradicting evidence.  They also contend that Columna's extrajudicial confession was inadmissible against respondents because of the rule on <i>res inter alios acta</i>.<br><br>We find no merit in the petition.<br><br>It is settled that, when confronted with a motion to withdraw an Information (on the ground of lack of probable cause to hold the accused for trial based on a resolution of the DOJ Secretary), the trial court has the duty to make an independent assessment of the merits of the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  It may either agree or disagree with the recommendation of the Secretary. Reliance alone on the resolution of the Secretary would be an abdication of the trial court's duty and jurisdiction to determine a <i>prima facie</i> case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  The court must itself be convinced that there is indeed no sufficient evidence against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>We agree with the CA that Judge Daguna limited herself only to the following:  (1) Columna's affidavit dated March 8, 2004 wherein he implicated the respondents in the murders; (2) his affirmation of this affidavit during the April 19, 2004 clarificatory hearing; (3) his letter dated October 29, 2004 and (4) the May 30, 2005 DOJ resolution upholding the prosecutor's recommendation to file the murder charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>She completely ignored other relevant pieces of evidence such as: (1) Columna's May 3, 2004 letter to respondent Lloyd Antiporda narrating the torture he suffered to force him to admit his participation in the crimes and to implicate the respondents; (2) his May 25, 2004 affidavit where he stated that neither he nor the respondents had any involvement in the murders and (3) his testimony during the October 22, 2004 clarificatory hearing wherein he categorically affirmed his May 3, 2004 letter and May 25, 2004 affidavit.<br><br>We declared in <i>Jimenez v. Jimenez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><i> </i>that<br><br><blockquote>[although] there is no general formula or fixed rule for the determination of probable cause since the same must be decided in the light of the conditions obtaining in given situations and its existence depends to a large degree upon the finding or opinion of the judge conducting the examination, <b>such a finding should not disregard the facts before the judge nor run counter to the clear dictates of reason. The judge or fiscal, therefore, should not go on with the prosecution in the hope that some credible evidence might later turn up during trial for this would be a flagrant violation of a basic right which the courts are created to uphold.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Had Judge Daguna reviewed the entire records of the investigation, she would have seen that, aside from the pieces of evidence she relied on, there were others which cast doubt on them.  We quote with approval the reflections of the CA on this point:<br><br><blockquote>The selectivity of respondent RTC Judge for purposes of resolving the <i>motion to withdraw the informations</i> effectively sidetracked the guidelines for an independent assessment and evaluation of the merits of the case.  Respondent RTC Judge thus impaired the substantial rights of the accused.  Instead, she should have made a circumspect evaluation by looking at everything made available to her at that point of the cases.  No less than that was expected and required of her as a judicial officer. According to <i>Santos v. Orda, Jr.</i>, the trial judge may make an independent assessment of the merits of the case based on the affidavits and counter-affidavits, documents, or evidence appended to the Information; the records of the public prosecutor which the court may order the latter to produce before the court; or any evidence already adduced before the court by the accused at the time the motion is filed by the public prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>Moreover, Judge Daguna failed to consider that Columna's extrajudicial confession in his March 8, 2004 affidavit was not admissible as evidence against respondents in view of the rule on <i>res inter alios acta.</i><br><br><i>Res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet</i>.  The rule on <i>res inter alios acta</i> provides that the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  Consequently, an extrajudicial confession is binding only on the confessant, is not admissible against his or her co-accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and is considered as hearsay against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  The reason for this rule is that:<br><br><blockquote>on a principle of good faith and mutual convenience, a man's own acts are binding upon himself, and are evidence against him.  So are his conduct and declarations. Yet it would not only be rightly inconvenient, but also manifestly unjust, that a man should be bound by the acts of mere unauthorized strangers; and if a party ought not to be bound by the acts of strangers, neither ought their acts or conduct be used as evidence against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>An exception to the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule is an admission made by a conspirator under Section 30, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court:<br><br><blockquote>Admission by conspirator. -- The act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its existence, may be given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration.</blockquote><br>This rule prescribes that the act or declaration of the conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its existence may be given in evidence against co-conspirators provided that the conspiracy is shown by independent evidence aside from the extrajudicial confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, in order that the admission of a conspirator may be received against his or her co-conspirators, it is necessary that (a) the conspiracy be first proved by evidence other than the admission itself (b) the admission relates to the common object and (c) it has been made while the declarant was engaged in carrying out the conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  Otherwise, it cannot be used against the alleged co-conspirators without violating their constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against them and to cross-examine them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Here, aside from the extrajudicial confession, which was later on recanted, no other piece of evidence was presented to prove the alleged conspiracy.  There was no other prosecution evidence, direct or circumstantial, which the extrajudicial confession could corroborate. Therefore, the recanted confession of Columna, which was the sole evidence against respondents, had no probative value and was inadmissible as evidence against them.<br><br>Considering the paucity and inadmissibility of the evidence presented against the respondents, it would be unfair to hold them for trial. Once it is ascertained that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused, they should be relieved from the pain of going through a full blown court case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  When, at the outset, the evidence offered during the preliminary investigation is nothing more than an uncorroborated extrajudicial confession of an alleged conspirator, the criminal complaint should not prosper so that the system would be spared from the unnecessary expense of such useless and expensive litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  The rule is all the more significant here since respondent Licerio Antiporda remains in detention for the murder charges pursuant to the warrant of arrest issued by Judge Daguna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Indeed, at that stage of the proceedings, the duty of Judge Daguna was only to satisfy herself whether there was probable cause or sufficient ground to hold respondents for trial as co-conspirators.  Given that she had no sufficient basis for a finding of probable cause against respondents, her orders denying the withdrawal of the Informations for murder against them were issued with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Hence, we hold that the CA committed no reversible error in granting the petitions for certiorari of respondents.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio Morales, Velasco, Jr., Nachura</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Penned by Associate Justice Lucas P.

The full text of the September 12, 2003 affidavit read:<br><br><blockquote>1.  About a week before August 15, 2003, I was in the house of Lucio Columna at Battalan, Lasam and there we drank gin together and stayed with him for several hours since we are close friends. In the course of our conversation we talked about the chances of Atty. Franklin Tamargo to win his election protest in the election for mayor of Buguey, Cagayan, and I told him what I heard that Atty. Tamargo was winning in the protest, Lucio Columna immediately said he could bet that Atty. Tamargo could not sit and assume as mayor even if he wins. Later I learned that Atty. Tamargo was killed last August 15.<br><br>2.  Last week, Lucio Columna and I were again together in the morning in our Barangay and he asked me to drink gin with him, and we continued drinking until about noon time. When he had drunk much, he told me "Awanen ni boss mon nga Tamargon, pinapatay ni Lloyd. Dakami pay ket di ti pimmatay." (Your boss Tamargo is already gone, he was ordered killed by Lloyd. In fact, we were the ones who killed him). He also said "Tamargo ka, Antiporda ak, no kayat mo saan ka nga agusubli diay Buguey yen ta awan met ni boss mon, agdakua ta ti negosyo ditoyen." (You are for Tamargo and I am for Antiporda; if you want, do not go back to Buguey anymore since your boss is already gone so that we can be together in business here). I know he is in the business of selling "shabu" and marijuana.<br><br>3.  I decided to come to Manila to tell the family what I know. I was shown the sketch of the face of suspect and I can say that the front side closely resembles that of Lucio Columna, and I am executing this freely and willingly to attest to its truth in court.</blockquote><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Assistant Prosecutor Bernardino R.
