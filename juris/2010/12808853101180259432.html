This is because the administrative agency concerned is in the best position to correct any previous error committed in its forum.&nbsp; Clearly, the filing of the petition for declaratory relief with the trial court had no basis, as there can be no issue ripe for judicial determination when the matter is within the primary jurisdiction of an administrative agency, the HLURB.<br><br>Consequently, inasmuch as the filing of the petition below was premature, appellant's application for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction, which is merely ancillary to the petition, has no leg to stand on."</blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration but it was denied by the Court of Appeals in its August 9, 2006 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition<i> (filed by Honesto V.
