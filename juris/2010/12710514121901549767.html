Cruz, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  There, he and about 30 to 40 other victims of the agency arrested the three accused by virtue of a citizen's arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  The accused were first brought to the Sta.

In accordance with our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court resolved to transfer the cases to the Court of Appeals for intermediate review.<br><br>On 31 January 2008, the Court of Appeals rendered the Decision now subject of this review.  The dispositive portion of which provides:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>I. The judgment of the trial court in Criminal Case No. 02-200788 finding the accused-appellant Rodolfo Gallo guilty of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and sentencing him to life imprisonment, as well as to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos is AFFIRMED.<br><br>The judgments in Criminal Cases Nos. 02-200803 and 02-200812 sentencing the accused-appellant to suffer an indeterminate prison term of four (4) years, two (2) months of <i>prision</i><i> correccional</i> to ten (10) years of  <i>prision</i><i> mayor</i> is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATION:<br><br>In additional to the P45,000.00 each to be paid by the accused-appellant to Ian Fernandez and Reynaldo Panlilio as actual damages; the accussed-appellant is also ordered to pay legal interest on the said amount of P45,000.00 from the time of the filing of the Information until fully paid.<br><br>II. The judgment in Criminal Case No. 02-200810 finding the accused-appellant guilty of estafa is MODIFIED, and the accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from one (1) year, eight (8) months and twenty-one (21) days of <i>prision</i><i> correccional</i> minimum to five (5) years, five (5) months and [eleven] (11) days of <i>prision</i><i> correccional</i> maximum.  The accused-appellant shall pay Zenaida Filomeno P20,000.00 by way of actual damages.  In addition, the accused-appellant shall also pay legal interest on the said amount of P20,000.00 from the time of filing of the Information until fully paid.<br><br>In all four cases, the accused-appellant Rodolfo Gallo shall be credited with the full extent of his preventive imprisonment pursuant to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.  Costs against accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>On 21 January 2009, the Court resolved to require the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desire, within thirty (30) days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  Appellant filed a Manifestation dated 18 March 2009 stating that he will no longer file a supplemental brief and is adopting his Appellant's Brief as his Supplemental Brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  The Office of the Solicitor General likewise manifested that it would no longer file a supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In his Brief, appellant assigns the following as errors committed by the trial court:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT A <i>QUO</i> ERRED IN GIVING MUCH WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THREE COUNTS OF ESTAFA NOTWITHSTANDING THE PATENT ABSENCE OF CRIMINAL INTENT ON THE PART OF THE LATTER.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE ALL THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME CHARGED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Appellant, in essence, claims that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The appeal must fail.  We find no valid grounds to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the lower court's judgment of conviction.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that the issue of credibility is the domain of the trial court which had the opportunity to observe the deportment and manner of the witnesses as they testified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  The findings of facts of a trial court, arrived at only after a hearing and evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses, certainly deserve respect by an appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  Unless it plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, may affect the result of the case, appellate courts will not disturb the findings of the trial court on the issue of credibility of witnesses, it being in a better position to decide the question, having heard and observed the witnesses themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>We find no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify a deviation from the general rule.  The trial court's findings and conclusions are duly supported by the evidence on record; thus, there is no reason to disturb them.<br><br>Moreover, there is no showing that the private complainants were impelled by any ill motive that could have affected their credibility. Where there is nothing to show that the witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by improper motive, their positive and categorical declarations on the witness stand, under the solemnity of an oath, deserve full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Appellant professes lack of criminal intent to escape liability for <i>estafa</i>.  He maintains that, like the private complainants, he is also an applicant trying his luck at finding work overseas; that he would usually help out in office work on occasions that he would visit the agency as an applicant which explains why complainants could have indeed seen and conversed with him about their applications.<br><br>These implausible arguments fail to persuade us.<br><br>As with the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals, this Court is likewise convinced that the prosecution was able to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, appellant's guilt for <i>estafa</i> under Article 315 (2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Article 315. Swindling (estafa). x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>1. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br><blockquote>(a)By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits.<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Under the above-quoted provision, there are three (3) ways of committing <i>estafa</i>:  (1) by using a fictitious name; (2) by falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; and (3) by means of other similar deceits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  To convict for this type of crime, it is essential that the false statement or fraudulent representation constitutes the very cause or the only motive which induces the complainant to part with the thing of value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In the case before us, appellant and Martir led the private complainants to believe that they possessed the power, qualifications and means to provide work in Korea.  During the trial of these cases, it was clearly shown that, together with Martir, appellant discussed with private complainants the fact of their being deployed abroad for a job if they pay the processing fee, and that he actually received payments from private complainants.  Thus, it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the three private complainants were deceived into believing that there were jobs waiting for them in a factory in Korea when in fact there were none.  Because of the assurances of appellant, each of the private complainants parted with their money and suffered damages as a result of their being unable to leave for Korea.  The elements of <i>estafa</i><i> â”€ </i>deceit and damage â”€ are thus indisputably present, making the conviction for <i>estafa</i> appropriate.<br><br>Appellant's defense that he is also an applicant is unavailing given the complete absence of any attempt on his part to seek a refund of the money he allegedly paid to the agency when the job promised him failed to materialize.  He did not complain at all, at the very least, but, instead, even "helped out" at the office whenever he went there to follow up his application.  As aptly put by the Court of Appeals, "[s]uch a story is highly improbable, incompatible with human behavior and contrary to ordinary experience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Likewise, we find that the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly found appellant guilty of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale under Republic Act No. 8042,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the pertinent provision of which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Definition. - For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13(f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines: Provided, That any such non-licensee or non-holder who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad to two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another.  It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group. x x x.<br></blockquote><br>To constitute illegal recruitment in large scale, three elements must concur:  (a) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; (b) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the same Code (now Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8042); and, (c) the offender committed the same against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Article 13(b) of the Labor Code defines recruitment and placement as "any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers; and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not."  In the simplest terms, illegal recruitment is committed by persons who, without authority from the government, give the impression that they have the power to send workers abroad for employment purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>We are persuaded that all three elements of illegal recruitment in large scale were proven in this case.<br><br>First, appellant had no valid license or authority to engage in the recruitment and placement of workers. This is established by the <i>Karagdagang</i><i> Salaysay</i> executed by Pacardo on 8 March 2002, paragraph 6 of which states that while MPM applied for a license, it was never issued one, for which reason, it changed its name to New Filipino Manpower Development and Services, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Second, despite not having such authority, appellant nevertheless engaged in recruitment activities, offering and promising jobs to private complainants and collecting from them various amounts as placement fees.  This is substantiated by the respective testimonies of the three private complainants.<br><br>Fernandez narrated that it was appellant who assured him that if he pays P45,000.00, he would be able to leave for Korea within two to three months.  Both Fernandez and Panlilio affirmed that they gave the money to appellant who issued a receipt therefore.  Filomeno testified that when she went to the office of Martir, the latter and appellant were in the process of accepting applicants for work overseas.  They told her that as a factory worker in Korea, she would have a monthly salary of US$500.00 with overtime pay.  Relying on their misrepresentations, she paid the placement fee to appellant and Martir.<br><br>Thus, the mere denials of appellant cannot stand against the clear, positive and straightforward testimonies of private complainants who positively identified appellant as one of two persons who undertook to recruit them for a supposed employment in Korea.  As already previously mentioned, absent any evidence that the prosecution witnesses were motivated by improper motives, the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses shall not be interfered with by this Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 31 January 2008 in CA-G.R.
