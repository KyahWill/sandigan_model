				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Jaren Tibong y Culla-ag (petitioner) was indicted for attempted rape allegedly committed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 14<sup>th</sup> [<i>sic</i>]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> day of April 2006, at Betag, Municipality of La Trinidad, Province of Benguet, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with lewd designs</span>, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously <span style="text-decoration: underline;">try and attempt to rape</span> [AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>] while the latter was sleeping and therefore unconscious, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by removing the latter's pajama and panty, and thereafter holding her vagina and fondling her breasts, and endeavor to have sexual intercourse with her against her will</span> and consent, thereby commencing in the execution of the crime of rape but did not perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the felony as a consequence by reason that the offended party was awakened, defended herself and escaped from him, which cause is not his spontaneous desistance, to the damage and prejudice of the said [AAA].<br><br>That the accused and [AAA] are relatives within the 3<sup>rd</sup> civil degree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>On April 17, 2006, then 18-year-old AAA, a college student at the Benguet State University, was at the house owned by petitioner's parents at Betag, La Trinidad, Benguet where she was boarding.&nbsp; She occupied a room at the 3-bedroom basement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> One of the rooms was occupied by petitioner and his wife.&nbsp; The third room was unoccupied.<br><br>From the account of AAA, the following transpired:<br><br>Days before the incident, petitioner's wife left the house after a misunderstanding with him.&nbsp; Before midnight of April 17,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 2006, petitioner arrived and repaired to the sofa at the basement's living room. AAA thereafter fell asleep but was awakened at about midnight as she "felt someone was undressing [her]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She saw petitioner, her first cousin (her father and his mother being siblings), wearing only "briefs" and "crouching over [her]," "on top of [her] bed," and pulling down her pajamas and panties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She asked appellant why he was doing that, to which he replied that "[they] will have sexual intercourse" and keep it a secret.&nbsp; She retorted if he was not sickened about it, to which he replied that she need not be bothered about their being cousins.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Continuing, AAA narrated:<br><br>She resisted and pulled up her pajamas and panties, but appellant pulled them down to her knees and mashed her breasts.&nbsp; He soon told her that they would watch a "bold" movie and apply what they watched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She struggled to free herself, but he forced her to lie down.&nbsp; She tried to shout for help, but he covered her mouth.<br><br>AAA further recounted:<br><br>Petitioner thereafter went towards the compact disc (CD) player which was "in front of the door of [her] room" to insert/play a CD.&nbsp; Finding the opportunity to escape, she grabbed her cell phone and bag which were placed on top of a table at her bedside, ran out of the house after appellant failed to restrain her, headed towards the highway, took a taxicab and proceeded to the house of her elder brother BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in Bahong, La Trinidad where she sought refuge.<br><br>The following morning (April 18), AAA, accompanied by BBB and an uncle, reported the incident to the La Trinidad Police Station where P03 Chona P. Bugnay took down her sworn complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The presentation of prosecution witnesses BBB and P03 Chona Bugnay was dispensed with, the defense having admitted the corroborative nature of their respective testimonies.<br><br>Upon the other hand, petitioner whose wife, as earlier reflected, left the house days before the incident after a quarrel with him, denied the accusation.&nbsp; He claimed that in the afternoon of April 17, 2006 until past 1:00 A.M. of the following day (April 18), he was drinking liquor with his friend Benny Malao (Malao) in three places - first at his (petitioner's) father's house, then at Maryland, and finally at Malao's boarding house, all located at La Trinidad; and on returning home drunk early morning of April 18, he immediately went to sleep at the living room adjacent to AAA's room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Branch 62 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of La Trinidad, Benguet found petitioner guilty of attempted rape, as charged, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the accused must be, as he is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of attempted rape.<br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, there being no modifying circumstance established, he is hereby imposed a penalty of imprisonment ranging from three (3) years and four (4) months of <i>prision correccional</i> medium, as minimum, to eight (8) years and six (6) months of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, as maximum.<br><br>The accused is hereby ordered to pay the private complainant moral damages in the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals <i>affirmed</i> petitioner's conviction, hence, the present petition for review on certiorari, contending that the prosecution failed to prove petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Petitioner cites <i>Perez v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which held:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner's acts of lying on top of the complainant, embracing and kissing her, mashing her breasts, inserting his hand inside her panty and touching her sexual organ, while admittedly obscene and detestable acts, <b>do not constitute attempted rape absent any showing that petitioner</b> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually commenced to force his penis into the complainant's sexual organ</span>. </b>Rather, these acts constitute acts of lasciviousness. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Insisting that there was no attempted rape, petitioner argues that AAA merely testified that he told her that they would have sexual intercourse; and that "this is not equivalent to carnal knowledge, or even an attempt to have carnal knowledge," since there is no showing that he had commenced or attempted to insert his penis into her sexual organ before she fled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Under Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code, there is an <i>attempt</i> to commit a felony when the offender commences its commission directly by overt acts but does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.<br><br>Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Any person who shall commit any act of lasciviousness upon the other person of either sex, under any of the circumstances mentioned in the preceding article [referring to Article 335 on rape], shall be punished by <i>prision correccional</i>.</blockquote><br>While rape and acts of lasciviousness have the same nature, they are fundamentally different. For <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in rape, there is the intent to lie with a woman,</span> whereas in acts of lasciviousness, this element is absent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Ironically, during the defense's cross examination of AAA, the existence of petitioner's overt acts showing his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intent to lie</span> with her was put to light. Consider the following testimony of AAA on cross examination:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Atty.
