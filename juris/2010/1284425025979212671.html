				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For failure to render decision in at least three cases within the reglementary period, as extended, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommends that Judge Salvador M.

By the same Resolution, the Court granted respondent's request for extension of 90 days within which to decide Civil Cases Nos. 30,410-04, 7286-03 and 8278-05, the <u>first, third</u> and <u>fourth</u> cases subject of his October 26, 2006 letter-request, <u>reckoned from their respective due dates</u>, per respondent's letter-requests of December 22, 2006 and January 2, 2007.&nbsp; Respondent was, however, reminded to indicate in his "future requests . . . the number of times such requests have been made."<br><br>By Resolution of September 26, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court noted and granted respondent's letter-requests dated April 23, 2007, June 8, 2007 and July 4, 2007, again with a reminder to indicate "in his future request ... the number of times such request has been made." Respondent was further directed to furnish the Court, through the OCA, a copy of each of his decisions in Civil Case Nos. 30,410-04, 7286-03, and 8278-05, the first, third and fourth of the four cases subject of his letter-request of October 26, 2006, within ten days from rendition of the decision.<br><br>By MEMORANDUM of January 27, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the OCA informed the Court that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">despite the lapse of more than two years</span>, respondent had not yet furnished the Court copies of his decisions in the three cases subject of his October 26, 2006 letter-request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The OCA thus recommended that respondent be fined in the amount of P15,000 for failure to decide these three cases, and that he be directed to decide them within 15 days from notice, <i>cum</i> warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br>By failing to submit a copy of each of the decisions on the three cases which respondent was expected to decide within the period, as extended, the presumption is that he failed to decide them.&nbsp; In any event, he failed to heed this Court's Resolutions bearing on them.<br><br>To ensure the strict observance of the constitutional mandate for all lower courts to decide or resolve cases or matters within the reglementary period, the Court issued Administrative Circular No. 13-87 which reads:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>3. Judges shall <u>observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution</u> for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts. Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts while <u>all other lower courts are given a period of three months to do so</u>. x x x (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>And the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</i> which took effect on June 1, 2004 expressly requires judges to perform all judicial duties, "including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with reasonable promptness</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> also echoes the mandate to decide or resolve cases or matters within the reglementary period by requiring judges to dispose of the court's business promptly and decide or resolve cases or matters within the required periods.<br><br>Heavy workload per se is not an excuse in not observing the reglementary period of deciding cases.&nbsp; An appointment to the Judiciary is an honor burdened with a heavy responsibility. When respondent accepted the appointment, he also accepted the heavy workload that comes with it.<br><br>In<i> Buenaflor v. Judge Ibaretta, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court found respondent liable for inefficiency and failure to decide the therein complainant's case on time and imposed on him a <u>fine of P3,000</u>, the same having occurred before the amendment of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC which took effect on October 1, 2001.<br><br>Under Sections 9 and 11 (B) of the Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended, undue delay in rendering decision is classified as a less serious charge penalized by (1) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one month nor more than three months; or (2) a fine of more than P10,000 but not exceeding P20,000.<br><br>Under the facts of the case, the recommended penalty should be increased to P20,000.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE</b>, Judge Salvador M.
