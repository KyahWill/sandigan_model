Worse, defendants had also begun to till portions of the subject properties that were previously untenanted and already planted with mango trees.&nbsp; Based on these facts, respondents prayed for the DARAB to (1) order defendants to comply with the Compromise Agreement by transferring and relocating their homes to the lots provided by respondents; (2) order defendants to pay lease rentals on the portions of the ricelands they were tilling from 1992 to present; (3) eject defendants from the subject properties for their deliberate failure to pay lease rentals in violation of their obligations under Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as the Code of Agrarian Reforms; and (4) order defendants to pay respondents P500,000.00 moral damages, P500,000.00 exemplary damages, and P500,000.00 actual damages, plus attorney's fees.<br><br>Among the special and affirmative defenses raised by defendants in their Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> are that respondents had no cause of action against defendants; the respondents failed to prove their title to the subject properties and registration of the same in their names; the subject properties were mainly planted with rice and only a negligible number of mango trees, which, at 15 to 18 years old, were already fruit-bearing; respondents' sign board confirmed the illegal conversion of the subject properties given the absence of the required application for conversion; the existence of the alleged Compromise Agreement was not established by respondents, and assuming that such Compromise Agreement did exist, it was illegal <i>per se</i> and void <i>ab initio</i>; respondents falsely promised to respect defendants' security of tenure, and respondents' true intention was to have defendants ejected through the instant case; it was the fundamental right of defendants, as tenant-farmers, to be freed from the bondage of the soil, and according to the Tenants Emancipation Decree, the Code of Agrarian Reforms, and the CARL, the subject properties are viable for coverage of the agrarian reform program; respondents had no authority to determine by themselves whether the subject properties were covered by the agrarian reform program; the opinion of the MARO of Malasiqui, Pangasinan, that the subject properties were not within the coverage of the agrarian reform laws, was still subject to review by higher DAR officials; defendants, who were tenant-farmers of respondent Ernesto S. Bravo's properties, had been religiously paying their lease rentals; in the event that the other respondents would be able to prove their ownership to the rest of the subject properties, defendants were willing and able to pay their lease rentals upon execution of a contract of lease between said respondents and defendants; defendants' non-payment of lease rentals to respondents (other than respondent Ernesto S. Bravo) was reasonable considering that defendants remitted said lease rentals to the true owners of the subject properties, the Llamas and Posadas; and computation of the lease rentals should be based on the actual harvest, and any sharing should be subject to the mandate of the Code of Agrarian Reforms, as amended.<br><br>Thus, defendants prayed that the PARAD dismiss respondents' Complaint for lack of cause of action/merit; and order respondents to pay jointly and solidarily to defendants P1,000,000.00 as moral damages, P1,000.00 as nominal damages, P1,000,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P500,000.00 for actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On February 23, 1996, PARAD Placido, "[a]fter going deeply into the roots of the controversy, making a searching examination of the facts, conducting an ocular inspection and investigation in the premises, carefully considering all the pleadings, weighing all [the] respective exhibits and evidences of the parties,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> rendered his Decision in DARAB Case Nos. 01-689 to 710-WP-'95, with the following decree:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>1.

Dismissing all claims and counterclaims for not being supported by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Defendants' appeal to the DARAB, docketed as DARAB Case Nos. 5195 to 5216, was unsuccessful.&nbsp; In its Decision dated May 6, 1998, the DARAB affirmed <i>in toto</i> PARAD Placido's Decision of February 23, 1996.<br><br>On the issue of whether the subject properties are within the coverage of the OLT program under the Tenants Emancipation Decree and CARL, the DARAB held:<br><br><blockquote>Anent the first issue, it is beyond any iota of doubt that the subject landholdings are outside the coverage of Presidential Decree No. 27 and Republic Act No. 6657.&nbsp; Presidential Decree No. 27 is categorical and very clear in its provision on the retention limit allowed the landowner - the landowner can retain an area of up to seven (7) hectares.&nbsp; Republic Act No. 6657 is likewise very clear that the landowner's retention limit is up to five (5) hectares.&nbsp; The Board agrees with the MARO of the locality that the subject landholdings cannot be placed within the coverage of either of the laws relied upon by the defendants-appellants.&nbsp; The records show that as early as March 10, 1971, the heirs of the late Josefa Quintans (who died on July 12, 1958) subdivided the original 24.5962-hectare landholding into parcels, none of which exceeded seven (7) hectares (Exhibit "B" Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Renunciation and Quitclaim dated March 10, 1971).&nbsp; When Presidential Decree No. 27 became a law on October 21, 1972, the subdivided parcels fell outside the coverage of the Operation Land Transfer program pursuant to said Decree, being each less than seven (7) hectares.&nbsp; These landholdings were further subdivided and decreased in size until not one parcel became more than five hectares.&nbsp; Despite changes in ownership, none of the landholdings were ever consolidated under one proprietorship in areas of more than seven hectares during the implementation of the Operation Land Transfer program under Presidential Decree No. 27 nor areas of more than five (5) hectares during the implementation of Republic Act No. 6657.&nbsp; Presently, each of the plaintiffs-appellees does not own more than five (5) hectares of the subject landholdings.&nbsp; This fact is not disputed by the defendants-appellants. Consequently, neither Presidential Decree No. 27 nor Republic Act No. 6657 can be relied upon for the expropriation of these parcels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>The DARAB also sustained the validity and legality of the Compromise Agreement in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>As regards the issue of the validity and legality of the compromise agreement, the same does not deserve a prolonged discussion.&nbsp; It is beyond question that the defendants-appellants are bound by the said compromise agreement.&nbsp; The document was entered into by and between the parties without any vice of consent and was duly notarized.&nbsp; The compromise agreement is clearly a waiver of their rights over the subject landholding for it contains admissions and declarations against their interest.&nbsp; If the defendants-appellants contend that it was not so, thus, reneging on their own sworn admissions of the existence of the fact, then they must have perjured themselves when they voluntarily and knowingly stated under oath that they are relinquishing their right over the subject landholding.&nbsp; The Board will not allow such perfidy to prevail because a party to a litigation must always come to court with clean hands and in good faith. Defendants-appellants are bound by their own voluntary admissions and declarations against their own interest as appearing in the said compromise agreement and the Board will not allow them to turn their backs to it (Dequito v.

Jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of an action is conferred by the Constitution and the law, and not by the consent or waiver of the parties where the court otherwise would have no jurisdiction over the nature or subject matter of the action. Nor can it be acquired through, or waived by, any act or omission of the parties. Moreover, estoppel does not apply to confer jurisdiction to a tribunal that has none over the cause of action. The failure of the parties to challenge the jurisdiction of the DARAB does not prevent the court from addressing the issue, especially where the DARAB's lack of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the complaint or petition.<br><br>Indeed, the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal is not affected by the defenses or theories set up by the defendant or respondent in his answer or motion to dismiss. Jurisdiction should be determined by considering not only the status or the relationship of the parties but also the nature of the issues or questions that is the subject of the controversy. If the issues between the parties are intertwined with the resolution of an issue within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DARAB, such dispute must be addressed and resolved by the DARAB.&nbsp; The proceedings before a court or tribunal without jurisdiction, including its decision, are null and void, hence, susceptible to direct and collateral attacks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Guided accordingly by the foregoing jurisprudence, the Court turns to respondents' Complaint before the DARAB, wherein they alleged:<br><br><blockquote>2.
