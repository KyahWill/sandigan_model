Laurel Avenue, Bajada Drive, Davao City last December 14, 1996.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>2.1.1. All of the five (5) checks were denominated to the "PAYEE'S ACCOUNT" only, the payee being Mabuhay Electronics Corporation although the proceeds of the checks were actually intended for Samsung Mabuhay Corporation. After the Joint Venture Agreement, Samsung dealers were duly requested by Samsung Mabuhay Corporation to make all checks payable to the order of Samsung Mabuhay Corporation instead of Mabuhay Electronics Corporation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, some dealers, like Conpinco Trading, still made out checks payable to Mabuhay Electronics Corporation.<br><br>2.1.2. Plaintiff Samsung Mabuhay Corporation continued to received checks from its local dealers payable to the order of Mabuhay Electronics Corporation.&nbsp; Plaintiff [Samsung Mabuhay Corporation] deposited the said checks to its bank account with Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC), Adriatico Branch under Account No. 0113-26238-8.&nbsp; FEBTC accepted for deposit into Samsung Mabuhay Corporation's account therein all checks payable to Mabuhay Electronics Corporation.<br><br>2.2. Two (2) of the five (5) checks picked-up by Reynaldo Senson were remitted to Samsung Mabuhay Corporation.&nbsp; These checks [1869866 and 1869867] in the total amount of P1,399,093.20 were cleared by the drawee bank, UCPB, and the amount credited to the account of Samsung Mabuhay Corporation with FEBTC.<br><br>2.3. However, the three (3) remaining UCPB checks, <i>i.e., </i>check nos. 1869863, 1869864, and 1869865 amounting to P1,563,750.00, were not remitted by Reynaldo Senson to Samsung Mabuhay Corporation.&nbsp; Instead, Reynaldo Senson, using an <i>alias</i> name, Edgardo Bacea, opened an account with defendant Real Bank, Malolos, Bulacan branch under the account name of one Mabuhay Electronics Company, a business entity in no way related to plaintiff Mabuhay Electronics Corporation. Mabuhay Electronics Company is a single proprietorship owned and managed by Reynaldo Senson, <i>alias</i> Edgardo Bacea.<br><br>2.4.&nbsp; Reynaldo Senson, <i>alias</i> Edgardo Bacea, opened an account with defendant [Real Bank] by presenting an identification card bearing Mabuhay Electronics Company, the <i>alias</i> name Edgardo Bacea identifying him as the General Manager of Mabuhay Electronics Company, and the photograph of Reynaldo Senson, x x x.&nbsp; Reynaldo Senson and Edgardo Bacea are one and the same person as shown in the identification card issued by Samsung Mabuhay Corporation to Reynaldo Senson x x x.<br><br>2.5. Reynaldo Senson, <i>alias</i> Edgardo Bacea, through the negligence of defendant [Real Bank], indorsed the checks and then deposited all the three (3) checks in the account of Mabuhay Electronics Company under Savings Account No. 1102-01944-2.&nbsp; The dorsal portion of the said checks (check nos. 1869863, 1869864, and 1869865) x x x and made integral parts hereof.<br><br>2.6. Defendant [Real Bank] then sent the three (3) checks for clearing and for payment through Far East Bank and Trust Company, Malolos, Bulacan Branch after stamping at the back of the checks the usual endorsements: "ALL PRIOR ENDORSEMENT and/or LACK OF ENDORSEMENT GUARANTEED." Conpinco Trading's account with the drawee bank, UCPB, was eventually debited for the value of the three (3) checks and Mabuhay Electronics Company's account with defendant [Real Bank] was credited for the same amount although it was not the payee nor the person authorized by the payee.<br><br>2.7. Subsequently, Reynaldo Senson, <i>alias</i> Edgardo Bacea again through the negligence of defendant bank, was able to withdraw the amount of P1,563,750.00.&nbsp; The value of the three (3) checks were negligently credited by defendant [Real Bank] to the account of Mabuhay Electronics Company, a single proprietorship, although the check was payable only to Mabuhay Electronics Corporation, a juridical entity, and to no one else.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2.9. Despite plaintiffs' [Samsung Mabuhay Corporation's] demands, defendant [Real Bank] ignored and refused to reimburse them with the value of the three (3) checks.&nbsp; Thus, plaintiffs were constrained to hire the legal services of the law firm of V.E. Del Rosario and Partners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner Real Bank, Inc. filed its Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on 23 February 1998, to which a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was filed by respondent Samsung on 5 March 1998.<br><br>On 12 March 1998, respondent Samsung filed an <i>Ex-Parte </i>Motion To Set Case for Pre-Trial, asking that the case be set for pre-trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; In a notice dated 24 March 1998, Judge Amelia Tria-Infante (Judge Infante) of RTC, Br. 9 of Manila, set the case for pre-trial on 25 June 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Meantime, petitioner Real Bank, Inc. filed on 26 May 1998 a Motion to Admit Third Party Complaint against Reynaldo A.

The Court of Appeals rendered a decision in favor of respondent Samsung dated 18 August 2006, the <i>fallo </i>of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Orders dated 5 June 2002 and 2 August 2002 are hereby <b>REVERSED </b>and<b> SET ASIDE.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals explained its decision in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>[R]espondent judge did not even peruse or verify the records of the case.&nbsp; Has she done so, she would have discovered that the former counsel of petitioner to whom she sent the Notice of the order had already withdrawn and that a new counsel for petitioner had already entered their appearance.&nbsp; Likewise, she should have discovered that at that time the Order dated March 7, 2001 was issued by RTC Br. 9, petitioner was no longer holding office at its given address. This fact is clearly indicated in the Order of March 7, 2001 itself.&nbsp; Clearly, therefore, respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction in issuing the Order dated June 5, 2002. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner Real Bank, Inc.'s Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution dated 13 December 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner Real Bank, Inc. submits the following issues for our resolution.<br><br><blockquote><b>I.

Judge Paderanga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this Court accentuated that mediation is part of pre-trial and failure of the plaintiff to appear thereat merits sanction on the part of the absent party.&nbsp; This court held:<br><br><blockquote>A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA dated 16 October 2001, otherwise known as the Second Revised Guidelines for the Implementation of Mediation Proceedings and Section 5, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court grant judges the discretion to dismiss an action for failure of the plaintiff to appear at mediation proceedings.<br><br>A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA considers mediation a part of pre-trial and provides sanctions for the absent party:<br><br><blockquote>12. Sanctions.<br><br>Since mediation is part of Pre-Trial, the trial court shall impose the appropriate sanction including but not limited to censure, reprimand, contempt and such sanctions as are provided under the Rules of Court for failure to appear for pre-trial, in case any or both of the parties absent himself/themselves, or for abusive conduct during mediation proceedings.</blockquote><br>Under Rule 18, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, failure of the plaintiff to appear at pre-trial shall be cause for dismissal of the action:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. Effect of failure to appear. - The failure of the plaintiff to appear when so required pursuant to the next preceding section shall be cause for dismissal of the action.&nbsp; The dismissal shall be with prejudice, unless otherwise ordered by the court.&nbsp; A similar failure on the part of the defendant shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to present his evidence ex parte and the court to render judgment on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>However, the ruling in <i>Senarlo </i>will not resolve the present case where the basic issue is whether or not respondent's Samsung non-appearance at the mediation proceedings is justifiable from the records.<br><br>We sustain the ruling of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Rule 138, section 26 of the Rules of Court outlines the procedure in case of withdrawal of counsel.&nbsp; It states:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 138<br>Attorneys and Admission to Bar<br></center><br>Sec. 26.&nbsp; <i>Change of attorneys. - </i>An attorney may retire at any time from any action or special proceeding, by the written consent of his client filed in court.&nbsp; He may also retire at any time from an action or special proceeding, without the consent of his client, should the court, on notice to the client and attorney, and on hearing, determine that he ought to be allowed to retire.&nbsp; In case of substitution, the name of the attorney newly employed shall be entered on the docket of the court in place of the former one, and written notice of the change shall be given to the adverse party.</blockquote><br>Under the first sentence of Section 26, the withdrawal of counsel with the conformity of the client is completed once the same is filed in court.&nbsp; No further action thereon by the court is needed other than the mechanical act of the Clerk of Court of entering the name of the new counsel in the docket and of giving written notice thereof to the adverse party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is uncontroverted that the withdrawal of respondent Samsung's original counsel, V.E. Del Rosario and Partners on 19 October 2000, was with the client's consent.&nbsp; Thus, no approval thereof by the trial court was required because a court's approval is indispensable only if the withdrawal is without the client's consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>It being daylight clear that the withdrawal of respondent Samsung's original counsel was sufficient as the same carried the stamp of approval of the client, the notice of mediation sent to respondent Samsung's original counsel was ineffectual as the same was sent at the time when such counsel had already validly withdrawn its representation.&nbsp; Corollarily, the absence of respondent Samsung during the scheduled mediation conference was excusable and justified.&nbsp; Therefore, the trial court erroneously dismissed Civil Case No. 97-86265.<br><br>We cannot sustain petitioner Real Bank, Inc.'s argument that respondent Samsung was negligent in the conduct of its case.<br><br>The calendar of hearings document the fact that respondent Samsung has been willing and able to prosecute its case. Except for the lone instance, reasonable as already shown, of absence during the scheduled mediation conference on 3 April 2001, respondent Samsung had, till then, promptly and religiously attended the hearings set by the RTC.&nbsp; In fact, respondent Samsung exhibited diligence and dispatch in prosecuting its case against petitioner Real Bank, Inc. by immediately moving to set the case for pre-trial after it had filed its reply and momently filing a motion for reconsideration of the RTC Order dismissing Civil Case No. 97-86265.<br><br>The following observation of the Court of Appeals is worth noting:<br><br><blockquote>As borne by the records, it is [petitioner] [Real Bank, Inc.] which asked for a resetting of the pre-trial twice.&nbsp; On the other hand, the [respondent Samsung] was the one egging and repeatedly requesting Presiding Judge Infante of Br. 9 to set the case for pre-trial.&nbsp; It has reached the point that [respondent Samsung] got exasperated for the unreasonable delay of the judge of RTC, Br. 9 in resolving the incidents pending before her that it was constrained to file a motion for inhibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>Herein respondent Samsung instituted Civil Case No. 97-86265 before the RTC, to recover the amount it claims to have lost due to the negligence of petitioner Real Bank, Inc., clearly a property right.&nbsp; The substantive right of respondent Samsung to recover a due and demandable obligation cannot be diminished by an unwarranted strictness in the application of a rule of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In <i>Calalang v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this Court underscored that unless a party's conduct is so negligent, irresponsible, contumacious or dilatory as to provide substantial grounds for dismissal for non-appearance, the court should consider lesser sanctions which would still amount into achieving the desired end.&nbsp; <i> </i><br><br>In <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we ruled that in the absence of a pattern or scheme to delay the disposition of the case or a wanton failure to observe the mandatory requirement of the rules, courts should decide to dispense rather than wield their authority to dismiss.<br><br>While not at the fore of this case, it may be stated that the state of the court docket cannot justify injudicious case dismissals.&nbsp; Inconsiderate dismissals, even without prejudice, do not constitute a <i>panacea</i> or a solution to the congestion of court dockets; while they lend a deceptive aura of efficiency to records of individual judges, they merely postpone the ultimate reckoning between the parties. In the absence of clear lack of merit or intention to delay, justice is better served by a brief continuance, trial on the merits, and final disposition of cases before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the ends of justice and fairness would be best served if the parties in Civil Case No. 97-86265 are given the full opportunity to thresh out the real issues in a full blown trial. Besides, petitioner Real Bank, Inc. would not be prejudiced should the RTC proceed with Civil Case No. 97-86265 as it is not stripped of any affirmative defenses nor deprived of due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the instant petition is <b>DENIED </b>for lack of merit and the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
