DOMINGO, SUPRA</i>, DID STRIP THE LOWER COURT OF ITS JURISDICTION IN <i>BID V. DELA ROSA</i>, <i>SUPRA</i>, TO ENJOIN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS, THE RULING CAN ONLY HAVE PROSPECTIVE EFFECT.</blockquote><br>Basically, petitioners argue that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, relied upon by the CA in its decision, does not apply in the present case because it falls under an exception.&nbsp; Citing <i>Board of Commissioners (CID) v. Dela Rosa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; petitioners assert that immediate judicial intervention in deportation proceedings is allowed where the claim of citizenship is so substantial that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the claim is correct.&nbsp; In connection therewith, petitioners assail the applicability of <i>Dwikarna v. Domingo </i>in the present case, which the CA relied upon in ruling against the same petitioners.<br><br>After a careful study of the arguments presented by the parties, this Court finds the petition meritorious.<br><br>Petitioners rely on <i>Board of Commissioners (CID) v.</i> <i>Dela Rosa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> wherein this Court ruled that when the claim of citizenship is so substantial as to reasonably believe it to be true, a respondent in a deportation proceeding can seek judicial relief to enjoin respondent BOC from proceeding with the deportation case.&nbsp; In particular, petitioners cited the&nbsp; following portions in this Court's decision:<br><br><blockquote>True, it is beyond cavil that the Bureau of Immigration has the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to try and hear cases against an alleged alien, and in the process, determine also their citizenship (<i>Lao vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 180 SCRA 756 [1089]. And a mere claim of citizenship cannot operate to divest the Board of Commissioners of its jurisdiction in deportation proceedings (<i>Miranda vs. Deportation Board</i>, 94 Phil. 531 [1951]).<br><br>However, the <b>rule enunciated in the above-cases admits of an exception, at least insofar as deportation&nbsp; proceedings are concerned.</b>&nbsp; Thus, what if the claim to citizenship of the alleged deportee is satisfactory?&nbsp; Should the deportation proceedings be allowed to continue or should the question of citizenship be ventilated in a judicial proceeding?&nbsp; In <i>Chua Hiong vs. Deportation Board</i> (96 Phil. 665 [1955]), this Court answered the question in the affirmative, and We quote:<br><br><blockquote><b>When the evidence submitted by a respondent is conclusive of his citizenship, the right to immediate review should also be recognized and the courts should promptly enjoin the deportation proceedings.&nbsp; A citizen is entitled to live in peace, without molestation from any official or authority, and if he is disturbed by a deportation proceeding, he has the unquestionable right to resort to the courts for his protection, either by a writ of habeas corpus or of prohibition, on the legal ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction.</b>&nbsp; If he is a citizen and evidence thereof is satisfactory, there is no sense nor justice in allowing the deportation proceedings to continue, granting him the remedy only after the Board has finished its investigation of his undesirability.<br><br><b>&nbsp; x x x And if the right (to peace) is precious and valuable at all, it must also be protected on time, to prevent undue harassment at the hands of ill-meaning or misinformed administrative officials.&nbsp; Of what use is this much boasted right to peace and liberty if it can be availed of only after the Deportation Board has unjustly trampled upon it, besmirching the citizen's name before the bar of public opinion?</b><br><br><b>The doctrine of primary jurisdiction of petitioners Board of Commissioners over deportation proceedings is, therefore, not without exception <i>(Calayday vs. Vivo</i>, 33 SCRA 413 [1970]; <i>Vivo vs. Montesa</i>, 24 SCRA 155 [1967]).</b> Judicial intervention, however, should be granted in cases where the claim of citizenship is so substantial that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the claim is correct.&nbsp; <b>In other words, the remedy should be allowed only on sound discretion of a competent court in a proper proceeding (<i>Chua Hiong v. Deportation Board</i>, supra; <i>Co vs. Deportation Board</i>, 78 SCRA 107 [1977]). It appearing from the records that respondent's claim of citizenship is substantial, as We shall show later, judicial intervention should be allowed.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>&nbsp;The present case, as correctly pointed out by petitioners and wrongfully found by the CA, falls within the above-cited exception considering that proof of their Philippine citizenship had been adduced, such as, the identification numbers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> issued by the Bureau of Immigration confirming their Philippine citizenship, they have duly exercised and enjoyed all the rights and privileges exclusively accorded to Filipino citizens, <i>i.e</i>., their Philippine passports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs.<br><br>In <i>BOC v. Dela Rosa</i>,&nbsp; it is required that before judicial intervention is sought, the claim of citizenship of a respondent in a deportation proceeding must be so substantial that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such claim is correct.&nbsp; In the said case, the proof adduced by the respondent therein was so substantial and conclusive as to his citizenship that it warranted a judicial intervention.&nbsp; In the present case, there is a substantial or conclusive evidence that petitioners are Filipino citizens. Without necessarily judging the case on its merits, as to whether petitioners had lost their Filipino citizenship by having a Canadian passport,&nbsp; the fact still remains, through the evidence adduced and undisputed by the respondents, that they are naturalized Filipinos, unless proven otherwise.<br><br>However, this Court cannot pass upon the issue of petitioners' citizenship as this was not raised as an issue.&nbsp; The issue in this petition is on the matter of jurisdiction, and as discussed above, the trial court has jurisdiction to pass upon the issue whether petitioners have abandoned their Filipino citizenship or have acquired dual citizenship within the confines of the law.<br><br>In this regard, it&nbsp; must be remembered though that this Court's ruling in <i>Dwikarna v. Domingo</i> did not abandon the doctrine laid down in <i>BOC v. Dela Rosa</i>.&nbsp; The exception remains.&nbsp; <i>Dwikarna</i> merely reiterated the doctrine of primary jurisdiction when this Court ruled that <b>if the petitioner is dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration, he can move for its reconsideration and if his motion is denied, then he can elevate his case by way of a petition for review before the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</b>&nbsp; However, utmost caution must be exercised in availing of the exception laid down in <i>BOC v. Dela Rosa </i>in order to avoid trampling on the time-honored doctrine of primary jurisdiction. The court cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal prior to resolving the same, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring special knowledge, experience and services in determining technical and intricate matters of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; In cases where the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is clearly applicable, the court cannot arrogate unto itself the authority to resolve a controversy, the jurisdiction over which is initially lodged with an administrative body of special competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Above all else, this Court still upholds the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. As enunciated in<i> Republic v. Lacap</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The general rule is that before a party may seek the intervention of the court, he should first avail of all the means afforded him by administrative processes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The issues which administrative agencies are authorized to decide should not be summarily taken from them and submitted to a court without first giving such administrative agency the opportunity to dispose of the same after due deliberation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Corollary to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; that is, courts cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal prior to the resolution of that question by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and the corollary doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which are based on sound public policy and practical considerations, are not inflexible rules. There are many accepted exceptions, such as: (a) where there is estoppel on the part of the party invoking the doctrine; (b) where the challenged administrative act is patently illegal, amounting to lack of jurisdiction; (c) where there is unreasonable delay or official inaction that will irretrievably prejudice the complainant; (d) where the amount involved is relatively small so as to make the rule impractical and oppressive; (e) where the question involved is purely legal and will ultimately have to be decided by the courts of justice;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (f) where judicial intervention is urgent; (g) when its application may cause great and irreparable damage; (h) where the controverted acts violate due process; (i) when the issue of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies has been rendered moot;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (j) when there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy; (k) when strong public interest is involved; and, (l) in <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
