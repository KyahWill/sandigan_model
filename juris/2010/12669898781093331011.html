CR HC No. 00520 affirming with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Carigara, Leyte, Branch 13, in Criminal Case No. 4071, convicting appellant Hilario Escoton of the crime of multiple rape against AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> contained the following accusatory allegations:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 12th day of May, 2001, in x x x, Province of Leyte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with deliberate intent and with lewd designs, taking advantage of the minority, as well as relationship of the accused with the victim, and by use of force and intimidation being armed with a sickle (garab) did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge for five (5) times in the same evening of May 12, 2001, with one "AAA", a 10-year-old, a niece of the accused, against her will to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>Contrary to law with the qualifying circumstance that the victim is under 18 years and the offender is a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree of the victim.<br></blockquote><br>The appellant pleaded not guilty to the crime charged during his arraignment. After the termination of the pre-trial conference, trial ensued.<br><br><b><i>The Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The evidence presented by the prosecution established that "AAA" was born on October 29, 1990, as shown by her Certificate of Live Birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Baptismal Certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  The appellant is the uncle of "AAA", being the brother of her mother.  On May 12, 2001, at around 7 o'clock in the evening, "AAA" and her brother were asleep in the house of their maternal grandmother with whom they were residing.  The appellant woke up "AAA" and told her to follow him to his house which was about 500 meters away.  "AAA's" brother also woke up and accompanied her.  Their grandmother did not give them permission to leave, but they still proceeded towards their destination.<br><br>Upon arrival, the appellant undressed himself and removed the lower garments of "AAA".  He made her lie down on the bamboo floor then inserted his penis into her vagina despite her pleas to discontinue his hideous act.  "AAA" felt pain as the appellant had sex with her.  The appellant raped "AAA" for five times during the night while her brother lay silently beside her.<br><br>When daylight came, the appellant ordered "AAA" and her brother to fetch drinking water. However, instead of heeding appellant's order, they went home to their grandmother to whom "AAA" tearfully narrated her ordeal.  Upon advice of a relative, they reported the incident to the police and "AAA" submitted herself to a physical examination in a hospital.  Although the doctors who performed the medical examination on "AAA" the day after she was raped could no longer be located during the trial, the Records Officer affirmed the authenticity of the document containing the results of said examination and the signatures of doctors appearing thereon. The record of the medical examination on "AAA" indicated that her genitalia was normal with incomplete healed lacerations of the hymen at 3, 8, and 9 o'clock positions.  The vaginal smear was negative for spermatozoa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Version of the Defense </i></b><br><br>The appellant presented a totally different version of the incident. He testified that on May 12, 2001, at around 7 o'clock in the evening, he was on his way home after consuming <i>tuba</i>.  He passed by the house of his mother and noticed her in the balcony having a conversation with his aunt Clarita and her husband.  He was then requested to fetch "AAA", who was watching television in the house of another relative.  The appellant obeyed and after finding "AAA" told her to go home.  However, "AAA" got angry, cursed him and insisted on watching the television.  Irked by "AAA's" behavior, appellant pushed her, which made her fall from the stairs until she landed on the ground.  It was only after this incident that "AAA" went home.<br><br>When the appellant returned to his mother's house, his mother and his aunt Clarita were enraged and hurled invectives at him.  He cursed them in return.  His mother warned that he would be sent to prison for repeatedly beating up "AAA".  He replied that the meager amount paid to him by his aunt Clarita and her husband whenever they hired him to work in their farm was demeaning to his person. Thereafter, he proceeded to the house of his uncle and slept on the balcony where he awoke at 6 o'clock the next morning.<br><br>The appellant asserted that his aunt Clarita initiated this case after he challenged her and her husband to a fight.  He also claimed that "AAA" concocted false accusation against him because he used to beat her with a whip and push her head to the ground as punishment for her stubbornness.<br><br><b><i>The Decision of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On June 28, 2004, the trial court rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, pursuant to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended, and further amended by R.A. 8353 (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997) and the amendatory provision of R.A.

However, medical examination or medical report is not indispensable to prove the commission of rape, for it is merely corroborative evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  An accused can still be convicted of rape on the sole basis of the testimony of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Here, even if we disregard the medico-legal report, the result would still be the same - the prosecution, through the testimony of "AAA", has successfully proved the case of rape against the appellant.<br><br>Appellant vehemently denies raping "AAA" and claims that he was already drunk and had fallen asleep in the house of his uncle during the alleged commission of the crime.  However, he failed to present any witness to corroborate his testimony.  Denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses and constitute self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the positive declaration of a credible witness. Between the positive assertions of the victim and the negative averments of the appellant, the former indisputably deserve more credence and are entitled to greater evidentiary weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Much less convincing is the proposition of the appellant that "AAA" filed the complaint against him because she and her other relatives were harboring ill feelings and evil motives against him. Ill motives become inconsequential where there are affirmative or categorical declarations establishing the accountability of the appellant for the felony, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  Moreover, we have observed that persons convicted of rape sometimes attribute the charges against them to family feuds, resentment or revenge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  However, as borne out by numerous cases, family resentment, revenge or feuds have never swayed us from giving full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially a minor who remained steadfast and unyielding throughout the trial that she was sexually violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Appellant also argues that the testimony of "AAA" is unworthy of credence since it is replete with inconsistencies.  He contends that if "AAA's" grandmother was with her at the time he fetched her, then "AAA" could have easily refused since her grandmother did not allow her to go with him.  He further contends that if he really intended to rape "AAA", he would not have allowed her younger brother to tag along as an eyewitness.<br><br>The factual question raised by the appellant fails to impress.  It is an inconsequential matter that does not bear upon the elements of the crime of rape. The decisive factor in the prosecution for rape is whether the commission of the crime has been sufficiently proven.  For a discrepancy or inconsistency in the testimony of a witness to serve as a basis for acquittal, it must refer to the significant facts indispensable to the guilt or innocence of the appellant for the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  As the inconsistencies alleged by the appellant had nothing to do with the elements of the crime of rape, they cannot be used as ground for his acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Further, victims do not cherish keeping in their memory an accurate account of the manner in which they were sexually violated. Thus, an errorless recollection of a harrowing experience cannot be expected of a witness, especially when she is recounting details from an experience as humiliating and painful as rape. Furthermore, rape victims, especially child victims, should not be expected to act the way mature individuals would when placed in such a situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In this case, minor inconsistencies are expected because (1) "AAA" was a child witness, (2) she was made to testify on a painful and humiliating incident, (3) she was sexually assaulted several times, and (4) she was made to recount details and events that happened two years before she testified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Penalty</i></b><br><br>Thus, given the foregoing circumstances, we find no cogent reason to reverse the findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  The prosecution sufficiently proved the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant. The trial court correctly meted the penalty of death since the rape committed against a child under 12 years of age by an offender who is a relative by consanguinity  within the third civil degree merits no less than the imposition of capital punishment under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  It is clear from the birth certificate of "AAA" that she was only ten years old when she was ravished by the appellant, her uncle, being the brother of her mother.<br><br>However, with the passage of Republic Act No. 9346 entitled "An Act Prohibiting The Imposition Of The Death Penalty In The Philippines," the penalty, as correctly imposed by the Court of Appeals, should be <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Pursuant to the same law, the accused-appellant shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>While the appellant was meted the proper penalty for committing one count of rape, we must not overlook the fact that the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty of five counts of rape. "AAA" related in detail to the trial court in a simple and straightforward manner how she was repeatedly ravished by the appellant, thereby leaving no doubt about its credibility and truthfulness.  She testified that the appellant inserted his penis inside her vagina and after consummating this act, she was raped again for four times under the same circumstances throughout the night.  Thus, appellant must be held guilty of five counts of rape and suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility of parole<i> </i>for each count.<br><br><b><i>The Damages</i></b><br><br>The five counts of rape committed by the appellant also require a modification of the award of damages by the trial court, as sustained by the Court of Appeals. For each of the five counts of rape, "AAA" is entitled to an award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, another P75,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
