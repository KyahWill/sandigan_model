SP No. 89372 entitled <i>"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company v. National Labor Relations Commission and Eusebio M. Honrado."</i><br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>The antecedent facts based on the September 25, 2008 Decision of the CA are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Private respondent Eusebio Honrado (hereafter "Honrado") was an employee of petitioner Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT for brevity) assigned at the PLDT North Parañaque Exchange. He was hired on August 25, 1981 and held the position of a senior lineman with a monthly salary of P21,600.00 prior to the termination of his employment on February 15, 2001.<br><br>On November 29, 1999, spouses Pete A. Mueda and Rodrigo H. Mueda went to PLDT's Quality Control Division (QCD for brevity) to verify their application for telephone because according to them, a person named Rony Hipolito (hereafter "Hipolito") who introduced himself as a PLDT employee went to their house on November 26, 1999 in the afternoon. Spouses Mueda narrated that Hipolito told them that he is the area inspector assigned therein and that <i>"okay na ang linya ng PLDT dito sa area ng Kalayaan, pwede ng magbayad ng kalahati, pero hindi pa pwedeng magpakabit ngayon dahil Sabado at ipapriority and teleponong ikakabit sa amin dahil nagda-down kami"</i>. They likewise narrated that he mentioned that <i>"ipapakilala niya kaming relatives niya para mauna na kami makabitan"</i> and that they can pay directly to him since he is a PLDT employee and that x x x the balance can be paid to PLDT within six months on installment basis. Spouses Mueda further stated: that because of this, they paid Hipolito P1,500.00 as partial payment for the installation of their new telephone line; that Hipolito even signed a receipt stating that he received P1,500.00 downpayment on the same date, November 26, 1999; and that he also gave a contact number of 822-2828 in case they have any query or follow-up.<br><br>At the QCD, Spouses Mueda found out that the act of Hipolito in soliciting and receiving P1,500.00 as down payment for installation of a new telephone line is against the policy of herein petitioner. So, in order to ascertain the identity of Rony Hipolito, Mrs. Pete Mueda was shown several pictures of outside plant personnel of herein petitioner with surname Hipolito. However, Mrs. Mueda could not pinpoint anyone who introduced himself as Rony Hipolito.<br><br>Hence, on January 18, 2000, Mr. Domosthenes J. Yap, QCD Investigator together with Mrs. Mueda, conducted a stake out operation at the PLDT North Parañaque Exchange to [determine] the identity of Rony Hipolito. When herein private respondent Honrado handed his Trip Authorization Pass (TAP for brevity) to the guard on duty at the gate of the PLDT North Parañaque Exchange, he was positively identified by Mrs. Mueda as the person who solicited and received the money from her and her husband.<br><br>On January 19, 2000, a confrontation [proceeding] between private respondent and Mrs. Mueda was conducted at the QCD. In the said [proceeding], Mrs. Mueda categorically declared, in the presence of private respondent, that the latter solicited and received P1,500.00 from her as down payment for the installation of her new telephone line. On the other hand, private respondent opted not [to] give any statement on the accusation against him. Nevertheless, he was given until January 26, 2000 to give a statement or explain his side which, was further extended until January 31, 2000 per letter dated January 26, 2000 of Mr. Fidel Paulino, acting head-QCD.<br><br>On May 9, 2000, per inter-office memorandum, the head of the QCD transmitted to the manager of private respondent, Mr. Torrenueva, the Investigation Report recommending that an administrative action for gross misconduct be filed against private respondent.<br><br>Then, on June 8, 2002, through an inter-office memorandum, Mr. Torrenueva asked private respondent to explain, in writing[,] within 72 hours from receipt of the memo, why he should not be dismissed for serious misconduct and if he so desire, he may ask for a hearing. Failure to do so shall be taken as waiver of his right to be heard. In reply, private respondent, per inter-office memorandum dated June 15, 2000, vehemently denied all the allegations imputed against him and requested for a formal hearing with the assistance of his counsel and Union official. On the same date, Mr. Torrenueva, per inter-office memorandum, informed private respondent that the formal hearing of his case was set on June 22, 2000.<br><br>Per letter dated June 20, 2000 of Atty. Untalan, Jr., he requested for the resetting of the hearing from June 22 to June 29 as he was just retained by private respondent as counsel.<br><br>On June 29, 2000, the formal hearing took place. In the said hearing, private respondent again denied the accusation against him. Then, his counsel asked the presiding officer to show them the alleged receipt issued by private respondent. But the said PLDT officer, Mr. Yap, refused to show it to them and told them that the hearing is only for the airing of private respondent's explanation and defenses. His counsel also persistently requested Mr. Yap to give them at least a single opportunity to cross-examine the accusers of his client to determine the truth because what was at stake was the means of livelihood of his client but his plea was heard by deaf ears.<br><br>Thereafter, per inter-office memorandum dated February 13, 2001, private respondent was notified that he was found liable as charged, hence, dismissed from service effective February 15, 2001 at the close of business hours. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Labor Arbiter</i></b><br><br>Consequently, respondent Honrado filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, money claims and damages against petitioner PLDT, denominated as NLRC NCR Case No. 30-04-01903-01.&nbsp; After submission of their respective position papers and other pleadings, on October 19, 2001, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the dispositive portion of which is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the instant case for lack of merit.</i><br><br><i>&nbsp; SO ORDERED.</i><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission</i></b><br><br>Respondent appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to the NLRC.&nbsp; On May 7, 2003 the NLRC granted the appeal, the decretal portion of which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is set aside.
