				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, prays for the reversal of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated November 7, 2006 and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 5, 2007 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 76642.&nbsp; The CA had affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 27, 2002 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 137, Makati City in Civil Case No. 97-997 which declared invalid the reversion or application of the Riverside Mills Corporation Provident and Retirement Fund (RMCPRF) to the outstanding obligation of Riverside Mills Corporation (RMC) with Philippine Banking Corporation (Philbank).<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>On November 1, 1973, RMC established a Provident and Retirement Plan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Plan) for its regular employees.&nbsp; Under the Plan, RMC and its employees shall each contribute 2% of the employee's current basic monthly salary, with RMC's contribution to increase by 1% every five (5) years up to a maximum of 5%.&nbsp; The contributions shall form part of the provident fund (the Fund) which shall be held, invested and distributed by the Commercial Bank and Trust Company.&nbsp; Paragraph 13 of the Plan likewise provided that the Plan "may be amended or terminated by the Company at any time on account of business conditions, but no such action shall operate to permit any part of the assets of the Fund to be used for, or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the members of the Plan and their ... beneficiaries.&nbsp; In no event shall any part of the assets of the Fund revert to [RMC] before all liabilities of the Plan have been satisfied."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On October 15, 1979, the Board of Trustees of RMCPRF (the Board) entered into an Investment Management Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Agreement) with Philbank (now, petitioner Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company).&nbsp; Pursuant to the Agreement, petitioner shall act as an agent of the Board and shall hold, manage, invest and reinvest the Fund in Trust Account No. 1797 in its behalf.&nbsp; The Agreement shall be in force for one (1) year and shall be deemed automatically renewed unless sooner terminated either by petitioner bank or by the Board.<br><br>In 1984, RMC ceased business operations.&nbsp; Nonetheless, petitioner continued to render investment services to respondent Board.&nbsp; In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated September 27, 1995, petitioner informed respondent Board that Philbank's Board of Directors had decided to apply the remaining trust assets held by it in the name of RMCPRF against part of the outstanding obligations of RMC.<br><br>Subsequently, respondent RMC Unpaid Employees Association, Inc. (Association), representing the terminated employees of RMC, learned of Trust Account No. 1797.&nbsp; Through counsel, they demanded payment of their share in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated February 4, 1997.&nbsp; When such demand went unheeded, the Association, along with the individual members of RMCPRF, filed a complaint for accounting against the Board and its officers, namely, Ernesto Tanchi, Jr., Carlitos Y. Lim, Amelita G. Simon, Evelina S. Ocampo and Cesar Saligumba, as well as petitioner bank.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 97-997 in the RTC of Makati City, Branch 137.<br><br>On June 2, 1998, during the trial, the Board passed a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in court declaring that the Fund belongs exclusively to the employees of RMC.&nbsp; It authorized petitioner to release the proceeds of Trust Account No. 1797 through the Board, as the court may direct.&nbsp; Consequently, plaintiffs amended their complaint to include the Board as co-plaintiffs.<br><br>On June 27, 2002, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of respondents.&nbsp; The trial court declared invalid the reversion and application of the proceeds of the Fund to the outstanding obligation of RMC to petitioner bank.&nbsp; The <i>fallo </i>of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Declaring INVALID the reversion or application of the Riverside&nbsp; Mills Corporation Provident and Retirement Fund as payment for&nbsp; the outstanding obligation of Riverside Mills Corporation with defendant Philippine Banking Corporation.<br><br>2. Defendant Philippine Banking Corporation (now [Global Bank]) is hereby ordered to:<br><br><ol type="a"><li> Reverse the application of the Riverside Mills Corporation&nbsp; Provident and Retirement Fund as payment for the outstanding obligation of Riverside Mills Corporation with defendant Philippine Banking Corporation;<br><br></li><li>Render a complete accounting of the Riverside Mills&nbsp; Corporation Provident and Retirement Fund; the Fund will then be subject to disposition by plaintiff Board of Trustees in accordance with law and the Provident Retirement Plan;<br><br></li><li>Pay attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total amounts due to plaintiffs Riverside Mills Unpaid Employees Association and the individual beneficiaries of the Riverside Mills Corporation Provident and Retirement Fund; and costs of suit.</li></ol><br>3.&nbsp; The Riverside Mills Corporation Provident and Retirement Fund is&nbsp; ordered to determine the beneficiaries of the FUND entitled to&nbsp; benefits, the amount of benefits per beneficiary, and pay such&nbsp; benefits to the individual beneficiaries.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed the trial court.&nbsp; It held that the Fund is distinct from RMC's account in petitioner bank and may not be used except for the benefit of the members of RMCPRF.&nbsp; Citing Paragraph 13 of the Plan, the appellate court stressed that the assets of the Fund shall not revert to the Company until after the liabilities of the Plan had been satisfied.&nbsp; Further, the Agreement was specific that upon the termination of the Agreement, petitioner shall deliver the Fund to the Board or its successor, and not to RMC as trustor.&nbsp; The CA likewise sustained the award of attorney's fees to respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Before us, petitioner makes the following assignment of errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE REVERSION AND APPLICATION BY PHILBANK OF THE FUND IN PAYMENT OF THE LOAN OBLIGATIONS OF RIVERSIDE MILLS CORPORATION WERE INVALID.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DECLARING THAT "BY HAVING ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOARD, (PHILBANK) IS NOW ESTOPPED TO QUESTION THE LATTER'S AUTHORITY AS WELL AS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THEREOF."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES TO PLAINTIFFS-APPELLEES ON THE BASIS THAT "[PHILBANK] WAS REMISS IN ITS DUTY TO TREAT RMCPRF'S ACCOUNT WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CARE CONSIDERING THE FIDUCIARY NATURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP, PERFORCE, THE PLAINTIFFS-APPELLEES WERE COMPELLED TO LITIGATE TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHT."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>The fundamental issue for our determination is whether the proceeds of the RMCPRF may be applied to satisfy RMC's debt to Philbank.<br><br>Petitioner contends that RMC's closure in 1984 rendered the RMCPRF Board of Trustees <i>functus officio</i> and devoid of authority to act on behalf of RMCPRF.&nbsp; It thus belittles the RMCPRF Board Resolution dated June 2, 1998, authorizing the release of the Fund to several of its supposed beneficiaries.&nbsp; Without known claimants of the Fund for eleven (11) years since RMC closed shop, it was justifiable for petitioner to consider the Fund to have "technically reverted" to, and formed part of RMC's assets.&nbsp; Hence, it could be applied to satisfy RMC's debts to Philbank.&nbsp; Petitioner also disputes the award of attorney's fees in light of the efforts taken by Philbank to ascertain claims before effecting the reversion.<br><br>Respondents for their part, belie the claim that petitioner exerted earnest efforts to ascertain claims. Respondents cite petitioner's omission to publish a notice in newspapers of general circulation to locate claims against the Fund.&nbsp; To them, petitioner's act of addressing the letter dated September 27, 1995 to the Board is a recognition of its authority to act for the beneficiaries.&nbsp; For these reasons, respondents believe that the reversion of the Fund to RMC is not only unwarranted but unconscionable.&nbsp; For being compelled to litigate to protect their rights, respondents also defend the award of attorney's fees to be proper.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>A trust is a "fiduciary relationship with respect to property which involves the existence of equitable duties imposed upon the holder of the title to the property to deal with it for the benefit of another."&nbsp; A trust is either express or implied.&nbsp; Express trusts are those which the direct and positive acts of the parties create, by some writing or deed, or will, or by words evincing an intention to create a trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Here, the RMC Provident and Retirement Plan created an express trust to provide retirement benefits to the regular employees of RMC.&nbsp; RMC retained legal title to the Fund but held the same in trust for the employees-beneficiaries.&nbsp; Thus, the allocation under the Plan is directly credited to each member's account:<br><br><blockquote>6. <u>Allocation:</u><br><br><ol type="a"><li>Monthly Contributions:<br><br><ol><li>Employee&nbsp; - to be <b>credited to his account</b>.<br><br></li><li>Employer - to be <b>credited to the respective member's account</b> as stated under the contribution provision.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Investment Earnings - semestral valuation of the fund shall be made and any earnings or losses shall <b>be credited or&nbsp; debited, as the case may be, to each member's account</b> in&nbsp; proportion to his account balances based on the last&nbsp; proceeding (sic) [preceding] accounting period.<br><br></li><li>Forfeitures - shall be retained in the fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</li></ol></blockquote><br>The trust was likewise a revocable trust as RMC reserved the power to terminate the Plan after all the liabilities of the Fund to the employees under the trust had been paid.&nbsp; Paragraph 13 of the Plan provided that "[i]n no event shall any part of the assets of the Fund revert to the Company before all liabilities of the Plan have been satisfied."<br><br>Relying on this clause, petitioner, as the Fund trustee, considered the Fund to have "technically reverted" to RMC, allegedly after no further claims were made thereon since November 1984. Thereafter, it applied the proceeds of the Fund to RMC's debt with the bank pursuant to Paragraph 9 of Promissory Note No. 1618-80<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; which RMC executed on May 12, 1981.&nbsp; The pertinent provision of the promissory note reads:<br><br><blockquote>IN THE EVENT THAT THIS NOTE IS NOT PAID AT MATURITY OR WHEN THE SAME BECOMES DUE UNDER ANY OF THE PROVISIONS HEREOF, I/WE HEREBY AUTHORIZE THE BANK AT ITS OPTION AND WITHOUT NOTICE, TO APPLY TO THE PAYMENT OF THIS NOTE, ANY AND ALL MONEYS, SECURITIES AND THINGS OF VALUE WHICH MAY BE IN ITS HAND OR ON DEPOSIT OR OTHERWISE <b>BELONGING TO ME/US</b> AND, FOR THIS PURPOSE, I/WE HEREBY, JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY, IRREVOCABLY CONSTITUTE AND APPOINT THE SAID BANK TO BE MY/OUR TRUE ATTORNEY-IN-FACT WITH FULL POWER AND AUTHORITY FOR ME/US AND IN MY/OUR NAME AND BEHALF, AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, TO NEGOTIATE, SELL AND TRANSFER ANY MONEYS, SECURITIES AND THINGS OF VALUE WHICH&nbsp; IT MAY HOLD, BY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SALE, AND APPLY THE PROCEEDS THEREOF TO THE PAYMENT OF THIS NOTE. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Petitioner contends that it was justified in supposing that reversion had occurred because its efforts to locate claims against the Fund from the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), the lower courts, the CA and the Supreme Court proved futile.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>Employees' trusts or benefit plans are intended to provide economic assistance to employees upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, particularly, old age retirement, death, sickness, or disability.&nbsp; They give security against certain hazards to which members of the Plan may be exposed. They are independent and additional sources of protection for the working group and established for their exclusive benefit and for no other purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Here, while the Plan provides for a reversion of the Fund to RMC, this cannot be done until all the liabilities of the Plan have been paid.&nbsp; And when RMC ceased operations in 1984, the Fund became liable for the payment not only of the benefits of qualified retirees at the time of RMC's closure but also of those who were separated from work as a consequence of the closure.&nbsp; Paragraph 7 of the Retirement Plan states:<br><br><blockquote>Separation from Service:<br><br>A member who is separated from the service of the Company before satisfying the conditions for retirement due to resignation <b>or any reason other than dismissal for cause shall be paid the balance of his account as of the last day of the month prior to separation</b>. The amount representing the Company's contribution and income thereon standing to the credit of the separating member shall be paid to him as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">Completed Years&nbsp; of Membership</div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">% of Company's Contribution and Earnings Thereon Payable<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">0 - 5 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">NIL</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">6 - 10 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">20%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">11 - 15 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">40%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">16 - 20 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">60%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">21 - 25 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">80%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">25 - over </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">100%</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>A member who is separated for cause shall not be entitled to withdraw the total amount representing his contribution and that of the Company including the earned interest thereon, and the employer's contribution shall be retained in the fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>The provision makes reference to a member-employee who is dismissed for cause.&nbsp; Under the <u>Labor Code</u>, as amended, an employee may be dismissed for just or authorized causes.&nbsp; A dismissal for just cause under Article 282<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the <u>Labor Code</u>, as amended, implies that the employee is guilty of some misfeasance towards his employer, <i>i.e.</i> the employee has committed serious misconduct in relation to his work, is guilty of fraud, has perpetrated an offense against the employer or any immediate member of his family, or has grossly and habitually neglected his duties.&nbsp; Essentially, it is an act of the employee that sets off the dismissal process in motion.<br><br>On the other hand, a dismissal for an authorized cause under Article 283<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and 284<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the <u>Labor Code</u>, as amended, does not entail any wrongdoing on the part of the employee.&nbsp; Rather, the termination of employment is occasioned by the employer's exercise of management prerogative or by the illness of the employee - matters beyond the worker's control.<br><br>The distinction between just and authorized causes for dismissal lies in the fact that payment of separation pay is required in dismissals for an authorized cause but not so in dismissals for just cause.&nbsp; The rationale behind this rule was explained in the case of <i>Phil. Long Distance Telephone Co. v. NLRC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and reiterated in <i>San Miguel Corporation v. Lao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> thus:<br><br><blockquote>We hold that henceforth separation pay shall be allowed as a measure of social justice only in those instances where the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those reflecting on his moral character. Where the reason for the valid dismissal is, for example, habitual intoxication or an offense involving moral turpitude, like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow worker, the employer may not be required to give the dismissed employee separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is called, on the ground of social justice.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br><i>The policy of social justice is not intended to countenance wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the underprivileged. </i>At best[,] it may mitigate the penalty but it certainly will not condone the offense.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. Lao</i>, we reversed the CA ruling which granted retirement benefits to an employee who was found by the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC to have been properly dismissed for willful breach of trust and confidence.<br><br>Applied to this case, the penal nature of the provision in Paragraph 7 of the Plan, whereby a member separated for cause shall not be entitled to withdraw the contributions made by him and his employer, indicates that the "separation for cause" being referred to therein is any of the just causes under Article 282 of the <u>Labor Code</u>, as amended.<br><br>To be sure, the cessation of business by RMC is an authorized cause for the termination of its employees. Hence, not only those qualified for retirement should receive their total benefits under the Fund, but those laid off should also be entitled to collect the balance of their account as of the last day of the month prior to RMC's closure.&nbsp; In addition, the Plan provides that the separating member shall be paid a maximum of 40% of the amount representing the Company's contribution and its income standing to his credit.&nbsp; Until these liabilities shall have been settled, there can be no reversion of the Fund to RMC.<br><br>Under Paragraph 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the Agreement, petitioner's function shall be limited to the liquidation and return of the Fund to the Board upon the termination of the Agreement.&nbsp; Paragraph 14 of said Agreement further states that "it shall be the duty of the Investment Manager to assign, transfer, and pay over to its successor or successors all cash, securities, and other properties held by it constituting the fund less any amounts constituting the charges and expenses which are authorized [under the Agreement] to be payable from the Fund."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, petitioner had no power to effect reversion of the Fund to RMC.<br><br>The reversion petitioner effected also could hardly be said to have been done in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employee-beneficiaries.&nbsp; The restriction imposed under Paragraph 13 of the Plan stating that "in no event shall any part of the assets of the Fund revert to the Company before all liabilities of the Plan have been satisfied," demands more than a passive stance as that adopted by petitioner in locating claims against the Fund.&nbsp; Besides, the beneficiaries of the Fund are readily identifiable - the regular or permanent employees of RMC who were qualified retirees and those who were terminated as a result of its closure.&nbsp; Petitioner needed only to secure a list of the employees concerned from the Board of Trustees which was its principal under the Agreement and the trustee of the Plan or from RMC which was the trustor of the Fund under the Retirement Plan. Yet, petitioner notified respondent Board of Trustees only after Philbank's Board of Directors had decided to apply the remaining trust assets of RMCPRF to the liabilities of the company.<br><br>Petitioner nonetheless assails the authority of the Board of Trustees to issue the Resolution of June 2, 1998 recognizing the exclusive ownership of the Fund by the employees of RMC and authorizing its release to the beneficiaries as may be ordered by the trial court.&nbsp; Petitioner contends that the cessation of RMC's operations ended not only the Board members' employment in RMC, but also their tenure as members of the RMCPRF Board of Trustees.<br><br>Again, we are not convinced. Paragraph 13 of the Plan states that "[a]lthough it is expected that the Plan will continue indefinitely, it may be amended or terminated by the Company at any time on account of business conditions." There is no dispute as to the management prerogative on this matter, considering that the Fund consists primarily of contributions from the salaries of members-employees and the Company.&nbsp; However, it must be stressed that the RMC Provident and Retirement Plan was primarily established for the benefit of regular and permanent employees of RMC. As such, the Board may not unilaterally terminate the Plan without due regard to any accrued benefits and rightful claims of members-employees.&nbsp; Besides, the Board is bound by Paragraph 13 prohibiting the reversion of the Fund to RMC before all the liabilities of the Plan have been satisfied.<br><br>As to the contention that the functions of the Board of Trustees ceased&nbsp; upon with RMC's closure, the same is likewise untenable.<br><br>Under Section 122<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the Corporation Code, a dissolved corporation shall nevertheless continue as a body corporate for three (3) years for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by or against it and enabling it to settle and close its affairs, to dispose and convey its property and to distribute its assets, but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which it was established.&nbsp; Within those three (3) years, the corporation may appoint a trustee or receiver who shall carry out the said purposes beyond the three (3)-year winding-up period. Thus, a trustee of a dissolved corporation may commence a suit which can proceed to final judgment even beyond the three (3)-year period of liquidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the same manner, during and beyond the three (3)-year winding-up period of RMC, the Board of Trustees of RMCPRF may do no more than settle and close the affairs of the Fund.&nbsp; The Board retains its authority to act on behalf of its members, <i>albeit,</i> in a limited capacity. It may commence suits on behalf of its members but not continue managing the Fund for purposes of maximizing profits. Here, the Board's act of issuing the Resolution authorizing petitioner to release the Fund to its beneficiaries is still part of the liquidation process, that is, satisfaction of the liabilities of the Plan, and does not amount to doing business.&nbsp; Hence, it was properly within the Board's power to promulgate.<br><br>Anent the award of attorney's fees to respondents, we find the same to be in order.&nbsp; Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code allows the award of attorney's fees in cases where the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest.&nbsp; Attorney's fees may be awarded by a court to one (1) who was compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his or her interest by reason of an unjustified act or omission of the party from whom it is sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner applied the Fund in satisfaction of the obligation of RMC without authority and without bothering to inquire regarding unpaid claims from the Board of Trustees of RMCPRF.&nbsp; It wrote the members of the Board only after it had decided to revert the Fund to RMC.&nbsp; Upon being met with objections, petitioner insisted on the reversion of the Fund to RMC, despite the clause in the Plan that prohibits such reversion before all liabilities shall have been satisfied, thereby leaving respondents with no choice but to seek judicial relief.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated November 7, 2006 and the Resolution dated March 5, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
