				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons.  The accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interest of immense importance, both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Due process commands that no man shall lose his liberty unless the Government has borne the burden of convincing the factfinder of his guilt. To this end, the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable, for it `impresses on the trier of fact the necessity of reaching certitude of the facts in issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Moreover, use of the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable to command the respect and confidence of the community in applications of criminal law. It is critical that the moral force of criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned. It is also important in our free society that every individual going about his ordinary affairs has confidence that his government cannot adjudge him guilty of a criminal offense without convincing a proper factfinder of his guilt with utmost certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Lest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) promulgated on April 24, 2006 affirming <i>in toto</i> the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 103 finding appellant Roldan Morales y Midarasa guilty of the crimes of possession and sale of dangerous drugs.<br><br><b>Factual Antecedents</b><br><br>Appellant was charged in two separate Informations before the RTC with possession and sale of methylamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b><u>Criminal Case No.</u></b><u><b> Q-03-114256</b></u><br><br>That on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of January, 2003 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused not being authorized by law to possess or use any dangerous drug, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in her/his/their possession and control, zero point zero three (0.03) grams of methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b><u>Criminal Case No.</u></b><u><b> Q-03-114257</b></u><br><br>That on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of January, 2003, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any dangerous drug, did, then and there, willfully and unlawfully sell, dispense, deliver, transport, distribute or act as broker in the said transaction, zero point zero three (0.03) gram of methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to both charges read in Filipino, a language known and understood by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  On motion of the City Prosecutor, the cases were consolidated for joint trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.<br><br>The testimonies of PO1 Eduardo Roy (PO1 Roy) and PO3 Armando Rivera (PO3 Rivera) were presented by the prosecution:<br><br>PO1 Roy testified that on January 2, 2003, at about 2:00 p.m., he was on duty at Police Station 9 where he made a pre-operation report on the buy-bust operation to be conducted on the herein appellant that same afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  He then proceeded to Brgy.

It found that contrary to the allegations of the appellant, there was no instigation that took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  Rather, a buy-bust operation was employed by the police officers to apprehend the appellant while in the act of unlawfully selling drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  The appellate court further held that what is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of prohibited drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  Stripped of non-essentials, the CA summarized the antecedent facts of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>PO1 Eduardo Roy prepared a pre-arranged report on the buy-bust operation to be conducted against appellant at Barangay San Vicente, Quezon City upon an informant's tip that appellant was selling "shabu" in the said area.  On the other hand, PO3 Armando Ragundiaz Rivera recorded the briefing, summary, identification of appellant and the buy-bust money to be used in the operation consisting of one (1) fifty peso bill, two (2) twenty peso bill[s] and one (1) ten peso bill.  PO1 Roy who acted as the poseur-buyer and PO3 Rivera as his back-up proceeded to University Avenue corner Commonwealth Avenue, Barangay San Vicente, Quezon City together with the informant.<br><br>PO1 Roy and the informant met appellant at the parking lot of Jollibee restaurant while PO3 Rivera positioned himself at the side of a parked car where he can easily have a clear view of the three.  After PO1 Roy was introduced by the informant to the appellant as a buyer of "shabu", the latter immediately produced a sachet containing the said prohibited drugs and handed the same to him.  PO1 Roy raised his left hand as the pre-arranged signal that the transaction was consummated.  Thereafter, PO3 Rivera went to the area, introduced himself as a police officer and frisked appellant from whom he recovered the marked money and a matchbox, where the suspected "shabu" was placed, and two (2) aluminum foils.  They informed appellant of his constitutional rights and brought him to the police station while the two (2) small transparent heat sealed sachets containing the suspected prohibited drugs and paraphernalia were turned over to the crime laboratory for examination, and which [was] later, found to be positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as "shabu").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Thence, the CA rendered judgment to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 103 dated April 29, 2004 is hereby AFFIRMED <i>IN TOTO.</i><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant elevated the case to this Court <i>via</i> Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  In our Resolution dated July 12, 2006, we resolved to accept the case and required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs simultaneously, if they so desire, within 30 days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  Both parties adopted their respective appellant's and appellee's briefs, instead of filing supplemental briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>Appellant claims that he should not be convicted of the offenses charged since his guilt has not been proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  In support of his contention, appellant alleges that the arresting officers did not even place the proper markings on the alleged <i>shabu</i> and paraphernalia at the time and place of the alleged buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  Appellant hence posits that this created serious doubt as to the items and actual quantity of <i>shabu</i> recovered, if at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, on the other hand, insists that the direct testimony of the two arresting officers sufficiently established the elements of illegal sale and possession of <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>At the outset, we draw attention to the unique nature of an appeal in a criminal case: the appeal throws the whole case open for review and it is the duty of the appellate court to correct, cite and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  On the basis of such review, we find the present appeal meritorious.<br><br>Prevailing jurisprudence uniformly hold that the trial court's findings of fact, especially when affirmed by the CA, are, as a general rule, entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  However, this rule admits of exceptions and does not apply where facts of weight and substance with direct and material bearing on the final outcome of the case have been overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  After due consideration of the records of this case, evidence presented and relevant law and jurisprudence, we hold that this case falls under the exception.<br><br>In actions involving the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the following elements must first be established: (1) proof that the transaction or sale took place and (2) the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i> or the illicit drug as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in prosecutions for illegal possession of a dangerous drug, it must be shown that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>  Similarly, in this case, the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> must be established beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>With respect to <i>corpus delicti</i>, Section 21 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources or dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) <b>The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the persons/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof</b>; x x x  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>People v. Partoza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> we held that the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. In the said case, the apprehending policeman did not mark the seized drugs after he arrested the appellant in the latter's presence.  Neither did he make an inventory and take a photograph of the confiscated items in the presence of the appellant.  There was no representative from the media and the Department of Justice, or any elected public official who participated in the operation and who were supposed to sign an inventory of seized items and be given copies thereof.  Hence, we held in the afore-cited case that there was no compliance with the statutory safeguards.  In addition, while the apprehending policeman admitted to have in his possession the <i>shabu</i> from the time the appellant was apprehended at the crime scene to the police station, records are bereft of proof on how the seized items were handled from the time they left the hands of the said police officer.<br><br>We declared in <i>People v. Orteza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> that the failure to comply with Paragraph 1, Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 implied a concomitant failure on the part of the prosecution to establish the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>People v. </i><i>Laxa</i>,<i> </i>where the buy-bust team failed to mark the confiscated marijuana immediately after the apprehension of the accused, the Court held that the deviation from the standard procedure in anti-narcotics operations produced doubts as to the origins of the marijuana. Consequently, the Court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the <i>corpus delicti.</i><br><br>The Court made a similar ruling in <i>People v. Kimura</i>, where the Narcom operatives failed to place markings on the seized marijuana at the time the accused was arrested and to observe the procedure and take custody of the drug.<br><br>More recently, in <i>Zarraga</i><i> v.</i><i> People</i>, the Court held that the material inconsistencies with regard to when and where the markings on the <i>shabu</i> were made and the lack of inventory on the seized drugs created reasonable doubt as to the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. The Court thus acquitted the accused due to the prosecution's failure to indubitably show the identity of the <i>shabu</i>.<br></blockquote><br>Likewise, in <i>People v. Obmiranis</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> we acquitted the appellant due to flaws in the conduct of the post-seizure custody of the dangerous drug allegedly recovered from the appellant, together with the failure of the key persons who handled the same to testify on the whereabouts of the exhibit before it was offered in evidence in court.<br><br>In the instant case, it is indisputable that the procedures for the custody and disposition of confiscated dangerous drugs, as mandated in Section 21 of RA 9165, were not observed.  The records utterly failed to show that the buy-bust team complied with these procedures despite their mandatory nature as indicated by the use of "shall" in the directives of the law.  The procedural lapse is plainly evident from the testimonies of the two police officers presented by the prosecution, namely: PO1 Roy and PO3 Rivera.<br><br>PO1 Roy, in his testimony, failed to concretely identify the items seized from the appellant. Moreover, he confirmed that they did not make a list of the items seized.  The patent lack of adherence to the procedural mandate of RA 9165 is manifest in his testimony, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0"

Hence, the investigator, referred to by PO1 Roy in his testimony as the one who took delivery of the seized items, was not identified nor was he presented in court.  More importantly, the testifying police officers did not state that they marked the seized drugs immediately after they arrested the appellant and in the latter's presence.  Neither did they make an inventory and take a photograph of the confiscated items in the presence of the appellant.  There was likewise no mention of any representative from the media and the Department of Justice, or any elected public official who participated in the operation and who were supposed to sign an inventory of seized items and be given copies thereof.  None of these statutory safeguards were observed.<br><br>Even PO1 Roy, the poseur-buyer, was not certain as to the identity of the confiscated <i>shabu</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Fiscal Jurado:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q-</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">If the said sachet and paraphernalia will be shown to you, how would you be able to identify the said items?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Witness</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A- </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I could not recall "pare-pareho yung shabu".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The procedural lapses in the handling and identification of the  seized items<br><br>collectively raise doubts as to whether the items presented in court were the exact same items that were confiscated from appellant when he was apprehended.<br><br>While this Court recognizes that non-compliance by the buy-bust team with Section 21 of RA 9165 is not fatal as long as there is a justifiable ground therefor, for and as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the siezed items are properly preserved by the apprehending team,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> these conditions were not met in the case at bar.
