He believed that the charge against him was ill-motivated because he sometimes physically abuses his wife in front of their children after engaging in a heated argument,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  and beats the children as a disciplinary measure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  He went further to narrate how his day was on the date of the alleged rape.<br><br>He alleged that on 15 March 2000, there was no food prepared for him at lunchtime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  Shortly after, AAA arrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  She answered back when confronted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  This infuriated him that he kicked her hard on her buttocks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Appellant went back to work and went home again around 3 o'clock in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Finding nobody at home,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> he prepared his dinner and went to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Later in the evening, he was awakened by the members of the "<i>Bantay Bayan</i>" headed by Moises Boy Banting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  They asked him to go with them to discuss some matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  He later learned that he was under detention because AAA charged him of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On 8 July 2006, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 9, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, rendered its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 10372-0, finding appellant guilty of rape qualified by relationship and minority, and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  It also ordered him to indemnify AAA P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as civil indemnity with exemplary damages of P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On 30 September 2008, the decision of the trial court was AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00456-MIN.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  The appellate court found that appellant is not eligible for parole and it increased both the civil indemnity and moral damages from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On 24 November 2008, the Court of Appeals gave due course to the appellant's notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  This Court required the parties to simultaneously file their respective supplemental briefs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> but both manifested that they will no longer file supplemental pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The lone assignment of error in the appellant's brief is that, the trial court gravely erred in finding him guilty as charged despite the failure of the prosecution to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> because: (1) there were inconsistencies in the testimonies of AAA and her brother BBB;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (2) his extrajudicial confession before Moises Boy Banting was without the assistance of a counsel, in violation of his constitutional right;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and (3) AAA's accusation was ill-motivated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><center><u><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b></u></center><br>Appellant contests the admissibility in evidence of his alleged confession with a "<i>bantay bayan</i>" and the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br><b><i>Admissibility in Evidence of an</i></b><br><b><i>Extrajudicial Confession before</i></b><br><b><i>a "Bantay Bayan"</i></b><br><br>Appellant argues that even if he, indeed, confessed to Moises Boy Banting, a "<i>bantay bayan,</i>" the confession was inadmissible in evidence because he was not assisted by a lawyer and there was no valid waiver of such requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The case of <i>People v. Malngan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> is the authority on the scope of the Miranda doctrine provided for under Article III, Section 12(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and (3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the Constitution.  In <i>Malngan,</i> appellant questioned the admissibility of her extrajudicial confessions given to the barangay chairman and a neighbor of the private complainant. This Court distinguished.  Thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>Arguably, </i>the <i>barangay</i><i> tanods</i>, including the <i>Barangay</i> Chairman, in this particular instance, <i>may </i>be deemed as law enforcement officer for purposes of applying Article III, Section 12(1) and (3), of the Constitution.  When accused-appellant was brought to the barangay hall in the morning of 2 January 2001, she was already a suspect, actually the only one, in the fire that destroyed several houses x x x.  She was, therefore, already under custodial investigation and the rights guaranteed by x x x [the] Constitution should have already been observed or applied to her.  Accused-appellant's confession to Barangay Chairman x x x was made in response to the `interrogation' made by the latter - admittedly conducted without first informing accused-appellant of her rights under the Constitution or done in the presence of counsel.  For this reason, the confession of accused-appellant, given to Barangay Chairman x x x, as well as the lighter found x x x in her bag are <b>inadmissible in evidence</b> against her x x x. <br><br>[But such does] not automatically lead to her acquittal. x x x [T]he constitutional safeguards during custodial investigations <b>do not apply to those not elicited through questioning by the police <u>or their agents</u> </b>but given in an ordinary manner whereby the accused verbally admits x x x as x x x in the case at bar when accused-appellant admitted to Mercedita Mendoza, one of the neighbors x x x [of the private complainant].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  <i>(Emphasis supplied)</i></blockquote><br>Following the rationale behind the ruling in <i>Malngan</i><i>, </i>this Court needs to ascertain whether or not a "<i>bantay bayan</i>" may<i> </i>be deemed a law enforcement officer within the contemplation of Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution.<br><br>In <i>People of the Philippines v. Buendia,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><i> </i>this Court had the occasion to mention the nature of a "<i>bantay bayan</i>," that is, "a group of male residents living in [the] area organized for the purpose of keeping peace in their community[,which is] an accredited auxiliary of the x x x PNP."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Also, it may be worthy to consider that pursuant to Section 1(g) of Executive Order No. 309 issued on 11 November 1987, as amended, a Peace and Order Committee in each <i>barangay</i> shall be organized "to serve as implementing arm of the City/Municipal Peace and Order Council at the <i>Barangay</i> level."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  The composition of the Committee includes, among others: (1) the <i>Punong Barangay</i> as Chairman; (2) the Chairman of the <i>Sangguniang Kabataan</i>; (3) a Member of the <i>Lupon Tagapamayapa</i>; (4) a <i>Barangay</i><i> Tanod</i>; and (5) <b>at least three (3) Members of existing <i>Barangay</i>-Based Anti-Crime or neighborhood Watch Groups or a Non Government Organization Representative well-known in his community.<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></b>  </b><br><br>This Court is, therefore, convinced that <i>barangay</i>-based volunteer organizations in the nature of watch groups, as in the case of the "<i>bantay bayan</i>," are recognized by the local government unit to perform functions relating to the preservation of peace and order at the <i>barangay</i> level.  Thus, without ruling on the legality of the actions taken by Moises Boy Banting, and the specific scope of duties and responsibilities delegated to a "<i>bantay</i><i> bayan</i>," particularly on the authority to conduct a custodial investigation, any inquiry he makes has the color of a state-related function and objective insofar as the entitlement of a suspect to his constitutional rights provided for under Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution, otherwise known as the Miranda Rights, is concerned.<br><br>We, therefore, find the extrajudicial confession of appellant, which was taken without a counsel, inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>Be that as it may, We agree with the Court of Appeals that the conviction of the appellant was not deduced solely from the assailed extrajudicial confession but "from the confluence of evidence showing his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b><i>Credibility of the Witnesses for the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>Appellant assails the inconsistencies in the testimonies of AAA and her brother BBB.  AAA testified that BBB accompanied her to the house of their grandmother.  Thereafter, they, together with her relatives, proceeded to look for a "<i>bantay bayan</i>."  On the other hand, BBB testified that he brought her sister to the house of their "<i>bantay bayan</i>" after he learned of the incident.<br><br>Citing <i>Bartocillo</i><i> v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><i> </i>appellant argues that "where the testimonies of two key witnesses cannot stand together, the inevitable conclusion is that one or both must be telling a lie, and their story a mere concoction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The principle, however, is not applicable in the case at bar.  In <i>Bartocillo, </i>the two testimonies could not simply stand together because:<br><br><blockquote>On one hand, if we are to believe Susan, Orlando could not have possibly seen the hacking incident since he had accompanied Vicente home. On the other hand, if we are to accept the testimony of Orlando, then Susan could not have possibly witnessed the hacking incident since she was with Vicente at that time. </blockquote><br>Here, the testimony of AAA does not run contrary to that of BBB.  Both testified that they sought the help of a "<i>bantay bayan</i>."  Their respective testimonies differ only as to when the help was sought for, which this Court could well attribute to the nature of the testimony of BBB, a shortcut version of AAA's testimony that dispensed with a detailed account of the incident.<br><br>At any rate, the Court of Appeals is correct in holding that the assailed inconsistency is too trivial to affect the veracity of the testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>  In fact, inconsistencies which refer to minor, trivial or inconsequential circumstances even strengthen the credibility of the witnesses, as they erase doubts that such testimonies have been coached or rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Appellant's contention that AAA charged him of rape only because she bore grudges against him is likewise unmeritorious.  This Court is not dissuaded from giving full credence to the testimony of a minor complainant by motives of feuds, resentment or revenge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>  As correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote>Indeed, mere disciplinary chastisement is not strong enough to make daughters in a Filipino family invent a charge that would not only bring shame and humiliation upon them and their families but also bring their fathers into the gallows of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that it is unbelievable for a daughter to charge her own father with rape, exposing herself to the ordeal and embarrassment of a public trial and subjecting her private parts to examination if such heinous crime was not in fact committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>  No person, much less a woman, could attain such height of cruelty to one who has sired her, and from whom she owes her very existence, and for which she naturally feels loving and lasting gratefulness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>  Even when consumed with revenge, it takes a certain amount of psychological depravity for a young woman to concoct a story which would put her own father to jail for the most of his remaining life and drag the rest of the family including herself to a lifetime of shame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>  It is highly improbable for [AAA] against whom no proof of sexual perversity or loose morality has been shown to fake charges much more against her own father. In fact her testimony is entitled to greater weight since her accusing words were directed against a close relative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </blockquote><br><b><i>Elements of Rape</i></b><br><br>Having established the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution, We now examine the applicability of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> to the case at bar.<br><br>The law provides, in part, that rape is committed, among others, "[b]y a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman" "through force, threat or intimidation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  The death penalty shall be imposed if it is committed with aggravating/qualifying circumstances, which include, "[w]hen the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The consistent and forthright testimony of AAA detailing how she was raped, culminating with the penetration of appellant's penis into her vagina, suffices to prove that appellant had carnal knowledge of her.  When a woman states that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  Further, when such testimony corresponds with medical findings, there is sufficient basis to conclude that the essential requisites of carnal knowledge have been established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals pointed out that the element of force or intimidation is not essential when the accused is the father of the victim, inasmuch as his superior moral ascendancy or influence substitutes for violence and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>  At any rate, AAA was actually threatened by appellant with his fist and a knife allegedly placed above AAA's head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>It may be added that the self-serving defense of appellant cannot prevail over the positive and straightforward testimony of AAA.  Settled is the rule that, "alibi is an inherently weak defense that is viewed with suspicion because it is easy to fabricate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> "Alibi and denial must be supported by strong corroborative evidence in order to merit credibility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>  Moreover, for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must establish two elements - (1) he was not at the <i>locus delicti </i>at the time the offense was committed; and (2) it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>  Appellant failed in this wise.<br><br><b><i>Aggravating/Qualifying Circumstances</i></b><br><br>The presence of the qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship with the offender in the instant case has likewise been adequately established. Both qualifying circumstances were specifically alleged in the Information, stipulated on and admitted during the pre-trial conference, and testified to by both parties in their respective testimonies.  Also, such stipulation and admission, as correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, are binding upon this Court because they are judicial admissions within the contemplation of Section 4, Rule 129 of the Revised Rules of Court.  It provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4.  <i>Judicial admissions.</i><i>  </i>-  <b>An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. </b> The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.</blockquote><br><b><i>Penalty</i></b><br><br>Finally, in increasing the amount of civil indemnity and damages each from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00, the Court of Appeals correctly considered controlling jurisprudence to the effect that where, as here, the rape is committed with any of the qualifying/aggravating circumstances warranting the imposition of the death penalty, the victim is entitled to P75,000.00 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><i> </i>and<i> </i>P75,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>  However, the award of exemplary damages should have been increased from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>  Also, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> <i>in lieu</i> of death was correctly imposed considering that the imposition of the death penalty upon appellant would have been appropriate were it not for the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346, or <i>An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>  We further affirm the ruling of the Court of Appeals on appellant's non-eligibility for parole.  Sec. 3 of Republic Act No. 9346 clearly provides that "persons convicted of offenses punished with <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or whose sentences will be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> by reason of the law, shall not be eligible for parole."<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 30 September 2008 in CA-G.R.
