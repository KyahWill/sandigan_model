Gimena submitted his explanation to the delayed remittance of undeposited collections of cash on hand totaling to P94,700.00. According to him, it is his practice to deposit/remit the cash collections whenever he makes his monthly reports.  He admitted that he was negligent in making the report on time, resulting in the delay of remittance of Judiciary Development Fund and Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund collections.  He also opted not to deposit the cash bond collections of election protest collection to the Municipal Treasurer's Office (MTO) for reason that it is the source of all expenses in case of revision as provided by the Rules of Procedures in Election Contest (Annex "B").<br><br>We find the explanation of Mr. Gimena on his failure to deposit to the MTO the cash collections amounting to P75,000.00 in election protest cases and the JDF and SAJF collections unmeritorious.  He kept the cash collections in election protest cases in his personal possession for almost one year.  The P75,000.00 collections in election protest cases were part of the P150,000.00 he collected in November 2007.  The other half P75,000.00 was deposited in November 2007 to the MTO under MTO OR Nos. 1230960 to 962 as shown in the attached photocopy of the Certificate of Deposits issued by the MTO (Annex "C").<br><br>The undeposited collections of cash on hand could have earned interest to the JDF/SAJF had he not kept the amount in his personal possession.  He is allowed to purchase Postal Money Orders (PMOs) from the Local Post Office payable to the Chief Accountant, Accounting Division, FMO-OCA for the JDF and SAJF collections or the nearest Land Bank situated in Catarman, Northern Samar which is approximately fifteen kilometers away from the court.<br><br>On April 15, 2009 the Team advised Mr. Gimena to deposit the amount of P12,607.00 to the Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund as provided for under Sec. 21 (g) of the Amended Administrative Circular No. 35-2004 which he complied on that day.  Furthermore, he was advised to deposit P6,133.00 and P75,000.00 to the JDF account &amp; Fiduciary Fund, respectively, which he complied also on the same day (Annexes "D" &amp; "E").<br><br><b>II.

I have been lately negligent in making this report on time resulting in the delay of my remittance of the JDF and the SA[J]F.  Rest assured, however, that I have not used any of said amount for my personal benefit and as of today, I have already remitted/deposited all amount according to your audit and reconciliation of my book of accounts. The corresponding disbursement vouchers and acknowledgment receipts are all hereto attached.<br><br>As to the amount of P75,000.00 (FF), the same has already been deposited with the Office of the Municipal Treasurer, LGU-Mondragon, Northern Samar.  I was mistaken in my belief that it need not be deposited/remitted since it was the source for all expenses in case of revision as provided by the Rules of Procedure in Election Contest.<br><br>Wherefore, I beg the indulgence of your Honorable Office and I commit myself to make my monthly report on time and that all these mistakes will not happen again.</blockquote><br>On May 25, 2009, the newly designated Presiding Judge Emerenciana O.

His express admission that he had been negligent in submitting the monthly report which, consequently, resulted in the delay in remitting the JDF and SAJF does not warrant his exculpation from administrative liability.  Likewise, his defenses that he had not used the subject funds for his personal benefit and that he had already deposited the said amounts do not work in his favor.  His subsequent restitution of the amount did not alter the fact that he was remiss in the discharge of his duties.  Suffice it to state that circulars of the Court must be strictly complied with to protect the safekeeping of funds and collections and to establish full accountability of government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Shortages in the amounts to be remitted and the years of delay in the actual remittance constitute gross neglect of duty for which the Clerk of Court shall be administratively liable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> gross dishonesty, gross misconduct,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and even malversation of public funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  As pointed out by the OCA, the P75,000.00 collected from election protest cases was part of the P150,000.00 he collected in November 2007 which he kept in his personal possession for almost one year (<i>should be</i> more than one year) and, thus, posed the danger of being lost or malversed and deprived the court of interest income.  The failure to remit on time judiciary collections deprives the court of interest that may be earned if the amounts are deposited in a bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  His "mistaken belief that the P75,000.00 FF need not be deposited or remitted since it was the source for all expenses in case of revision as provided by the Rules of Procedure in Election Contest" would not constitute valid excuse.  Unfamiliarity with procedures will not exempt him from liability.  As Clerk of Court II, Gimeno is expected to keep abreast of all applicable laws, jurisprudence and administrative circulars pertinent to his office.  As custodian of court funds and revenues, Clerks of Court have always been reminded of their duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories for they are not supposed to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Court finds Gimena guilty of two (2) offenses, <i>i.e</i>., delay in the deposit of collections and non-submission of monthly reports of collections, deposits and withdrawals in violation of Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 (dated June 15, 2000) and OCA Circular No. 113-2004 (September 16, 2004). The OCA recommended two penalties for the said offenses, albeit in the alternative -- suspension for one (1) month without pay or fine in the amount of five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) with a stern warning that similar act will be dealt with more severely in the future. This should be modified.  In <i>Re: Report on Audit and Physical Inventory of the Records of Cases in MTC of Peñaranda, Nueva Ecija</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> therein clerk of court was found guilty of gross neglect of duty for failure to timely turn over the court collections and submit monthly reports and, thus, dismissed from the service.  Similarly, in <i>Sollesta v.

The <i>minimum</i> of the penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present.<br><br>b.  The <i>medium</i> of the penalty shall be imposed where no mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present.<br><br>c.  The <i>maximum</i> of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present.<br><br>d.  Where aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present, paragraph [a] shall be applied where there are more mitigating circumstances present; paragraph [b] shall be applied when the circumstances equally offset such other; and paragraph [c] shall be applied when there are more aggravating circumstances.<br><br><b>Section 55. </b> <b>Penalty for the Most Serious Offense.  </b>If the respondent is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge or count and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances.</blockquote><br>Jurisprudence abound that delayed remittance of cash collections by the clerk of court or cash clerk constitutes gross neglect of duty and imposed the supreme penalty of dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Hence, the imposable penalty upon Gimena should be dismissal from the service.  However, since he pleaded that he did not malverse any of the amounts collected for his personal benefit and had subsequently remitted the subject amounts, as shown by the attached disbursement vouchers and acknowledgment receipts, with no outstanding accountabilities, these can be taken as mitigating circumstances which warrant the imposition of the lower penalty of suspension of one (1) month without pay.
