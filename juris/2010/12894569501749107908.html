				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Jurisprudence is replete with rulings that in civil cases, the party who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it. Burden of proof is the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to prove the truth of his claim or defense by the amount of evidence required by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In this case, the petitioners awfully failed to discharge their burden to prove by preponderance of evidence that the Agreement they entered into with respondents' predecessor-in-interest is a contract of sale and not a mere contract to sell, or that said Agreement was novated after the latter subsequently entered into an oral contract of sale with them over a determinate portion of the subject property more than a decade ago.<br><br>Petitioners filed this appeal from the Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC's) dismissal of their action for specific performance where they sought to compel the respondents to convey the property subject of their purported oral contract of sale.<br><br><i><b>Factual Antecedents</b></i><br><br>The property involved in this case is a portion of a parcel of land known as Lot No. 263 located at Sabayle Street, Iligan City. Lot No. 263 has an area of 860 square meters covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 0-271<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> registered in the name of Eugenia Primero (Eugenia), married to Alfredo Primero, Sr. (Alfredo).<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early 1980s, Eugenia leased the lot to petitioner Irene Montecalvo (Irene) for a monthly rental of P500.00.&nbsp; On January 13, 1985, Eugenia entered into an un-notarized Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> with Irene, where the former offered to sell the property to the latter for P1,000.00 per square meter.&nbsp; They agreed that Irene would deposit the amount of P40,000.00 which shall form part of the down payment equivalent to 50% of the purchase price.&nbsp; They also stipulated that during the term of negotiation of 30 to 45 days from receipt of said deposit, Irene would pay the balance of P410,000.00 on the down payment.&nbsp; In case Irene defaulted in the payment of the down payment, the deposit would be returned within 10 days from the lapse of said negotiation period and the Agreement deemed terminated. However, if the negotiations pushed through, the balance of the full value of P860,000.00 or the net amount of P410,000.00 would be paid in 10 equal monthly installments from receipt of the down payment, with interest at the prevailing rate.<br><br>Irene failed to pay the full down payment within the stipulated 30-45-day negotiation period.&nbsp; Nonetheless, she continued to stay on the disputed property, and still made several payments with an aggregate amount of P293,000.00.&nbsp; On the other hand, Eugenia did not return the P40,000.00 deposit to Irene, and refused to accept further payments only in 1992.<br><br>Thereafter, Irene caused a survey of Lot No. 263 and the segregation of a portion equivalent to 293 square meters in her favor. However, Eugenia opposed her claim and asked her to vacate the property. Then on May 13, 1996, Eugenia and the heirs of her deceased husband Alfredo filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Irene and her husband, herein petitioner Nonilon Montecalvo (Nonilon) before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Iligan City.&nbsp; During the preliminary conference, the parties stipulated that the issue to be resolved was whether their Agreement had been rescinded and novated. Hence, the MTC dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction since the issue is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation. The MTC's Decision dismissing the ejectment case became final as Eugenia and her children did not appeal therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On June 18, 1996, Irene and Nonilon retaliated by instituting CM Case No. 11-3588 with the RTC of Lanao del Norte for specific performance, to compel Eugenia to convey the 293-square meter portion of Lot No. 263.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><i><b>Proceedings before the Regional Trial Court</b></i><br><br>Trial on the merits ensued and the contending parties adduced their respective testimonial and documentary evidence before the trial court.<br><br>Irene testified that after their Agreement for the purpose of negotiating the sale of Lot No. 263 failed to materialize, she and Eugenia entered into an oral contract of sale and agreed that the amount of P40,000.00 she earlier paid shall be considered as down payment.&nbsp; Irene claimed that she made several payments amounting to P293,000.00 which prompted Eugenia's daughters Corazon Calacat (Corazon) and Sylvia Primero (Sylvia) to ask Engr. Antonio Ravacio (Engr. Ravacio) to conduct a segregation survey on the subject property. Thereafter, Irene requested Eugenia to execute the deed of sale, but the latter refused to do so because her son, Arty. Alfredo Primero, Jr. (Atty. Primero), would not agree.<br><br>On March 22, 1999, herein respondents filed with the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> a "Notice of Death of the Defendant"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> manifesting that Eugenia passed away on February 28, 1999 and that the decedent's surviving legal heirs agreed to appoint their co-heir Atty. Primero, to act as their representative in said case, In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated April 8, 1999, the trial court substituted the deceased defendant with Atty. Primero.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, presented the testimony of Atty. Primero to establish that Eugenia could not have sold the disputed portion of Lot No. 263 to the petitioners.&nbsp; According to Atty. Primero, at the time of the signing of the Agreement on January 13, 1985, Eugenia's husband, Alfredo, was already dead.&nbsp; Eugenia merely managed or administered the subject property and had no authority to dispose of the same since it was a conjugal property.&nbsp; In addition, respondents asserted that the deposit of P40,000.00 was retained as rental for the subject property.<br>&nbsp;<br>Respondents likewise presented Sylvia, who testified that"the receipts issued to petitioners were for the lot rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Another sister of Atty. Primero, Corazon, testified that petitioners were their tenants in subject land, which she co-owns with her mother Eugenia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She denied having sold the purported 293-square meter portion of Lot No. 263 to the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> &nbsp;<br><br>As rebuttal witness, petitioners presented Engr. Ravacio, a surveyor who undertook the segregation of the 293-square meter portion out of fee subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On October 22, 2001, the RTC rendered a Decision:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (1) dismissing the complaint and the counterclaim for lack of legal and factual bases; (2) ordering petitioners to pay respondents P2,500.00 representing rentals due, applying therefrom the amount deposited and paid; and (3) ordering petitioner to pay 12% legal interest from finality of decision until full payment of the amount due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed the Decision of the trial court to the CA.<br><b><i><br>Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Both parties filed their respective briefs before the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thereafter, on November 28, 2003, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> affirming the RTC Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;Petitioners timely filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> However, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated June 27, 2004, the CA resolved to deny the same for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b><center>Issues<br></center></b><br>Petitioners thus filed this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> anchored on the following grounds.<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>WHETHER AN ORAL CONTRACT OF SALE OF A PORTION OF [A] LOT IS BINDING [UPON] THE SELLER.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER A SELLER IN AN ORAL CONTRACT OF SALE OF A PORTION OF [A] LOT CAN BE COMPELLED TO EXECUTE THE REQUIRED&nbsp; DEED OF SALE AFTER THE AGREED CONSIDERATION WAS PAID AND POSSESSION THEREOF DELIVERED TO AND ENJOYED BY THE BUYER.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE BUYER HAS A RIGHT TO ENFORCE AN ORAL CONTRACT OF SALE AFTER THE PORTION SOLD IS SEGREGATED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE SELLER IS BOUND BY THE HANDWRITTEN RECEIPTS PREPARED AND SIGNED BY HER EXPRESSLY INDICATING PAYMENTS OF LOTS.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT COULD RENDER A JUDGMENT ON ISSUES NOT DEFINED IN THE PRE-TRIAL ORDER.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>The Agreement dated January 13, 1985 <br>is a contract to sell. Hence, with<br>petitioners' non-compliance with its <br>terms and conditions, the obligation of <br>the respondents to deliver and execute <br>the corresponding deed of sale never <br>arose.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The CA found that the Agreement dated January 13, 1985 is not a contract of sale but a mere contract to sell, the efficacy of which is dependent upon the <i>resolutory</i> condition that Irene pay at least 50% of the purchase price as down payment within 30-45 days&nbsp; from&nbsp; the day Eugenia received the P40,000.00 deposit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Said court further found that such condition was admittedly not met.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioners admit that the Agreement dated January 13, 1985 is at most, "a preliminary agreement for an eventual contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; However, they argue that contrary to the findings of the appellate court, it was not only the buyer, Irene, who failed to meet the condition of paying the balance of the 50% down payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> They assert that the Agreement explicitly required Eugenia to return the deposit of P40,000.00 within 10 days, in case Irene tailed to pay the balance of the 50% down payment within the stipulated period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, petitioners posit that for the cancellation clause to operate, two conditions must concur, namely, (1) buyer fails to pay the balance of the 50% down payment within the agreed period and (2) seller should return the deposit of P40,000.00 within 10 days if the first condition was not complied with. Petitioners conclude that since both seller and buyer failed to discharge their reciprocal obligations, being in <i>pari delictu</i>, the seller could not repudiate their agreement to sell.<br><br>The petitioners' contention is without merit.<br><br>There is no dispute as to the due execution and existence of the Agreement. The issue thus presented is whether the said Agreement is a contract of sale or a contract to sell.

Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>we distinguished a contract of sale from a contract to sell in that in a contract of sale the title to the property passes to the buyer upon the delivery of the tiling sold; in a <i>contract to sell</i>, ownership is agreement, reserved in the seller and is not to pass to the buyer until full payment of the purchase price<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>. Otherwise stated, in a contract of sale, the-seller loses ownership over the property and cannot: recover it until and unless the contract is resolved or rescinded; whereas, in a contract to sell, title is retained by the seller until full payment of the price.26 In the latter contract, payment of the price is a positive suspensive condition, failure of which is not a breach but an event that prevents the obligation of the vendor to convey title from becoming effective.'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the Agreement, Eugenia, as owner, did not convey her title to the disputed property to Irene since the Agreement was made for the purpose of negotiating the sale of the 860-square meter property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On this basis, we are more inclined to characterize the agreement as a contract to sell rather than a contract of sale. Although not by itself controlling, the absence of a provision in the Agreement transferring title from the owner to the buyer is taken as a strong indication that the Agreement is a contract to sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In a contract to sell, the prospective seller explicitly reserves the transfer of title to the prospective buyer, meaning, the prospective seller does not as yet agree or consent to transfer ownership of the property subject of the contract to sell until the happening of an event, which for present purposes we shall take as the full payment of the purchase price,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> What the seller agrees or obliges himself to do is to fulfill his promise to sell the subject property when the entire amount of the purchase price is delivered to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In other words, the full payment of the purchase price partakes of a suspensive condition, the non-fulfillment of which prevents the obligation to sell from arising and thus, ownership is retained by the prospective seller without further remedies by the prospective buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> A contract to sell is commonly entered into in order to protect the seller against a buyer who intends to buy the property in installment by withholding ownership over the property until the buyer effects Ml payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>In this case, the Agreement expressly provided that it was "entered into for the purpose of negotiating the sale of the above referred property between the same parties herein x x x." The term of the negotiation shall be for a-period of 30-45 days from receipt of the P40,000.00 deposit and the buyer has to pay the balance of the 50% down payment amounting to P410,000.00 within the said period of negotiation. Thereafter, an Agreement to Sell shall be executed by the parties and the remainder of the purchase price amounting to another P410,000.00 shall be paid in 10 equal monthly installments from receipt of the down payment. The assumption of both parties that the purpose of the Agreement was for negotiating the sale of Lot No. 263, in its entirety, for a definite price, with a specific period for payment of a specified down payment, and the execution of a subsequent contract for the sale of (he same on installment payments leads to no other conclusion than that the predecessor-in-interest of the herein respondents and the herein petitioner Irene entered into a contract to sell.<br><br>As stated in the Agreement, the payment of the purchase price, in installments within the period stipulated, constituted a <i>positive suspensive condition</i>, the failure of which is not really a breach but an event that prevents the obligation of the seller to convey title in accordance with Article 1184 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Hence, for petitioners' failure to comply with the terms and conditions laid down in the Agreement, the obligation of the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents to deliver and execute the corresponding deed of sale never arose.<br><br>The fact that the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents failed to return the P40,000.00 deposit subsequent to the expiration of the period of negotiation did not prevent the respondents from repudiating the Agreement. The obligation of the respondent to convey the property never came to pass as the petitioners did not comply with the positive suspensive condition of full payment of the purchase price within the period as stipulated.<br><br><i>The alleged oral contract of sale for the <br>293-square meter portion of the properly <br>was not proved by preponderant evidence. <br>Hence, petitioners cannot<br>compel the successors-in-interest of the <br>deceased Eugenia to execute a deed of<br>absolute sale in their favor.</i><br><br>Petitioners alleged in their Complaint that in 1992, Eugenia refused to accept further payments and suggested that she will convey to petitioners 293 square meters of her 860-square meter property, in proportion to payments already made. Thus, Eugenia caused the segregation of the area where the petitioners' building now stands, consisting of 293 square meters.<br><br>In support of their contention, petitioners presented the testimony of Irene, who testified that Eugenia segregated for them an area of 293 square meters for the agreed price of P1,000.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The total purchase price allegedly agreed upon by the parties, amounting to P293,000.00, corresponded to the amount of payments already made by Irene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> They likewise presented (1) 82 receipts covering the period October 13, 1986 to July 10, 1994;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (2) the testimony of the surveyor, Engr. Ravacio, to show that the segregation survey of the 293-square meter portion of the property was made with the knowledge and consent of Eugenia; and (3) the resulting subdivision plan.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents counter that the alleged contract of sale is contradicted by petitioners' own evidence. <br><br>We cannot sustain the contention of the petitioners. The primal issue to be resolved is whether the parties subsequently entered into a contract of sale over the segregated 293-square meter portion of Lot No. 263. It is a fundamental principle that for a contract of sale to be valid, the following elements must be present: (a) consent or meeting of the minds; (b) determinate subject matter; and (3) price certain in money or its equivalent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Until the contract of sale is perfected, it cannot, as an independent source of obligation, serve as a binding juridical relation between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioners' allegations that the 82 receipts indicated that they were issued "for payment of lot (at Sabayie)",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a cursory examination thereof shows that the receipts from 1986 to 1992 do not consistently indicate "Sabayle Lot" or "Sabayle Lot Deposit". More than half of the receipts presented merely indicated receipt of differing sums of money from the petitioners.&nbsp; In addition, the receipts for the years 1993 to 1994 do not establish installment payments for the purchase of the disputed portion of Lot No. 263. Rather, the receipts indicate that the same were issued as proof of "cash advance",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> "cash for groceries, electric bill, water bill, telephone/long distance",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> "cash",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43 ]</sup>"cash for mktg"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and "x x x cash to be paid a month after".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>These are not consistent with the allegation of the petitioners that they have paid the dill amount of the purchase price for the 293-square meter portion of the lot by 1992.<br><br>Moreover, the testimony of petitioners' witness, surveyor Engr. Ravacio, shows that Eugenia was neither around when the survey was conducted nor gave her express consent to the conduct of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>On the other hand, respondents' witness, Sylvia, testified that the receipts issued to the petitioners were for the lot rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>In addition, respondents' third witness, Corazon, testified that petitioners were their tenants in subject land, which she co-owns with her mother Eugenia, and disclaimed any sale of any portion of their lot to the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>Thirdly, since the surveyor himself, Engr. Ravacio, admitted that Eugenia did not give her express consent to the conduct of the segregation plan, the resulting subdivision plan, submitted by the petitioners to the trial court to prove that Eugenia caused the segregation of the 293-square meter area, cannot be appreciated.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides that in civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence.&nbsp; However, the evidence presented by the petitioners, as considered above, fails to convince this Court that Eugenia gave her consent to the purported oral deed of sale for the 293-square meter portion of her property. We are hence in agreement with the finding of the CA that there was no contract of sale between the parties.&nbsp; As a consequence, petitioners cannot rightfully compel the successors-in-interest of Eugenia to execute a deed of absolute sale in their favor.<br><br><i>The courts below correctly modified the<br>rental award to P2,500.00 per month,</i><br><br>Lastly, petitioners argue that the courts below erred in imposing a P2,500.00 monthly rental from 1985 onwards, since said amount is far greater than the last agreed monthly rental (December 1984) of P500.00.<br><br>In its Decision, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC "that the trial court had authority to fix a reasonable value for the continued use and occupancy of the leased premises after the termination of the lease contract, and that it was not bound by the stipulated rental in the contract of lease since it is equally settled that upon termination or expiration of the contract of lease, the rental stipulated therein may no longer be the reasonable value for the use and occupation of the premises as a result of the change or rise in values.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial court can take judicial notice of the general increase in rentals of real estate especially of business establishments".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The appellate court likewise held that the petitioners failed to discharge their burden to show that the said&nbsp; price was exorbitant&nbsp; or unconscionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Hence, the CA found no reason to disturb the trial court's decision ordering the petitioners to pay P2,500.00 as monthly rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court further held that "to deprive Eugenia of the rentals due her as the owner-lessor of the subject property would result to unjust enrichment on the part of Irene."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>The courts below correctly took judicial notice of the nature of the leased property subject of the case at bench based on its location and commercial viability. As described in the Agreement, the property is immediately in front of St. Peter's College.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> More significantly, it is stated in the Declaration of Real Property submitted by the petitioners as evidence in the trial court, that the property is used predominantly for commercial purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The assessment by the trial court of the area where the property is located is therefore fairly grounded.<br><br>Furthermore, the trial court also had factual basis in arriving at the said conclusion, the same being based on the un-rebutted testimony of a witness who is a real estate broker. With respect to the prevailing valuation of the property in litigation, witness Atty. Primero, a licensed real estate broker testified that:<br><br><blockquote>xxx There is no fixed pricing for each year because it always depends on the environment so that if the price in 1986, as you were referring to 1986, it would have risen or increased from P1,000.00, then it would increase to P3,000.00, then it would increase to P7,000.00 and again increase to P15,000.00 and right now the current price of property in that area is P25,000.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The RTC rightly modified the rental award to P2,500.00 per month, considering that it is settled jurisprudence that courts may take judicial notice of the general increase in rentals, particularly in business establishments.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
