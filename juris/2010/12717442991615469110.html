				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this original petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> petitioner Chamber of Real Estate and Builders' Associations, Inc. is questioning the constitutionality of Section 27 (E) of Republic Act (RA) 8424<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the revenue regulations (RRs) issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to implement said provision and those involving creditable withholding taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Petitioner is an association of real estate developers and builders in the Philippines.  It impleaded former Executive Secretary Alberto Romulo, then acting Secretary of Finance Juanita D. Amatong and then Commissioner of Internal Revenue Guillermo Parayno, Jr. as respondents.<br><br>Petitioner assails the validity of the imposition of minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) on corporations and creditable withholding tax (CWT) on sales of real properties classified as ordinary assets.<br><br>Section 27(E) of RA 8424 provides for MCIT on domestic corporations and is implemented by RR 9-98.  Petitioner argues that the MCIT violates the due process clause because it levies income tax even if there is no realized gain.<br><br>Petitioner also seeks to nullify Sections 2.57.2(J) (as amended by RR 6-2001) and 2.58.2 of RR 2-98, and Section 4(a)(ii) and (c)(ii) of RR 7-2003, all of which prescribe the rules and procedures for the collection of CWT on the sale of real properties categorized as ordinary assets. Petitioner contends that these revenue regulations are contrary to law for two reasons: <i>first</i>, they ignore the different treatment by RA 8424 of ordinary assets and capital assets and <i>second</i>, respondent Secretary of Finance has no authority to collect CWT, much less, to base the CWT on the gross selling price or fair market value of the real properties classified as ordinary assets.<br><br>Petitioner also asserts that the enumerated provisions of the subject revenue regulations violate the due process clause because, like the MCIT, the government collects income tax even when the net income has not yet been determined. They contravene the equal protection clause as well because the CWT is being levied upon real estate enterprises but not on other business enterprises, more particularly those in the manufacturing sector.<br><br>The issues to be resolved are as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">whether or not this Court should take cognizance of the present case;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td> <div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">whether or not the imposition of the MCIT on domestic corporations is unconstitutional and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td> <div style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">whether or not the imposition of CWT on income from sales of real properties classified as ordinary assets under RRs 2-98, 6-2001 and 7-2003, is unconstitutional.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><b><br>OVERVIEW OF THE ASSAILED PROVISIONS<br><br></b><br>Under the MCIT scheme, a corporation, beginning on its fourth year of operation, is assessed an MCIT of 2% of its gross income when such MCIT is greater than the normal corporate income tax imposed under Section 27(A).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> If the regular income tax is higher than the MCIT, the corporation does not pay the MCIT.

According to them, there is no actual case calling for the exercise of judicial power and it is not yet ripe for adjudication because<br><br><blockquote>[petitioner] did not allege that CREBA, as a corporate entity, or any of its members, has been assessed by the BIR for the payment of [MCIT] or [CWT] on sales of real property.  Neither did petitioner allege that its members have shut down their businesses as a result of the payment of the MCIT or CWT.  Petitioner has raised concerns in mere abstract and hypothetical form without any actual, specific and concrete instances cited that the assailed law and revenue regulations have actually and adversely affected it.  Lacking empirical data on which to base any conclusion, any discussion on the constitutionality of the MCIT or CWT on sales of real property is essentially an academic exercise.<br><br>Perceived or alleged hardship to taxpayers alone is not an adequate justification for adjudicating abstract issues. Otherwise, adjudication would be no different from the giving of advisory opinion that does not really settle legal issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>An actual case or controversy involves a conflict of legal rights or an assertion of opposite legal claims which is susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  On the other hand, a question is considered ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Contrary to respondents' assertion, we do not have to wait until petitioner's members have shut down their operations as a result of the MCIT or CWT.  The assailed provisions are already being implemented.  As we stated in <i>Didipio Earth-Savers' Multi-Purpose Association, Incorporated (DESAMA) v. Gozun</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><blockquote>By the mere enactment of the questioned law or the approval of the challenged act, the dispute is said to have ripened into a judicial controversy even without any other overt act. Indeed, even a singular violation of the Constitution and/or the law is enough to awaken judicial duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>If the assailed provisions are indeed unconstitutional, there is no better time than the present to settle such question once and for all.<br><br>Respondents next argue that petitioner has no legal standing to sue:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner is an association of some of the real estate developers and builders in the Philippines.  Petitioners did not allege that [it] itself is in the real estate business.  It did not allege any material interest or any wrong that it may suffer from the enforcement of [the assailed provisions].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Legal standing or <i>locus standi</i> is a party's personal and substantial interest in a case such that it has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act being challenged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  In <i>Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc. v.

There is no dispute that the individual members of petitioner association are residents of the NGC. As such they are covered and stand to be either benefited or injured by the enforcement of the IRR, particularly as regards the selection process of beneficiaries and lot allocation to qualified beneficiaries. Thus, petitioner association may assail those provisions in the IRR which it believes to be unfavorable to the rights of its members. xxx Certainly, petitioner and its members have sustained direct injury arising from the enforcement of the IRR in that they have been disqualified and eliminated from the selection process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>In any event, this Court has the discretion to take cognizance of a suit which does not satisfy the requirements of an actual case, ripeness or legal standing when paramount public interest is involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  The questioned MCIT and CWT affect not only petitioners but practically all domestic corporate taxpayers in our country. The transcendental importance of the issues raised and their overreaching significance to society make it proper for us to take cognizance of this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b>Concept and Rationale of the MCIT</b><br><br>The MCIT on domestic corporations is a new concept introduced by RA 8424 to the Philippine taxation system.  It came about as a result of the perceived inadequacy of the self-assessment system in capturing the true income of corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It was devised as a relatively simple and effective revenue-raising instrument compared to the normal income tax which is more difficult to control and enforce.  It is a means to ensure that everyone will make some minimum contribution to the support of the public sector. The congressional deliberations on this are illuminating:<br><br><blockquote>Senator Enrile.  Mr. President, we are not unmindful of the practice of certain corporations of reporting constantly a loss in their operations to avoid the payment of taxes, and thus avoid sharing in the cost of government.  In this regard, the Tax Reform Act introduces for the first time a new concept called the [MCIT] so as to minimize tax evasion, tax avoidance, tax manipulation in the country and for administrative convenience.  ... This will go a long way in ensuring that corporations will pay their just share in supporting our public life and our economic advancement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Domestic corporations owe their corporate existence and their privilege to do business to the government. They also benefit from the efforts of the government to improve the financial market and to ensure a favorable business climate. It is therefore fair for the government to require them to make a reasonable contribution to the public expenses.<br><br>Congress intended to put a stop to the practice of corporations which, while having large turn-overs, report minimal or negative net income resulting in minimal or zero income taxes year in and year out, through under-declaration of income or over-deduction of expenses otherwise called tax shelters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Mr. Javier (E.) ... [This] is what the Finance Dept. is trying to remedy, that is why they have proposed the [MCIT].  Because from experience too, you have corporations which have been losing year in and year out and paid no tax.  So, if the corporation has been losing for the past five years to ten years, then that corporation has no business to be in business.  It is dead.  Why continue if you are losing year in and year out? So, we have this provision to avoid this type of tax shelters, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>The primary purpose of any legitimate business is to earn a profit.  Continued and repeated losses after operations of a corporation or consistent reports of minimal net income render its financial statements and its tax payments suspect.  For sure, certain tax avoidance schemes resorted to by corporations are allowed in our jurisdiction.  The MCIT serves to put a cap on such tax shelters.  As a tax on gross income, it prevents tax evasion and minimizes tax avoidance schemes achieved through sophisticated and artful manipulations of deductions and other stratagems.  Since the tax base was broader, the tax rate was lowered.<br><br>To further emphasize the corrective nature of the MCIT, the following safeguards were incorporated into the law:<br><br>First, recognizing the birth pangs of businesses and the reality of the need to recoup initial major capital expenditures, the imposition of the MCIT commences only on the fourth taxable year immediately following the year in which the corporation commenced its operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  This grace period allows a new business to stabilize first and make its ventures viable before it is subjected to the MCIT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Second, the law allows the carrying forward of any excess of the MCIT paid over the normal income tax which shall be credited against the normal income tax for the three immediately succeeding years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Third, since certain businesses may be incurring genuine repeated losses, the law authorizes the Secretary of Finance to suspend the imposition of MCIT if a corporation suffers losses due to prolonged labor dispute, <i>force majeure</i> and legitimate business reverses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Even before the legislature introduced the MCIT to the Philippine taxation system, several other countries already had their own system of minimum corporate income taxation.  Our lawmakers noted that most developing countries, particularly Latin American and Asian countries, have the same form of safeguards as we do.  As pointed out during the committee hearings:<br><br><blockquote>[Mr. Medalla:] Note that most developing countries where you have of course quite a bit of room for underdeclaration of gross receipts have this same form of safeguards.<br><br>In the case of Thailand, half a percent (0.5%), there's a minimum of income tax of half a percent (0.5%) of gross assessable income.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This line of reasoning is <i>non sequitur</i>.<br><br>Section 57(A) expressly states that final tax can be imposed on certain kinds of income and enumerates these as passive income. The BIR defines passive income by stating what it is not:<br><br><blockquote>...if the income is generated in the active pursuit and performance of the corporation's primary purposes, the same is not passive income...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote><br>It is income generated by the taxpayer's assets. These assets can be in the form of real properties that return rental income, shares of stock in a corporation that earn dividends or interest income received from savings.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 57(B) provides that the Secretary can require a CWT on "income payable to natural or juridical persons, residing in the Philippines."  There is no requirement that this income be passive income.  If that were the intent of Congress, it could have easily said so.<br><br>Indeed, Section 57(A) and (B) are distinct.  Section 57(A) refers to FWT while Section 57(B) pertains to CWT.  The former covers the kinds of passive income enumerated therein and the latter encompasses <i>any income other than those listed in 57(A).</i> Since the law itself makes distinctions, it is wrong to regard 57(A) and 57(B) in the same way.<br><br>To repeat, the assailed provisions of RR 2-98, as amended, do not modify or deviate from the text of Section 57(B).  RR 2-98 merely implements the law by specifying what income is subject to CWT. It has been held that, where a statute does not require any particular procedure to be followed by an administrative agency, the agency may adopt any reasonable method to carry out its functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  Similarly, considering that the law uses the general term "income," the Secretary and CIR may specify the kinds of income the rules will apply to based on what is feasible.

As a result, the government is collecting tax from net income not yet gained or earned.<br><br>Again, it is stressed that the CWT is creditable against the tax due from the seller of the property at the end of the taxable year. The seller will be able to claim a tax refund if its net income is less than the taxes withheld.

Sales on installment are taxed on a per-installment basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Petitioner's desire to utilize for its operational and capital expenses money earmarked for the payment of taxes may be a practical business option but it is not a fundamental right which can be demanded from the court or from the government.<br><br><b>NO VIOLATION OF<br> EQUAL PROTECTION</b><br><br>Petitioner claims that the revenue regulations are violative of the equal protection clause because the CWT is being levied only on real estate enterprises.  Specifically, petitioner points out that manufacturing enterprises are not similarly imposed a CWT on their sales, even if their manner of doing business is not much different from that of a real estate enterprise.  Like a manufacturing concern, a real estate business is involved in a continuous process of production and it incurs costs and expenditures on a regular basis.  The only difference is that "goods" produced by the real estate business are house and lot units.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Again, we disagree.<br><br>The equal protection clause under the Constitution means that "no person or class of persons shall be deprived of the same protection of laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and in like circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>  Stated differently, all persons belonging to the same class shall be taxed alike.  It follows that the guaranty of the equal protection of the laws is not violated by legislation based on a reasonable classification.  Classification, to be valid, must (1) rest on substantial distinctions; (2) be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) not be limited to existing conditions only and (4) apply equally to all members of the same class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>The taxing power has the authority to make reasonable classifications for purposes of taxation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>  Inequalities which result from a singling out of one particular class for taxation, or exemption, infringe no constitutional limitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>  The real estate industry is, by itself, a class and can be validly treated differently from other business enterprises.<br><br>Petitioner, in insisting that its industry should be treated similarly as manufacturing enterprises, fails to realize that what distinguishes the real estate business from other manufacturing enterprises, for purposes of the imposition of the CWT, is not their production processes but the prices of their goods sold and the number of transactions involved. The income from the sale of a real property is bigger and its frequency of transaction limited, making it less cumbersome for the parties to comply with the withholding tax scheme.<br><br>On the other hand, each manufacturing enterprise may have tens of thousands of transactions with several thousand customers every month involving both minimal and substantial amounts. To require the customers of manufacturing enterprises, at present, to withhold the taxes on each of their transactions with their tens or hundreds of suppliers may result in an inefficient and unmanageable system of taxation and may well defeat the purpose of the withholding tax system.<br><br>Petitioner counters that there are other businesses wherein expensive items are also sold infrequently, <i>e.g.</i> heavy equipment, jewelry, furniture, appliance and other capital goods yet these are not similarly subjected to the CWT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>  As already discussed, the Secretary may adopt any reasonable method to carry out its functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>  Under Section 57(B), it may choose what to subject to CWT.<br><br>A reading of Section 2.57.2 (M) of RR 2-98 will also show that petitioner's argument is not accurate.  The sales of manufacturers who have clients within the top 5,000 corporations, as specified by the BIR, are also subject to CWT for their transactions with said 5,000 corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br><b>SECTION 2.58.2 OF RR NO. 2-98<br> MERELY IMPLEMENTS SECTION 58 <br>OF RA 8424</b><br><br>Lastly, petitioner assails Section 2.58.2 of RR 2-98, which provides that the Registry of Deeds should not effect the regisration of any document transferring real property unless a certification is issued by the CIR that the withholding tax has been paid.  Petitioner proffers hardly any reason to strike down this rule except to rely on its contention that the CWT is unconstitutional.  We have ruled that it is not.  Furthermore, this provision uses almost exactly the same wording as Section 58(E) of RA 8424 and is unquestionably in accordance with it:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 58.  <i>Returns and Payment of Taxes Withheld at Source</i>. -<br><br>(E) <i>Registration with Register of Deeds</i>. -  <b>No registration of any document transferring real property shall be effected by the Register of Deeds unless the [CIR] or his duly authorized representative has certified that such transfer has been reported, and the capital gains or [CWT], if any, has been paid</b>:  xxxx any violation of this provision by the Register of Deeds shall be subject to the penalties imposed under Section 269 of this Code. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>CONCLUSION</b><br><br>The renowned genius Albert Einstein was once quoted as saying "[the] hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>  When a party questions the constitutionality of an income tax measure, it has to contend not only with Einstein's observation but also with the vast and well-established jurisprudence in support of the plenary powers of Congress to impose taxes. Petitioner has miserably failed to discharge its burden of convincing the Court that the imposition of MCIT and CWT is unconstitutional.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Carpio, Carpio Morales, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Perez</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In particular, these are Section 2.27 (E), Section 2.57.2 (J) (as amended by RR 6-2001) and Section 2.58.2 of RR 2-98 and Section 4 (a) (ii) and (c) (ii) of RR-7-2003.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Applying the 32% tax rate to net income.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Implementing [RA 8424], "An Act Amending the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended" Relative to the Imposition of the [MCIT] on Domestic Corporations and Resident Foreign Corporations.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Implementing [RA 8424] relative to the Withholding on Income subject to the Expanded Withholding Tax and Final Withholding Tax, Withholding of Income Tax on Compensation, Withholding of Creditable Value-Added Tax and Other Percentage Taxes.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This Certificate is commonly known as the "CAR" or the "certificate authorizing registration."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Providing the Guidelines in Determining Whether a Particular Real Property Is a Capital Asset or an Ordinary Asset Pursuant to Section 39(A)(1) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 for Purposes of Imposing the Capital Gains Tax under Sections 24(D), 25(A)(3), 25(B) and 27(D)(5), or the Ordinary Income Tax under Sections 24(A), 25(A) &amp; (B), 27(A), 28(A)(1) and 28(B)(1), or the [MCIT] under Sections 27(E) and 28(A)(2) of the same Code.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  <i>Jumamil v.
