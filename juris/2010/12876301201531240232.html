A joint task force appointed PO3 Lagasca as team leader, "MADAC Operative" Mergal as poseur-buyer, and "MADAC Operative" Lumawag as back-up arresting officer.

They proceeded to South Avenue and stopped at the Makati Public Safety Authority (<em>MAPSA</em>) Office where one of the men alighted from the vehicle, went inside the office, and returned with a plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> which he said was what they had bought from her.<br><br>She was thereafter brought to the DEU where she was questioned in the course of which an investigator produced a One Hundred Peso bill and the man who was interrogating her wrote something thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of May 12, 2006, Branch 64 of the Makati City RTC convicted appellant, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is rendered finding the accused JENNEFER CARIN y DONOGA, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge for violation of Section 5, Art. II, RA 9165, and sentencing her to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>The period during which the accused is detained shall be considered in her favor pursuant to existing rules.<br><br>The Branch Clerk of Court is directed to transmit to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) the one piece of plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> weighing 0.02 gram subject matter of this case for said agency's appropriate disposition.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>In convicting appellant, the trial court relied on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions of the police officers and discredited appellant's defense of frame-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals <i>affirmed </i>appellant's conviction by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of June 27, 2008. Hence, the present appeal.<br><br>Both parties in their manifestations before this Court adopted their respective Briefs filed before the appellate court in lieu of Supplemental Briefs.<br><br>In her Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> appellant, contending that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, raises, among other things, the operatives' failure to observe proper procedure in the conduct of the operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that, indeed, the prosecution failed to show that the police complied with Section 21, paragraph (1) of Article II of R.A. 9165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and with the chain of custody requirement under the Act.&nbsp; Thus, PO3 Lagasca admitted on cross-examination:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">ATTY REGALA:<br><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, Mr. Witness, as team leader, you would know for a fact that in [an] operation like this, photographs are supposed to be taken in the presence of the suspect. <b>Do you have any photograph, Mr. Witness, to show to the Court that you indeed abide[d] with the rule in conducting a narcotics operation?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>None, sir.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>In a prosecution for illegal sale of a prohibited drug, the prosecution must prove the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. All these require evidence that the sale transaction transpired, coupled with the presentation in court of the body or substance of the crime that establishes that a crime has actually been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Failure to comply with Section 21, paragraph (1) of Article II of RA No. 9165 and its implementing rules results, in certain cases such as in the present one, in failure to establish the existence of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The nature of illegal drugs â”€ "indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise" â”€ requires that strict compliance with the proper procedure is enjoined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In the present case, the buy-bust team failed to follow the mandatory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> procedure.<br><br>In another vein, even the version of prosecution witness PO3 Lagasca does not jibe with prosecution witness Mergal's.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PO3 LAGASCA:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">You also testified, Mr. Witness, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">when the transaction was ongoing, you saw the accused entered her house?</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When she returned, she allegedly handed the shabu to your poseur buyer.

No. 9165 are not necessarily fatal to the prosecution's case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> justifiable grounds therefor must thus be proffered and proven and cannot just be merely presumed to exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, the prosecution&nbsp; was glaringly silent on its procedural lapses.<br><br>Nagging doubt on the identity and integrity of the subject specimen is also mirrored in the testimony of PO3 Lagasca.&nbsp; He claimed that PO1 Alex Inopia made a request for drug test and for laboratory examination, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROSECUTOR BAGAOISAN:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">After the arrest of the accused, what happened next, Mr. Witness?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PO3 LAGASCA:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>We</b> brought the suspect together with the confiscated item to the office of AIDSOTF, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened at the office of AIDSOTF?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The accused was investigated, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened, Mr. Witness after the investigation was conducted?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>PO1 Alex Inopia</b> made a request for drug test and a request for laboratory examination, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened after the preparation of those requests you mentioned?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">We </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">brought the accused together with the item confiscated to the SPD Crime Laboratory, sir</span>.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened after you brought the item and the accused at (sic) the PNP Crime laboratory?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We filed a case against the accused the following day, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The letter-request for Laboratory Examination was, however, made not by PO1 Inopia but by the Chief of Drug Enforcement Unit SPO4 Arsenio A.
