				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioner Phimco Industries, Inc. (<i>PHIMCO</i>), seeking to reverse and set aside the decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated February 10, 2004, and the resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated December 12, 2005, of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. SP No. 70336. The assailed CA decision dismissed PHIMCO's petition for <i>certiorari </i>that challenged the resolution, dated December 29, 1998, and the decision, dated February 20, 2002, of the National Labor Relations Commission (<i>NLRC</i>); the assailed CA resolution denied PHIMCO's subsequent motion for reconsideration.<br><br><center><u><b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b></u><br></center><br>The facts of the case, gathered from the records, are briefly summarized below.<br><br>PHIMCO is a corporation engaged in the production of matches, with principal address at Phimco Compound, Felix Manalo St., Sta. Ana, Manila. Respondent Phimco Industries Labor Association (<i>PILA</i>) is the duly authorized bargaining representative of PHIMCO's daily-paid workers. The 47 individually named respondents are PILA officers and members.<br><br>When the last collective bargaining agreement was about to expire on December 31, 1994, PHIMCO and PILA negotiated for its renewal. The negotiation resulted in a deadlock on economic issues, mainly due to disagreements on salary increases and benefits.<br><br>On March 9, 1995, PILA filed with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (<i>NCMB)</i> a Notice of Strike on the ground of the bargaining deadlock. Seven (7) days later, or on March 16, 1995, the union conducted a strike vote; a majority of the union members voted for a strike as its response to the bargaining impasse. On March 17, 1995, PILA filed the strike vote results with the NCMB. Thirty-five (35) days later, or on April 21, 1995, PILA staged a strike.<br><br>On May 3, 1995, PHIMCO filed with the NLRC a petition for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order (<i>TRO</i>), to enjoin the strikers from preventing - through force, intimidation and coercion - the ingress and egress of non-striking employees into and from the company premises. On May 15, 1995, the NLRC issued an <i>ex-parte</i> TRO, effective for a period of twenty (20) days, or until June 5, 1995.<br><br>On June 23, 1995, PHIMCO sent a letter to thirty-six (36) union members, directing them to explain within twenty-four (24) hours why they should not be dismissed for the illegal acts they committed during the strike. Three days later, or on June 26, 1995, the thirty-six (36) union members were informed of their dismissal.<br><br>On July 6, 1995, PILA filed a complaint for unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal (<i>illegal dismissal case</i>) with the NLRC. The case was docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 00-07-04705-95, and raffled to Labor Arbiter (<i>LA</i>) Pablo C. Espiritu, Jr.<br><br>On July 7, 1995, then Acting Labor Secretary Jose S. Brillantes assumed jurisdiction over the labor dispute, and ordered all the striking employees (except those who were handed termination papers on June 26, 1995) to return to work within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of the order. The Secretary ordered PHIMCO to accept the striking employees, under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to the strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On the same day, PILA ended its strike.<br><br>On August 28, 1995, PHIMCO filed a Petition to Declare the Strike Illegal (<i>illegal strike case</i>) with the NLRC, with a prayer for the dismissal of PILA officers and members who knowingly participated in the illegal strike. PHIMCO claimed that the strikers prevented ingress to and egress from the PHIMCO compound, thereby paralyzing PHIMCO's operations. The case was docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 00-08-06031-95, and raffled to LA Jovencio Ll. Mayor.<br><br>On March 14, 1996, the respondents filed their Position Paper in the illegal strike case. They countered that they complied with all the legal requirements for the staging of the strike, they put up no barricade, and conducted their strike peacefully, in an orderly and lawful manner, without incident.<br><br>LA Mayor decided the case on February 4, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and found the strike illegal; the respondents committed prohibited acts during the strike by blocking the ingress to and egress from PHIMCO's premises and preventing the non-striking employees from reporting for work. He observed that it was not enough that the picket of the strikers was a moving picket, since the strikers should allow the free passage to the entrance and exit points of the company premises. Thus, LA Mayor declared that the respondent employees, PILA officers and members, have lost their employment status.<br><br>On March 5, 1998, PILA and its officers and members appealed LA Mayor's decision to the NLRC.<br><br><center><u><b>THE NLRC RULING</b></u><br></center><br>The NLRC decided the appeal on December 29, 1998, and set aside LA Mayor's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The NLRC did not give weight to PHIMCO's evidence, and relied instead on the respondents' evidence showing that the union conducted a peaceful moving picket.<br><br>On January 28, 1999, PHIMCO filed a motion for reconsideration in the illegal strike case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In a parallel development, LA Espiritu decided the union's illegal dismissal case on March 2, 1999.&nbsp; He ruled the respondents' dismissal as illegal, and ordered their reinstatement with payment of backwages. PHIMCO appealed LA Espiritu's decision to the NLRC.<br><br>Pending the resolution of PHIMCO's motion for reconsideration in the illegal strike case and the appeal of the illegal dismissal case, PHIMCO moved for the consolidation of the two (2) cases. The NLRC acted favorably on the motion and consolidated the two (2) cases in its Order dated August 5, 1999.<br><br>On February 20, 2002, the NLRC rendered its Decision in the consolidated cases, ruling totally in the union's favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It dismissed the appeal of the illegal dismissal case, and denied PHIMCO's motion for reconsideration in the illegal strike case. The NLRC found that the picket conducted by the striking employees was not an illegal blockade and did not obstruct the points of entry to and exit from the company's premises; the pictures submitted by the respondents revealed that the picket was moving, not stationary. With respect to the illegal dismissal charge, the NLRC observed that the striking employees were not given ample opportunity to explain their side after receipt of the June 23, 1995 letter. Thus, the NLRC affirmed the Decision of LA Espiritu with respect to the payment of backwages until the promulgation of the decision, plus separation pay at one (1) month salary per year of service in lieu of reinstatement, and 10% of the monetary award as attorney's fees. It ruled out reinstatement because of the damages sustained by the company brought about by the strike.<br><br>On March 14, 2002, PHIMCO filed a motion for reconsideration of the consolidated decision.<br><br>On April 26, 2002, without waiting for the result of its motion for reconsideration, PHIMCO elevated its case to the CA through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><u><center><b>THE CA RULING</b><br></center></u><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> promulgated on February 10, 2004, the CA dismissed PHIMCO's petition for <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; The CA noted that the NLRC findings, that the picket was peaceful and that PHIMCO's evidence failed to show that the picket constituted an illegal blockade or that it obstructed the points of entry to and exit from the company premises, were supported by substantial evidence.<br><br>PHIMCO came to us through the present petition after the CA denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><sup> </sup>PHIMCO's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><u><center><b>THE PETITION</b><br></center></u><br>The petitioner argues that the strike was illegal because the respondents committed the prohibited acts under Article 264(e) of the Labor Code, such as blocking the ingress and egress of the company premises, threat, coercion, and intimidation, as established by the evidence on record.<br><br><u><center><b>THE CASE FOR THE RESPONDENTS</b><br></center></u><br>The respondents, on the other hand, submit that the issues raised in this case are factual in nature that we cannot generally touch in a petition for review, unless compelling reasons exist; the company has not shown any such compelling reason as the picket was peaceful and uneventful, and no human barricade blocked the company premises.<br><br><u><center><b>THE ISSUE</b><br></center></u><br>In <i>Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> we laid down the basic approach that should be followed in the review of CA decisions in labor cases, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case. In question form, the question to ask is: Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?<br></blockquote><br>In this light, the core issue in the present case is whether the CA correctly ruled that the NLRC did not act with grave abuse of discretion in ruling that the union's strike was legal.<br><br><center><u><b>OUR RULING</b></u><br></center><br><b><i>We find the petition partly meritorious.</i></b><br><b><i>Requisites of a valid strike</i></b><br><br>A strike is the most powerful weapon of workers in their struggle with management in the course of setting their terms and conditions of employment.&nbsp; Because it is premised on the concept of economic war between labor and management, it is a weapon that can either breathe life to or destroy the union and its members, and one that must also necessarily affect management and its members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In light of these effects, the decision to declare a strike must be exercised responsibly and must always rest on rational basis, free from emotionalism, and unswayed by the tempers and tantrums of hot heads; it must focus on legitimate union interests. To be legitimate, a strike should not be antithetical to public welfare, and must be pursued within legal bounds. The right to strike as a means of attaining social justice is never meant to oppress or destroy anyone, least of all, the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Since strikes affect not only the relationship between labor and management but also the general peace and progress of the community, the law has provided limitations on the right to strike. Procedurally, for a strike to be valid, it must comply with Article 263<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Labor Code, which requires that: (a) a notice of strike be filed with the Department of Labor and Employment (<i>DOLE</i>) 30 days before the intended date thereof, or 15 days in case of unfair labor practice; (b) a strike vote be approved by a majority of the total union membership in the bargaining unit concerned, obtained by secret ballot in a meeting called for that purpose; and (c) a notice be given to the DOLE of the results of the voting at least seven days before the intended strike.<br><br>These requirements are mandatory, and the union's failure to comply renders the strike illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The 15 to 30-day cooling-off period is designed to afford the parties the opportunity to amicably resolve the dispute with the assistance of the NCMB conciliator/mediator, while the seven-day strike ban is intended to give the DOLE an opportunity to verify whether the projected strike really carries the imprimatur of the majority of the union members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the respondents fully satisfied the legal procedural requirements; a strike notice was filed on March 9, 1995; a strike vote was reached on March 16, 1995; notification of the strike vote was filed with the DOLE on March 17, 1995; and the actual strike was launched only on April 25, 1995.<br><br><b><i>Strike may be illegal for commission of prohibited acts</i></b><br><br>Despite the validity of the purpose of a strike and compliance with the procedural requirements, a strike may still be held illegal where the <b><i>means employed</i></b> are illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The means become illegal when they come within the prohibitions under Article 264(e) of the Labor Code which provides:<br><br><blockquote>No person engaged in picketing shall commit any act of violence, coercion or intimidation or obstruct the free ingress to or egress from the employer's premises for lawful purposes, or obstruct public thoroughfares.<br></blockquote><br><b>Based on our examination of the evidence which the LA viewed differently from the NLRC and the CA, we find the PILA strike illegal.</b>&nbsp; We intervene and rule even on the evidentiary and factual issues of this case as both the NLRC and the CA grossly misread the evidence, leading them to inordinately incorrect conclusions, both factual and legal. While the strike undisputably had not been marred by actual violence and patent intimidation, the picketing that respondent PILA officers and members undertook as part of their strike activities effectively blocked the free ingress to and egress from PHIMCO's premises, thus preventing non-striking employees and company vehicles from entering the PHIMCO compound.&nbsp; In this manner, the picketers violated Article 264(e) of the Labor Code.<br><br><b><i>The Evidence</i></b><br><br>We gather from the case record the following pieces of relevant evidence adduced in the compulsory arbitration proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b><i>For the Company</i></b><br><br>1.

REYES: this incident on May 22, 1995, when a coaster or bus attempted to enter PHIMCO compound, you mentioned that it was refused entry. Why was this (sic) it refused entry?<br><br>WITNESS: Because at that time, there was a moving picket at the gate that is why the bus was not able to enter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x x<br><br>Q: Despite this TRO, which was issued by the NLRC, were you allowed entry by the strikers?<br><br>A: We made several attempts to enter the compound, I remember on May 7, 1995, we tried to enter the PHIMCO compound but we were not allowed entry.<br><br>Q: Aside from May 27, 1995, were there any other instances wherein you were not allowed entry at PHIMCO compound?<br><br>A: On May 29, I recall I was riding with our Production Manager with the Pick-up.

Contrary to the NLRC characterization that it was a "peaceful moving picket," it stood, in fact, as an obstruction to the company's points of ingress and egress.<br><br>Significantly, the testimonies adduced were validated by the photographs taken of the strike area, capturing the strike in its various stages and showing how the strikers actually conducted the picket.&nbsp; While the picket was moving, it was maintained <i>so close to the company gates</i> that it virtually constituted an obstruction, especially when the strikers joined hands, as described by Aguilar, or were moving in circles, hand-to-shoulder, as shown by the photographs, that, for all intents and purposes, blocked the free ingress to and egress from the company premises. In fact, on closer examination, it could be seen that <i>the respondents were conducting the picket right at the company gates</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The obstructive nature of the picket was aggravated by the <i>placement of benches</i>, with strikers standing on top, directly in front of the open wing of the company gates, <i>clearly obstructing the entry and exit points of the company compound</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>With a virtual human blockade and real physical obstructions (benches and makeshift structures both outside and inside the gates),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> it was pure conjecture on the part of the NLRC to say that "[t]he non-strikers and their vehicles were&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; free to get in and out of the company compound undisturbed by the picket line."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Notably, aside from non-strikers who wished to report for work, company vehicles likewise could not enter and get out of the factory because of the picket and the physical obstructions the respondents installed. The blockade went to the point of causing the build up of traffic in the immediate vicinity of the strike area, as shown by photographs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; This, by itself, renders the picket a prohibited activity. Pickets may not aggressively interfere with the right of peaceful ingress to and egress from the employer's shop or obstruct public thoroughfares; picketing is not peaceful where the sidewalk or entrance to a place of business is obstructed by picketers parading around in a circle or lying on the sidewalk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>What the records reveal belies the NLRC observation that "the evidence&nbsp; x&nbsp; x x&nbsp; tends to show that what respondents actually did was walking or patrolling to and fro within the company vicinity and by word of mouth, banner or placard, informing the public concerning the dispute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The "peaceful moving picket" that the NLRC noted, influenced apparently by the certifications (Mayor delos Reyes, Fr. Adeviso, Fr. Fausto and <i>Barangay</i> Secretary Gesmundo presented in evidence by the respondents, was "peaceful" only because of the absence of violence during the strike, but the obstruction of the entry and exit points of the company premises caused by the respondents' picket was by no means a "petty blocking act" or an "insignificant obstructive act."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>As we have stated, while the picket was moving,&nbsp; the movement was in circles, very close to the gates, with the strikers in a hand-to-shoulder formation without a break in their ranks, thus preventing non-striking workers and vehicles from coming in and getting out.&nbsp; Supported by actual blocking benches and obstructions, what the union demonstrated was a very persuasive and quietly intimidating strategy whose chief aim was to paralyze the operations of the company, not solely by the work stoppage of the participating workers, but by excluding the company officials and non-striking employees from access to and exit from the company premises.&nbsp; No doubt, the strike caused the company operations considerable damage, as the NLRC itself recognized when it ruled out the reinstatement of the dismissed strikers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><b><i>Intimidation</i></b><br><br>Article 264(e) of the Labor Code tells us that picketing carried on with violence, coercion or intimidation is unlawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> According to American jurisprudence, what constitutes unlawful intimidation depends on the totality of the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Force threatened is the equivalent of force exercised.

On balance, it supports the company's submission that the respondent PILA officers and members committed acts during the strike prohibited under Article 264(e) of the Labor Code.&nbsp; The testimonies of non-striking employees, who were prevented from gaining entry into the company premises, and confirmed no less by two officers of the union, are on record.<br><br>The photographs of the strike scene, also on record, depict the true character of the picket; while moving, it, in fact, constituted a human blockade, obstructing free ingress to and egress from the company premises, reinforced by benches planted directly in front of the company gates.&nbsp; The photographs do not lie - these photographs clearly show that the picketers were going in circles, without any break in their ranks or closely bunched together, right in front of the gates.&nbsp; Thus, company vehicles were unable to enter the company compound, and were backed up several meters into the street leading to the company gates.<br><br>Despite all these clear pieces of evidence of illegal obstruction, the NLRC looked the other way and chose not to see the unmistakable violations of the law on strikes by the union and its respondent officers and members.&nbsp; Needless to say, while the law protects the rights of the laborer, it authorizes neither the oppression nor the destruction of the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; For grossly ignoring the evidence before it, the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion; for supporting these gross NLRC errors, the CA committed its own reversible error.<br><br><b><i>Liabilities of union </i></b><br><br><b><i>officers and members</i></b><br><br>In the determination of the liabilities of the individual respondents, the applicable provision is Article 264(a) of the Labor Code:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 264. <i>Prohibited activities. -</i> (a)&nbsp; x x&nbsp; x<br><br>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br><br>Any union officer who knowingly participates in an illegal strike and any worker or union officer who knowingly participates in the commission of illegal acts during a strike may be declared to have lost his employment status: Provided, That mere participation of a worker in a lawful strike shall not constitute sufficient ground for termination of his employment, even if a replacement had been hired by the employer during such lawful strike.</blockquote><br><br>We explained in <i>Samahang Manggagawa sa Sulpicio Lines, Inc.-NAFLU v.
