1985, MONINA alleged that FRANCISCO had been married to a certain Lilia Lopez
Jison since 1940.  At the end of 1945 or
the start of 1946, however, FRANCISCO impregnated Esperanza F. Amolar (who was
then employed as the nanny of FRANCISCO's daughter, Lourdes).  As a result, MONINA was born on 6 August
1946, in Dingle, Iloilo, and since childhood, had enjoyed the continuous,
implied recognition as an illegitimate child of FRANCISCO by his acts and that
of his family.  MONINA further alleged
that FRANCISCO gave her support and spent for her education, such that she
obtained a Master's degree, became a certified public accountant (CPA) and
eventually, a Central Bank examiner.  In
view of FRANCISCO's refusal to expressly recognize her, MONINA prayed for a
judicial declaration of her illegitimate status and that FRANCISCO support and
treat her as such.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the complaint as she had ceased to be in his employ as early as 1944, and did
not know of her whereabouts since then;  further, he never recognized MONINA, expressly or impliedly, as his
illegitimate child.  As affirmative and
special defenses, FRANCISCO contended that MONINA had no right or cause of
action against him and that her action was barred by estoppel, laches and/or

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">At trial on the
merits, MONINA presented a total of eleven (11) witnesses, namely:  herself, Ruben Castellanes, Sr., Adela
Casabuena, Arsenio Duatin, Zafiro Ledesma, Danthea Lopez, Romeo Bilbao, Rudy
Tingson, Alfredo Baylosis, Dominador Zavariz and Lope Amolar.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Ruben Castellanes,
Sr., a 63-year old resident of Iloilo City, testified that he had worked for
FRANCISCO for a total of six (6) years at Nelly Garden, FRANCISCO's Iloilo
residence.  Towards the end of the
Japanese occupation, FRANCISCO’s wife suffered a miscarriage or abortion,
thereby depriving FRANCISCO of consortium;  thereafter, FRANCISCO’s wife managed a nightclub on the ground floor of
Nelly Garden which operated daily from 6:00 p.m. till 3:00 a.m. of the
following day, thereby allowing FRANCISCO free access to MONINA’s mother,
Esperanza Amolar, who was nicknamed <i>Pansay</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Adela Casabuena,
a 61-year old farmer, testified that she served as the <i>yaya</i> (“nanny”) of
Lourdes from July 1946 up to February 1947.  Although <i>Pansay</i> had left Nelly Garden two (2) weeks before Adela
started working for the Jisons, <i>Pansay</i> returned sometime in September
1946, or about one month after she gave birth to MONINA, to ask FRANCISCO for
support.  As a result, <i>Pansay</i> and
Lilia Jison, FRANCISCO's wife, quarreled in the living room, and in the course
thereof, <i>Pansay</i> claimed that FRANCISCO was the father of her baby.  To which, Lilia replied: “I did not tell you
to make that baby so it is your fault.”  During the quarrel which lasted from 10:30 till 11:00 a.m., FRANCISCO
was supposedly inside the house listening. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Arsenio Duatin,
a 77-year old retired laborer, testified that from 1947 until 1977, he worked
as FRANCISCO’s houseboy at the latter’s house on 12th Street, Capitol
Subdivision, Bacolod City.  Arsenio met
MONINA in 1967, when Felipe Lagarto, the bookkeeper at Nelly Garden, informed
Arsenio that MONINA, FRANCISCO’s daughter, would arrive at Bacolod City with a
letter of introduction from Lagarto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Initially,
Arsenio identified seven (7) black-and-white photographs (Exhs. X-5 to X-11) of
MONINA,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

bills, he likewise identified six (6) telephone cards (Exhs. G to L).  Arsenio then declared that when MONINA
arrived in Bacolod City, she introduced herself to him as FRANCISCO’s daughter.  She stayed at FRANCISCO’s house, but when
the latter and his wife would come over, Arsenio would “conceal the presence of
MONINA because Mrs. Jison did not like to see her face.”  Once, Arsenio hid MONINA in the house of
FRANCISCO’s sister, Mrs. Luisa Jison Alano, in Silay City;  another time, at the residence of
FRANCISCO’s cousin, Mrs. Concha Lopez Cuaycong.  Finally, Arsenio declared that the last time he saw MONINA was
when she left for Manila, after having finished her schooling at La Salle
College in Bacolod City.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On re-direct and
upon questions by the court, Arsenio disclosed that it was FRANCISCO who
instructed that MONINA be hidden whenever FRANCISCO and his wife were
around;  that although FRANCISCO and
MONINA saw each other at the Bacolod house only once, they called each other
“through long distance;”  and that
MONINA addressed FRANCISCO as “Daddy” during their lone meeting at the Bacolod
house and were “affectionate” to each other.  Arsenio likewise declared that MONINA stayed at FRANCISCO's Bacolod
house twice:  first for a month, then
for about a week the second time.  On
both occasions, however, FRANCISCO and his wife were abroad.  Finally, Arsenio recalled that FRANCISCO
likewise bade Arsenio to treat MONINA like his (FRANCISCO’s) other daughters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The testimony of
Zafiro Ledesma, a 74-year old banker and former mayor of Iloilo City, initially
touched on how he and his wife were related to FRANCISCO, FRANCISCO's wife and
MONINA.  Zafiro first identified Exhibit
R, a diagram of the family trees of the Jison and Lopez families, which showed
that former Vice-President Fernando Lopez was the first cousin of FRANCISCO’s
wife, then told the court that the family of Vice-President Lopez treated
MONINA “very well because she is considered a relative xxx by reputation, by actual
perception.”  Zafiro likewise identified
Exhibits X-13 to X-18, photographs taken at the 14 April 1985 birthday
celebration of Mrs. Fernando Lopez, which showed MONINA with the former
Vice-President and other members of the Lopez family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Zafiro further testified
that while MONINA lived with Mrs. Cuaycong, the latter paid for some of
MONINA’s school needs and even asked MONINA to work in a hospital owned by Mrs.
Cuaycong; and that another first cousin of FRANCISCO’s wife, a certain Remedios
Lopez Franco, likewise helped MONINA with her studies and problems, and even
attended MONINA’s graduation in 1978 when she obtained a masteral degree in
Business Administration, as evidenced by another photograph (Exh. X-12).  Moreover, upon Remedios’ recommendation, MONINA
was employed as a secretary at Merchant Financing Company, which was managed by
a certain Danthea Lopez, the wife of another first cousin of FRANCISCO’s wife,
and among whose directors were Zafiro himself, his wife and Danthea’s husband.  In closing, Zafiro identified MONINA’s
Social Security Record (Exh. W), which was signed by Danthea as employer and
where MONINA designated Remedios as the beneficiary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Danthea Lopez, a
58-year old housekeeper, declared that FRANCISCO was the first cousin of her
husband, Eusebio D. Lopez;  and that she
came to know MONINA in the latter part of 1965 when Remedios Franco recommended
MONINA for employment at Merchant Financing Co., which Danthea managed at that
time.  Remedios introduced MONINA to
Danthea “as being reputedly the daughter of Mr. Frank Jison;” and on several
occasions thereafter, Remedios made Danthea and the latter’s husband understand
that MONINA was “reputedly the daughter of [FRANCISCO].”  While MONINA worked at Merchant Financing,
Danthea knew that MONINA lived with Remedios;  however, in the latter part of 1966, as Remedios left for Manila and
MONINA was still studying at San Agustin University, Danthea and her husband
invited MONINA to live with them.  During MONINAs 6-month stay with them, she was not charged for board and
lodging and was treated as a relative, not a mere employee, all owing to what
Remedios had said regarding MONINA’s filiation.  As Danthea understood, MONINA resigned from Merchant Financing as
she was called by Mrs. Cuaycong, a first cousin of Danthea’s husband who lived
in Bacolod City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Romeo Bilbao, a
43-year old seaman, testified that he had worked for FRANCISCO from 1969 up to
1980 at Nelly Garden in various capacities:  as a procurement officer, hacienda overseer and, later, as  hacienda administrator.  Sometime in May, 1971, Romeo saw and heard
MONINA ask “her Daddy” (meaning FRANCISCO) for the money he promised to give
her, but FRANCISCO answered that he did not have the money to give, then told
MONINA to go see Mr. Jose Cruz in Bacolod City.  Then in the middle of September that year, FRANCISCO told Romeo
to pick up Mr. Cruz at the Iloilo pier and bring him to the office of Atty.
Benjamin Tirol.  At said office, Atty.
Tirol, Mr. Cruz and MONINA entered a room while Romeo waited outside.  When they came out, Atty. Tirol had papers
for MONINA to sign, but she refused.  Atty. Tirol said that a check would be released to MONINA if she signed
the papers, so MONINA acceded, although Atty. Tirol intended not to give MONINA
a copy of the document she signed.  Thereafter, Mr. Cruz gave MONINA a check (Exh. Q), then MONINA grabbed a
copy of the document she signed and ran outside.  Romeo then brought Mr. Cruz to Nelly Garden.  As to his motive for testifying, Romeo
stated that he wanted to help MONINA be recognized as FRANCISCO’S daughter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Rudy Tingson, a
45-year old antique dealer, testified that in 1963-1964, he was employed by
FRANCISCO’s wife at the Baguio Military Institute in Baguio City;  then in 1965, Rudy worked at FRANCISCO’s
office at Nelly Garden recording hacienda expenses, typing vouchers and office
papers, and, at times, acting as paymaster for the haciendas.  From the nature of his work, Rudy knew the
persons receiving money from FRANCISCO’s office, and clearly remembered that in
1965, as part of his job, Rudy gave MONINA her allowance from FRANCISCO four
(4) times, upon instructions of a certain Mr. Lagarto to give MONINA P15.00 a
month.  Rudy likewise recalled that he
first met MONINA in 1965, and that she would go to Nelly Garden whenever
FRANCISCO’s wife was not around.  On
some of these occasions, MONINA would speak with and address FRANCISCO as
“Daddy,” without objection from FRANCISCO.  In fact, in 1965, Rudy saw FRANCISCO give MONINA money thrice.  Rudy further declared that in April 1965,
FRANCISCO’s office paid P250.00 to Funeraria Bernal for the funeral expenses of
MONINA’s mother.  Finally, as to Rudy's
motives for testifying, he told the court that he simply wanted to help bring
out the truth “and nothing but the truth,” and that MONINA’s filiation was
common knowledge among the people in the office at Nelly Garden.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On re-direct,
Rudy declared that the moneys given by FRANCISCO’s office to MONINA were not
reflected in the books of the office, but were kept in a separate book, as Mr.
Lagarto explained that FRANCISCO’s wife and children “should not know [of]
this.”  Rudy further revealed that as to
the garden “meetings” between FRANCISCO and MONINA, Rudy saw MONINA kiss
FRANCISCO on the cheek both upon arriving and before leaving, and FRANCISCO’s
reaction upon seeing her was to smile and say in the Visayan dialect: “<i>Kamusta
ka iha</i>?” (“How are you, daughter?”);  and that MONINA was free to go inside the house as the household staff
knew of her filiation, and that, sometimes, MONINA would join them for lunch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Alfredo
Baylosis, a 62-year old retired accountant, testified that he worked for
FRANCISCO at Central Santos-Lopez in Iloilo from 1951 up to 1961, then at Nelly
Garden from 1961 until 1972.  Alfredo
first served FRANCISCO as a bookkeeper, then when Mr. Lagarto died in 1967 or
1969, Alfredo replaced Mr. Lagarto as office manager.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Alfredo knew
MONINA since 1961 as she used to go to Nelly Garden to claim her <s>P</s>15.00
monthly allowance given upon FRANCISCO’s standing order.  Alfredo further declared that  MONINA’s filiation was pretty well-known in
the office;  that he had seen MONINA and
FRANCISCO go from the main building to the office, with FRANCISCO’s arm on
MONINA’s shoulder;  and that the office
paid for the burial expenses of <i>Pansay</i>, but this was not recorded in the
books in order to hide it from FRANCISCO’s wife.  Alfredo also disclosed that the disbursements for MONINA’s
allowance started in 1961 and were recorded in a separate cash book.  In 1967, the allowances ceased when MONINA
stopped schooling and was employed in Bacolod City with Miller, Cruz &amp; Co.,
which served as FRANCISCO’s accountant-auditor.  Once, when Alfredo went to the offices of Miller, Cruz &amp; Co.
to see the manager, Mr. Atienza, and arrange for the preparation of FRANCISCO’s
income tax return, Alfredo chanced upon MONINA.  When Alfredo asked her how she came to work there, she answered
that “her Daddy,” FRANCISCO,  recommended
her, a fact confirmed by Mr. Atienza.  Alfredo then claimed that Mr. Jose Cruz, a partner at Miller, Cruz &amp;
Co., was the most trusted man of FRANCISCO. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Dominador
Savariz, a 55-year old caretaker, testified that he worked as FRANCISCO’s
houseboy at Nelly Garden from November 1953 up to 1965.  One morning in April 1954, MONINA and her
mother <i>Pansay</i> went to Nelly Garden and spoke with FRANCISCO for about an
hour, during which time, Dominador was vacuuming the carpet about six (6) to
seven (7) meters away.  Due to the noise
of the vacuum cleaner, FRANCISCO and MONINA spoke in loud voices, thus
Dominador overheard their conversation.  As FRANCISCO asked <i>Pansay</i> why they came, <i>Pansay</i> answered
that they came to ask for the “sustenance” of his child MONINA.  FRANCISCO then touched MONINA's head and
asked: “How are you Hija?,” to which MONINA answered: “Good morning,
Daddy.”  After FRANCISCO told <i>Pansay</i>
and MONINA to wait, he pulled something from his wallet and said to <i>Pansay</i>:  “I am giving this for the child.”  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In May 1954,
Dominador saw MONINA at Mr. Lagarto’s office where  Dominador was to get “the day’s expenses,”  while MONINA was claiming her allowance from
Mr. Diasnes.  The next month, Dominador
saw MONINA at Nelly Garden and heard in the office that MONINA was there to get
her allowance “from her Daddy.”  In
December 1960, Dominador saw MONINA at Nelly Garden, in the room of Don Vicente
(father of FRANCISCO’s wife), where she asked for a Christmas gift “and she was
calling Don Vicente, <i>Lolo</i> (grandfather).”  At that time, FRANCISCO and his wife were not around.  Then sometime in 1961, when Dominador went
to Mr. Lagarto’s office to get the marketing expenses, Dominador saw MONINA
once more claiming her allowance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Dominador
further testified that in February 1966, after he had stopped working for
FRANCISCO, Dominador was at Mrs. Franco’s residence as she recommended him for
employment with her sister, Mrs. Concha Cuaycong.  There, he saw MONINA, who was then about 15 years old, together
with Mrs. Franco’s daughter and son.  Mrs. Franco pointed at MONINA and asked Dominador if he knew who MONINA
was.  Dominador answered that MONINA was
FRANCISCO’s daughter with <i>Pansay</i>, and then Mrs. Franco remarked that
MONINA was staying with her (Mrs. Franco) and that she was sending MONINA to
school at the University of San Agustin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Lope Amolar, a
50-year old resident of Dingle, Iloilo, and the younger brother of Esperanza
Amolar (<i>Pansay</i>), testified that he worked for FRANCISCO as a houseboy
from March to November 1945 at Nelly Garden.  Thereafter, FRANCISCO sent Lope to work at Elena Apartments in Manila.  By November 1945, <i>Pansay</i> was also
working at Elena Apartments, where she revealed to Lope that FRANCISCO
impregnated her.  Lope then confronted
FRANCISCO, who told Lope “don’t get hurt and don’t cause any trouble, because I
am willing to support your <i>Inday Pansay</i> and my child.”  Three (3) days after this confrontation,
Lope asked for and received permission from FRANCISCO to resign because he
(Lope) was hurt.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 21 October
1986, MONINA herself took the witness stand.  At that time, she was 40 years old and a Central Bank Examiner.  She affirmed that as evidenced by
certifications from the Office of the Local Civil Registrar (Exhs. E and F) and
baptismal certificates (Exhs. C and D), she was born on 6 August 1946 in
Barangay Tabugon, Dingle, Iloilo, to Esperanza Amolar (who passed away on 20
April 1965) and FRANCISCO.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> MONINA first studied at Sagrado
where she stayed as a boarder.  While at
Sagrado from 1952 until 1955 (up to Grade 4), her father, FRANCISCO, paid for
her tuition fees and other school expenses.  She either received the money from FRANCISCO or from Mr. Lagarto, or saw
FRANCISCO give money to her mother, or Mr. Lagarto would pay Sagrado
directly.  After Sagrado, MONINA studied
in different schools,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> but FRANCISCO continuously answered

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">For her college
education, MONINA enrolled at the University of Iloilo, but she later dropped
due to an accident which required a week's hospitalization.  Although FRANCISCO paid for part of the
hospitalization expenses, her mother shouldered most of them.  In 1963, she enrolled at the University of
San Agustin, where she stayed with Mrs. Franco who paid for MONINA's tuition
fees.  However, expenses for books, school
supplies, uniforms and the like were shouldered by FRANCISCO.  At the start of each semester, MONINA would
show FRANCISCO that she was enrolled, then he would ask her to canvass prices,
then give her the money she needed.  After finishing two (2) semesters at University of San Agustin, as evidenced
by her transcript of records (Exh. Z showing that FRANCISCO was listed as
Parent/Guardian [Exh. Z-1]), she transferred to “De Paul College,”  just in front of Mrs. Franco’s house, and
studied there for a year.  Thereafter,
MONINA enrolled at Western Institute of Technology (WIT), where she obtained a
bachelor’s degree in Commerce in April 1967.  During her senior year, she stayed with Eusebio and Danthea Lopez at
Hotel Kahirup, owned by said couple.  She passed the CPA board exams in 1974, and took up an M.B.A. at De La
Salle University as evidenced by her transcript (Exh. AA), wherein FRANCISCO
was likewise listed as “Guardian” (Exhs. AA-1 and AA-2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA
enumerated the different members of the household staff at Nelly Garden, to
wit: Luz, the household cook;  the houseboys
Silvestre and Doming;  the housemaid
Natang;  the <i>yaya</i> of the adopted
triplets, Deling;  the <i>yaya</i> of <i>Lolo</i>
Vicente, Adelina;  and others.  MONINA likewise enumerated the members of
the office staff (Messrs. Baylosis, Lagarto, Tingson, Diasnes, Jalandoni,
Supertisioso, Doroy, and others), and identified them from a photograph marked
as Exhibit X-2.  She then corroborated
the prior testimony regarding her employment at Merchant Financing Co., and her
having lived at Hotel Kahirup and at Mrs. Cuaycong’s residence in Bacolod City,
while working at the hospital owned by Mrs. Cuaycong.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA further
testified that in March 1968, she went to Manila and met FRANCISCO at Elena
Apartments at the corner of Romero and Salas Streets, Ermita.  She told FRANCISCO that she was going for a
vacation in Baguio City with Mrs. Franco’s mother, with whom she stayed up to
June 1968.  Upon her return from Baguio
City, MONINA told FRANCISCO that she wanted to work, so the latter arranged for
her employment at Miller &amp; Cruz in Bacolod City.  MONINA went to Bacolod City, was interviewed by Mr. Jose Cruz, a
partner at Miller &amp; Cruz, who told her she would start working first week
of September, <i>sans</i> examination.  She resigned from Miller &amp; Cruz in 1971 and lived with Mrs. Cuaycong
at her Forbes Park residence in Makati.  MONINA went to see FRANCISCO, told him that she resigned and asked him
for money to go to Spain, but FRANCISCO refused as she could not speak Spanish
and would not be able find a job.  The
two quarreled and FRANCISCO ordered a helper to send MONINA out of the
house.  In the process, MONINA broke
many glasses at the pantry and cut her hand, after which, FRANCISCO hugged her,
gave her medicine, calmed her down, asked her to return to Bacolod City and
promised that he would give her the money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA returned
to Bacolod City by plane, using a Filipinas Orient Airways plane ticket (Exh.
M) which FRANCISCO gave.  She called Mr.
Cruz, then Atty. Tirol, as instructed by Mr. Cruz.  These calls were evidenced by PLDT long distance toll cards
(Exhs. G to L), with annotations at the back reading: “charged and paid under
the name of Frank L. Jison” and were signed by Arsenio Duatin (Exhs. G-1 to
L-1).  PLDT issued a certification as to
the veracity of the contents of the toll cards (Exh. BB).  Likewise introduced in evidence was a letter
of introduction prepared by Mr. Cruz addressed to Atty. Tirol, on MONINA's
behalf (Exh. N).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA also
declared that Atty. Tirol then told her that she would have to go to Iloilo and
sign a certain affidavit, before Mr. Cruz would turn over the money promised by
FRANCISCO.  She went to Atty. Tirol’s
office in Iloilo, but after going over the draft of the affidavit, refused to
sign it as it stated that she was not FRANCISCO’s daughter.  She explained that all she had agreed with
FRANCISCO was that he would pay for her fare to go abroad, and that since she
was a little girl, she knew about her illegitimacy.  She started crying, begged Atty. Tirol to change the affidavit,
to which Atty. Tirol responded that he was also a father and did not want this
to happen to his children as they could not be blamed for being brought into
the world.  She then wrote a letter
(Exh. O) to FRANCISCO and sent it to the latter’s Forbes Park residence
(Bauhinia Place) by JRS courier service (Exhs. O-5 to O-7).  MONINA subsequently met FRANCISCO in Bacolod
City where they discussed the affidavit which she refused to sign.  FRANCISCO told her that the affidavit was
for his wife, that in case she heard about MONINA going abroad, the affidavit
would “keep her peace.”  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA then
narrated that the first time she went to Atty. Tirol’s office, she was
accompanied by one Atty. Fernando Divinagracia, who advised her that the
affidavit (Exh. P)</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> would “boomerang” against FRANCISCO
“as it is contrary to law.”  MONINA
returned to Bacolod City, then met with Atty. Tirol once more to reiterate her
plea, but Atty. Tirol did not relent.  Thus, on the morning of 20 or 21 September 1971, she signed the
affidavit as she was jobless and needed the money to support herself and finish
her studies.  In exchange for signing
the document, MONINA received a Bank of Asia check for <s>P</s>15,000.00 (Exh.
Q), which was less than the <s>P</s>25,000.00 which FRANCISCO allegedly
promised to give.  As Atty. Tirol seemed
hesitant to give her a copy of the affidavit after notarizing it, MONINA merely
grabbed a copy and immediately left.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA then
prepared to travel abroad, for which purpose, she procured letters of
introduction (Exhs. S and T) from a cousin, Mike Alano (son of FRANCISCO’s
elder sister Luisa);  and an uncle,
Emilio Jison (FRANCISCO’s elder brother), addressed to another cousin, Beth
Jison (Emilio’s daughter), for Beth to assist MONINA.  Exhibit S contained a statement (Exh. S-1) expressly recognizing
that MONINA was FRANCISCO’s daughter.  Ultimately though, MONINA decided not to go abroad, opting instead to
spend the proceeds of the P15,000.00 check for her CPA review, board exam and
graduate studies.  After finishing her
graduate studies, she again planned to travel abroad, for which reason, she
obtained a letter of introduction from former Vice President Fernando Lopez
addressed to then United States Consul Vernon McAnnich (Exh. V).  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As to other acts
tending to show her filiation, MONINA related that on one occasion, as
FRANCISCO’s wife was going to arrive at the latter’s Bacolod City residence,
FRANCISCO called Arsenio Duatin and instructed Arsenio to hide MONINA.  Thus, MONINA stayed with Mrs. Luisa Jison for
the duration of the stay of FRANCISCO’s wife.  MONINA also claimed that she knew Vice President Fernando Lopez and his
wife, Mariquit, even before starting to go to school.  Thus, MONINA asked for a recommendation letter (Exh. U) from Mrs.
Mariquit Lopez for possible employment with Mrs. Rosario Lopez Cooper, another
second cousin of FRANCISCO.  In Exhibit
U, Mrs. Lopez expressly recognized MONINA as FRANCISCO’s daughter.  As additional proof of her close relationship
with the family of Vice President Lopez, MONINA identified photographs taken at
a birthday celebration on 14 April 1985.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA finally
claimed that she knew the three (3) children of FRANCISCO by wife, namely,
Lourdes, Francisco, Jr. (Junior) and Elena, but MONINA had met only Lourdes and
Junior.  MONINA's testimony dealt
lengthily on her dealings with Junior and the two (2) occasions when she met
with Lourdes.  The last time MONINA saw
FRANCISCO was in March 1979, when she sought his blessings to get married. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In his defense,
FRANCISCO offered his deposition taken before then Judge Romeo Callejo of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 48.  As additional witnesses, FRANCISCO presented Nonito Jalandoni, Teodoro
Zulla, Iñigo Supertisioso, Lourdes Ledesma, Jose Cruz and Dolores Argenal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">FRANCISCO
declared that <i>Pansay</i>’s employment ceased as of October, 1944, and that
while employed by him, <i>Pansay</i> would sleep with the other female helpers
on the first floor of his residence, while he, his wife and daughter slept in a
room on the second floor.  At that time,
his household staff was composed of three (3) female workers and two (2) male
workers.  After <i>Pansay</i> left in
October 1944, she never communicated with him again, neither did he know of her
whereabouts.  FRANCISCO staunchly denied
having had sexual relations with <i>Pansay </i>and disavowed any knowledge
about MONINA’s birth.  In the same vein,
he denied having paid for MONINA’s tuition fees, in person or otherwise, and
asserted that he never knew that Mr. Lagarto paid for these fees.  Moreover, FRANCISCO could not believe that
Lagarto would pay for these fees despite absence of instructions or approval
from FRANCISCO.  He likewise
categorically denied that he told anyone, be it Danthea Lopez, Zafiro Ledesma,
Concha Cuaycong or Remedios Franco, that MONINA was his daughter.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align:left" align="left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">FRANCISCO also disclosed that upon his return from the
United States in 1971, he fired Alfredo Baylosis upon discovering that Alfredo
had taken advantage of his position during the former’s absence.  FRANCISCO likewise fired Rudy Tingson and
Romeo Bilbao, but did not give the reasons therefor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align:left" align="left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Finally, FRANCISCO denied knowledge of MONINA’s long
distance calls from his Bacolod residence; nevertheless, when he subsequently
discovered this, he fired certain people in his office for their failure to
report this anomaly.  As regards the
caretaker of his Bacolod residence, FRANCISCO explained that since MONINA lived
at Mrs. Cuaycong’s residence, the caretaker thought that he could allow people
who lived at the Cuaycong residence to use the facilities at his (FRANCISCO’s)
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Nonito
Jalandoni, bookkeeper and paymaster at Nelly’s Garden from 1963 up to 1974,
then from 1980 up to 1986, the assistant overseer of Hacienda Lopez, testified
that he did not know MONINA;  that he
learned of her only in June 1988, when he was informed by FRANCISCO that MONINA
had sued him; and that he never saw MONINA at Nelly’s Garden, neither did he
know of any instructions for anyone at Nelly’s Garden to give money to
MONINA.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Teodoro Zulla,
FRANCISCO’s bookkeeper and paymaster from 1951 up to 1986, testified that
FRANCISCO dismissed Alfredo Baylosis due to certain unspecified
discrepancies;  and that he never saw
MONINA receive funds from either Mr. Lagarto or Mr. Baylosis.  Upon questions from the trial court,
however, Teodoro admitted that he prepared vouchers for only one of FRANCISCO’s
haciendas, and not vouchers pertaining to the latter’s personal expenses.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Iñigo
Supertisioso testified that he worked for FRANCISCO at Nelly’s Garden from 1964
up to 1984 as a field inspector, paymaster, cashier and, eventually,
officer-in-charge (OIC).  He confirmed
Alfredo Baylosis’ dismissal due to these unspecified irregularities, then
denied that FRANCISCO ever ordered that MONINA be given her allowance.  Likewise, Iñigo never heard FRANCISCO
mention that MONINA was his (FRANCISCO’s) daughter.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Lourdes Ledesma,
FRANCISCO’s daughter, testified that she saw (but did not know) MONINA at the
Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, on the occasion of the birth of Lourdes’ first son,
Mark.  Over lunch one day, Lourdes’ aunt
casually introduced Lourdes and MONINA to each other, but they were referred to
only by their first names.  Then
sometime in 1983 or 1984, MONINA allegedly went to Lourdes’ house in Sta. Clara
Subdivision requesting for a letter of introduction or referral as MONINA was
then job-hunting.  However, Lourdes did
not comply with the request. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Jose Cruz, a
partner at Miller, Cruz &amp; Co., testified that MONINA worked at Miller &amp;
Cruz from 1968 up to 1971, however, he did not personally interview her before
she was accepted for employment.  Moreover, MONINA underwent the usual screening procedure before being
hired.  Jose recalled that one of the
accountants, a certain Mr. Atienza, reported that MONINA claimed to be
FRANCISCO’s daughter.  Jose then told
Mr. Atienza to speak with MONINA and see if he (Mr. Atienza) could stop her
from spreading this rumor.  Mr. Atienza
reported that he spoke with MONINA, who told him that she planned to leave for
the United States and needed <s>P</s>20,000.00 for that purpose, and in exchange,
she would sign a document disclaiming filiation with FRANCISCO.  Thus, Jose instructed Mr. Atienza to request
that MONINA meet with Jose, and at that meeting, MONINA confirmed Mr. Atienza’s
report.  Jose then informed Atty. Tirol,
FRANCISCO’s personal lawyer, about the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Atty. Tirol told
Jose to send MONINA and her lawyer to his (Atty. Tirol’s) office in
Iloilo.  Jose then wrote out a letter of
introduction for MONINA addressed to Atty. Tirol.  Jose relayed Atty. Tirol’s message to MONINA through Mr. Atienza,
then later, Atty. Tirol told Jose to go to Iloilo with a check for <s>P</s>15,000.00.  Jose complied, and at Atty. Tirol’s office,
Jose saw MONINA, Atty. Tirol and his secretary reading some documents.  MONINA then expressed her willingness to
sign the document, <i>sans</i> revisions.  Jose alleged that he drew the <s>P</s>15,000.00 from his personal funds,
subject to reimbursement from and due to an understanding with FRANCISCO. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Dolores Argenal,
a househelper at Nelly Garden from May 1944 up to May 1946, testified that she
knew that <i>Pansay</i> was Lourdes’ nanny;  that Lourdes slept in her parents’ room;  that she had not seen FRANCISCO give special treatment to <i>Pansay</i>;  that there was no “unusual relationship”
between FRANCISCO and <i>Pansay, </i>and if there was any, Dolores would have
easily detected it since she slept in the same room as <i>Pansay</i>.  Dolores further declared that whenever
FRANCISCO’s wife was out of town, <i>Pansay</i> would bring Lourdes downstairs
at nighttime, and that <i>Pansay</i> would not sleep in the room where FRANCISCO
slept.  Finally, Dolores declared that <i>Pansay</i>
stopped working for FRANCISCO and his wife in October, 1944.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The reception of
evidence having been concluded, the parties filed their respective
memoranda.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">It need be
recalled that Judge Catalino Castañeda, Jr. presided over trial up to 21
October 1986, thereby hearing only the testimonies of MONINA’s witnesses and
about half of MONINA’s testimony on direct examination. Judge Norberto E.
Devera, Jr. heard the rest of MONINA's testimony and those of FRANCISCO’s
witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In its decision
of 12 November 1990</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> the trial court, through Judge
Devera, dismissed the complaint with costs against MONINA.  In the opening paragraph thereof, it
observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">This is a complaint for recognition
of an illegitimate child instituted by plaintiff Monina Jison against defendant
Francisco Jison.  This complaint was
filed on March 13, 1985 at the time when plaintiff, reckoned from her death of
birth, was already thirty-nine years old.  Noteworthy also is the fact that it was instituted twenty years after
the death of plaintiff’s mother, Esperanza Amolar.  For the years between plaintiff’s birth and Esperanza’s death, no
action of any kind was instituted against defendant either by plaintiff, her
mother Esperanza or the latter’s parents.  Neither had plaintiff brought such an action against defendant
immediately upon her mother’s death on April 20, 1965, considering that she was
then already nineteen years old or, within a reasonable time thereafter.  Twenty years more had to supervene before
this complaint was eventually instituted.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The trial court
then proceeded to discuss the four issues stipulated at pre-trial, without,
however, summarizing the testimonies of the witnesses nor referring to the
testimonies of the witnesses other than those mentioned in the discussion of
the issues.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The trial court
resolved the first issue in the negative, holding that it was improbable for
witness Lope Amolar to have noticed that <i>Pansay</i> was pregnant upon seeing
her at the Elena Apartments in November 1945, since <i>Pansay</i> was then only
in her first month of pregnancy;  that
there was no positive assertion that “copulation did indeed take place between
Francisco and Esperanza;”  and that
MONINA’s attempt to show opportunity on the part of FRANCISCO failed to
consider “that there was also the opportunity for copulation between Esperanza
and one of the several domestic helpers admittedly also residing at Nelly’s
Garden at that time.”  The RTC also
ruled that the probative value of the birth and baptismal certificates of
MONINA paled in light of jurisprudence, especially when the misspellings
therein were considered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The trial court
likewise resolved the second issue in the negative, finding that MONINA’s
evidence thereon “may either be one of three categories, namely:  hearsay evidence, incredulous evidence, or
self-serving evidence."  To the
first category belonged the testimonies of Adela Casabuena and Alfredo
Baylosis, whose knowledge of MONINA’s filiation was based, as to the former, on
“utterances of defendant’s wife Lilia and Esperanza allegedly during the heat
of their quarrel,” while as to the latter, Alfredo's conclusion was based “from
the rumors going [around] that plaintiff is defendant’s daughter, from his
personal observation of plaintiff’s facial appearance which he compared with
that of defendant’s and from the way the two (plaintiff and defendant) acted
and treated each other on one occasion that he had then opportunity to closely
observe them together.”  To the second
category belonged that of Dominador Savariz, as:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">At each precise time that Esperanza
allegedly visited Nelly’s Garden and allegedly on those occasions when
defendant’s wife, Lilia was in Manila, this witness was there and allegedly
heard pieces of conversation between defendant and Esperanza related to the
paternity of the latter’s child. xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The RTC then
placed MONINA’s testimony regarding the acts of recognition accorded her by
FRANCISCO’s relatives under the third category, since the latter were never presented
as witnesses, for which reason the trial court excluded the letters from
FRANCISCO’s relatives (Exhs. S to V). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As to the third
issue, the trial court held that MONINA was not barred by prescription for it was
of “the perception … that the benefits of Article 268 accorded to legitimate
children may be availed of or extended to illegitimate children in the same
manner as the Family Code has so provided;” or by laches, “which is [a]
creation of equity applied only to bring equitable results, and … addressed to
the sound discretion of the court [and] the circumstances [here] would show
that whether plaintiff filed this case immediately upon the death of her mother
Esperanza in 1965 or twenty years thereafter in 1985, xxx there seems to be no
inequitable result to defendant as related to the situation of plaintiff.”  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The RTC ruled,
however, that MONINA was barred by estoppel by deed because of the affidavit
(Exh. P/Exh. 2) which she signed “when she was already twenty-five years, a
professional and … under the able guidance of counsel.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Finally, the RTC
denied FRANCISCO’s claim for damages, finding that MONINA did not file the
complaint with malice, she having been “propelled by an honest belief, founded
on probable cause.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA

the other means by which illegitimate filiation could be proved, <i>i.e.</i>,
the open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child or,
by any other means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws, such as “the

“bottom line issue” was whether or not MONINA established her filiation as
FRANCISCO’s illegitimate daughter by preponderance of evidence, as to which
issue said court found:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">[N]ot just preponderant but
overwhelming evidence on record to prove that [MONINA] is the illegitimate
daughter of [FRANCISCO] and that she had continuously enjoyed such status by
direct acts of [FRANCISCO] and/or his relatives.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In so ruling,
the Court of Appeals observed that the testimonies of Lope Amolar, Adela
Casabuena and Dominador Savariz were already sufficient to establish MONINA’s
filiation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">As adverted to earlier, the trial
court discredited Lope Amolar’s testimony by saying that Lope could not have
detected Esperanza’s pregnant state in November, 1945 since at that point in
time [<i>sic</i>] she was still in the initial stage of pregnancy.  Apparently, the trial court paid more
emphasis on the date mentioned by Lope Amolar than on the tenor and import of
his testimony.  As xxx Lope xxx was
asked about an incident that transpired more than 41 years back, [u]nder the
circumstances, it is unreasonable to expect that Lope could still be dead right
on the specific month in 1945 that [he] met and confronted his sister.  At any rate, what is important is not the month
that they met but the essence of his testimony that his sister pointed to their
employer [FRANCISCO] as the one responsible for her pregnancy, and that upon
being confronted, [FRANCISCO] assured him of support for Esperanza and their
child.  It would appear then that in an
attempt to find fault with Lope’s testimony, the trial court has fallen
oblivious to the fact that even [FRANCISCO], in his deposition, did not deny
that he was confronted by Lope about what he had done to Esperanza, during
which he unequivocally acknowledged paternity by assuring Lope of support for
both Esperanza and their child.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align:left" align="left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The Court of Appelas further noted that Casabuena and
Savariz “testified on something that they personally observed or witnessed,”
which matters FRANCISCO “did not deny or refute.”  Finally, said court aptly held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Taking into account all the
foregoing uncontroverted testimonies xxx let alone such circumstantial evidence
as [MONINA’s] Birth Certificates xxx and Baptismal Certificates which
invariably bear the name of [FRANCISCO] as her father, We cannot go along with
the trial court’s theory that [MONINA’s] illegitimate filiation has not been
satisfactorily established.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Significantly, [MONINA’s] testimony
finds ample corroboration from [FRANCISCO’s] former employees, Arsenio Duatin,
Rudy Tingson and Alfredo Baylosis. xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Carefully evaluating appellant’s
evidence on her enjoyment of the status of an illegitimate daughter of
[FRANCISCO] <u>vis-a-vis</u> [FRANCISCO’s] controversion thereof, We find more
weight in the former.  The positive
testimonies of [MONINA] and [her] witnesses xxx all bearing on [FRANCISCO’s]
acts and/or conduct indubitably showing that he had continuously acknowledged
[MONINA] as his illegitimate daughter have not been succeessfully [<i>sic</i>]
refuted.  In fact, [FRANCISCO] himself,
in his deposition, only casually dismissed [MONINA’s] exhaustive and detailed
testimony as untrue, and with respect to those given by [MONINA’s] witnesses,
he merely explained that he had fired [them] from their employment.  Needless to state, [FRANCISCO’s] vague
denial is grossly inadequate to overcome the probative weight of [MONINA’s]
testimonial evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Even the affidavit (Exh 2) which
[FRANCISCO] had foisted on the trial court xxx does not hold sway in the face
of [MONINA’s] logical explanation that she at first did agree to sign the
affidavit which contained untruthful statements.  In fact, she promptly complained to [FRANCISCO] who, however
explained to her that the affidavit was only for the consumption of his spouse
xxx.  Further, the testimony of Jose
Cruz concerning the events that led to the execution of the affidavit xxx could
not have been true, for as pointed out by [MONINA], she signed the affidavit
xxx almost five months after she had resigned from the Miller, Cruz &amp; Co.
xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">At any rate, if [MONINA] were not
his illegitimate daughter, it would have been uncalled for, if not absurd, for
[FRANCISCO] or his lawyer to have secured [MONINA’s] sworn statement xxx  On the contrary, in asking [MONINA] to sign
the said affidavit at the cost of P15,000, [FRANCISCO] clearly betrayed his
intention to conceal or suppress his paternity of [MONINA].  xxx  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">In fine, We hold that [MONINA’s]
filiation as [FRANCISCO’s] illegitimate daughter has been conclusively
established by the uncontroverted testimonies of Lope Amolar, Adela Casabuena
and Dominador Savariz to the effect that appellee himself had admitted his
paternity of the appellee, and also by the testimonies of appellant, Arsenio
Duatin, Romeo Bilbao, Rudy Tingson and Alfredo Baylosis unerringly
demonstrating that by his own conduct or overt acts like sending appellant to
school, paying for her tuition fees, school uniforms, books, board and lodging
at the Colegio del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus, defraying appellant’s
hospitalization expenses, providing her with [a] monthly allowance, paying for
the funeral expenses of appellant’s mother, acknowledging appellant’s paternal
greetings and calling appellant his “Hija” or child, instructing his office
personnel to give appellant’s monthly allowance, recommending appellant for
employment at the Miller, Cruz &amp; Co., allowing appellant to use his house
in Bacolod and paying for her long distance telephone calls, having appellant
spend her vacation in his apartment in Manila and also at his Forbes residence,
allowing appellant to use his surname in her scholastic and other records (Exhs
Z, AA, AA-1 to AA-5, W &amp; W-5), appellee had continuously recognized
appellant as his illegitimate daughter.  Added to these are the acts of [FRANCISCO’s] relatives acknowledging or
treating [MONINA] as [FRANCISCO’s] daughter (Exh U) or as their relative (Exhs
T &amp; V).  On this point, witness
Zafiro Ledesma, former Mayor of Iloilo City, whose spouse belongs to the Lopez
clan just like [FRANCISCO], testified that [MONINA] has been considered by the
Lopezes as a relative.  He identified
pictures of the appellee in the company of the Lopezes (Exhs X-16 &amp; X-17).  Another witness, Danthea H. Lopez, whose
husband Eusebio Lopez is appellee’s first cousin, testified that appellant was
introduced to her by appellee’s cousin, Remedios Lopez Franco, as the daughter
of appellee Francisco Jison, for which reason, she took her in as [a] secretary
in the Merchant’s Financing Corporation of which she was the manager, and
further allowed her to stay with her family free of board and lodging.  Still on this aspect, Dominador Savariz
declared that sometime in February, 1966 appellee’s relative, Ms. Remedios
Lopez Franco pointed to appellant as the daughter of appellee Francisco Jison.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Finally, the Certifications of the
Local Civil Registrar of Dingle (Exhs E and F) as well as [MONINA’s] Baptismal
Certificates (Exhs C &amp; D) which the trial ocurt admitted in evidence as part
of [MONINA’s] testimony, may serve as circumstantial evidence to further
reinforce [MONINA’s] claim that she is [FRANCISCO’s] illegitimate daughter by
Esperanza Amolar.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">True it is that a trial judge’s
assessment of the credibility of witnesses is accorded great respect on
appeal.  But the rule admits of certain
exceptions.  One such exception is where
the judge who rendered the judgment was not the one who heard the witnesses
testify. [citations omitted]  The other
is where the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated some
facts or circumstances of weight and substance which, if properly considered,
might affect the result of the case. [citations omitted]  In the present case, both exceptions obtain.  All of [MONINA’s] witnesses xxx whose
testimonies were not given credence did not testify before the judge who
rendered the disputed judgment.  xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As to the second

contradictory and unreliable,” and proceeds to attack the credibility of her

detected <i>Pansay</i>’s pregnancy in November 1945 when they met since she
would have been only one (1) month pregnant then; (b) Dominador Savariz did not
in fact witness the meeting between FRANCISCO, <i>Pansay</i> and MONINA; (c)
Zafiro Ledesma had an ulterior motive in testifying for MONINA as he owned a
bank in Iloilo which was then under Central Bank supervision and MONINA was the
Bank Examiner assigned to Iloilo; and (d) Danthea Lopez was not related to him
by blood and whatever favorable treatment MONINA received from Danthea was due
to the former’s employment at Merchants’ Financing Company and additional
services rendered at Kahirup Hotel; besides, Danthea admitted that she had no

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anent the
treatment given by his relatives to MONINA as his daughter, FRANCISCO points to
the fact that <i>Pansay</i> was the former laundrywoman of Mrs. Franco; MONINA resided
with the families of Eusebio Lopez and Concha Cuaycong because she was in their
employ at Kahirup Hotel and Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, respectively; MONINA
failed to present Mrs. Franco, Eusebio Lopez and Mrs. Cuaycong; and MONINA’s
employment at the accounting firm of Miller, Cruz &amp; Co. was attributable to
her educational attainment, there being absolutely no evidence to prove that
FRANCISCO ever facilitated her employment thereat.  Hence, in light of Baluyot v. Baluyot,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">With respect to
the third assigned error, FRANCISCO argues that the Court of Appeals’ reliance
on the certifications of the Local Civil Registrar (Exhs. E and F) and
Baptismal Certificates (Exhs. C and D) as circumstantial evidence is
misplaced.  First, their genuineness
could not be ascertained as the persons who issued them did not testify.  Second, in light of <i>Reyes v. Court of
Appeals</i>,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> the contents of the baptismal
certificates were hearsay, as the data was based only on what was told to the
priest who solemnized the baptism, who likewise was not presented as a
witness.  Additionally, the name of the
father appearing therein was “Franque Jison,” which was not FRANCISCO’s
name.  Third, in both Exhibits E and F,
the names of the child’s parents were listed as “Frank Heson” and “Esperanza
Amador” (not Amolar).  FRANCISCO further
points out that in Exhibit F, the status of the child is listed as
“legitimate,” while the father’s occupation as “laborer.”  Most importantly, there was no showing that
FRANCISCO signed Exhibits E and F or that he was the one who reported the
child’s birth to the Office of the Local Civil Registrar.  As to MONINA’s educational records,
FRANCISCO invokes Bañas v. Bañas</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn23" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> which recognized that school
records are prepared by school authorities, not by putative parents, thus
incompetent to prove paternity.  And, as
to the photographs presented by MONINA, FRANCISCO cites Colorado v. Court of
Appeals,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

not present any of the persons with whom she is seen in the pictures to testify
thereon; besides these persons were, at best, mere second cousins of
FRANCISCO.  He likewise assails the
various notes and letters written by his relatives (Exhs. S to V) as they were
not identified by the authors.  Finally,
he stresses that MONINA did not testify as to the telephone cards (Exhs. G to

discussion, however, must be situated within the general rules on evidence, in
light of the burden of proof in civil cases, <i>i.e.</i>, preponderance of
evidence, and the shifting of the burden of evidence in such cases.  Simply put, he who alleges the affirmative
of the issue has the burden of proof, and upon the plaintiff in a civil case,
the burden of proof never parts.  However, in the course of trial in a civil case, once plaintiff makes
out a <i>prima facie</i> case in his favor, the duty or the burden of evidence
shifts to defendant to controvert plaintiff’s <i>prima facie</i> case,
otherwise, a verdict must be returned in favor of plaintiff.  Moreover, in civil cases, the party having
the burden of proof must produce a preponderance of evidence thereon, with
plaintiff having to rely on the strength of his own evidence and not upon the
weakness of the defendant’s.  The
concept of “preponderance of evidence” refers to evidence which is of greater
weight, or more convincing, that which is offered in opposition to it;  at bottom, it means probability of truth.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn32" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

the instant controversy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">FRANCISCO’s
arguments in support of his first assigned error deserve scant consideration.  While it has been observed that unlawful
intercourse will not be presumed merely from proof of an opportunity for such
indulgence,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn33" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> this does not favor FRANCISCO.  Akin to the crime of rape where, in most
instances, the only witnesses to the felony are the participants in the sexual
act themselves, in deciding paternity suits, the issue of whether sexual
intercourse actually occurred inevitably redounds to the victim’s or mother’s
word, as against the accused’s or putative father’s protestations.  In the instant case, MONINA’s mother could
no longer testify as to the fact of intercourse, as she had, unfortunately,
passed away long before the institution of the complaint for recognition.  But this did not mean that MONINA could no
longer prove her filiation.  The fact of
her birth and her parentage may be established by evidence other than the
testimony of her mother.  The paramount
question then is whether MONINA’s evidence is coherent, logical and natural.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn34" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The complaint
stated that FRANCISCO had carnal knowledge of <i>Pansay</i>  “by about the end of 1945.”  We agree with MONINA that this was broad
enough to cover the fourth quarter of said year, hence her birth on 6 August
1946 could still be attributed to sexual relations between FRANCISCO and
MONINA’s mother.  In any event, since it
was established that her mother was still in the employ of FRANCISCO at the
time MONINA was conceived as determined by the date of her birth, sexual
contact between FRANCISCO and MONINA’s mother was not at all impossible, especially
in light of the overwhelming evidence, as hereafter shown, that FRANCISCO
fathered MONINA, has recognized her as his daughter and that MONINA has been
enjoying the open and continuous possession of the status as FRANCISCO’s
illegitimate daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">MONINA’s
reliance on the certification issued by the Local Civil Registrar concerning
her birth (Exhs. E and F) is clearly misplaced.  It is settled that a certificate of live birth purportedly
identifying the putative father is not competent evidence as to the issue of
paternity, when there is no showing that the putative father had a hand in the
preparation of said certificates, and the Local Civil Registrar is devoid of
authority to record the paternity of an illegitimate child upon the information
of a third person.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn37" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Simply put, if the alleged father
did not intervene in the birth certificate, <i>e.g.</i>, supplying the
information himself, the inscription of his name by the mother or doctor or
registrar is null and void;  the mere
certificate by the registrar without the signature of the father is not proof
of voluntary acknowledgment on the latter’s part.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

participation in the preparation of the baptismal certificates (Exhs. C and D)
and school records (Exhs. Z and AA) renders these documents incompetent to
prove paternity, the former being competent merely to prove the administration
of the sacrament of baptism on the date so specified.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn39" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We now direct
our attention to MONINA’s 21 September 1971 affidavit (Exh. P/Exh. 2), subject
of the fourth assigned error, where she attests that FRANCISCO is not her
father.  MONINA contends that she signed
it under duress, <i>i.e.</i>, she was jobless, had no savings and needed the
money to support herself and finish her studies.  Moreover, she signed Exhibit P upon the advice of Atty.
Divinagracia that filiation could not be waived and that FRANCISCO’s ploy would
“boomerang” upon him.  On the other
hand, FRANCISCO asserts that full credence should be afforded Exhibit P as
MONINA was already 25 years old at the time of its execution and was advised by
counsel;  further, being a notarized
document, its genuineness and due execution could not be questioned.  He relies on the testimony of Jose Cruz, a
partner at the accounting firm of Miller &amp; Cruz, who declared that he
intervened in the matter as MONINA was spreading rumors about her filiation
within the firm, which might have had deleterious effects upon the relationship
between the firm and FRANCISCO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align:left" align="left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">On this issue, we find for MONINA and agree with the
following observations of the Court of Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Even the affidavit (Exh 2) which
[FRANCISCO] had foisted on the trial court xxx does not hold sway in the face
of [MONINA’s] logical explanation that she at first did agree to sign the
affidavit which contained untruthful statements.  In fact, she promptly complained to [FRANCISCO] who, however
explained to her that the affidavit was only for the consumption of his spouse
xxx. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">At any rate, if [MONINA] were not
his illegitimate daughter, it would have been uncalled for, if not absurd, for
[FRANCISCO] or his lawyer to have secured [MONINA’s] sworn statement xxx  On the contrary, in asking [MONINA] to sign
the said affidavit at the cost of <s>P</s>15,000, [FRANCISCO] clearly betrayed
his intention to conceal or suppress his paternity of [MONINA].  xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Indeed, if
MONINA were truly not FRANCISCO’s illegitimate daughter, it would have been
unnecessary for him to have gone to such great lengths in order that MONINA
denounce her filiation.  For as clearly
established before the trial court and properly appreciated by the Court of
Appeals, MONINA had resigned from Miller &amp; Cruz five (5) months prior to
the execution of the sworn statement in question, hence negating FRANCISCO’s
theory of the need to quash rumors circulating within Miller &amp; Cruz
regarding the identity of MONINA’s father.  Hence, coupled with the assessment of the credibility of the testimonial
evidence of the parties discussed above, it is evident that the standard to
contradict a notarial document, <i>i.e.</i>, clear and convincing evidence and

know.”  In declining then to lend

general observation of humanity teach us that the natural limitations of our
inventive faculties are such that if a witness undertakes to fabricate and
deliver in court a false narrative containing numerous details, he is almost
certain to fall into fatal inconsistencies, to make statements which can be
readily refuted, or to expose in his demeanor the falsity of his message.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">For this reason it
will be found that perjurers usually confine themselves to the incidents
immediately related to the principal fact about which they testify, and when
asked about collateral facts by which their truthfulness could be tested, their
answers not infrequently take the stereotyped form of such expressions as “I
don’t know” or “I don’t remember.” xxx</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn50" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Second, the
reasons for the dismissals of Tingson, Baylosis and Savariz were unspecified or
likewise unsubstantiated, hence FRANCISCO’s attempt to prove ill-motive on
their part to falsely testify in MONINA’s  favor may not succeed.  As may be
gleaned, the only detail which FRANCISCO could furnish as to the circumstances
surrounding the dismissals of his former employees was that Baylosis allegedly
“took advantage of his position” while FRANCISCO was in the United States.  But aside from this bare claim, FRANCISCO’s
account is barren, hence unable to provide the basis for a finding of bias
against FRANCISCO on the part of his former employees. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

MONINA’s allowance;  declared that
Alfredo Baylosis was dismissed due to discrepancies discovered after an audit,
without any further elaboration, however;  but admitted that he never prepared the vouchers pertaining to
FRANCISCO’s personal expenses, merely those intended for one of FRANCISCO’s

by Mr. Jison for irregularities,” while Superticioso was informed by FRANCISCO
that Tingson was dismissed for loss of confidence.  Superticioso likewise denied that MONINA received money from

of an action to establish one’s illegitimate filiation when relying upon the

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The last
assigned error concerning laches likewise fails to convince.  The essential elements of laches are: (1)
conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims, giving
rise to the situation of which the complaint seeks a remedy; (2) delay in
asserting the complainant’s rights, the complainant having had knowledge or
notice of the defendant’s conduct as having been afforded an opportunity to
institute a suit; (3) lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant
that the complaint would assert the right in which he bases his suit; and (4)
injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the
complainant, or the suit is not held barred.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

the doctrine that stale demands apply only where by reason of the lapse of time

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As FRANCISCO set
up laches as an affirmative defense, it was incumbent upon him to prove the
existence of its elements.  However, he
only succeeded in showing MONINA’s delay in asserting her claim, but miserably
failed to prove the last element.  In
any event,  it must be stressed that
laches is based upon grounds of public policy which requires, for the peace of
society, the discouragement of stale claims, and is principally a question  of the inequity or unfairness of permitting
a right or claim to be enforced or asserted.  There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes laches; each case is to
be determined according to its particular circumstances.  The question of laches is addressed to the
sound discretion of the court, and since it is an equitable doctrine, its
application is controlled by equitable considerations.  It cannot be worked to defeat justice or to perpetuate
fraud and injustice.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn60" href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Since the instant case involves
paternity and filiation, even if illegitimate, MONINA filed her action well
within the period granted her by a positive provision of law.  A denial then of her action on ground of laches
would clearly be inequitable and unjust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
