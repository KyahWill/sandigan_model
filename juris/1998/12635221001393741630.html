				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In view of the
intrinsic nature of rape where only two persons are usually involved, courts
are cautioned to minutely scrutinize the words and actions of the victim.  In this case, we meticulously examined the
testimony of the complainant, but we find no reason to disturb the trial
court’s finding which gave it full faith and credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The
prosecution’s version of the facts, as summarized by the solicitor general in

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“At around 8:00 o’clock in
the evening of 6 March 1994, private complainant Fe Revilla [‘Fe,’ for brevity]
was in the company of long time friends Raquel Castaneda and Carlito Ocenas who
came to visit her at her house in Freedom Park III, Batasan Hills, Quezon City
(TSN, 7 June 1994, pp. 3-4).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">While enjoying their
tattle, appellant and his Muslim companion, Ashmad, unexpectedly arrived.  The two joined in the conversation when
suddenly, appellant pulled out a fan knife and jeered, ‘Trip kong manggulo
ngayon’ [I feel like creating trouble] (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 5).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thereafter, Ashmad left the
group.  Meantime, Fe and her friends
were immobilized with fear and apprehension over appellant’s conduct (<i>Ibid.</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Soon, appellant left the
house (<i>Ibid.</i>).  Feeling quite
relieved, Fe rose from her seat to prepare coffee.  Minutes later, however, appellant came back, still in his
uncharacteristic mood, and reiterating that he wants to stir trouble (<i>Ibid.,</i>
p. 6).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since Raquel and Carlito
became apprehensive of appellant’s presence, they left without even tasting
their coffee (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 6).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Taking advantage of Fe’s
sudden isolation, appellant bodily seized her and told her to go to bed with
him (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 7).  Initially, Fe
resisted.  When appellant, however,
aimed his knife at Fe while the latter was already tangled in his embrace,
Fe  could only plead for mercy and
entreat appellant about her children and the consequences of his act.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ostensibly unmoved by her
cry for mercy, appellant pushed Fe to the nearby bed, about five (5) steps away
(<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 9).  Thereafter,
appellant pulled down his trousers and went on top of his victim.  Appellant thereafter slid his victim’s one-length
dress up to her shoulders and removed her underwear.  Then, appellant introduced his organ into hers and began to pump
until apparently he realized that his victim was menstruating. (<i>Ibid.,</i>
p. 11).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Appellant inquired from Fe
if indeed she was menstruating and despite receiving an affirmation, appellant
lit a lighter and checked on his victim’s pudendum (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 11).  Although he already pulled out his organ
from his victim, appellant now took time in kissing his victim all over her
face (<i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 11-12).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fe could now only cry.  When a vehicle suddenly blew its horn, Fe
distracted appellant by saying that a visitor just came (<i>Ibid., </i>p.
12).  Appellant said he could not
care.  When a car’s horn again sounded,
Fe reiterated that a cousin may have arrived (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 13).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">This time, appel[l]ant
budged.  Taking this as her cue,  Fe pushed appellant and ran as fast as she
could (<i>Ibid.</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fe scampered to the
direction of the Barangay Lupon (<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 13).  By chance, Rev. Reynaldo Cabangon [“Rev.
Cabangon,” for brevity], a pastor, happened to meet a distressed Fe on the road
who was crying and uttering that she was raped and molested by a certain
“Domeng” (TSN, 7 June 1994, p. 14).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">At around 10:40 o’clock
that evening of the same date, Fe’s sworn statement was taken (Exh. “C,”
Records, p. 85).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The following morning, or
on 7 March 1994 at 11:00 o’clock a.m., a medical examination was conducted on
private complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">GIL PIQUERO, 43 years old,
married, self employed and a resident of 91 Everlasting St., Freedom Park III,
Batasan Hills, Quezon City.  The
testimony of the witness was offered to show that he is the Purok leader of
Freedom Park 3, Batasan Hills, Quezon City, and that he personally knows that
the complainant and Ricardo Pili lived as husband and wife at Freedom Park III
and that the accused had caused the construction of her sari-sari store.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">He declared, among others,
that he knew the complainant because they were both in the barangay, she
holding the position of barangay secretary; that he knew the accused and his
brother because they were his neighbors; that, as a purok leader, he knew for a
fact that Ricardo Pili and the complainant were live-in partners for one (1)
year at Sgt. Pili’s house at Dama de Noche St., and that the accused
constructed her sari-sari store because he always passed by it on his way to
the multi-purpose hall; and that a certain Hatulan helped the accused construct
the sari-sari store.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">On cross-examination, the witness
clarified that his friendship with the accused was not really personal byt
[sic] he knew the latter as a carpenter in their place; that Ricardo Pili was a
friend but not a close friend; that he is an accused in three cases, two
attempted homicide and one for acts of lasciviousness before the court; and
that the accused requested him to testify in his favor.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It is
doctrinally settled that “the assessment of the credibility of witnesses and
their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, because of its
unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their
demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination.  These are the most significant factors in
evaluating the sincerity of witnesses and in unearthing the truth, especially in
the face of conflicting testimonies.  Through its observations during the entire proceedings, the trial court
can be expected to determine, with reasonable discretion, whose testimony to
accept and which witness to disbelieve.  Verily, findings of the trial court on such matters will not be
disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been
overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted so as to materially affect the
disposition of the case.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> In the instant case, appellant has
failed to present any substantial evidence or argument to convince us to modify
or reverse the findings of the trial court.  On the contrary, after careful examination of the records, we find the
trial court’s judgment, except the grant of moral damages, worthy of
affirmation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">This Court has
repeatedly expressed that “in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape
where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant
must be scrutinized with extreme caution.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> In keeping with this principle, we

support the conviction of rape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Carnal knowledge

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The above-quoted
testimony is bereft of equivocation and constitutes an unmistakable narration
of consummated rape.  “It is a truism
that when an alleged victim of rape says that she was violated, she says in
effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her, and
so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be
convicted on the basis thereof.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> This is so in the instant case, in

rape cases is that physical resistance need not be established when
intimidation is exercised upon the victim and the latter submits herself, against
her will, to the rapist’s embrace because of fear for life and personal
safety.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The complainant clearly testified
that appellant brandished a knife at her and threatened to kill her with
it.  She was obviously cowed into
submission by the real and present threat of physical  harm  on her person.  Besides, although no laceration was found on
the genital area of the victim, who had had four children, the abrasion on her
left shoulder is enough evidence of the struggle that ensued.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

false and inconsistent with ordinary human experience and the normal order of
things.  The defense stresses that it is
unimaginable how the accused-appellant could poke a knife at the right side of
the complainant’s body when they were facing each other, with the left hand of
accused-appellant embracing the complainant.  If accused-appellant was holding the knife with his right hand, he must
have poked it at the left side of complainant’s body.</span><a style="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> We are not persuaded.  The partners must have been constantly moving
as the ravager tried to pin down the victim, who tried to struggle away until,
overcome by force, she succumbed to the intimidation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense also
points out: “We are amazed how the penis of the accused-appellant [could] be
inside complainant’s vagina while the former [was] in a kneeling position, his
right hand holding a lighter probing the latter’s vagina if she had
menstruation.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> This is a clutch at straws.  The acts described were not necessarily
simultaneous.  That the narration of the
events, which were in themselves traumatic, was less than letter-perfect is
understandable, considering that the story was extracted through questions and
answers in open court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense also
asks why the victim did not escape when the first opportunity presented
itself.  This is really a minor
point.  When a rape victim becomes
paralyzed with fear, she cannot be expected to think and act coherently.  Her failure to immediately take advantage of
the early opportunity to escape does not automatically vitiate the credibility
of her account.  In any event, the Court
notes that she eventually managed to escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Next, appellant
contends that the medical finding does not support the claim of the complainant</span><a style="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> that her thigh was caught in the
door as she wrestled with the accused.  Again, this is captious reasoning.  It is common knowledge that the constitution and physical make-up of
individuals vary.  The fact that no
abrasion or contusion was found on complainant’s left thigh does not
necessarily negate the possibility that, indeed, her left thigh was caught in
the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense
further argues that complainant’s narration of the attempted apprehension of
the accused on the day of the incident itself is implausible.</span><a style="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> If the policemen went to the house
of the accused to apprehend him, they should have been more assertive of their
right to enforce their duty.  This is
easily explained by the fact that the policemen could not have arrested the
accused, as they had no warrant of arrest.  Hence, they only invited him for questioning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense
likewise asserts that if the appellant was really guilty, he would have
escaped, considering that he had stayed in his house the next day, after having
been apprised of the complaint lodged against him the night before.  It contends that the non-flight of the
accused is a categorical indicium of innocence.  We do not agree.  This
Court has repeatedly held that “there is no law or principle which guarantees
that non-flight <i>per se </i>is proof, let alone conclusive proof, of one’s
innocence and, as in the case of alibi, such defense is unavailing when placed
astride the undisputed fact that there is positive identification of the
felon.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense also
assails the credibility of Carlito Ocenar.  If said witness really saw the accused brandishing a knife and uttering
threatening statements, he should have asked the neighbors or the authorities
for assistance.  His abject indifference
to the danger that lurked around a friend is labeled as abnormal.  We cannot subscribe to this idea.  It is true that said witness -- as a
concerned citizen, more so as a friend -- should have done something to help
the complainant.  But it must be
stressed that not everyone can be expected to be brave and heroic.  As stated by the trial court  in its decision, “gone are the days of the
knights in shining armor.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> His cowardice or unconcern does
not, by itself, negate the credibility of his corroborative testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Finally,
appellant ascribes ill motive to the complainant who allegedly wanted to hit
back at him for his opposition to her extramarital affair with his
brother.  To quote the appellant:
“Apparently, the trial court has become oblivious of the commonplace occurrence
in our midst that crimes more heinous and dastardly than rape have been
committed in the name and by reason of ‘LOVE’ or lack thereof.  A spurned or abandoned suitor or lover is at
times driven by a devilish force to commit acts only heartless beasts can do.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> We disagree.  The alleged ill motive, even if true, is too
flimsy and inconsequential.  Granting <i>arguendo</i>
that the accused and the complainant did not get along well, the Court does not
see how the complainant, a married woman, could demean her womanhood, risk
public censure, and expose herself to the rigors, embarrassments and headaches
of a public trial, if her motive was other than to secure justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Denial and Alibi<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In comparison
with the clear and straightforward testimony of the complainant and her
witnesses, the defenses of denial and alibi, which appellant relies upon, are
discredited and shopworn.  “In the case
of alibi, it is elementary case law that the requirements of time and place be
strictly complied with by the defense, meaning that the accused must not only
show that he was somewhere else but that it was also physically impossible for
him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> This the defense utterly failed to
do.  The appellant testified that he was
watching basketball in the house of Ricardo Malto when the incident happened.</span><a style="" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> He stated further that the distance
between the house of Ricardo and that of the offended party could be traversed
in “a minute, maybe 2 to 3 minutes.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Clearly, the proximity of the
houses in question refutes the defense of alibi.  In any event, “we have ruled so many times to the point of
triteness that denial and alibi cannot prevail over positive identification.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court
awarded moral damages to the complainant in the amount of <s>P</s>30,000.  This award cannot be sustained for lack of evidentiary
