				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. No. 33716, affirming the ruling of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 58, of Makati, Metro Manila.
<p>The facts are as follows:
</p><p>Petitioner filed an action against private respondents for the 
recovery of a sum of money with damages and preliminary attachment. It 
alleged that sometime in 1983, A.T. Diaz Realty, through Anita Diaz, 
bought from Ricardo Lorenzo his undivided share in a parcel of land 
which he owned in common with Servando Solomon. In connection with this 
transaction, Diaz issued a check for P60,000.00 in the name of Ricardo 
Lorenzo’s agent, private respondent Crispulo Arboleda. The check, dated 
November 7, 1983, was to be drawn against the current account of A.T. 
Diaz Realty in the Marikina branch of the Security Bank and Trust Co. 
(SBTC). According to Diaz, the money was part of the purchase price of 
the land. It was to be used to pay the capital gains tax on the 
transaction and to reimburse Solomon for payments he had made for 
delinquent real estate taxes on the land. In return, Solomon would 
deliver to Diaz the title to the land.
</p><p>On November 8, 1983, Solomon informed Diaz that, as he had not 
yet been reimbursed by private respondent, he could not deliver to Diaz 
the title to the land. Diaz decided to reimburse Solomon and to pay the 
capital gains tax herself. Consequently, she issued two more checks, one
 for P20,000.00, in the name of Solomon for the reimbursement, and 
another one for P40,000.00, payable to bearer, for the payment of the 
tax. Thereafter, on the same date, she ordered petitioner to stop 
payment on the check. Diaz allegedly advised private respondent of the 
order and requested the return of the check to her.
</p><p>Instead of returning the check to Diaz, however, private 
respondent encashed it on November 24, 1983. For their part, employees 
of petitioner bank failed to notice that the check was the subject of a 
stop payment order and allowed private respondent to encash it. (It 
appears that the drawer, A.T. Diaz Realty, had two accounts with 
petitioner, a savings account and a current account. It had an agreement
 with petitioner for automatic transfer which made it possible for the 
drawer to draw a check against its current account and have it supported
 by funds from the savings account, if funds from the current account 
were insufficient to cover the amount of the check. The stop payment 
order issued by A.T. Diaz Realty was posted in the current account 
ledger. However, when the check was presented for encashment, bank 
personnel consulted not the current account ledger in which the stop 
payment order was posted but the savings account ledger, to see if the 
funds therein deposited were sufficient to cover the amount of the 
check. Since no stop payment order was posted in that ledger, the check 
was encashed.) 
</p><p>The error was discovered only the next day, November 25, 1983. 
Petitioner recredited the amount (P60,000.00) of the check to A.T. Diaz 
Realty’s account. 
</p><p>Bank officials went to see respondent Arboleda to ask for the 
return of the amount of P60,000.00. But they were told the money had 
been turned over to Amador Libongco. When asked by bank officials, 
Libongco did not deny receipt of the money, but said he would return it 
provided Diaz showed him the receipt for payment of the capital gains 
tax.
</p><p>As Diaz failed to show receipts, Arboleda and Libongco refused to
 return the money. Petitioner, therefore, filed the instant suit.
</p><p>In their answer, Arboleda and Libongco denied any obligation to 
return the money, alleging that it was due them, the P45,000.00 as 
payment for the balance of the purchase price, and the P15,000.00 as 
payment for Arboleda’s commission as agent. Arboleda also denied having 
been notified of the stop payment order, while Libongco denied having 
received the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Libongco died on January 19, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and, accordingly, the case against him was dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>On May 21, 1990, the trial court rendered its decision, 
dismissing petitioner’s complaint. It ruled that private respondent and 
Libongco had no obligation to return the P60,000.00 to Diaz. First, 
because private respondent was entitled to P15,000.00 as his commission.
 Second, because Diaz could not demand reimbursement for the amount she 
paid for capital gains tax without receipts to show for the payment. The
 trial court found that no tax had actually been paid as the sale of the
 land was antedated May 21, 1976 to avoid payment of the capital gains 
tax. Consequently, it was held, petitioner should not have recredited 
A.T. Diaz Realty with the P60,000.00. 
</p><p>The reason given for the stop payment order was “transaction 
incomplete.” However, according to the trial court, since the sale of 
the land had been completed on November 22, 1983, when the sale to A.T. 
Diaz Realty was annotated on the title while the check was encashed on 
November 24, 1983, the transaction had already been completed at the 
time the check was encashed. The reason given for the stop payment 
order, i.e., that “transaction incomplete” was, thus, a gross 
misrepresentation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>The trial court ruled that petitioner incurred no liability even 
if it encashed the check despite a stop payment order, because of a note
 in the stop payment order form:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>[T]he depositor agrees . . . not to hold the bank liable on account
 of payment contrary to the request . . . if the same occurs through 
inadvertence, accident or oversight. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals which, as earlier stated,
 affirmed the decision of the trial court. Hence, this petition. 
Petitioner contends: 
</p><ol><li>  The Court of Appeals erred in upholding the decision of the 
lower court dismissing the complaint and in not ordering respondent 
Arboleda to return the value of the subject check to petitioner.
  </li><li>  The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the decision of the 
lower court not ordering respondent Arboleda to pay petitioner interest 
on the value of the subject check, and exemplary damages, attorney’s 
fees and cost of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  </li></ol>
<p>The petition must fail.
</p><p>Petitioner contends that whatever claim respondent has against 
Anita Diaz is immaterial to this case. It is argued that private 
respondent has an obligation to return the money he received based on 
Art. 2154 of the Civil Code, which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>If something is received when there is no right to demand it, and 
it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it 
arises.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contention has no merit. There was no contractual relation 
created between petitioner and private respondent as a result of the 
payment by the former of the amount of the check. Petitioner simply paid
 the check for and in behalf of Anita Diaz. Therefore, the question 
whether private respondent Crispulo Arboleda has a right to keep the 
proceeds of the check is very relevant to this action brought to recover
 the amount. As private respondent points out:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>It is Anita Diaz to whom respondent sold their property. It is 
Anita Diaz who issued the subject check in payment of the balance of the
 purchase price, and earmarked for the payment of the capital gains tax 
and agent’s commission for the sale of the property. If the check was 
dishonored upon presentment for payment, respondent cannot sue 
petitioner but only the drawer (Anita Diaz) for lack of privity. The 
funds from which the check shall be paid belong to Anita Diaz and merely
 deposited with the petitioner bank. The stop payment order was issued 
by Anita Diaz for alleged “incomplete transaction” which is a 
misrepresentation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether petitioner is liable to Anita Diaz for cashing the check 
after it had been ordered not to pay is a matter between them. By 
restoring the amount it had paid to the account of A.T. Diaz Realty, 
petitioner merely stepped into the shoes of the drawer. Consequently, 
its present action is subject to the defenses which private respondent 
Arboleda might raise had this action been instituted by Anita Diaz. 
</p><p>What appears to have happened in this case is that there was an 
agreement that if Anita Diaz, the drawer of the check, paid the capital 
gains tax, she would be reimbursed the amount she had paid to Arboleda. 
Claiming that she had paid the capital gains tax, Diaz issued a stop 
payment order to petitioner and asked for the return of the check she 
had issued to Arboleda. As she could not show any receipt for payment, 
however, Arboleda refused to return the check. Arboleda instead cashed 
the check and refused to pay its proceeds.
</p><p>Not only was there no receipt presented in this case to prove 
payment of the tax by Anita Diaz. There are circumstances which render 
Anita Diaz’ claim that she has paid the tax doubtful: (1) the Deputy 
Registrar of Deeds of Marikina testified that they did not have any 
record showing payment of the capital gains tax;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (2) the check for the P40,000.00, which Anita Diaz claimed she had issued in payment of the tax, was payable to cash,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 and thus, it could not be determined to whom the proceeds of such check
 were paid; and (3) Jose Angeles, to whom the check was allegedly given 
by Anita Diaz, was not presented in court.
</p><p>Petitioner contends that defenses against Anita Diaz should not 
be considered in this case because she has not been impleaded as a 
party. It appears, however, that petitioner was ordered by the trial 
court to implead Diaz but it did not do so on the ground that it was 
going to present her as a witness.
</p><p>Indeed, even if petitioner is considered to have paid Anita Diaz 
in behalf of Arboleda, its right to recover from Arboleda would be only 
to the extent that the payment benefitted Arboleda, because the payment 
(recrediting) was made without the consent of Arboleda. Since Arboleda 
denies owing any obligation to Diaz, petitioner cannot ask for 
reimbursement. Thus, Art. 1236 of the Civil Code states: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>The creditor is not bound to accept payment or performance by a 
third person who has no interest in the fulfillment of the obligation, 
unless there is a stipulation to the contrary. Whoever pays for another 
may demand from the debtor what he has paid, except that if he paid 
without the knowledge or against the will of the debtor, he can recover 
only insofar as the payment has been beneficial to the debtor.
  </p>
