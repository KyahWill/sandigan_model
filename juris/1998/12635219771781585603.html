evidence.  However, the comprising
circumstances must be duly proven, consistent with each other and lead with
moral certainty to only one conclusion: that the accused is guilty.  If the totality of such circumstances
eliminates beyond reasonable doubt the possibility of innocence, conviction is
proper; otherwise, the accused must be acquitted.  If said accused, however, took advantage of the effects of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the
Appellee’s Brief, the solicitor general presents the following narration of the
kidnapping:</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“On August 19, 1992 at
around 9:45 in the evening, Engr. Miguel E. Resus  (‘Engr. Resus’) and his wife, Dr. Bernardita B. Resus (‘Dr.
Resus’), arrived at their residence/clinic at Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del
Sur, from a novena they attended.  Waiting for the Resus spouses at the clinic which adjoins the Resus
spouses’ residence were three men who identified themselves as Commander Bobong
Gonzaga (who is actually Raul Mondaga), Commander Bongkoy (who is actually
Maluenda) and alias ‘Alex’.  Upon the
arrival of the Resus spouses, Mondaga declared that they came upon orders of a
certain Father Simon, an alleged NPA Commander, with his directive to solicit
money and medicines needed for the victims of the recent military-NPA encounter
at Melale, Agusan del Sur.  The trio
demanded from the couple medicines and money in the amount of <s>P</s>20,000.00,
but when the couple told them that they did not have such an amount, they
lowered their demand to <s>P</s>10,000.00, and reduced it still to <s>P</s>5,000.00
when the couple still could not produce the said amount.  Finally, the demand was lowered to any amount
the Resus couple could provide.  The
latter gave the amount of <s>P</s>500.00 plus assorted medicines worth <s>P</s>800.00.  After they were given the money and
medicines, the trio demanded that they be driven by Engr. Resus in his
Volkswagen car to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur, but the couple begged off
reasoning that their car [did] have any sufficient gasoline and that the car
was not in good running condition to travel that night.  Mondaga then demanded that very early in the
morning, the couple should prepare the vehicle so Engr. Resus [could] drive
them to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur.  They left the clinic with [a] threat not to tell anybody about their
coming, otherwise they [would] kill all the members of their family and blow-up
the clinic.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next day or on August
20, 1992 at around 5:00 o’clock in the morning, Mondaga arrived at the
residence of the Resus couple.  Mondaga
hurried up Engr. Resus as he [would] meet his companions who were ferried by
Legarto.  Engr. Resus then drove Mondaga
to Andanan.  As the two passed along
Andanan, they met Legarto, who was on his way back to Diatogon after his
passengers, i.e., Maluenda and Alex, alighted from his motorcycle and
[waited]  for Mondaga and Engr. Resus at
Andanan.  Maluenda and Alex then rode
with Mondaga and Engr. Resus to Barobo.  Upon reaching Barobo, Mondaga told Engr. Resus that they [would] go to
San Francisco instead of going to San Roque.  They, however, did not reach San Francisco, and instead they stopped at
Alegria.  Upon reaching Alegria, Mondaga
ordered Engr. Resus that he had to go with them.  Against his will, Engr. Resus went with the three.  They went to the mountain hiking for almost
two (2) hours between the boundary of Cardon and Alegria.  Upon reaching a hut, Mondaga told him that
he had forgotten something and had to go back and that Engr. Resus had to stay
there.  So Engr. Resus, Maluenda, Alex
and Gil Bueno passed the night in the farmhut.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile at the house of
the Resus couple, Dr. Resus was informed by the midwife that Mondaga came at
around 4:00 p.m. when Dr. Resus was out.  Mondaga told the midwife that he [would] come back.  Mondaga arrived at the Resus clinic at
around 7:00 in the evening.  Mondaga
demanded from Dr. Resus the amount of <s>P</s>300,000.00 for the release of Engr.
Resus.  Dr. Resus told Mondaga that she
[could] only produce <s>P</s>10,000.00.  Mondaga told Dr. Resus to reserve the amount for he [would] get it the
following morning.  He also instructed
Dr. Resus to look for the firearm of her husband.  Dr. Resus then searched for the gun (Exh. H) of her husband and
after finding it in the cabinet in their room, gave the same to Mondaga.  After [the gun was given to him], Mondaga
demanded for the use of Engr. Resus’ motorcycle, but Dr. Resus told him that
the motorcycle [was] out of order.  So
Mondaga instructed Dr. Resus to get the motorcycle of Legarto, which Dr. Resus
did.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">On August 21, 1992, at
around 4:45 a.m. Mondaga arrived at Dr. Resus’ clinic.  Shortly thereafter, Legarto also arrived in
his motorcycle.  Mondaga demanded that
Dr. Resus go with them but the latter made excuses particularly her
health.  Dr. Resus asked that her helper
Maria Abne go instead to which Mondaga agreed.  At exactly 5:00 a.m., Mondaga, Legarto and Maria Abne left Dr. Resus’
clinic, bringing with them the <s>P</s>10,000.00 Dr. Resus gave and the Magnum
22 of Engr. Resus.  The three arrived at
Alegria, San Francisco, Agusan del Sur at around 7:00 a.m.  Legarto then safely kept his motorcycle
after which they walked to the forest for about 2 hours until they reached a
carabao crossing where Mondaga left Legarto and Maria Abne for 30 minutes.  Mondaga went to the hut where he left Engr.
Resus with a note from Dr. Resus which state[d], ‘Daddy, I have committed only <s>P</s>10,000.00’.  He gave the note to Engr. Resus but told
Engr. Resus that ‘you can afford <s>P</s>300,000.00’.  Engr. Resus pleaded with Mondaga that they [did] not have such
amount so Mondaga lowered his demand to <s>P</s>200,000.00.  Engr. Resus then signed the note stating,
‘Mommy, it is up to you to produce this amount.’  With the note, Mondaga and Legarto went back to Alegria, while
Abne was left with Engr. Resus.  Legarto
who was driving Engr. Resus’ car, went to the house of Nora Gubantes where Dr.
Resus was at that time and informed her that Mondaga [was] waiting [for] her at
SSIFA, St. Christine.  Dr. Resus went
with Legarto at SSIFA, St. Christine where they met Mondaga, who joined them at
the car after which the three proceeded to a deserted place.  Mondaga then handed to Dr. Resus the note
written by Engr. Resus where it was written the <s>P</s>200,000.00 ransom.
[sic]  Dr. Resus told Mondaga that she
[could] only produce <s>P</s>100,000.00  Mondaga agreed to the <s>P</s>100,000.00 on the additional condition
that he [would] no longer return the motorcycle of Legarto and instead to give
to Legarto the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00 as payment for the motorcycle.  Mondaga also instructed Legarto to deliver
the amount of <s>P</s>100,000.00 and the original license of the
motorcycle.  Dr. Resus and Legarto then
went back to the clinic leaving Mondaga behind.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">At around 1:30 p.m. of
August 21, 1992, Dr. Resus, together with Nora Gubantes, went to Lianga to
secure money from the relatives of Dr. Resus.  Since Dr. Resus’ cousins were out of town, the two proceeded to San Francisco,
Agusan del Sur to see Dr. Presentacion Manatad, the mayor of San
Francisco.  Dr. Resus informed Mayor
Manatad about the incident and asked the mayor to give her an amount of <s>P</s>150,000.00
in return for a PNB Check Dr. Resus [would] issue.  Mayor Manatad gave her the amount after Dr. Resus issued PNB
Check No. 621330-AJ in the amount of <s>P</s>150,000.00 (Exh. B).  Dr. Resus gave the money to Nora Gubantes
with the instruction to give the same to Legarto.  Upon reaching Diatogon, Nora Gubantes gave the money to her husband
with the instruction to give the money to Legarto.  Legarto acknowledged receiving the money from Mr. Gubantes on
August 22, 1992.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">On August 22, 1992, Mondaga
arrived at the hut where Engr. Resus was and told that [sic] the latter that he
would be released but that he [would] come back to get the balance of the <s>P</s>300,000.00
in three months.  In the afternoon of
August 22, 1992, Engr. Resus and Maria Abne were released.  The two were driven by Legarto in Engr.
Resus[‘] car.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

arrived at their clinic near their residence at Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del
Sur after attending a novena.  (TSN,
March 16, 1993, p. 3).  There were three
(3) men who were waiting for them at the clinic, later identified as Commander
Bobong Gonzaga (Raul Mondaga), Commander Bongkoy (Daniel Maluenda), and a
certain ‘Alex’ (<i>ibid..</i> p. 5).  Mondaga, upon arrival of the spouses, solicited money and medicines from
them, upon orders of a certain Father Simon, an NPA Commander (<i>ibid..</i> p.
7).  These money and medicines were
needed for the victims of the recent military-NPA encounter at Melale, Agusan

(<i>ibid..</i> p. 8) but lowered it to <s>P</s>10,000.00, and still reduced it

Engr. Resus in his Volkswagen car to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur, but
Engr. Resus declined saying that he could not drive them at 12:00 midnight
because he [did] not have enough gasoline and that his service car [was] not in
good condition to travel in the evening.  (TSN, March 16, 1993, p. 8).  But
one person, Mondaga, insisted that the next morning, a vehicle should be
prepared for a trip to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur. (TSN, March 17,
1993, p. 43)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

morning of August 20, 1992, Mondaga knocked at the door of the clinic.  Engr. Resus was just busy preparing the
vehicle, securing gasoline. (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 44.)  Mondaga rode in the vehicle of Engr. Resus and met his two
companions at Andanan. (<i>ibid..</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Instead of San Roque, the
vehicle stopped at Alegria (TSN, March 16, 1993, p. 11).  The three (Mondaga, Maluenda and Alex) asked
Engr. Resus to go with them.  (<i>ibid..</i>)  They went to the mountains and hiked for
almost two (2) hours between the boundary of Gordon and Alegria. (<i>ibid..</i>)  When they reached the area, Mondaga went
back to Alegria, leaving behind the three who passed the night in the
area.  (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 12)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

4:00 in the afternoon at the clinic of Dr. Resus.  (TSN, March 17, 1993, p. 47)  Dr. Resus was out, but when Mondaga later came back at 7:00 in the evening
and saw Dr. Resus (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 48), he demanded the amount of <s>P</s>300,000.00.  But since Dr. Resus had only <s>P</s>10,000.00,
Mondaga told her to reserve it and he [would] get it the next morning.  (<i>ibid..</i>, pp. 48-49)  After asking for the firearm of Engr. Resus,
(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 51) Mondaga demanded to use the motorcycle of Engr. Resus. (<i>ibid..</i>)  Dr. Resus said that it was out of order. (<i>ibid..</i>)  Mondaga ordered her to secure a motorcycle.
(<i>ibid.</i>) Dr. Resus, together with her maid, Maria Abne, went to the house
of their driver, Rudy Legarto. (TSN, November 23, 1993, p. 22)  Dr. Resus requested Rudy Legarto to drive
for Maria Abne and Mondaga in his motorcycle to Alegria and on his return, to
drive for his Manong Mike. (<i>ibid.</i>)  Legarto refused because of his work.  (<i>ibid.</i>)  But when Dr.
Resus insisted and when told that it was very important to conduct Maria Abne
and Mondaga, and because she was his boss, he agreed. (<i>ibid..</i>)  He was asked to file a leave of absence from
his job. (<i>ibid..</i>)  It is
important to note that it was [Dr.] Resus who got Legarto involved in this
drama.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

morning of August 21, 1992, Legarto drove for Maria Abne and Mondaga to Alegria

p. 23) to a hilly side.   (<i>ibid..</i>)
Legarto and Maria Abne were left behind and Mondaga told them that he [would]
inform his commander to release Engr. Resus. (<i>ibid..</i>)  They were also warned not to escape because
they were guarded.  (<i>ibid..</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">At about 9:00 in the
evening, Engr. Resus, together with Mondaga, arrived.  Legarto was told by Engr. Resus not to worry as he was treated
well.  (<i>ibid..</i>) Engr. Resus told
Mondaga that Legarto was his driver and Maria Abne was his helper. (<i>ibid..</i>)  [O]n the way back, Legarto and Abne walked
five (5) meters ahead while Mondaga and Engr. Resus walked side by side.  Legarto and Abne heard their conversations (<i>ibid.</i>,
pp. 23-24) and Mondaga was demanding <s>P</s>300,000.00. Engr. Resus pleaded
that he [did not] have that amount. (<i>ibid.</i>)  Mondaga them ordered Engr. Resus to make a note to his wife, Dr.
Resus stating that <s>P</s>300,000.00 be given. (<i>ibid.</i>)  After the note was signed, Mondaga got the
keys of the Volkswagen car and the motorcycle while Legarto was brought along
to Alegria.  (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 25)  Engr. Resus and Maria Abne were left
behind.  (<i>ibid.</i>)  When they arrived at Alegria, Mondaga
ordered him to drive the Volkswagen in going back to Diatagon while Mondaga
drove the motorcycle of Legarto. (<i>ibid..</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

told to shut up again. (<i>ibid..</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the Volkswagen car towards the area near the Fisheries School at St. Catherine,
Lianga, Surigao del Sur. (<i>ibid..</i>)  At some point Mondaga joined them in the car.  Dr. Resus allowed Mondaga to sit at the back while she sat in

pleaded  that she [could] only produce <s>P</s>100,000.00.
(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 27) Mondaga agreed, provided the motorcycle of Legarto be
included. (<i>ibid..</i>)  Legarto, at
this point, intervened and told Dr. Resus not to include in the negotiation his
motorcycle because the installment was not yet fully paid.  (<i>ibid..</i>)  Dr. Resus then told him to “just give his motorcycle.” (<i>ibid..</i>)  Then, Mondaga told Dr. Resus that Legarto
would be the one who [would] bring the money to Alegria.  He agreed again because Dr. Resus was his
boss. (<i>ibid..</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

there was an emergency because Engr. Resus was held hostage and he [would]
deliver the money. (<i>ibid..</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">On his way to Alegria, he

another <s>P</s>14,000.00 which was about to be given by Dr. Resus. (<i>ibid..</i>)  However, he advised Dr.  Resus that he would bring only <s>P</s>100,000.00

back to Lianga, where they met Dr. Resus.  Mayor Layno of Lianga commented that if not for your driver and Maria
Abne, Engr. Resus [would] not be rescued. (<i>ibid..</i>) Engr. Resus and Dr.

before the Municipal Judge, he was arrested just when he went out from the
office (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 31).  He was
brought to Patin-ay, Agusan del Sur, where he was detained.  (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 32) While there, he wrote
a letter to Engr. and Dr. Resus for help.  (<i>ibid..</i>) The letter expressed his sentiment and dismay that in
spite of his help, he was included in the case. (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 33)  He denied having driven Mondaga alias Bobong
Gonzaga at any other time.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Similarly,
Maluenda denies knowledge of Mondaga’s plan to commit the said crime.  He accompanied the latter to Mahilom only to
mine for gold and not to plan, much less commit, any crime.  He alleges that he guarded the victim at the
hut only because Mondaga threatened to kill him and his family.  Through counsel, Maluenda presents his own
version of the facts, as follows:</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that on August 20, 1992 at around 10:00 o’clock in the evening, he was in his
house at Barobo when Raul Mondaga came over.  Mondaga told him that he [had] a tunnel in Mahilom and offered Maluenda
a fifty-fifty proposition to gold mine the tunnel.  Maluenda, who [was] a farmer and at the same time a gold miner,
agreed to the proposition.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">On August 21, 1992 at
around 7:00 o’clock in the morning, Maluenda together with Mondaga proceeded to
Sitio Mahilom.  Upon reaching Garden,
Tambis, Surigao del Sur, Mondaga tried to give Maluenda a pistol and grenade
but Maluenda questioned Mondaga’s purpose for bringing the same since they were
just looking for gold inside the tunnel.  Mondaga in turn told Maluenda to just follow what he [ordered] so that
nothing will happen to him, and that Mondaga [would] not hesitate to kill a
person, so Maluenda merely followed Mondaga as he was afraid.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Arriving at Mahilom,
Mondaga and Maluenda proceeded to a hut where the latter saw Engr. Resus and
some other persons.  Mondaga ordered
Maluenda to stay in the hut and feed these persons.  Maluenda in turn retorted that their agreement was to mine for
gold, but Mondaga told him ‘to just follow my order so that nothing will happen
to you, or else I will blast your head and kill your family.’  Inside the hut, Maluenda and Engr. Resus
talked and planned to escape.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next day at around 2:00
in the afternoon, Maluenda, together with Engr. Resus, left but when they
reached Alegria, they met Mondaga.  Mondaga approached Engr. Resus, held his hand and said, do not be afraid
because you can go home.  Mondaga also
told Maluenda not to report the matter to the authorities otherwise, they
[would] all be killed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

at the clinic of Dra. Resus on August 19, 1992.  Furthermore, he denied having received any money from

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court
convicted Legarto, Maluenda and Mondaga, holding that they successfully
perpetrated a clear case of kidnapping.  It gave complete credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses
whom it deemed unquestionably reliable, sincere and candid.  The lower court held that Mondaga was the
mastermind of the kidnapping.  While
Appellant Legarto portrayed himself as a good Samaritan to the Resus couple,
the trial court stated that he was a wolf in sheep’s clothing and described his
testimony as evasive, false and shallow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The court <i>a

explain why he did not testify against Mondaga in the criminal case for
carnapping involving his motorcycle.  His actuations from the outset until the time he delivered the ransom
money betrayed his active participation as a co-principal by indispensable
cooperation in the crime.  Of the <s>P</s>136,000
handed to him for delivery to the kidnappers, Legarto kept <s>P</s>36,000 for
himself.  Legarto confidently refused to
accept <s>P</s>14,000 more from Dr. Resus, saying that what he had  was already sufficient.  He further failed to report the incident to
the police when he had the opportunity to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Through the same
witnesses for the prosecution, Maluenda, who introduced  himself as Commander Dongkoy,  was  positively identified as one of the men who went to Dr. Resus’ clinic on
August 19, 1992.  The kidnap victim also
identified him as the guard at the hideout in Alegria.  Hence, the trial court convicted him as a
co-principal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Court’s Ruling<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The appeal is
partially meritorious as regards Legarto who, in the light of the evidence
presented, should be held liable only as an accessory.  In contrast, Maluenda’s conviction deserves
affirmation, as his culpability in the kidnapping was clearly proven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Legarto’s Culpability<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><i><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Sufficiency of
Circumstantial Evidence<o:p></o:p></span></sup></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The solicitor
general argues for the affirmation of Legarto’s conviction on the ground that
the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses is
generally accorded great respect on appeal.  However, the Court believes that the resolution of this appeal
transcends the issue of the credibility of the witnesses.  There is need to evaluate the sufficiency of
the circumstantial evidence presented to sustain Legarto’s conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court
found Legarto guilty as a principal by indispensable cooperation on the basis
of several pieces of <i>circumstantial evidence,</i> which the solicitor
general depicts as clearly demonstrating his participation.  On the other hand, Legarto asserts that the
same set of evidence is frail and inconclusive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Legarto’s
contention merits consideration.  A
principal by indispensable cooperation is defined by Article 17 of the Revised
Penal Code thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“ART. 17. <i>Principals. – </i>The
following are considered principals:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">x x x<span style=""> </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those who cooperate in the commission of the offense by another
act without which it would not have been accomplished.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Legarto cannot
be convicted under this definition because the prosecution failed to allege,
much less prove, any overt act on his part showing direct participation in the
kidnapping itself, his participation in the incident being limited to acts
committed after the abduction was already consummated.  He was not with the kidnappers (1) when they
forcibly solicited money and medicine from the Resus couple, (2) when they
brought the kidnap victim to Alegria, and (3) when Mondaga demanded ransom for the
victim’s release.  Together with the
Resus’ housemaid, he accompanied Mondaga to the hideout in Alegria only upon
Dr. Resus’ request.  In short, the
prosecution failed to piece together a clear story as to how Legarto figured in
the kidnapping caper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Admittedly,
circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to convict an accused as a principal
by indispensable cooperation in accordance with Sec. 4, Rule 133 of the Rules
of Court.</span><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> It may also show conspiracy.  Thus, this Court meticulously examined the
pleadings, the records and the assailed Decision, in order to evaluate the
sufficiency of Legarto’s conviction.  The pieces of circumstantial evidence used by the prosecution and
accepted by the trial court are enumerated and evaluated <i>seriatim</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: left;" align="left"><i><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Acquaintance Is
Inconclusive Proof of Participation<o:p></o:p></span></sup></i></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">That Mondaga frequented the house of Legarto in Diatagon proves that he
knew the latter.  Witness Sanchez
testified that she even saw them riding  Legarto’s  motorcycle  during  the  town  fiesta  on June 24, 1992.  However, this
event occurred about two months before the kidnapping on August 19 to 22,
1992.  Considering that the prosecution
did not present any evidence to show that the plan to kidnap Engineer Resus was
hatched as early as June 24, 1992, the fact that Legarto and Mondaga were
together during the town fiesta should not be considered as proof of Legarto’s
direct participation in the crime.  Likewise, that Legarto was acquainted with Mondaga does not prove that
the former had a hand in the kidnapping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

general harps on the fact that, on August 20, 1992,  Legarto was seen transporting Maluenda and “Alex” to Andanan on
his motorcycle.  He claims that this is
strong proof of Legarto’s complicity, as it shows that Legarto had knowledge of
the plan to kidnap Engineer Resus.  The
trial court, for its part, said that this fact “points to the clear perception
that xxx he was part of the dubious criminal plan.”  The “fact” relied upon by the solicitor general and the trial
court, however, is a mere speculation.  This is clear from Engineer Resus’ testimony, the pertinent portion of

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Engineer Resus
merely said that he saw Legarto heading back to Diatagon.  He did not witness Maluenda and “Alex” on
board Legarto’s motorcycle or alighting therefrom; he only saw the two at
Andanan waiting for Mondaga and him.  In
fact, Engineer Resus did not actually see Legarto transport Mondaga’s
companions.  Hence, the statement that
Legarto did so is a conclusion unsupported by Resus’ testimony, a mere
speculation of the event that <i>might</i> have preceded what Engineer Resus
saw.  Its true nature as a conjecture is
evident from the averment of the trial court that “xxx they were conveyed there
by Rodrigo Legarto with the use of his motorcycle, as he was even encountered
on the road on his return back to Diatagon that morning by Engr. Resus.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">From the
foregoing, it is clear that Legarto’s alleged direct participation in the
kidnapping is without factual basis;  it
is nothing more than an inference drawn from a presumption.  And because circumstantial evidence not
adequately established cannot become the basis of conviction, such inference
cannot be given evidentiary weight to support Legarto’s conviction as a
principal by indispensable cooperation.</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The solicitor
general avers that Mondaga’s instruction to Dr. Resus to requisition Legarto’s
motorcycle proves Legarto’s complicity in the felonious scheme.  The averment is inaccurate because Mondaga,
in accordance with Dr. Resus’ testimony, had originally requisitioned the
victim’s motorcycle, but the latter told him that it was out of order.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> So, Mondaga asked for Legarto’s
motorcycle instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">That Mondaga
chose Legarto’s motorcycle when he could have demanded any other two-wheel
vehicle can be explained by the fact that, several times prior to the
kidnapping, he had taken a ride on the said motorcycle.  Note that Legarto used the motorcycle as a
vehicle for hire in the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The solicitor

designated as collector of the ransom money, proves the latter’s
participation.  The trial court, on the
same point, said:</span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

having withheld at his house a part of the ransom money amounting to <s>P</s>36,000.00(?)

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">These averments,
however, are sufficiently rebutted by Legarto’s allegation that, out of loyalty
to his former boss, he participated in the release of the kidnap victim, not in
his detention. The testimony of Engineer Resus -- that Legarto was at Alegria
in order to fetch  the  former -- is cited by the defense as
follows:</span><a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Regarding the <s>P</s>36,000
which he kept, Legarto alleges that this was payment for his motorcycle which
was taken by Mondaga.  He claims that he

by Dr. Resus who told him that she would replace it.</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Confirming this, Dr. Resus

Thus, such payment could not rationally constitute
evidence of direct participation or of conspiracy in the kidnapping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: left;" align="left"><i><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Non-appearance at
the Hearings of the Carnapping Case<o:p></o:p></span></sup></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The solicitor
general and the trial court posit that direct participation was established by
the failure of Legarto to testify against Mondaga in the criminal case for the
carnapping of Legarto’s motorcycle.  The
excuses of Legarto for his inability to attend the hearings -- that he did not
have transportation and that he had stomach ache -- were branded by the
solicitor general as “flimsy and incredible.”  After all, Legarto was able to appear sans such problems when the trial
court ordered the release of the motorcycle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The contention
is untenable.  Legarto’s lack of
interest in pursuing the criminal case against Mondaga may be less than
laudable, but it does not necessarily show direct participation in the
kidnapping.  Dismissal of cases due to
failure to prosecute is a common legal experience.  Legarto’s excuses for failing to prosecute may be dubious, but
they cannot become the basis for his conviction as a principal by indispensable
cooperation in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: left;" align="left"><i><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">“Finger of

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the assailed
Decision, the trial court states, “As to how accused Raul Mondaga came to know
that the Resus couple could pay [the] ransom, the finger of suspicion points to
Legarto as [the] source.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> However, an examination of the
transcripts of stenographic notes reveals no testimony that Legarto provided
the kidnappers with information regarding the spouses’ finances.  This was pure speculation or suspicion
–nothing more, nothing less.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to Convict By Circumstantial Evidence<o:p></o:p></span></sup></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A conviction
based on circumstantial evidence requires the concurrence of the following
elements: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the
inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the
circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.</span><a style="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> For such a conviction to withstand
judicial scrutiny, the prosecution must further show that all the circumstances
are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the accused is innocent or with any
other rational hypothesis except that of his guilt.</span><a style="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In this case,
the totality of the pieces of circumstantial evidence being imputed to Legarto
does not foreclose the possibility that he took no part in the criminal
enterprise and does not, therefore, overcome his constitutional right to be
presumed innocent.</span><a style="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The presumption
of innocence is founded upon substantive law and basic principles of
justice.  It serves to balance the
scales of justice in what would otherwise be an uneven contest between a single
individual accused of a crime and the prosecution which has all the resources
of the government at its command.  Thus,
this presumption cannot be overcome by mere suspicion or conjecture that the
defendant probably committed the crime or that he had the opportunity to do
so.  The prosecution is required to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  Otherwise, the accused must be set free in
accordance with the rule that conflicts in and insufficiency of evidence must
be resolved in favor of the theory of innocence rather than the theory of
guilt.</span><a style="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Although the
trial court did not pass upon conspiracy as a source of Legarto’s culpability,
we deem it proper to do so, since it was alleged in the Information.  In theory, conspiracy exists when two or
more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and
decide to commit it.</span><a style="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Once established, the act of one
becomes the act of all.  Further,
conspiracy must be shown to exist as clearly as the commission of the offense
itself, although direct proof is not essential.</span><a style="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Prior agreement or assent to the
crime is usually inferred from the acts of the accused showing concerted
action, common design and objective, actual cooperation, concurrence of
sentiments, or community of interest.</span><a style="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> In most cases, like the one at bar,

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In Legarto’s
case, conspiracy was not at all established by the prosecution.  The familiarity between Legarto and Mondaga
is insufficient proof, as conspiracy transcends companionship.</span><a style="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Moreover, Mondaga’s act of meeting
Legarto on the road to Andanan does not show conspiracy, because a merely
casual or unintended meeting, like passive presence, is not proof of conspiracy.</span><a style="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Similarly insufficient as
circumstantial evidence to prove conspiracy were Mondaga’s demand for the use
of Legarto’s motorcycle, Legarto’s collecting the ransom money and delivering
part of it, and Legarto’s failure to testify against Mondaga due to either
refusal or neglect.  We stress that
conspiracy must be founded on facts, not on mere inferences and conjectures.</span><a style="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Without an allegation of any overt

Criminal Liability<o:p></o:p></span></sup></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Despite its
belief that Legarto was not a co-principal or a co-conspirator, this Court
cannot completely free him from criminal liability.  Established by the prosecution are the following: (1) he reported
the “loss” of the motorcycle to the police authorities despite the fact that it
had been given to Mondaga as part of the ransom; (2) he had received <s>P</s>36,000
for it; (3) he paid the balance of the purchase price of the motorcycle with
the said money; and (4) he claimed, regained and retained its possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Legarto may not
have had a direct hand in the kidnapping, but he received part of the ransom
and used it to pay off his arrears in his motorcycle loan.  Thus, having knowledge of the kidnapping for
ransom and without having directly participated therein, he took part in the
crime <i>subsequent </i>to its commission by profiting from its effects.</span><a style="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> He may not be the devil with the
face of an angel that the trial court described, but he is definitely not a
saint.   He is criminally liable as an
accessory to the crime of kidnapping for ransom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Under Article 19
of the Revised Penal Code, accessories are defined as those who (1) have
knowledge of the commission of the crime, (2) did not take part in its
commission as principal or accomplice, but (3) took part in it subsequent to
its commission by any of the three modes enumerated in this article,</span><a style="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> one of which is by profiting or by

proven in Legarto’s case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">As an accessory
to the consummated crime of kidnapping, the penalty imposable upon Legarto is
two degrees lower than that prescribed by law under Article 267 of the said
Code.</span><a style="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Since no modifying circumstance is

sought by Maluenda on the ground that only Mondaga executed the acts

than words.  Established by the prosecution
beyond cavil was his direct participation in the criminal conspiracy to kidnap
Engineer Resus, who testified that Maluenda was one of the men who had, on the
night of August 19, 1992, extorted money and medicine from him and his wife,

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Although only
Mondaga verbally extorted money and demanded ransom from the Resus couple, it
is evident that the kidnapping was committed with Maluenda’s
participation.  Beyond reasonable doubt,
Maluenda’s actions exhibited a community of interest and a concurrence of
sentiment with Mondaga.  Consequently
inevitable as they relate to Maluenda are the following holdings of the trial
court:</span><a style="" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“xxx Simply stated, the
witnesses for the prosecution, in contrast to that [of] the defense, are, in
the Court’s assessment, unquestionably reliable, sincere and candor [sic] in
their testimonies which [were] very logical and credible.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">and, as between
the affirmative testimony of the prosecution witnesses and that of the negative
versions of the defense, the former [was] more stronger [sic].  The accuseds [sic] resorted to unfounded
denials.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">To summarize, the Court
finds that a clear case of kidnapping for ransom [had] been successfully
committed by all the accuseds [sic] charged in the information, who are all
private individuals; that the victim of that heinous crime [was] Engr. Miguel
E. Resus; that ransom money was actually paid in consideration of his release
on the third day that he was forcibly deprived of his liberty; xxx.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Accused Raul Mondaga, alias
Bobong Gonzaga, and Accused Daniel Maluenda, alias Commander Dongkoy have both
been positively identified as among the active perpetrators. x x x x.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

negating the trial court’s assessment of the circumstantial evidence pertains

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, the appeal is partially
