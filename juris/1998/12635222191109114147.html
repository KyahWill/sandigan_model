				<H3>GOVERNOR JOSIE CASTILLO-CO, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE ROBERT BARBERS, DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN JESUS GUERRERO, EMILIO GONZALES, III AND CONGRESSMAN JUNIE CUA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>KAPUNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Governor Josie Castillo-Co of Quirino, through this 
special civil action for certiorari and prohibition, with prayer for 
temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction, seeks to 
nullify the Order of the Deputy Ombudsman directing her preventive 
suspension.
<p>On 27 June 1997, Quirino Congressman Junie Cua filed a complaint 
before the Office of the Ombudsman against Governor Castillo-Co and 
Provincial Engineer Virgilio Ringor. Congressman Cua alleged that in the
 course of its investigation in aid of legislation, the House of 
Representatives Committee on Good Government chaired by him uncovered 
irregularities in the purchase of heavy equipment by the Governor and 
the Provincial Engineer. Congressman Cua charged that the equipment 
purchased was “reconditioned” instead of “brand new” as required by 
resolutions of the province’s Sanggunian authorizing such purchase. 
Other irregularities claimed to have been committed included 
overpricing, lack of public bidding, lack of inspection, advance payment
 prior to delivery in violation of Section 338 of the Local Government 
Code, and an attempt to cover up such irregularities. Congressman Cua 
thus accused Governor Castillo-Co and Provincial Engineer Ringor of 
violating Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices
 Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> as amended, and Articles 213<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 217<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code.
</p><p>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 4 
July 1997, that is, a week after the complaint was filed, Governor 
Castillo-Co and Provincial Engineer Ringor were placed under preventive 
suspension for a period of six (6) months. Said order was signed by 
Emilio A. Gonzalez III, Director, and approved by Jesus Guerrero, Deputy
 Ombudsman for Luzon.
</p><p>Governor Castillo-Co and Provincial Engineer Ringor thereafter 
filed separate motions for reconsideration. Both motions were denied in a
 “Joint Order”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated 1 August 1997 signed by Director Gonzales and approved by Deputy Ombudsman Guerrero.
</p><p>On 12 August 1997, Governor Castillo-Co filed the present 
petition. Petitioner imputes grave abuse of discretion upon the Deputy 
Ombudsman for issuing the order of preventive suspension against her. As
 may be deduced from the petition, the grounds invoked in support 
thereof are:
</p><blockquote>
<ol><li>               The Deputy Ombudsman is not authorized to sign the order of preventive suspension; </li><li>               The issuance of such order was hasty and selective, and deprived petitioner of due process; and </li><li>               The conditions required to sustain petitioner’s 
preventive suspension have not been met and that, at any rate, the 
duration thereof is excessive. </li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In a Resolution dated 26 August 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> this Court resolved, among others, to grant petitioner’s prayer for a temporary restraining order.
</p><p>The petition has no merit.
</p><p align="center">I
</p><p>Petitioner claims that under Republic Act No. 7975,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 only the Ombudsman has the authority to sign the order placing 
officials with a 27 salary grade or above, like petitioner-governor, 
under preventive suspension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 In this case, the suspension order was neither signed nor approved by 
Ombudsman Aniano Desierto. Rather, said order was signed by Director 
Emilio Gonzales III and approved by Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon Jesus 
Guerrero.
</p><p>There is nothing in RA 7975, however, that would remotely suggest
 that only the Ombudsman, and not his Deputy, may sign an order 
preventively suspending officials occupying positions classified as 
grade 27 or above.
</p><p>On the other hand, Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>SEC. 24. <em>Preventive Suspension</em>. -- The Ombudsman <u>or his Deputy</u>
 may preventively suspend any officer or employee under his authority 
pending an investigation, if in his judgment, the evidence of guilt is 
strong, and (a) the charge against such officer or employee involves 
dishonesty, oppression or gross misconduct, or neglect in the 
performance of duty; or (b) the charge would warrant removal from the 
service; or (c) the respondent’s continued stay in office may prejudice 
the case filed against him. </p>
  <p>The preventive suspension shall continue until the case is 
terminated by the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six months, 
without pay, except when the delay in the disposition of the case by the
 Office of the Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of 
the respondent, in which case the period of such delay shall not be 
counted in computing the period of suspension herein provided. 
(Underscoring supplied.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Section 9, Rule III of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of Ombudsman<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>SEC. 9. <em>Preventive suspension</em>. – Pending investigation, 
the respondent may be preventively suspended without pay for a period of
 not more than six (6) months, if, in the judgment of the Ombudsman <u>or his proper deputy</u>,
 the evidence of guilt is strong, and (a) the charge against such 
officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or gross misconduct,
 or neglect in the performance of duty, (b) the charge would warrant 
removal from the service; or (c) the respondent’s continued stay in 
office may prejudice the case filed against him. </p>
  <p>If the administrative investigation is not terminated within the 
period the respondent is suspended, the respondent shall be 
automatically reinstated unless the delay in the disposition of the case
 is due to the fault, negligence or any cause attributable to the 
respondent, in which case the period of such delay shall not be counted 
in computing the period of suspension. (Underscoring supplied.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under these provisions, there cannot be any doubt that the Ombudsman 
or his Deputy may preventively suspend an officer or employee, where 
appropriate, as indicated by the word “or” between the “Ombudsman” and 
“his Deputy.” The word “or” is a disjunctive term signifying 
disassociation and independence of one thing from each of the other 
things enumerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The law does not require that only the Ombudsman himself may sign the order of suspension.
</p><p align="center">II
</p><p>Petitioner next questions the manner by which the suspension 
order was issued. She claims that she was denied due process because she
 was not afforded the opportunity to controvert the evidence against her
 before the order of preventive suspension was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 A preventive suspension, however, can be decreed on an official under 
investigation after charges are brought and even before the charges are 
heard since the same is not in the nature of a penalty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> but merely a preliminary step in an administrative investigation. Thus, in <em>Lastimosa vs. Vasquez</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> we quoted with favor our pronouncement in <em>Nera vs. Garcia</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>In connection with the suspension of petitioner before he could 
file his answer to the administrative complaint, suffice it to say that 
the suspension was not a punishment or penalty for the acts of 
dishonesty and misconduct in office, but only as a preventive measure. 
Suspension is a preliminary step in an administrative investigation. If 
after such investigation, the charges are established and the person 
investigated is found guilty of acts warranting his removal, then he is 
removed or dismissed. This is the penalty. There is, therefore, nothing 
improper in suspending an officer pending his investigation and before 
the charges against him are heard and be given an opportunity to prove 
his innocence.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the said order was issued seven days after the 
complaint was filed did not constitute grave abuse of discretion. The 
immediate issuance of such order is required in order to prevent the 
subject of the suspension from committing further irregularities. Such 
prompt action, moreover, is in consonance with Section 15 of RA 6770 
which exhorts the Ombudsman to:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>xxx give priority to complaints filed against high ranking 
government officials and/or those occupying supervisory positions, 
complaints involving grave offenses as well as complaints involving 
large sums of money and/or properties.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not give much credence to petitioner’s suggestions of a 
malicious conspiracy between the Deputy Ombudsman Guerrero and 
Congressman Cua, reputedly petiitoner’s political adversary, to harass 
her. The Deputy Ombudsman and the Congressman, being public officials, 
enjoy the presumption of regularity of performance of duties. Such 
presumption can be overcome only by strong and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> No such evidence exists in this case.
</p><p align="center">III
</p><p>Contrary to petitioner’s contention, the conditions required to 
sustain her preventive suspension have been met in this case. These 
conditions are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>(1) That the evidence of guilt is strong; and
  </p>
  <p>(2) That any of the following circumstances are present:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) the charge against such officer or employee involves 
dishonesty, oppression, or grave misconduct or neglect in the 
performance of duty;
    </p>
    <p>(b) the charges would warrant removal from the service; or
    </p>
    <p>(c) the respondent’s continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first requisite rests upon the determination of the disciplining authority, the Office of the Ombudsman in this case:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>As held in <em>Buenaseda v. Flavier</em>, however, whether the 
evidence of guilt is strong is left to the determination of the 
Ombudsman by taking into account the evidence before him. A preliminary 
hearing as in bail petitions in cases involving capital offenses is not 
required. In rejecting a similar argument as that made by petitioner in 
this case, this Court said in that case:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The import of the <em>Nera</em> decision is that the disciplining
 authority is given the discretion to decide when the evidence of guilt 
is strong. This fact is bolstered by Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, which 
expressly left such determination of guilt to the ‘judgment’ of the 
Ombudsman on the basis of the administrative complaint . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We find no reason to disturb such determination in this case.
</p><p><u>All</u> the circumstances enumerated in the second requisite 
are likewise present. Petitioner is charged with, among others, fraud 
against the public treasury and malversation, offenses indubitably 
involving dishonesty and grave misconduct. These charges, if proven 
true, also constitute grounds for her removal upon order of the proper 
court. Section 60(c) of the Local Government Code states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>SEC. 60. <em>Grounds for Disciplinary Actions</em>. – An elective official may be disciplined, suspended or removed from office on any of the following grounds: </p>
  <p>x x x;
  </p>
  <p>c) <u>Dishonesty</u>, oppression, misconduct in office, gross negligence, or an offense punishable by at least prision mayor.
  </p>
  <p>x x x. (Underscoring supplied).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner’s high position likewise gives her access to public 
records and the clout to influence possible witnesses. Her continued 
stay in office may thus prejudice the prosecution of the case filed 
against her. It is immaterial that, as petitioner contends, no evidence 
has been adduced to prove that petitioner may influence possible 
witnesses or may tamper with the public records. It is sufficient that 
there exists such a possibility.
</p><p>Finally, the duration of petitioner’s suspension is not 
excessive. Petitioner’s suspension for six (6) months is within the 
limits prescribed by Section 24 of R.A. 6770. The length of the period 
of suspension within such limits, like the evaluation of the strength of
 the evidence, lies in the discretion of the Ombudsman.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, this petition is hereby DISMISSED. 
The temporary restraining order issued by this Court per its Resolution 
dated 26 August 1997 is hereby LIFTED with immediate effect.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
