<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On November 16,
1991, the private respondent was hired as chief accountant of petitioner Cebu
Filveneer Corporation.  Ms. Rhodora M.
Guillermo served as her accounting clerk.  The top executives of petitioner corporation were Italians:  Mr. Carlo Cordaro, President; Mr. John
Chapman Kun, General Manager; and, Mr. Renato Marinoni, Production Manager.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On January 21,
1992, Mr. Kun informed Mr. Cordaro of his desire to resign as general manager
effective March 1, 1992.  He requested
for the liquidation of his investment in the company in the sum of <s>P</s>125,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On February 7,
1992, Mr. Kun secured one blank check and blank check voucher from Ms.
Guillermo.  Ms. Guillermo failed to
immediately inform the private respondent of the blank check and voucher taken
by Mr. Kun.  Private respondent,
however, noticed the missing check voucher on February 10, 1992.  She asked Ms. Guillermo about the check
voucher and was told that it was with Mr. Kun.  Mr. Kun was able to prepare the check in the amount of <s>P</s>125,000.00,
had it signed by Mr. Marinoni and encashed on February 12, 1992.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Private
respondent learned of Mr. Kun's act and forthwith informed Mr. Cordaro who was
then in Italy.  Mr. Cordaro suspended
Mr. Kun and designated Mr. Marinoni and the private complainant as responsible
persons for the company funds.  He also
directed the private complainant to assist the company lawyer in filing a
criminal case against Mr. Kun.  On her
part, the private complainant wrote to the PNB MEPZ Branch demanding the return
of the encashed check.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On February 15,
1992, Mr. Marinoni confronted the private respondent and charged her with
complicity in Mr. Kun's irregular disbursement of company funds.  On February 17, 1992, the private respondent
reported for work late and was prevented entry by the security guards.  A Restriction Order has been issued against
her by Mr. Marinoni upon authority of Mr. Cordaro.  Mr. Marinoni also caused the forcible opening of private
respondent's table and the vault inside her office.  The private respondent reported the incident to the MEPZ PNP
Station.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On February 18,
1992, the private respondent complained to the MEPZ Labor Relations
Officer.  The next day, Mr. Marinoni
issued a memorandum suspending the private respondent for thirty (30) days
without pay effective February 17, 1992 for failure to report to office for
half a day.  On February 19, 1992, the
private respondent filed a case against the petitioners for illegal dismissal.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

need for an accountant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1992, Atty. Julius Neri notified the private respondent that her investigation
would start March 12, 1992.  Private
respondent failed to attend the investigation so it was reset to March 28, 1992.  On said date, the private respondent
appeared thru Atty. Godofredo Parawan, Jr. who objected to the conduct of the
investigation on the ground that his client had already filed a complaint for
illegal dismissal with the labor arbiter.  Nonetheless, Atty. Neri proceeded with the investigation <i>ex parte</i>.  On April 6, 1992, on the basis of Atty.
Neri's recommended action, petitioner dismissed the private respondent on two
grounds:  (1) failure to report the
blank check and voucher which Mr. Kun secured from Ms. Guillermo; and (2)
overpaying herself <s>P</s>7,000.00 as 13th month pay for the year 1991.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We uphold the
ruling of the public respondent that petitioners have no ground to dismiss the
private respondent for breach of trust or gross negligence.  Under Article 282 of the Labor Code, an
employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In
labor-management relations, there can be no higher penalty than dismissal from
employment.  Dismissal severs
employment ties and could well be the economic  death sentence of an employee.  Dismissal prejudices the socio-economic well being of the employee's
family and threatens the industrial peace.  Due to its far reaching implications, our Labor Code decrees that an
employee cannot be dismissed, except for the most serious causes.  The overly concern of our laws for the
welfare of employees is in accord with the social justice philosophy of our
Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Prescinding from
these premises, petitioners' insistence that they legally dismissed the private
respondent for loss of trust stands on quicksand.  At the very most, petitioners were only able to prove that
private respondent failed to inform immediately her superiors of the act of Mr.
Kun in getting a blank check and blank voucher from Ms. Guillermo.  The omission of the private respondent can
hardly be described as "willful" to justify her dismissal.  For one, the omission did not last for
long.  For another, the subsequent
actions of the private respondent upon learning of the encashment of the
unauthorized check by Mr. Kun negate any implication that she willfully or
intentionally defaulted in reporting to prejudice petitioners.  Indeed, she reported the matter to
petitioner Cordaro and wrote to the PNB MEPZ Branch to retrieve the encashed
check.  A breach is willful if it is
done intentionally, knowingly and purposely.  Petitioners merely proved the omission of the private respondent but
there is no evidence whatsoever that it was done intentionally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Nor are we
prepared to agree with petitioners that the private respondent was grossly or
habitually negligent in the performance of her duties.  The records reveal that the private
respondent has not been remiss in the past in the performance of her duties,
hence, she cannot be charged with habitual negligence.  We cannot also characterize private
respondent's negligence as gross in character.  Gross negligence  implies a want
or absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence or the entire
absence of care.  It evinces a
thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid
them.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

does not show that the private respondent has any reason to distrust Mr.
Kun.  Mr. Kun was petitioner's general
manager and appears to have conducted himself well in the performance of his
duties in the past.  There was not the
slightest reason to suspect that Mr. Kun would commit any illegal act.  At the most, the trust misplaced by the
private respondent constitutes error of judgment but not gross negligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"On 21 March 1989, Republic
Act No. 6715 took effect, amending the Labor Code.  Article 279 thereof states in part:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family:Arial">`ART. 279.  <i>Security of Tenure.-  </i>An employee who is unjustly dismissed
from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights
and other privileges and to his <i>full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and
to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his
compensation is withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement</i>.'
(italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"In accordance with the above
provision, an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to his full backwages
from the time his compensation was withheld from him (which, as a rule, is from
the time of his illegal dismissal) up to the time of his actual
reinstatement.  It is true that this
Court had ruled in the case of Pines City Educational Center vs. NLRC (G.R. No.
96779, 10 November 1993, 227 SCRA 655)  that "in ascertaining the total amount of backwages payable to them
(employees), we go back to the rule prior to the Mercury Drug rule that the
total amount derived from employment elsewhere by the employee from the date of
dismissal up to the date of reinstatement, if any, should be deducted
therefrom."  The rationale for such
ruling was that, the earnings derived elsewhere by the dismissed employee while
litigating the legality of his dismissal, should be deducted from the full
amount of backwages which the law grants him upon reinstatement, so as not
to  unduly or unjustly enrich the
employee at the expense of the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"The Court deems it
appropriate, however, to reconsider such earlier ruling on the computation of
backwages as enunciated in said Pines City Educational Center case, by now
holding that conformably  with the
evident legislative intent as expressed in Rep. Act No. 6715, above-quoted,
backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee, should not, as a
general rule, be diminished or reduced by the earnings derived by him elsewhere
during the period of his illegal dismissal.  The underlying reason for this ruling is that the employee, while
litigating the legality (illegality) of his  dismissal, must still earn a living to support himself and family, while
full backwages have to be paid by the employer as part of the price or
penalty  he has to pay for illegally
dismissing his employee.  The clear
legislative intent of the amendment in Rep. Act No. 6715 is to give more
benefits to workers that was previously given them under the <i>Mercury Drug</i>  rule or the "deduction of earnings
elsewhere" rule.  Thus, a closer
adherence to the legislative policy behind Rep. Act No. 6715 points to
"full backwages"  as meaning
exactly that, i.e., without  deducting
from backwages the earnings derived elsewhere by the concerned employee during
the period of his illegal dismissal.  In other words,  the provision
calling for "full backwages" to illegally dismissed employees is
clear, plain and free from ambiguity and, therefore, must be applied without
attempted or strained interpretation. <i>Index animi sermo est</i>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We hold that
public respondent should not have awarded moral damages and attorney's fees in
favor of the private respondent.  To be
sure, the private respondent was negligent when she did not immediately inform
her superior about the blank check and voucher taken by Mr. Kun, although, as aforediscussed,  it is not the specie of negligence that will
justify dismissal.  Thus, petitioners
should not and cannot be made to pay moral damages and attorney's fees for
their dismissal of the private respondent was not motivated by bad faith or
malice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Finally, we hold
that Mr. Cordaro cannot be made solidarily liable with petitioner corporation
for the illegal dismissal of the private respondent.  In dismissing the private respondent, he acted as President of
petitioner corporation and he did so in good faith.  His act as an officer of the corporation cannot result in his
private liability.  This is too
fundamental a rule to deserve further discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
