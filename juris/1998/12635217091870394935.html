December 1988, along the Maharlika Highway at Barangay Tinandog, Municipality
of Atimonan, Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating
together and mutually helping each other, armed with bladed and pointed
weapons, with intent to gain, by means of force, violence, threats and

steal and carry away from one Freddie Saavedra, a Honda TMX motorcycle with a
sidecar bearing Plate No. DW 9961 valued at THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (<s>P</s>30,000.00)
Philippine currency, belonging to the said Freddie Saavedra, to the damage and
prejudice of the latter in the aforesaid amount; and that on the occasion of
said robbery and by reason thereof, the said accused,  with intent to kill, with evident premeditation and treachery,
and taking advantage of their superior strength and in pursuance of their conspiracy,
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and
stab with the said weapon said Freddie Saavedra, thereby inflicting upon the
latter multiple stab wounds on the different parts of his body, which directly
caused his death.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Contrary to law.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On arraignment,
the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The relevant
facts established by the prosecution are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">On December 5, 1988, at about 7:00
o’clock p.m., tricycle driver Freddie Saavedra went to see his wife, Delfa, at
Our Lady of Angels Academy in Atimonan, Quezon, where the latter is a third
year high school student, to inform her that he will drive both accused to
Barangay Maligaya.  It was the last
time, however, that Freddie was seen alive.  When the latter failed to return that evening, Delfa, as early as 4:30
o’clock a.m. of December 6, 1988 inquired on his whereabouts from relatives and
friends.  In the course of such inquiry,
a certain Arnel Villarama revealed that the lifeless body of her husband was
discovered on the diversion road at Barangay Malinao in Atimonan.  Forthwith, they proceeded to the said place
and found him sprawled on the ground with fourteen stab wounds in different
parts of his body.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Meanwhile,
relying on the information that an abandoned sidecar of a tricycle was sighted
at Barangay Malinao, Lucena Philippine National Police (PNP) led by Lt. Carlos
Santos proceeded to the scene of the crime and recovered a blue sidecar which
they brought back with them to their headquarters.  Subsequently, Lt. Santos, Cpl. Numeriano Aguilar and Pat. Rolando
Alandy invited appellant in connection with the instant case and with respect
to two other robbery cases reported in Lucena City.  During their conversation, appellant allegedly gave an explicit
account of what actually transpired in the case at bar.  He narrated that he and co-accused Amido
were responsible for the loss of the motorcycle and the consequent death of
Saavedra.  Moreover, he averred that
they sold the motorcycle to a certain Danny Teves of Barrio Summit, Muntinlupa
for a sum of <s>P</s>4,000.00.  With the
help of appellant as a guide, the Lucena PNP immediately dispatched a team to
retrieve the same.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">After admitting
that it was purchased from both the accused and upon failure to present any
document evidencing the purported sale, Teves voluntarily surrendered it to the
police who turned it over, together with the sidecar, to the Atimonan Police
Station for safekeeping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Lt. Carlos, on
cross-examination, testified that when he invited appellant to their
headquarters, he had no warrant for his arrest.  In the course thereof, he informed the latter that he was a
suspect, not only in the instant case, but also in two other robbery cases
allegedly committed in Lucena City.  In
the belief that they were merely conversing inside the police station, he
admitted that he did not inform appellant of his constitutional rights to
remain silent and to the assistance of counsel; nor did he reduce the supposed
confession to writing.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Appellant, on
the other hand, alleged that he had no participation in the offense charged and
contended that his only involvement in the matter was the referral of accused
Amido to Teves.  He recounted that
sometime in December 1988, Amido sought him at his house and told him that the
motorcycle he was riding on was being offered for sale.  Upon proof shown that it was indeed
registered under Amido’s name, he accompanied the latter to Manila on board the
said motorcycle and they approached Antonio Carandang.  The latter, thereafter, brought them to a
certain Perlita Aguilar and Danilo Teves with whom the sale was finally
consummated.  He allegedly received <s>P</s>150.00
as his commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Amido presented
alibi as his defense.  He alleged that
although a tricycle driver by occupation, he was at Barangay Malusak, Atimonan
on the day in question, some seven kilometers from the town, busy assisting in
the renovation of his mother’s house.  He narrated that the victim was his friend and, therefore, he could not
have participated in the gruesome death of the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dated April 21, 1994, the trial court convicted appellant, the dispositive
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

foregoing considerations, this Court finds Herson Tan GUILTY beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime of Highway Robbery with Murder and hereby sentences him to
