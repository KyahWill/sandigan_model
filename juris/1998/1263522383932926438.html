Accused-appellant Emma Maquilan was found guilty of drug-pushing in 
violation of R.A. No. 6425, as amended, and sentenced to suffer the 
penalty of reclusion perpetua in a decision rendered by the Regional 
Trial Court of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte (Branch 11) on October 14,
 1994. The 59 sticks of handrolled marijuana cigarettes and the matchbox
 of marijuana seeds seized from her were ordered destroyed.
<p>
Accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal as a result of which the 
records of the case (Criminal Case No. S-2191) were forwarded to this 
Court. However, before the Court could act on the appeal and require her
 to file an appellant’s brief, accused-appellant moved to withdraw her 
appeal. In a handwritten letter, dated March 14, 1997, prepared for her 
by another person, accused-appellant stated that she was going to file a
 petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to seek her 
release from confinement for the sake of her children who needed a 
mother’s support and guidance. (“<em>Sumulat po ako para po ipaalam na nais ko nang iurong ang aking apila dahilan po sa nais kong mag-file ng Habeas Corpus</em>.<em> May mga anak po akong lumalaki at kailangan ang pagsubaybay ng isang ina.”</em>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><p>
In its resolution, dated July 9, 1997, the Court required the Solicitor 
General to comment, even as it required accused-appellant’s counsel, 
Atty. Teresita S. de Guzman, of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO), to 
confer with her and to determine whether in filing the motion 
accused-appellant acted of her own free will.
</p><p>
In his comment, dated September 22, 1997, the Solicitor General stated 
he had no objection to the motion. Per certification of Cecilia B. 
Veneracion, Clerk I and Documents Incharge of the Bureau of Corrections,
 the Solicitor General believed that accused-appellant fully understood 
the nature and purpose of her motion. He cited the statement in People 
v. Mendoza,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  that “withdrawal of an appeal before the filing of the appellee’s brief is allowed and granted.”
</p><p>
On the other hand, in a manifestation, dated September 3, 1997, Atty. de
 Guzman informed the Court that accused-appellant had been released from
 prison on July 25, 1997 by virtue of an order of the Regional Trial 
Court of Pasig City (Branch 71) issued in a habeas corpus case. Counsel 
therefore asked to be excused from making a report on the voluntariness 
of the motion to withdraw appeal. In another manifestation, dated 
November 10, 1997, Atty. de Guzman stated that she had no participation 
in the filing of the habeas corpus case.
</p><p>
In view of this information, the Court required the Solicitor General to
 comment, but the latter reiterated his position that he had no 
objection to the withdrawal of the appeal and expressed the view that 
“appellant filed the proper remedy of a petition for the issuance of the
 writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em> Said remedy appears to be duly supported by evidence presented in the hearing of said petition and by jurisprudence.”
</p><p>
In its resolution of June 15, 1998, the Court required Judge Celso D. 
Laviña of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 71, to show 
cause why he should not be held in contempt of court for granting the 
petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and for ordering 
the release of accused-appellant from confinement, considering that the 
appeal in this case was still pending. In compliance, Judge Laviña 
submitted the following explanation, dated July 22, 1998:
</p><ol><li>On February 26, 1997, a verified and certified Petition for 
Issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed by Atty. Editha C. Pio, PA
 III, Public Attorney’s Office, Department of Justice, as counsel for 
petitioner Emma Maquilan versus Rachel D. Ruelo, respondent, in Sp. 
Proc. No. 10725, which was raffled to Branch 71, on February 27, 1997, a
 copy of which is hereto attached as Annex A.
</li><li>On March 10, 1997, an Order was issued setting the case 
for hearing on March 18, 1997 and the Writ directing respondent Ruelo, 
as Superintendent IV of the Correctional Institution for Women, 
Mandaluyong City, to produce the petitioner-inmate Maquilan and to make a
 return of the writ, copies of which are hereto attached as Annexes B 
and C.
</li><li>
On March 18, 1997, respondent Ruelo through Concesa V. Mendoza, 
Superintendent I, filed a Comments, Exhibit C, stating “(T)that she 
interposes no objection to the Petition and reliefs prayed for as she is
 entitled to the same pursuant to the rulings in the cases or 
jurisprudence mentioned in the Petition”, a copy of which is hereto 
attached as Annex D.
</li><li>
Per Orders of April 8, 1997, April 21, 1997, May 26, 1997, June 9, 1997 
and June 30, 1997, as Annexes “E” to “E-4”, respectively, the case was 
reset for hearing and heard with Minutes of sessions held on April 8, 
1997, April 21, 1997, May 26, 1997, Notice dated May 27, 1997, Minutes 
on June 9, 1997, Subpoena dated June 10, 1997, Minutes on June 30, 1997,
 Subpoena dated June 30, 1997, Minutes on July 7, 1997 and Certification
 dated December 15, 1995 as Annexes “F” to “F-8”, respectively.
</li><li>On July 7, 1997, an Order was issued granting the 
petition for habeas corpus and ordering the immediate release of 
petitioner unless “there is other lawful cause for her further 
detention”, as Annex “G”.

<blockquote>
  <p>In People v. De Lara (236 SCRA 291, 299), it was held that “(I)f 
the marijuana involved is from 500 to 749 grams, the penalty to be 
imposed is <em>reclusion temporal.</em> If the marijuana involved is 
from 250 to 499 grams, the penalty to be imposed is prision mayor and if
 the weight of the marijuana involved is below 250 grams, the penalty to
 be imposed is prision correccional.” In People v. Simon (234 SCRA 555),
 R.A. No. 6425, as amended, was further amended by R.A. No. 7659 which 
took effect on December 31, 1993 (On page 569). And, “it has long been 
settled that by force of Article 10 of said Code the beneficent 
provisions of Article 22 thereof applies to and shall be given 
retrospective effect to crimes punished by special laws” like R.A. No. 
6425, as amended by R.A. No. 7659 (On page 570). </p>
  <p> Petitioner Maquilan in Sp. Proc. No. 10725 and accused-appellant 
herein, stated that she was convicted in Crim. Case No. S-2191 for 
selling “fifty five (55) sticks of marijuana cigarettes rolled in RP 
paper and one (1) match box of marijuana seeds” in violation of Republic
 Act No. 6425 (Sec. 4)” (pp. 1-2, Petition as Annex “A”). </p>
  <p> Prosecution’s witness, in Crim. Case No. S-2191, RTC Sindangan, 
Zamboanga del Norte, Branch 11, Chief Inspector Godofredo Dalida 
testified that his group took “from inside the cabinet” of Maquilan 50 
or 51 sticks of marijuana cigarettes rolled in RP paper plus the 4 
sticks of handrolled marijuana cigarettes handed by Maquilan to 
asset/poseur-buyer Diogracias Ramirez. In his Decision dated October 17,
 1994, the Honorable Presiding Judge ordered 59 sticks of handrolled 
marijuana cigarettes and one (1) matchbox of marijuana seeds destroyed. 
He sentenced Maquilan “to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua” 
(Decision as Annex A of Petition). </p>
  <p> Petitioner Maquilan states that “she has actually served 4 years, 
10 months and 13 days of good conduct time allowance as of 06 January 
1997” (Par. 7, Petition as Annex “A”). In a Certification dated January 
6, 1997 (Exhibits B and Annex C of Petition) signed by Asst. Documents 
Incharge Edna T. Miranda and Superintendent IV Rachel D. Ruelo, 
Correctional Institution for Women, it stated that Maquilan “was 
credited in the service of her sentence with 1 year, 6 months and 15 
days xxx and has actually served 4 years, 10 months and 13 days.”
  </p>
  <p> Acting Chief Idabel Bernabe-Pagulayan of Forensic Chemistry 
Division, NBI, Manila, testified on Exhibit “D”, as Annex “G” which was 
the Certification dated December 15, 1995 to the effect that the average
 weight of one stick of marijuana cigarette was 0.3300 to 0.5000 gram in
 Metro Manila and nearby provinces. </p>
  <p>
    Since there were 59 sticks of handrolled marijuana cigarettes 
ordered destroyed at 0.5000 gram per stick, the result would be 29.5 
grams plus one (1) match box of marijuana seeds which would total to not
 more than but less than 250 grams or for 55 sticks of handrolled 
marijuana cigarettes at 0.5000 gram per stick would be 27.5 grams plus 
one (1) match box of marijuana seeds. The total would be not more than 
250 grams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under SIMON, the penalty to be imposed should be prision 
correccional or 6 months and 1 day to 6 years to be taken from the 
medium period (On page 573, 574, thereof) or two (2) years, four (4) 
months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months.
  </p>
  <p> Based upon the evidence on hand and solely guided by the averments
 in the verified Petition as Annex “A” hereof, the Certification, 
Exhibit “D” as Annex “G” by respondent Ruelo, Exhibit “B” as Annex “C” 
of Petition, the Comment by respondent Ruelo, Exhibit “C” as Annex “D” 
hereof, interposing no objection to the petition, the testimony of 
Acting Chief Forensic Chemist Pagulayan on the quantity or weight of the
 marijuana and the existing jurisprudence on the matter, an Order dated 
July 7, 1997, as Annex “H” was issued granting the petition for habeas 
corpus and ordering the immediate release of petitioner from detention 
as petitioner Maquilan had already served 4 years, 10 months and 13 days
 as of January 6, 1997 “unless there is other lawful cause for further 
detention.”
  </p>
  <p> Petitioner Maquilan therefore “is entitled to benefit from the 
reduction of penalty introduced by the new law” and her “continued 
detention in the (Correctional Institution for Women) is a violation of 
(her) basic human rights and that, therefore, (she) should be released 
from prison without further delay” (Ordoñez v. Vinarao, 239 SCRA 114, 
115). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It appears that in her petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas 
corpus, accused-appellant falsely stated that she was in custody “by 
reason of a final decision issued by the Regional Trial Court of 
Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte (Branch 11).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  No mention was made by her of her appeal pending in this Court. On the
 other hand, the respondent in the habeas corpus case, Rachel D. Ruelo, 
Superintendent IV of the Correctional Institute for Women, filed a 
comment interposing no objection to the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
The release of accused-appellant constitutes unlawful interference with 
the proceedings of this Court and is only somewhat mitigated by the fact
 that the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City appears to have been misled
 by accused-appellant as to the status of the decision in Criminal Case 
No. S-2191. The trial court’s order granting release on habeas corpus, 
based as it is on the erroneous assumption that the decision in the 
criminal case had become final, is void. The trial court had no 
jurisdiction to issue the order in question.
</p><p>
This case is analogous to People v. Bacang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  There accused-appellants moved for the withdrawal of their appeal but,
 without waiting for the resolution of their motion, they applied for 
and were granted pardon by the President and released from confinement. 
Quoting People v. Salle, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  this Court ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> We now declare that the “conviction by final judgment” limitation 
under Section 19, Article VII of the present Constitution prohibits the 
grant of pardon, whether full or conditional, to an accused during the 
pendency of his appeal from his conviction by the trial court. Any 
application therefor, if one is made, should not be acted upon or the 
process toward its grant should not be begun unless the appeal is 
withdrawn. Accordingly, the agencies or instrumentalities of the 
Government concerned must require proof from the accused that he has not
 appealed from his conviction or that he has withdrawn his appeal. Such 
proof may be in the form of a certification issued by the trial court or
 the appellate court, as the case may be. The acceptance of the pardon 
shall not operate as an abandonment or waiver of the appeal, and the 
release of an accused by virtue of a pardon, commutation of sentence, or
 parole before the withdrawal of an appeal shall render those 
responsible therefor administratively liable. Accordingly, those in 
custody of the accused must not solely rely on the pardon as a basis for
 the release of the accused from confinement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Accordingly, the Court in that case denied the accused-appellants’ 
motion to withdraw their appeal and ordered their rearrest. Those 
responsible for their release were cited for contempt.
</p><p>
What was said in Bacang applies mutatis mutandis to this case. The use 
of the high prerogative writ as a post-conviction remedy presupposes a 
final judgment by virue of which accused is detained for the service of 
his sentence. As a matter of fact, however, that is not the case here as
 accused-appellant’s appeal is still pending.
</p><p>
<strong>WHEREFORE, </strong>the motion to withdraw appeal is DENIED and 
the Bureau of Corrections is DIRECTED to effect the rearrest within 
sixty (60) days from notice of accused-appellant Emma Maquilan, 
utilizing for this purpose the assistance of the Philippine National 
Police and the National Bureau of Investigation, and her reconfinement 
thereafter at the Correctional Institute for Women in Mandaluyong, Metro
 Manila and forthwith to submit a report to the Court. Further action on
 the appeal is held in abeyance pending the rearrest of 
accused-appellant Emma Maquilan.
</p><p>
Accused-appellant Emma Maquilan, Atty. Editha C. Pio of the Public 
Attorney’s Office, and Rachel D. Ruelo, Superintendent IV of the 
Correctional Institute for Women are hereby REQUIRED to SHOW CAUSE 
within ten (10) days from notice why they should not be held in contempt
 for misrepresenting to the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City (Branch 
71) the status of Criminal Case No. S-2191.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
