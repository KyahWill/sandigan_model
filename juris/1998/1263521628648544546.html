After conducting a hearing thereon, during which Exaltacion Lopez, Inspector Motalib Banding, and Cleofas Mendoza (a fellow teacher of the complainant) were presented by the prosecution, the court, in an order, dated 22 July 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> denied the petition for bail. A motion for its reconsideration, as well as for the quashal of the warrant of arrest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was likewise denied by the trial court in its order of 25 August 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the arraignment that followed, the accused pleaded "not guilty" to the charge.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution, incorporating the evidence presented during the hearing on the petition for bail (deemed reproduced during the trial), in most part consisted of the statements at the witness stand of Exaltacion Lopez, Inspector Motalib Banding, Cleofas Mendoza and Dr. Vladimir Villaseñor (the examining physician).<br><br>The complainant, Exaltacion Lopez, a 50-year old teacher, testified that she was, at past 5:00 in the afternoon of 11 February 1992, in her classroom at the Molave Regional Pilot School in Molave, Zamboanga del Sur, preparing to call it a day. While shutting down the wooden jalousie windows of the classroom, she was suddenly held from behind by a man in pink jogging pants. The man was naked from waist up except for his face which was wrapped in "ninja" fashion. The intruder grabbed Exaltacion by her right hand, and pointed a <i>batangas</i> knife at her neck. She attempted to snatch the knife away but that did not work. He led her to the corner of the room with the knife still being poked on her. By the time she turned her head to squarely face him, the man was already completely naked except for the "ninja style" shirt that still partly covered his face. She pleaded to be spared but he paid no heed. He ordered her to lie down on the cemented floor. Showing his impatience, by her refusal, the man grabbed her by the blouse causing her to fall on the floor. He rode on top of her, throwing her two hands above her head. Then, holding the batangas knife with one hand, he used the other in removing her panty. Ultimately, he succeeded in having her. When he had finished, he demanded P100.00 from her which she hastily gave. He would not, however, let her go just yet. After a while, he again forcibly took her. His lust now fully satisfied, he wiped himself dry using the table cloth hanging at the magazine rack. Shortly thereafter, he departed. After recovering from the ordeal, she closed the room and hurriedly repaired home. She informed her husband of the incident that evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The following morning, her fellow teachers, to whom she likewise narrated the incident, assisted in bringing the matter up to the police authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Cleofas Mendoza, a fellow teacher of Exaltacion Lopez, stated that she went to the Molave Police Station on 12 February 1992 to report the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Inspector Motalib Banding, after receiving the report, promptly conducted an investigation. He went to the crime scene and interviewed Exaltacion who described the rapist to be a man of medium built and with a fair complexion, protruding eyes (botlogon ng mata) and a scar at the right arm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Banding took the table cloth used by the rapist and sent it for laboratory examination to the PC Crime Laboratory in Manila. He dispatched his police officers to round up possible suspects on the basis of the description given by the complainant. A week later, or on 21 February 1992, he and policeman Cortez invited accused Joseph Barrientos for questioning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> When Barrientos was presented to Exaltacion at the police station, the latter immediately recognized him to be the person who molested her. Barrientos asked Exaltacion for her forgiveness; his words: <i>"Ma'm, pasaylo-a ko sa akong nahimo nimo, dili nato ni kasohan, tabangan ta lagi ka Ma'm nga mawala ang estorya nimo"</i> (Ma'm, forgive me for what I have done against you, we will not bring this to court, I will help you Ma'm to eradicate the story against you). She refused to forgive him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The table cloth sent for examination was analyzed by Dr. Vladimir Villaseñor. It was found positive for the presence of seminal fluid stains.<br><br>The defense denied the accusation. Aside from the accused, six other witnesses were presented to corroborate appellant’s alibi and claim of maltreatment by the police.<br><br>Appellant stated that in the morning of 11 February 1992, he had left Molave for Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur, where he stayed at the house of his brother until the morning of 13 February 1992. He went to Dumingag in order to borrow a fatigue uniform which he would use for the ROTC summer camp training in Sinacaban. The next day, 12 February 1992, he attended the death anniversary of his brother’s father-in-law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He was able to return home to Molave only in the afternoon of 13 February 1992. That same afternoon, while watching a basketball game at the Public Plaza of Molave, police officer Robert Cortez invited him to the Police Station for questioning. After a brief investigation, he was allowed to go home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On 17 February 1992, he and a certain Dante Baguio, a person of his size and built but with darker complexion, were fetched by a police vehicle and presented to two children at the Police Station. The children, when asked if they could recognize appellant, responded in the negative. Thereupon, he was allowed to leave the station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On 20 February 1992, while he was on his way home, he was directed by Inspector Banding, then driving a police service vehicle, to proceed to the Molave Police Station. At the station, he was asked to wait for Inspector Banding at the latter’s office. After a little while, Inspector Banding arrived with Lopez who pointed at him (the accused) as being the man who had raped her. He vehemently denied the accusation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He was locked up in jail anyway. The next day, he was mauled, blindfolded and maltreated by Inspector Banding and his men for not agreeing to confess to the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After the presentation of evidence had closed, the court, presided over by Hon. Camilo E. Tamin of the Regional Trial Court (“RTC”) of Molave, Zamboanga del Sur, Branch 23, promulgated its decision, dated 20 February 1995, which held accused Barrientos guilty of the crime charged. The court concluded:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, this court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of rape with robbery and hereby sentences him to the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the offended party Exaltacion Lopez moral damage in the sum of P300,000.00, and the cost of the proceedings.<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>Interposing an appeal to this Court, the accused asseverates that the trial court has erred -<br><blockquote>“I. IN HOLDING THAT THERE IS A VALID COMPLAINT SIGNED BY THE PRIVATE OFFENDED PARTY SUFFICIENT IN LAW TO CONFER JURISDICTION TO THE TRIAL COURT;<br><br>“II. IN ADMITTING THE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE OFFENDED PARTY AND CHIEF OF POLICE, MOTALIB BANDING THE ACCUSED ASKED FORGIVENESS FROM THE PRIVATE OFFENDED PARTY THEREBY ADMITTING HIS GUILT;<br><br>“III. ON RELYING ON THE SOLE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE OFFENDED PARTY THAT SHE COULD IDENTIFY THE ACCUSED AS THE VERY PERSON WHO RAPED AND ROBBED HER; and<br><br>“IV. IN NOT BELIEVING THE TESTIMONY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS CORROBORATED BY HIS WITNESSES.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant assails both the complaint signed by the Chief of Police and the Information filed by the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor as being insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court, arguing that the prosecution for rape can only be done by means of a valid complaint made by the offended party herself.<br><br>The contention lacks merit.<br><br>The term “complaint filed by the offended party” found in Rule 110, Section 5, of the Rules of Court, said the Court in People vs. Sangil,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> should be -<br><blockquote>“x x x given a liberal or loose interpretation meaning a `charge, allegation, grievance, accusation or denunciation’ (p. 158, West’s Legal Thesaurus Dictionary) – rather than a strict legal construction, for more often than not the offended party who files it is unschooled in the law. The purpose of the complaint in Section 5, Rule 110, is merely to initiate or commence the prosecution of the accused. The victim’s `sinumpaang salaysay’ which was prepared in the vernacular, and the `complaint’ in English, which must have been prepared for her by someone else, complement each other, when read together, and satisfy the legal definition of a `complaint’ as `a sworn statement charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the offended party x x x’ (Sec. 3, Rule 110, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure). The Court is not inclined to disregard her salaysay (complaint) for mere lack of an oath for that would amount to suppressing her anguished cry for redress.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>The sworn statement of Exaltacion Lopez, the offended party in the case at bar, was signed by Lopez herself in the office of the Chief of Police (Motalib Banding). That statement, in “question and answer” form and filed with the Molave MTC to support the complaint signed by the Chief of Police, was to this effect:<br><br>“PRELIMINARY:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Exaltacion Lopez Y Fernandez, you are being informed that under Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code, any person who knowingly making any untruthful statement shall testify under oath before any competent person duly authorized by law to administer oath shall commit the crime of Perjury.

Here, the sworn statement of the victim hardly can cast doubt on her evident resolve to bring the accused to justice.<br><br>In any event, the issue on the validity and sufficiency of the complaint has been belatedly put up by appellant. The matter could have been raised in a motion to quash the information pursuant to Section 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Rule 117, of the Rules of Court which step he has failed to do. The rule, according to the Court’s holding in People vs. Garcia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> is that -<br><blockquote>“x x x at any time before entering his plea, the accused may move to quash the information on the ground that it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form. The failure of the accused to assert any ground for a motion to quash before he pleads to the information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of the grounds for a motion to quash, except the grounds of no offense charged, lack of jurisdiction over the offense charged, extinction of the offense or penalty, and jeopardy.”</blockquote>Appellant next faults the trial court for not rejecting the testimony to the effect that the accused has sought forgiveness from the complainant when made to confront him, on 21 February 1992, at the office of the Chief of Police. He claims that the confrontation between him and the complainant is violative of his right to counsel, he having been neither assisted, nor advised of his right to be represented, by counsel at the time.<br><br>The argument is misdirected.<br><br>There was no written confession or sworn statement of the accused taken during any custodial investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that had been presented, nor even attempted to be presented, in evidence. The matter testified to was appellant’s spontaneous statement of having asked for the forgiveness of the offended party. It was a statement uttered by appellant, overheard by the Chief of Police Motalib Banding, that had not been elicited from him through any questioning. Incidentally, in appellant’s own testimony in court, he disclaimed having sought forgiveness from Exaltacion Lopez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> but conceded that, in his counter-affidavit of 10 March 1992, he admitted having apologized to the complainant, although, he added, it was only because of the alleged mauling and torture he had received from Inspector Banding and his men.<br><br>Appellant questions his so-called warrantless arrest. There is paucity of facts on record to substantiate this claim but if, indeed, there has been an irregularity attendant to his arrest, it should, not having been raised at the opportune time, be deemed cured by his having voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Not only did appellant enter his plea during arraignment and actively participated at the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> but he likewise has filed, even priorly, a petition for bail which, itself, would have just the same constituted a waiver of any supposed irregularity in his arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Neither is the Court convinced by the contention that appellant has not been sufficiently identified to be the culprit by the complainant. Familiarity with the physical features of a person is an acceptable way for proper identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As has so keenly been observed by the trial court:<br><blockquote>“At the investigation by the police in the afternoon of February 12, 1992, the complainant described the person who ravished her as one of bulging eyes, of fair complexion, sturdily built in body, and with a scar at the right arm at the elbow joint. The accused fits the description given by the offended party. At the confrontation between the accused and the offended party in the Office of the Chief of Police, the offended party was able to positively identify the accused as the person who ravished her twice in the afternoon of February 11, 1992. She found the identifying scar in the part of the body of the accused where she said the same can be located.

Controlling in an Information should not be the title of the complaint, nor the designation of the offense charged or the particular law or part thereof allegedly violated, these being, by and large, mere conclusions of law made by the prosecutor, but the description of the crime charged and the particular facts therein recited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Neither is it the technical name given to the offense by the prosecutor, more than the allegations made by him, that should predominate in determining the true character of the crime.

There were more times<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> when the Court held Article 294(2) to be applicable than when it ruled otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In People vs. Mabag,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the votes of the Justices were stated by the ponente, Mr. Justice Vicente Abad Santos, thus -<br><blockquote>“The writer of this opinion together with Justices Hermogenes Concepcion, Jr., Ramon C. Fernandez, Juvenal K. Guerrero and Pacifico P. de Castro are for the affirmance in toto of the lower court’s decision. Justice Ameurfina A. Melencio-Herrera concurs with the aforementioned members of the Court and adds the observation `that even in a prosecution for Robbery with Rape, which can be prosecuted de oficio, the offended woman should still file a complaint for Rape as a jurisdictional requirement (sec. 4, Rule 110; Art. 344, Revised Penal Code), and out of consideration for her. But if the rape victim herself testifies in open Court, as in this case, the purpose behind the requirement should be deemed as having been met, it being apparent that the victim, as in a complaint filed by her, has decided to expose in a public trial the outrage on her person.’ Justice Claudio Teehankee concurs in the imposition of the death penalty but believes that not one but three death penalties should be meted to the accused. He has filed a separate opinion to this effect. Justice Antonio P. Barredo’s vote is `that appellant Paulino Mabag should be sentenced to three death penalties because as I have already explained in previous opinions, it is absurd to read Article 294 (2) of the Revised Penal Code without taking into account the latest amendment of Article 335. The construction of laws must never result in absurdity.’ Justice Felix V. Makasiar has filed a dissenting opinion to the effect that the accused should be convicted and sentenced to death for three separate crimes of robbery with rape. However, Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando following his opinion in People vs. Carandang, L-31012, August 15, 1973, 52 SCRA 259, believes that the appropriate penalty is reclusion perpetua and so does Justice Ramon C. Aquino who has filed a dissenting opinion.<br><br>“It thus appears that nine members of the Court are for the imposition of the death penalty in varying numbers, while two members are for reclusion perpetua only.<br><br>“WHEREFORE, for lack of the necessary votes the decision appealed from is hereby modified in that the accused shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua but is affirmed in all other respects. <i>Costs de oficio</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote>It was during this period of diversity of opinion within the Court that, relevant to the instant case,<i> People vs. Mabag</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> was decided where, for lack of the required ten votes, the death sentence imposed on the accused was modified to <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> and where, among other things, it said:<br><blockquote>“As to the second assignment of error, the appellant claims that even assuming, without admitting, that he is guilty of the offense charged, he cannot be meted the death penalty because Arts. 293, 294, par. 2 and 296 of the Revised Penal Code which are mentioned in the information prescribe only the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape, among other crimes. [Presidential Decree No. 767 which took effect on August 15, 1975 has amended Art. 294, par. 2 of the Revised Penal Code by adding the following: `PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WHEN THE ROBBERY ACCOMPANIED WITH RAPE IS COMMITTED WITH THE USE OF A DEADLY WEAPON OR BY TWO OR MORE PERSONS THE PENALTY SHALL BE RECLUSION PERPETUA TO DEATH.’ This amendment cannot of course be given retroactive effect.]<br><br>“But the applicable provision is Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code the relevant portion of which reads: `Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty is reclusion perpetua to death.’ And this is the provision mentioned in the dispositive portion of the lower court’s decision quoted above. The fact that Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code is not mentioned in the information is unimportant and did not deprive the appellant of his constitutional right to be informed of the accusation against him. As former Chief Justice Moran said:<br><blockquote>“`It has been held, however, that if the above requirement [Rule 110, Sec. 7, Rules of Court] is not complied with and no name has been given to the offense alleged to haven been committed, the defect is merely of form which does not prejudice the substantial rights of the defendant. This is especially so where the facts pleaded are clearly constitutive of a specific offense. In such cases, the real nature of the crime charged is determined not by the title of the complaint, nor by the specification of the provision of the law alleged to have been violated, but by the facts recited in the complaint or information. This is so because `from a legal point of view, and in a very real sense, it is of no concern to the accused what is the technical name of the crime of which he stands charged. It in no way aids him in his defense on the merits x x x. The real question is not did he commit a crime given in the law some technical and specific name, but did he perform the acts alleged in the body of the information in the manner therein set forth. If he did, it is of no consequence to him, either as a matter of procedure or of substantive right, how the law denominates the crime which those acts constitute x x x. In the designation of the crime, the accused never has a real interest until the trial has ended. For his full and complete defense, he need not know the name of the crime at all. It is of no consequence whatever for the protection of his substantial rights x x x. It is the province of the court alone to say what the crime is and what it is named.’ Accordingly, the accused will not be permitted `to stand by and watch the fiscal while he guesses as to the name which ought to be applied to the crime with which he charges the accused, and then take advantage of the guess if it happens to be wrong, while the acts and omissions upon which that guess was made and which are the only real foundation of the charges against him are clearly and fully stated in the information.’ Otherwise, it would `change the battleground in criminal cases from issues to guesses and from facts to fancy.’’ (IV Moran, Rules of Court, pp. 22-23, 1970 ed.)</blockquote>“That the lower court did not err in applying Art. 355 of the Revised Penal Code is shown by the decision of this Court in People vs. Obtinalia, G.R. No. L-30190, April 30, 1971, 38 SCRA 651.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote>All taken, herein appellant must be convicted of two counts of rape under Article 335, qualified by with the use of deadly weapon (a batangas knife), and the crime of robbery under Article 294, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Article 335 of the Code, before the more onerous amendatory provisions of Republic Act No. 7659 (1994) and Republic Act No. 8353 (1997), read:<br><blockquote>“ART. 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br>“1. By using force or intimidation;<br><br>“2. When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>“3. When the woman is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present.<br><br>“The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.<br><br>“Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.<br><br>“When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>“When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be likewise death.<br><br>“When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death. (As amended by Rep. Act No. 2632, approved June 18, 1960, and Rep. Act No. 4111, approved June 20, 1964.)”</blockquote>When, such as in the case at bar, the crime of rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon, the penalty prescribed would be reclusion perpetua to death; there being neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstance shown, the minimum thereof, or <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> should be the appropriate penalty. The penalty of death, in any event, could not be imposed because of the then constitutional proscription.<br><br>In turn, Article 294, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><blockquote>“ART. 294. Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons-Penalties. - Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><center><br>“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</center><br>“5. The penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period to prision mayor in its medium period in other cases. (As amended by Rep. Act No. 18.)”</blockquote>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and absent any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the full range of the penalty that may be imposed is anywhere<b> from </b>arresto mayor in its maximum period to <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium period, as the <b>minimum penalty,</b> to prision mayor in its minimum period, as the <b>maximum penalty.</b><br><br>The trial court missed to order appellant to pay the victim actual damages of P100.00 cash taken from her. Conformably with recent court rulings, indemnity for damages must likewise be awarded to the rape victim. The purpose of this award is essentially one of reparation, not punishment or correction, that accounts for its being appropriately termed “indemnity.” Consistent with the prevailing rule, and considering the circumstances of the case, the civil indemnity is here fixed at P100,000.00 for the two counts of rape committed.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the judgment of the RTC of Molave, Zamboanga del Sur in Criminal Case No. 92-10267 is MODIFIED by finding accused-appellant Joseph Barrientos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape and the separate crime of robbery. He is accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of two (2) <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for the crimes of rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and the indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to seven (7) years of prision mayor, as maximum for the robbery committed. Accused-appellant is ordered to indemnify the offended party the sum of P100,000.00 and to restore the amount of P100.00 taken from her.<br><br>Costs against accused-appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., Regalado, Davide, Jr., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Mendoza, Francisco, Panganiban,</i> and <i>Martinez,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, Vol. I, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ibid., </i>p. 4<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><i> Ibid.,</i> p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><i> Ibid.,</i> pp. 48-49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 51-52.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, Volume 3, 20 July 1992, pp. 4-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><i> Ibid.,</i> p. 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, Volume 3, 22 July 1992, p. 33.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, Volume 3, 20 July 1992, pp. 33-34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 34-35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><i> Ibid.,</i> pp. 38-39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TSN, Volume 3, 14 July 1993, pp. 12-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 25-30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> TSN, Volume 3, 20 July 1993, pp. 10-15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><i> Ibid.,</i> pp. 16-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><i> Ibid.</i>, pp. 21-24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Rollo, pp. 37-38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Rollo, pp. 54-55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 208 SCRA 696.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> At page 707.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Records, Volume 1, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Supra.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 125 SCRA 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> At p. 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> SEC. 3. <i>Grounds.</i> – The accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the following grounds:<br><blockquote>(a) That the facts charged do not constitute an offense;<br><br>(b) That the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the offense charged or the person of the accused;<br><br>(c) That the officer who filed the information had no authority to do so;<br><br>(d) That it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form;<br><br>(e) That more than one offense is charged except in those cases in which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for various offenses;<br><br>(f) That the criminal action or liability has been extinguished;<br><br>(g) That it contains averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification; and<br><br>(h) That the accused has been previously convicted or in jeopardy of being convicted, or acquitted of the offense charged.</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> G.R.
