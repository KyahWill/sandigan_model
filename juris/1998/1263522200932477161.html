				<H3>ANTONIO SURIMA, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND LORETA PEDIAPCO LIM, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">ANTONIO SURIMA filed on 11 September 1990 a complaint against 
private respondent Loreta Pediapco Lim for overtime pay, 13th month pay,
 service incentive leave pay, premium pay for holidays and rest days, 
and underpayment of wages. He alleged that he started working with 
private respondent in 1983 as cashier of <em>Horace P. Lim Construction Supply</em>,
 named after her son Horace, located in San Jose, Antique. In the same 
establishment he was also tasked with selling rice and rice husk. Still 
another job he held for her was as collector of rentals for her three 
(3) buildings. 
<p>Sometime in 1989 petitioner Surima was transferred to Sibalom, 
Antique, where he worked again as cashier but this time at private 
respondent's <em>Caltex</em> gasoline station. In August of the same 
year he also became a salesman in a drugstore owned by her although 
during harvest seasons he would be placed in charge of her business of 
buying and selling <em>palay</em>. He was earning at that time a monthly salary of P1,000.00. 
</p><p>On 1 October 1990, or almost three (3) weeks after he filed his 
complaint, petitioner was allegedly dismissed without just cause, hence 
his additional claim for back wages, reinstatement and attorney's fees. 
</p><p>Private respondent contended that petitioner was first employed 
by her son Horace. In July 1989, when the latter's business flaundered 
and eventually ceased to operate, she hired petitioner as domestic 
helper receiving an income of P250.00 per week with free board and 
lodging. He also worked in her drugstore but only occasionally. On 1 
October 1990 he left his work.
</p><p>The Labor Arbiter did not sustain the claim of illegal dismissal 
for lack of evidence. On the other hand, he upheld the contention of 
private respondent that she hired petitioner only in July 1989 for which
 he was adequately compensated. Thus on 26 June 1991 the complaint was 
dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><p>On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) viewed 
the case differently. According to public respondent, respondent Loreta 
Pediapco Lim had the burden of producing the employment records of her 
business enterprise as proof that petitioner was not in any way 
connected with any of her businesses since 1983. She failed to discharge
 this burden. Even granting that petitioner initially worked with her 
son Horace, the undisputed fact is that her son's business did not have a
 separate personality of its own. Thus, it is not difficult to conclude 
that the business enterprises where petitioner worked belonged to one 
and the same owner, private respondent herself, hence,” the finding of 
the NLRC that petitioner had been her employee since 1983.
</p><p>Furthermore, the NLRC took into account the fact that only a day 
after petitioner allegedly left his work his counsel sent private 
respondent a letter protesting his termination from the service. This 
prompt recourse to legal assistance was considered inconsistent with the
 claim of abandonment. Moreover, there was not even a compliance by 
private respondent with the legal requisite of notice to petitioner at 
his last known address.
</p><p>As a consequence, the NLRC concluded that petitioner was 
illegally dismissed so that he was entitled to reinstatement with back 
wages. However, due to the strain in the relationship of the parties and
 the lapse of time, separation pay in lieu of reinstatement was 
considered by the NLRC to be more feasible under the circumstances. 
Petitioner was likewise declared entitled to wage differentials, 13th 
month pay, service incentive leave pay and attorney's fees, but his 
other claims were denied for lack of basis. Thus on 12 January 1995 
private respondent Loreta Pediapco Lim was ordered to pay petitioner the
 following amounts -

<p>Private respondent moved for reconsideration while petitioner moved 
for recomputation of the awards. However, both motions were denied on 19
 May 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The NLRC found 
private respondent's motion without merit while that of petitioner was 
filed beyond the 10-day reglementary period. The records showed that 
petitioner received copy of the decision on 23 January 1995 but moved 
for recomputation only on 13 February 1995 after the decision became 
final and executory on 2 February 1995. 
</p><p>Private respondent then resorted to this Court in G.R. No. 120404
 but her petition was dismissed for failure to show grave abuse of 
discretion on the part of the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The dismissal became final and executory on 28 August 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>For his part, petitioner filed the instant petition assailing the
 NLRC for its grave abuse of discretion in the computation of his 
monetary awards and prayed that it be required to make the necessary 
recomputation. Petitioner alleges that the NLRC has contravened settled 
jurisprudence when it limited the period of his entitlement to back 
wages, separation pay, wage differentials, 13th month pay and service 
incentive leave pay to only three (3) years reckoned from the time of 
his illegal dismissal. He also asserts that additional awards of wage 
differentials, 13th month pay and service incentive leave pay should be 
granted to him covering the three-year period prior to the filing of the
 complaint since money claims prescribe in three (3) years.
</p><p>Respondent counters that inasmuch as petitioner failed to timely 
move for reconsideration he could no longer seek other reliefs, and that
 it is perfectly within the discretion of the NLRC to limit the award of
 back wages to three (3) years since it is not her fault that it took 
approximately four (4) years for the appeal to be resolved. However, in 
the event a recomputation of the back wages be granted private 
respondent asks for an opportunity to prove petitioner's earnings 
elsewhere pursuant to <em>Pines City Educational Center v. NLRC</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>But, first, the procedural error committed by petitioner.
</p><p>Petitioner received copy of the assailed decision on 23 January 
1995. Not having filed a motion for reconsideration within the ten 
(10)-day reglementary period, the decision became final and executory as
 to him on 2 February 1995. Petitioner moved for recomputation only on 
13 February 1995. Along the same line did we rule in <em>Labudahon v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and <em>Orient Express Placement Philippines v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 that on the strength of Art. 223 of the Labor Code and Sec. 14, Rule 
VII, New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC, in the absence of a motion for 
reconsideration timely filed within the ten (10)-day reglementary 
period, the assailed order, resolution or decision of the NLRC becomes 
final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof.
</p><p>However, fundamental consideration of substantial justice 
persuades us to decide the present case on the merits rather than to 
dismiss it on a technicality. In so doing, we exercise our prerogative 
in labor cases that no undue sympathy is to be accorded to any claim of 
procedural misstep, the idea being that our power must be exercised 
according to justice and equity and substantial merits of the 
controversy. As we shall discuss in the succeeding paragraphs, the 
assailed ruling of the NLRC in the instant case is contrary to law and 
jurisprudence, thus making certiorari still an available remedy in the 
premises.
</p><p>We had allowed in the past appeals from the decisions of the 
Labor Arbiter to the NLRC even if filed beyond the reglementary period 
in the interest of substantial justice. Among these were <em>Ruga v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> where our decision relied upon by respondent NLRC was not applicable; <em>City Fair Corporation v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> where there was insufficient evidence to justify the enormous amount of damages awarded; <em>Valderrama v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> where we preferred to give life to the constitutional mandate for the protection of labor; and, <em>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 where we considered as enough reasons the Labor Arbiter's lack of 
jurisdiction and perpetuation of unjust enrichment. By the same token, 
the present case deserves liberal treatment.
</p><p>Article 279 of the Labor Code as amended by Sec. 34 of RA No. 6715<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> provides: <em>"An
 employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to 
reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and 
to his full back wages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other 
benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his 
compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual 
reinstatement."</em> The amendment took effect on 21 March 1989 and was 
thus applicable at the time of petitioner's dismissal on 1 October 1990.
 Two vital aspects of the provision have been the subject of 
interpretation by this Court. First, as to the total amount of back 
wages, although the law speaks of "full back wages," <em>Pines City</em>
 enunciated the rule that in the ascertainment of the total amount of 
back wages the entire amount derived from employment elsewhere by the 
employee from the date of dismissal up to the date of reinstatement, if 
any, should be deducted therefrom. We have however reconsidered <em>Pines City</em> in <em>Bustamante v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 by holding that conformably with the evident legislative intent as 
expressed in RA No. 6715 the back wages to be awarded to an illegally 
dismissed employee should not be diminished or reduced by the earnings 
derived by him elsewhere during the period of his illegal dismissal. 
</p><p>The rationale for the new ruling is that the employee, while 
litigating the legality (illegality) of his dismissal, must still earn a
 living to support himself and his family, while the employer has to pay
 full back wages as part of his penalty for illegally dismissing his 
employee. The clear legislative intent of RA No. 6715 as conveyed in 
Bustamante is to give more benefits to workers than what were previously
 given them under the <em>Mercury Drug</em> rule or the <em>"deductions of earnings elsewhere"</em> rule. <em>Second</em>,
 as to the time frame for the computation of back wages, the provision 
mentions the period from withholding of compensation up to actual 
reinstatement, which period can be established with facility. However, 
there may be an instance when reinstatement is considered no longer 
feasible, necessitating award of separation pay instead. The question 
now arises: When is the period for computation of back wages and 
separation pay supposed to end? <em>Gaco v. NLRC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 addressed the question squarely by holding that in such circumstance, 
the computation shall be up to the time of finality of this Court's 
decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Apparently, the 
justification is that along with the finality of this Court's decision 
the issue on illegal dismissal is finally laid to rest.
</p><p>We agree with petitioner that the NLRC gravely abused its 
discretion in the computation of his monetary awards. It shortened the 
period thereof to three (3) years<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 without any basis at all and in the process ignored current law and 
jurisprudence. Taking into account that the NLRC awarded separation pay 
in lieu of reinstatement, the period should be up to the finality of 
this Court's decision. We must clarify however that what we are 
referring to is the decision in G.R. No. 120404 which finally settled 
the dispute on illegal dismissal and other claims of petitioner on 28 
August 1995.
</p><p>Under Art. 291 of the Labor Code, money claims arising from an 
employer-employee relationship must be filed within three (3) years from
 the time the cause of action accrued. Again we agree with petitioner 
that his claims consisting of wage differentials, 13th month pay and 
service incentive leave pay may be recovered from 11 September 1987, or 
three years before the date of the filing of the complaint, up to 11 
September 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The 
amounts that may be awarded shall be in addition to those already 
awarded and which form part of the total monetary awards. It is beyond 
our competence to determine whether the actual salary rate of petitioner
 was below the minimum wage rate from 11 September 1987 up to 11 
September 1990. The NLRC is better equipped to perform this task. Within
 the same period, petitioner has established that he did not receive 
payments for his 13th month and service incentive leave and such amounts
 should be included in the computation.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is GRANTED. The decision
 of public respondent NLRC dated 12 January 1995 granting monetary 
awards to petitioner Antonio Surima is MODIFIED. The NLRC is directed to
 recompute the following: (a) back wages from 1 October 1990 to 28 
August 1995; (b) separation pay from 1983 to 28 August 1995; (c) wage 
differentials, from 11 September 1987 to 11 September 1990 if entitled 
thereto, 13th month pay and service incentive leave pay covering the 
same period; (d) wage differentials, 13th month pay and service 
incentive leave pay from 1 October 1990 to 28 August 1995; and, (e) 
attorney's fees of ten percent (10%) of the total monetary awards.
