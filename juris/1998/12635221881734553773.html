				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In resolving this appeal, the Court reiterates the time-honored 
doctrine that the findings of trial courts on the credibility of 
witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great weight and are 
generally not disturbed on appeal, except for strong and valid reasons. 
In addition, the Court underscores the principle that nighttime does not
 automatically aggravate a crime. The prosecution must prove that the 
accused deliberately sought the darkness, took advantage of it and 
benefited from it by ensuring his non-identification or capture.
<p align="center"><strong><u>The Case</u></strong>
</p><p>This is an appeal from the 20-page Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>

Branch 44, in the consolidated Criminal Case Nos. D-10203, D-10204, 
D-10205, D-10206, D-10207 and D-10769, convicting Laudemar de la Cruz of
 murder, frustrated murder and three counts of attempted murder. Said 
Decision disposed of six (6) Informations filed against appellant by 2nd
 Assistant City Prosecutor Ludgerio B. Limbos.
</p><p>The first Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> docketed as Criminal Case No. D-10203, charged:

Dagupan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, LAUDEMAR DELA CRUZ y Verdadero, did then
 and there, wilfully, unlawfully and criminally, have in his possession,
 custody and control a .45 caliber pistol, with Serial No. 2126560 
marked Remington, with four (4) live ammunition, without authority 
and/or license to possess the same.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> docketed as Criminal Case No. D-10204, charged De la Cruz as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“That on or about the 29th day of November, 1990, in the City of 
Dagupan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, LAUDEMAR DELA CRUZ y Verdadero, being 
then armed with a gun, with treachery, evident premeditation and with 
intent to kill one CESAR MACASIEB, did then and there, wilfully, 
unlawfully and criminally, attack, assault and use personal violence 
upon the latter by shooting and hitting him on vital parts of his body 
with the said weapon, thereby causing his death shortly thereafter due 
to `[c]ardio respiratory arrest, massive intrathoracic hemorrhage, 
multiple gunshot wound’ as per Autopsy Report issued by Dr. Tomas G. 
Cornel, Asst. City Health Officer, this City, to the damage and 
prejudice of the legal heirs of said deceased, CESAR MACASIEB, in the 
amount of not less than THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P30,000.00) Philippine 
currency, and other consequential damages.”

<p>In the third,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> fourth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and fifth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 Informations docketed as Criminal Case Nos. D-10205, D-10206 and 
D-10207, respectively, De la Cruz was separately accused of attempting 
to kill Absalon B. Villabroza, Nivelly Aliven and Bernardo Domingo. 
Except for the names of the victims and the location of the wound 
sustained by each, the three Informations similarly allege the 
following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“That on or about the 29th day of November, 1990, in the City of 
Dagupan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, LAUDEMAR DELA CRUZ y Verdadero, being

ABSALON B. VILLABROZA, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully, and 
criminally, attack, assault and use personal violence upon the latter by
 shooting and hitting him on the left shoulder with the said weapon, the
 said accused having thus commenced a felony directly by overt acts but 
did not perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the
 crime of murder by reason of some cause or accident other than his own 
spontaneous desistance, to the damage and prejudice of the herein 
complainant, ABSALON B. VILLABROZA.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last Information, filed as Criminal Case No. D-10769, charged De la Cruz with frustrated murder as follows:

with a gun, with treachery, evident premeditation and with intent to 
kill one RICARDO FERNANDEZ, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and
 criminally, attack, assault and use personal violence upon the latter 
by shooting him, hitting him on the face and right arm with the said 
gun, the said accused having thus performed all the acts of execution 
which could have produced the crime of murder as a consequence, but 
which nevertheless did not produce it by reason of some causes 
independent of the will of the perpetrator, that is due to the timely 
and able medical attendance rendered to him, to the damage and prejudice
 of the herein complainant, RICARDO FERNANDEZ.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>

<p align="center"><strong><u>The Facts</u></strong>
<br>
<u><strong><em>Version of the Prosecution</em></strong></u>
</p><p>The antecedents of the case, as established by the prosecution 
and to which the trial court gave credence, evolved in the manner 
narrated below.
</p><p>Around 10:00 o’clock in the evening of November 29, 1990, Ricardo
 Fernandez alias Ricky, then 29 years of age, was having some drinks 
with his friend Cesar Macasieb at the Crisan Canteen located along Reyes
 Street, Dagupan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
Shortly, three men, who turned out to be Bernardo Domingo, Absalon 
Villabroza and Nivelly Aliven, arrived. Their two other companions, 
Cesar Diolazo and Jolly de Guzman, stayed ten to fifteen meters away 
from the canteen to watch over the fish which they were to deliver for 
their employer, the Pacific Farms Incorporated, to Aling Aning at the 
Magsaysay Market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>According to Fernandez, he was still drinking with Macasieb when Appellant Laudemar de la Cruz arrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He did not know appellant but had seen him in a wake at the Funeraria Dagupan sometime in August or September 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 Upon arriving, appellant ordered a bottle of beer which he drank near 
the entrance of the canteen, about three to five meters from where 
Fernandez and Macasieb were seated. Then, appellant, who had not 
finished his bottle of beer, went outside the canteen. Fernandez saw him
 sit on a chair by the entrance. As they continued conversing and 
drinking, he disappeared, during which time, Fernandez surmised, he must
 have urinated. Appellant reappeared and had another drink before 
leaving again. Then, suddenly, appellant emerged and shot Macasieb. As 
the latter fell, appellant also shot Fernandez on the face, causing him 
to feel dizzy and to fall. After a while, Fernandez rose and ran to the 
police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
</p><p>Bernardo Domingo, a driver in his early forties, related that he 
was with two companions in the same restaurant on that fateful night. 
While eating, he glanced at the door and noticed a man standing while 
drinking beer some two meters away. The man, who was wearing a jacket 
and a hat, used two hands in gunning down, first, the two persons who 
were drinking; then, Villabroza, Domingo himself, and Aliven in that 
order. Domingo’s left thigh and right arm were hit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 Villabroza was in the act of putting a spoon of food into his mouth 
when he was hit by appellant on his left shoulder. He fell and, when he 
came to his senses, saw that Domingo and Aliven were also injured. He 
then glanced at the door; not seeing appellant anymore, he ran with his 
companions towards the road to look for their two other companions who 
could bring them to the hospital. It turned out that Diolazo and De 
Guzman were already on their way to the police, when they met a mobile 
car proceeding to the restaurant. Domingo, Villabroza and Aliven were 
taken to the Luzon Medical Center (LMC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
</p><p>Sgt. Reynaldo de Vera was on duty at the Dagupan City Police 
Station on that same evening. Around 10:00 p.m., a bloodied Fernandez, 
with a gunshot wound on his face, arrived at the police station, where 
he reported to Sgt. De Vera that he had been shot at the Crisan Store. 
The police rushed Fernandez to the Pangasinan Medical Center and, on the
 way, learned from him that it was De la Cruz who had shot him. As 
Fernandez was being treated at the hospital, Sgt. De Vera and his group 
returned to the police station, where they were instructed to proceed to
 the crime scene which was about three hundred meters from the police 
station.
</p><p>The police found the store in disarray, with bottles and drinking
 glasses scattered around. They found three slugs of a .45 caliber 
firearm and five empty shells from a firearm of the same caliber, which 
were later forwarded to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for 
examination. The women at the canteen told the police that they 
recognized the man who had shot the victims, but that they did not know 
his name. From the canteen, Sgt. De Vera proceeded to the LMC and 
learned that the other victims were Domingo, Aliven, Villabroza, and 
Macasieb who was already dead.
</p><p>From the hospital, the police went back to their station to scan 
the police blotter to verify Fernandez’ information that his brother had
 previously lodged a complaint against the man who shot them. True 
enough, Sgt. De Vera learned from the police records that a certain Boy 
Fernandez, Councilor Doria and another barangay councilor had complained
 against Laudemar de la Cruz for alleged threats during a card game.
</p><p>Upon learning the identity of the man who had gone on the 
shooting rampage, Sgt. De Vera, in the company of several policemen, 
proceeded to the residence of appellant at Pantal Centro. Before 
reaching his house, however, they saw him seated in a waiting shed with a
 gun in his hand. The police thus drew their weapons as they approached 
him, but he threw his gun towards the back of the waiting shed. Cpl. 
Zosimo Fabia retrieved the .45 caliber pistol that was later forwarded 
to the NBI for examination.
</p><p>The police then arrested appellant and took him to the police 
station where he was investigated. Then they brought him to the 
Pangasinan Medical Center, where Fernandez pointed to him as the man who
 had shot him. Afterwards, the police also took appellant to the LMC, 
where the other victims likewise positively identified him as the person
 who had fired at them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>The death certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 issued by Dr. Tomas G. Cornel, assistant city health officer of Dagupan
 City, shows that 35-year-old Cesar Macasieb died due to “cardio 
respiratory arrest” and “massive intrathoracic hemorrhage” caused by the
 gunshot wounds Macasieb sustained on his right wrist, left hand and the
 anterior chest wall “along the parasternal line, right, level of the 
2nd intercostal space, right, 0.8 cm. in diameter, round in shape”; with
 a point of exit at the “posterior aspect (back) along the scapular 
line, left, level of the 5th intercostal space left, 1 cm. in diameter, 
irregular in shape.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>Macasieb was an employee of the Funeraria Dagupan, who earned at 
least P400 a week. His widow, Avelina, a laundrywoman, was left with 
three children aged 14, 11 and 6 years. It was Macasieb’s maternal 
grandmother, Candida Bustillo, who spent for his funeral expenses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>which, referring to an inventory she prepared, amounted to P30,400.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In court, she presented a receipt showing that she paid P12,000 to Funeraria Dagupan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 and another receipt, issued by the Eternal Gardens Memorial Park in 
Dagupan, showing that she paid a total of P6,100 for the memorial park 
lot and the interment fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
</p><p>For Villabroza, a medical certificate, which attested to the treatment he received for his injuries,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 was issued by Drs. Carlito V. Arenas and Marilou Arizabal of the LMC 
Specialists Group, Inc. His statement of account shows that he spent 
P31,420.11 for his twelve-day hospitalization<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and P17,784.00 for professional fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 According to him, his employer paid to the LMC the amount of P39,000, 
which did not include the cost of the stainless steel metal that was 
inserted into his upper arm bone. In addition, he lost his daily income 
of P110 when, for two months, he was unable to resume his work as a 
driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
</p><p>Nivelly Aliven, who did not testify during the trial, merely submitted a medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> as proof of the injuries he sustained; and a billing statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>for his two-day hospitalization at the LMC, showing his medical expenses which added up to P1,082.50.
</p><p>Bernardo Domingo also sustained two lacerated wounds on the 
thigh, a fractured right forearm and a “through and through” gunshot 
wound at the lateral aspect of the right forearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He stayed for three days in the same hospital and spent a total of P2,251.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
</p><p>For Ricardo Fernandez, his attending physician, Dr. Corlito T. de
 Guzman, gave this diagnosis in the medico-legal certificate he issued:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Fracture comminuted maxillary anterior multiple laceration buccal mucosa secondary to [g]un [s]hot wound </p>
  <p>SURGICAL INTERVENTION: November 30, 1990
  </p>
  <p>- debridement and removal of foreign body”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For his twenty-five day stay in the hospital, his mother spent 
P32,000. Receipts labeled “Exh. D” to “Exh. D-60” reflect the expenses 
he incurred for medicines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Furthermore, he was required to undergo medical checkup for six months.
</p><p>NBI Senior Ballistician Ireneo S. Ordiano Jr. brought to court 
the .45 caliber pistol and the magazine containing four live ammunitions
 taken from appellant; and five empty shells and three bullets gathered 
from the crime scene. He testified that, after test-firing from the same
 firearm, he compared the test bullet with an evidence bullet and, 
finding that both evidence and test bullets had similar individual 
chambers and striations engraved on their surfaces,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> concluded that both were fired from the evidence firearm. His findings are contained in a report marked “Exh. G.”
</p><p align="center"><u><em><strong>Version of the Defense</strong></em></u><em><strong></strong>
</em>
</p><p>Testifying in his own defense, appellant claimed that he joined 
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in 1987. In 1988, he was 
promoted to the rank of private first class; the following year, to 
corporal, for his having been part of the team that apprehended a 
CPP-NPA regional commander named Francisco Pascual, a feat for which he 
was also awarded a certificate and a bronze cross medal for 
“distinguished exemplary services” in the AFP. On September 11, 1990, he
 was wounded in a military operation in Labrador for which he was given a
 spot promotion to desk sergeant. During the incident involved in this 
case, appellant was assigned to the “46346 Military Intelligence 
Company, 7th Division, Fort Magsaysay, Palayan City.” He was in Dagupan 
City on a “stick [sic] out operation” under the command of Capt. 
Winnefred Perez. As an intelligence officer, he was issued a .45 caliber
 firearm, Serial No. 2126560.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
</p><p>He was alone conducting surveillance under the stakeout operation
 when, about nine o’clock in the evening of November 29, 1990, he was at
 the vicinity of Crisan Canteen. There he met Gil Vismanos, a resident 
of the same barangay, who invited him for a drink. Vismanos seated 
himself outside the canteen, while he went inside to order. Appellant 
was ordering beer when he was fired upon from his right side. Seeing a 
revolver pointed at him from that side, he immediately dropped to the 
ground, at the same time drawing out from his waist his .45 caliber 
firearm that was loaded with seven bullets. He fired three shots towards
 the three men at his right side, but none at the two men who were at 
the opposite side. As he was firing, he was crawling backward towards 
the door of the canteen. He heard “many shots” from the men, but could 
not ascertain what direction they came from.
</p><p>Upon reaching the door, he would have proceeded to the south but 
he opted to go northward, because this portion of Reyes Street was dark.
 He crossed the river by means of a boat, intending to go home and call 
up his superiors in Lingayen from the telephone of his neighbor, Atty. 
Areola. At Atty. Areola’s residence, he tried, for twenty-five to thirty
 minutes, to contact his unit in Lingayen, but in vain. Thus, he 
proceeded to the waiting shed to hire a tricycle that would take him to 
Lingayen. He was at the waiting shed when the police arrived and leveled
 their guns at him. All he could do was surrender his firearm to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
</p><p>According to Gil Vismanos, he invited appellant to join him for a
 bottle of beer, because they had not seen each other for a long time. 
Vismanos seated himself in one of the stalls in front of the Crisan 
Canteen. As appellant entered the canteen to buy beer, Vismanos heard 
“some shots” coming from “several kinds of guns.” Appellant drew his gun
 and “retaliated” but did not remain for long inside the canteen, as he 
“ran towards the river.” Afraid to be caught in the crossfire, Vismanos 
also ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
</p><p>Hernando Magana, a graduate of the Armament Maintenance and 
Repair Course in Fort Magsaysay, a noncommissioned AFP officer and 
weapons instructor, testified mainly on the effect of a .45 caliber 
bullet on its target. According to Magana, a .45 caliber bullet is so 
strong that a face hit by it would disintegrate (mawawasak), such that 
the victim would not be able to observe the subsequent events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the trial court convicted accused-appellant
 of the charges of murder, attempted murder and frustrated murder, but 
acquitted him of the charge of illegal possession of firearms.
</p><p align="center"><u><strong>Assignment of Errors</strong></u><strong></strong>
</p><p>In this appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> appellant attributes to the trial court the following errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“1.               THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO CONSIDER
 THE APPELLANT’S PLEA OF A ‘SHOOTOUT’ AND THAT APPELLANT MERELY RETURNED
 FIRE TO DEFEND HIMSELF; </p>
  <p>2.  THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE QUALIFYING 
CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE ATTACK WAS ALLEGEDLY SUDDEN
 AND UNEXPECTED AND THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF NIGHTTIME SIMPLY 
BECAUSE THE INCIDENT TRANSPIRED AT NIGHTTIME; and
  </p>
  <p>3.  THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT DECLARING THAT THE 
PROSECUTION FAILED TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE
 DOUBT AND IN NOT ACQUITTING THE APPELLANT.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><u><strong>The Court’s Ruling </strong></u>
</p><p>The appeal lacks merit.
</p><p align="center"><u><strong>First Issue: <em>Self-Defense</em></strong></u>
</p><p>In alleging a shoot-out that required his corresponding reaction,
 appellant impliedly raises the justifying circumstance of self-defense.
 Thus, during the cross-examination of Prosecution Witness Bernardo 
Domingo, appellant’s counsel tried to ferret out factual bases for the 
version of the defense that the three men eating inside the canteen and 
their two companions who remained outside were armed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 For the same purpose, during the cross-examination of Witness Absalon 
Villabroza, the defense tried but failed to make him confirm their 
assertion that he and his companions “were actually coming up to the 
accused” before appellant shot at them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
 Appellant himself testified that he had been fired upon by one of the 
men in the canteen before he drew his gun and fired back. However, 
appellant’s evidence on the matter does not measure up to the quantum of
 proof required by law to merit his exoneration from the charges.
</p><p>In self-defense, an accused admits to having performed the 
criminal act. He may, however, disclaim legal liability on the ground 
that his life had been exposed to harm first, before he committed the 
act in defense of himself. Consequently, once self-defense is invoked, 
the burden of proof is shifted to the accused to establish the following
 elements: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (b) 
reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it, and 
(3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending 
himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Of these 
requisites, the most indispensable is unlawful aggression on the part of
 the victim. Failure of the defense to prove unlawful aggression results
 in the failure of the claim of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
</p><p>By his own testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
 appellant tried to prove unlawful aggression on the part of the 
victims. He claimed that he was merely in the act of ordering a bottle 
of beer, when someone from his right side fired at him. His friend Gil 
Vismanos supported this claim by testifying that he <em>heard</em> shots from different kinds of firearms before he saw appellant retaliate. But because Vismanos only <em>heard</em>
 gunshots while he was outside the canteen, without actually seeing who 
fired the initial shot, the reliability of his supporting testimony on 
the fact of unlawful aggression cannot be given weight sufficient to 
tilt the scale of justice in favor of the appellant.
</p><p>The elimination of Vismanos’ testimony on the shooting leaves 
appellant’s testimony as the sole basis for the claim of self-defense. 
Coming from the defendant himself, such assertion, being a self-serving 
claim from a polluted source, leaves much to be desired. A plea of 
self-defense cannot be justifiably appreciated, where it is not only 
uncorroborated by independent and competent evidence, but also extremely
 doubtful by itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>
</p><p>Indeed, if appellant’s version of the incident is true, then the 
victims were so naive as to commit the crime in a lighted public place, 
barely three hundred meters away from a police station. Considering 
their superiority in number, the victims could have chosen a more 
discreet place to ensure the successful execution of their alleged plan 
to ambush appellant who, as he himself claimed, was undertaking a 
surveillance mission single-handedly. If it is true that the victims 
instigated the incident, then none of them, including Fernandez whose 
face was hit by appellant’s gunfire, would have immediately run to the 
police station to report the incident. In contrast, when appellant was 
apprehended, he did not inform the police that there had been a 
shoot-out or that he had acted in self-defense. Such failure is fatal to
 his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
</p><p>Moreover, the disparate versions of the prosecution and of the 
defense as to who initiated the aggression was settled by the trial 
court, which gave unconditional credence to the testimonies of the 
prosecution witnesses. As this Court has held innumerable times, the 
sphere of discretion of trial courts rightfully includes determination 
of the issue of credibility. Absent any palpable error or arbitrariness 
in the findings of the lower court, we find no reason to conclude 
differently in this case, for we accord respect and finality to findings
 of the trial court on the matter of credibility of witnesses, which 
includes assigning value and weight to each of their testimonies. This 
is because a trial court has the opportunity, not available to an 
appellate court, of directly observing each witness’ deportment and 
manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
</p><p>The defense noticeably failed to impute to the prosecution 
witnesses any common motive among them that could have impelled them to 
attack appellant. Neither did it allege any evil purpose that could have
 spurred them to testify against him. Such failure renders the version 
of the defense all the more incredible.
</p><p>In insisting that the incident was actually a shoot-out, appellant points to the total of nine<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
 gunshot wounds sustained by the victims which far exceeded the three 
shots he had allegedly fired plus the four bullets remaining in his gun,
 which the police had retrieved upon his arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>
 He asserts that his .45 pistol has a full-load capacity of only seven 
bullets. This apparent discrepancy, however, is not beyond explanation. 
We recall Victim Bernardo Domingo’s testimony:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q    How many shots [were] made by the gun w[i]elder? </p>
  <p>A     With one shot was directed to one of my companions, and 
myself, considerably two shots. I was hit on my thigh and again, I was 
shot on my forearm and still hit the man besides me. [sic]
  </p>
  <p>Q     So, there were three shots of you?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, because the first hit Villabroza, the second shot hit 
me on my thigh and third, my arm, but it went through and through and 
hit Aliven.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What part of the body of Aliven was hit?
  </p>
  <p>A      Here, sir. (Witness pointing to the right side of his body.)
  </p>
  <p>xxx  xxx        xxx
  </p>
  <p>Q     Did you come to know if any slug was recovered from the body of Aliven?
  </p>
  <p>A      None, the bullet went through and through.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Do you know if any slug was taken from the body of Villabroza?
  </p>
  <p>A      The bullet exited.
  </p>
  <p>Q     In your case, was there any slug that was recovered?
  </p>
  <p>A      The bullet went through and through.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is thus not improbable, considering the proximity of the victims 
to one another and the existence of gunshot wounds with exit points, 
which some of them sustained, that one shot could have hit two or more 
of them. That a single bullet might have hit two or more persons 
“through and through” was in fact affirmed by Defense Witness Magana, 
who testified on the potency of a .45 caliber firearm.
</p><p>Furthermore, although there is no testimonial evidence that 
appellant reloaded his pistol, documentary evidence reveals that he had 
been issued more than seven (7) bullets for it. Exhibit 1 shows that Lt.
 Winnefred Perez simultaneously issued to appellant a .45 caliber 
service pistol, two (2) magazines and fourteen (14) rounds of cartridges
 for the same pistol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> 
Hence, if appellant had not reloaded his gun during the incident, it is 
not improbable or beyond credulity that he reloaded it after he fled 
from the canteen, as a result of which it still contained four (4) live 
bullets when the police retrieved it behind the waiting shed, where 
appellant had thrown it.
</p><p>Worth underscoring is the fact that <em>no other kind of bullet was recovered from the crime scene</em>.
 Even more significant is the finding that the empty shells and slugs 
recovered were all fired from the .45 caliber firearm issued to 
appellant. In the absence of proof to rebut the presumption of 
regularity in the performance of their task, the police can be presumed 
to have made a thorough search for evidence at the crime scene. Thus, 
nothing but a vain attempt at paving the way for his exculpation is the 
accounting by appellant of the number of bullets fired from his pistol 
and that of the live ones recovered from it upon his arrest.
</p><p>Of paramount importance is the fact that the prosecution has 
proven beyond reasonable doubt that appellant fired the shots which 
caused the death of Cesar Macasieb and the wounding of four others. The 
positive identification of appellant as the gun wielder, coupled with 
his failure to substantiate his self-defense allegation, points to no 
conclusion other than that he is responsible and, thus, liable for the 
crimes charged.
</p><p align="center"><u><strong>Second Issue: <em>Treachery and Nighttime</em></strong></u>
</p><p>In convicting appellant of murder and frustrated and attempted 
murders, the trial court appreciated the attendance of treachery. For 
treachery to be considered a qualifying circumstance, two conditions 
must be satisfied: (a) the malefactor employed such means, method or 
manner of execution as to ensure his or her safety from the defensive or
 retaliatory acts of the victim; and (b) the said means, method or 
manner of execution was deliberately adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>
 The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without 
warning -- done in a swift and unexpected manner, affording the hapless,
 unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Under the established facts of the case, we find the conclusion of the court <em>a quo</em> in order.
</p><p>Indeed, the assault made by appellant was sudden and unexpected, 
completely taking the persons inside the canteen by surprise. None of 
the victims had any inkling that appellant who was a stranger to all of 
them, except to Victim Ricardo Fernandez, would go on a shooting 
rampage. Fernandez may have noticed that appellant came and went three 
times prior to the attack, but neither this nor any other act exhibited 
by the latter was a sufficient warning of impending trouble or an 
indication of his criminal intent against any of the victims.
</p><p>Thus, when accused-appellant fired at the unsuspecting victims 
suddenly and without warning, they were all caught off guard, affording 
them no opportunity to shield themselves or to run away, much less, to 
retaliate against their lone assailant. Furthermore, he was armed while,
 apparently, none of them was. The manner in which he carried out his 
felonious acts ensured that his criminal design would succeed, and that 
he would escape unscathed, as he did. Verily, the qualifying 
circumstance of <em>alevosia</em> was present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>
</p><p>However, the generic aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot
 be appreciated against appellant. The fact alone that the crimes were 
committed at night does not automatically aggravate the crimes. 
Nocturnity becomes a modifying element only when (1) it is specially 
sought by the offender; (2) the offender takes advantage of it; or (3) 
it facilitates the commission of the crime by insuring the offender’s 
immunity from identification or capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>
 In this case, other than the time of the commission of the crimes, 
nothing else suggests that appellant deliberately availed himself or 
took advantage of the cover of darkness to facilitate the accomplishment
 of his felonious design. On the contrary, the <em>locus criminis</em> was well-lighted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>
</p><p align="center"><u><strong>Third Issue:
    <br>
    <em>Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</em></strong></u>
</p><p>While, on the one hand, based on the prosecution evidence and the
 foregoing discussion, we entertain no doubt as to the culpability of 
accused-appellant for the murder of Cesar Macasieb and for the attempted
 murders of Absalon Villabroza, Nivelly Aliven and Bernardo Domingo, on 
the other hand we believe that the court <em>a quo</em> erred in convicting appellant of frustrated murder for his assault upon Ricardo Fernandez.
</p><p>In a <em>frustrated</em> felony, the perpetrator performs all 
acts necessary to produce the crime but, for some reason other than his 
own spontaneous desistance, the felony is not consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>
 Appellant De la Cruz, however, failed to perform all the acts of 
execution necessary to kill Fernandez. According to the latter, after he
 had been shot, he felt dizzy and fell to the ground but was able to 
stand again and run to the police station. When he was taken to the 
hospital, he remained conscious. His injuries, though no doubt serious, 
were not proven to be fatal such that, without timely medical attention,
 they would have caused his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Hence, for the injuries inflicted upon Ricardo Fernandez, appellant may be held liable only for attempted murder.
</p><p>The penalty imposable on a principal in an attempted murder, where there is no aggravating or mitigating circumstance, is <em>prision correccional</em> in its maximum period to <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, appellant shall suffer the penalty of two (2) years and four (4) months of <em>prision correccional</em>, as minimum, to eight (8) years of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum, for <em>each</em> of the four (4) counts of attempted murder.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the assailed Decision is <em>AFFIRMED</em> with the <em>MODIFICATION</em>
 that no generic aggravating circumstance is deemed to have attended the
 commission of the crimes and that, for the injuries inflicted upon 
Ricardo Fernandez, Appellant Laudemar de la Cruz is liable only for 
attempted murder. Appellant’s penalties, which shall be served 
successively in accordance with law, consist of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> for the crime of murder and four (4) separate terms of imprisonment ranging from two (2) years and four (4) months of <em>prision correccional</em>, as minimum, to eight (8) years of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum, for the four (4) counts of attempted murder. Costs against appellant.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
