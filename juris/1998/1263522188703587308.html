				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision of 
the Court of Appeals. Petitioner Joaquin E. David was charged, in two 
separate informations, with homicide and frustrated homicide for the 
fatal shooting of Noel Nora and the serious wounding of the latter’s 
brother, Narciso Nora, Jr., on March 28, 1981, in Malabon, Metro Manila.
<p>After trial, petitioner was found guilty as charged. The 
dispositive portion of the decision, dated August 17, 1988, of the 
Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of Homicide under Articles 249 and 64(1) of the 
Revised Penal Code, and for the crime of Frustrated Homicide under 
Articles 249 and 50, without any mitigating or aggravating circumstance 
in both cases, and hereby sentences the accused,
  </p>
  <p>For the crime of Homicide, to suffer an indeterminate sentence of 
EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor medium, as minimum, to 
SIXTEEN (16) YEARS of reclusion temporal medium, as maximum;
  </p>
  <p>For the crime of Frustrated Homicide, to suffer an indeterminate 
sentence of TWO (2) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision correccional as 
minimum, to EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor, as 
maximum.

  <p>And ordering the accused:

<ol><li>      To indemnify the heirs of Noel Nora the sum of -
      <br>            
      P30,000.00 for the death of Noel Nora

      <br>
      or a total sum of P28,000.00 </li></ol>
  <p>SO ORDERED.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 rendered on October 29, 1992, modified the sentence after crediting 
petitioner with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>The penalty prescribed by law for homicide is <em>reclusion temporal</em>.
 Since there is one (1) mitigating and no aggravating circumstance, the 
penalty should be imposed in the [sic] its minimum period. Applying the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the range of penalty next lower to that 
prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the offense is <em>prision mayor</em>. For the crime of Homicide, the penalty is therefore modified to a minimum of 10 years and 1 day of <em>prision mayor</em> to a maximum of 14 years and 8 months of <em>reclusion temporal</em>.
  </p>
  <p>As to the crime of Frustrated Homicide, the same is likewise modified to a minimum of 4 years and 1 day of <em>prision correccional</em> to a maximum of 6 years and 1 day of <em>prision mayor</em>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WHEREFORE, except for the modifications above indicated, the rest of the appealed judgment is hereby AFFIRMED in all respects.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>SO ORDERED.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 29, 1992, the appellate court further modified the sentence 
on petitioner on the ground that the evidence did not show that he had a
 police record or that he was incorrigible. The dispositive portion of 
the court’s resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, except for the penalties imposed which is hereby 
modified to read as follows: 1) for the crime of Homicide with one 
mitigating circumstance - the penalty ranging from six (6) years and one
 (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em> <u>as minimum</u> and twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal</em> <u>as maximum</u>; and 2) for the crime of frustrated homicide with one mitigating circumstance - six (6) months and one (1) day of <em>prision correccional</em> <u>as minimum</u> to six (6) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em> <u>as maximum</u>, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED for lack of merit.
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still not satisfied, petitioner brought this appeal from the 
decision, as modified, of the Court of Appeals. Petitioner contends that<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>-

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prosecution evidence in this case is as follows:
</p><p>On March 28, 1981, at about 10:00 p.m., while the Nora brothers 
Arturo, Arnel, Noel and Narciso were walking along Flerida Street in 
Malabon, Metro Manila on their way home to Capitan Tiago Street, they 
saw petitioner near the compound of his house. Noel Nora, the deceased, 
confronted him about derogatory remarks allegedly made by the latter. 
Petitioner ran to his house to get a gun. When the Nora brothers reached
 the intersection of Flerida and Capitan Tiago Streets, he shouted at 
them “<em>Putang ina ninyo</em> (You sons of a bitch)” and other 
epithets, and then fired four times at them. One shot hit Noel, killing 
him. Another shot hit Narciso Nora on the ankle. Another nearly hit the 
zipper of Arturo Nora.
</p><p>Petitioner claimed self-defense. He alleged that on the night in 
question, he went to the corner of Flerida and Capitan Tiago Streets 
because Noel Nora had earlier challenged him to a fight. However, upon 
reaching the place, he found that Noel had brought along his three (3) 
brothers and other companions who ganged up on him. Petitioner claimed 
that Noel Nora stabbed him with a knife, hitting him on the left arm and
 that the group could have stabbed him several times more had he not 
been able to dodge their blows. He said when he tried to run away, the 
victim’s brothers held both his arms while Narciso hit him with a piece 
of wood on the thighs and buttocks and the others boxed him on the 
abdomen. Petitioner said he was able to run away, but the Nora brothers 
chased him, shouting, “We will enter your house and we will kill you.” 
Petitioner therefore took the .38 caliber gun of his father (who was a 
policeman) from the cabinet on the ground floor of their house.
</p><p>Petitioner went out of the house. The Nora brothers, who were 
just five (5) steps away from the door of their house, ran after seeing 
that petitioner had a gun. But after running to the other side of the 
street, they hurled stones at petitioner and shouted derogatory words at
 him. Petitioner claimed he afterward went inside the compound, but he 
slipped, whereupon the Nora brothers advanced toward him. He warned them
 not to get near, but they kept coming closer, for which reason 
petitioner fired at them. Petitioner was then from four (4) to five (5) 
meters away from the group. Petitioner afterward went inside their house
 and gave the gun to his mother.
</p><p>In rejecting petitioner’s claim of self-defense, the Court of Appeals said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>The bone of contention in this case centers on the issue of 
self-defense. The trial court, in denying the same, ruled that since 
there was no unlawful aggression immediately preceeding [<em>sic</em>] the shooting of the victims, the claim of self-defense to justify the acts of the accused is unavailing.
  </p>
  <p>For its part, the appellant contends that the lower court erred in 
its appreciation of the evidence and testimony of witnesses relative to 
the locus of the shooting incident. The appellant claims that 
notwithstanding the direct contradiction made by defense witnesses 
regarding the locus of the crime, the same does not in any way diminish 
the credibility of appellant’s story and his claim of self-defense. </p>
  <p>The contention is devoid of merit. In this case, the issue with 
respect to the locus of the crime is determinative not only of the place
 of its commission. More importantly, it is decisive in determining the 
existence of unlawful aggression as justification for appellant’s claim 
of self-defense. </p>
  <p>The facts of the case and the evidence presented during the trial 
reveal that the shooting of the victims happened outside the residential
 compound of the accused. No matter how the defense try to belabour the 
issue by claiming in its reply brief that there were in fact two (2) 
compounds - the residence of the accused being a small compound within 
the bigger compound of his relatives’ residence and that the victims 
were shot inside this big section albeit outside the residential 
compound of the accused, the evident fact remains that the victims were 
shot not in the vicinity of appellant’s residence as claimed by the 
defense but in the streets, after the accused has taken his father’s gun
 from their house. Noteworthy is the testimony of defendant’s mother to 
the effect that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Court:              The Court would like to ask. Was your son 
outside or inside the gate of your compound when you went to verify the 
shots?
    </p>
    <p>Witness:         He was about to enter the gate of our compound.
    </p>
    <p>Court:              When you say he was about to enter the gate 
of the compound, he was coming from the outside of the compound of 
course?
    </p>
    <p>Witness:         He was outside the gate of our compound.
    </p>
    <p>(TSN, 11 November 1987 p. 13)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The accused who claims self-defense must prove its elements clearly
 and convincingly. The rationale is because such proceeds from the 
admission of the accused that he killed or wounded another, which is a 
felony, for which he should be criminally liable unless he established 
to the satisfaction of the Court the fact of legitimate defense 
(Castanares v. Court of Appeals, 92 SCRA 567)
  </p>
  <p>As correctly appreciated by the trial court, the evidence 
established that there was in fact no immediate unlawful aggression to 
warrant the acts of the accused in shooting the victims. While the 
accused was indeed mauled and beaten up by the deceased and his 
companions, the aggression stopped when the accused was able to free 
himself from the assault of the group and thereafter sought refuge in 
their house. An act of aggression, when its author does not persist in 
his purpose or when he discontinues his attitude to the extent that the 
object of his attack is no longer in peril is not unlawful aggression 
warranting self-defense (People v. Macariola, 120 SCRA 92)
  </p>
  <p>Having sought refuge in their house after the aggression had 
ceased, the accused should have desisted from stepping out of their 
abode with his father’s gun. In going after the deceased and his 
companions after the unlawful aggression ceased to exist, the act of the
 accused became retaliatory in nature, done for the purpose of avenging 
whatever pain and injuries he had suffered from the hands of the 
victims. Consequently, the same cannot be considered as constituting 
self-defense for the act to repel the unlawful aggression must 
immediately follow such unlawful aggression (US v. Ferrer, 1 Phil. 56). </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>First</em>. Petitioner contends that the unlawful aggression of 
the Noras and their group did not cease and that the finding of the 
Court of Appeals that it did is contrary to the evidence, particularly 
the testimonies of Inocencio Antonio and Florthelito Vergara. 
</p><p>Petitioner omits to mention the testimonies of his two other 
witnesses, Eduardo Bartolo and Pilar David, on which the trial court and
 the Court of Appeals relied for their finding that there was no longer 
any unlawful aggression when petitioner shot the victims. Bartolo 
testified that on March 28, 1981, he heard shots and the sound of stones
 being hurled. When he stepped out of his house to find out what was 
going on, he saw petitioner near the gate of their compound, aiming his 
gun at the Nora brothers. For her part, Pilar David, mother of 
petitioner, told the court that because she heard gunshots, she went to 
the gate of their compound to see what was going on. She said she saw 
petitioner getting inside the gate of the compound.
</p><p>Another defense witness, Inocencio Antonio, testified that the 
victims were rushing toward petitioner when they were at the corner of 
Flerida and Kapitan Tiago Streets. Antonio said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. CRESCINI: [Defense Lawyer]
  </p>
  <p>Q     Where were those teenagers numbering 5 to 6 at that time that Jake David was about to fire those two (2) last shots?
  </p>
  <p>A      At the corner of Flerida and Kapitan Tiago Streets and they were rushing towards Jake David, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The testimonies of these witnesses belie petitioner’s claim that he 
shot the Nora brothers because they had come dangerously close to 
getting inside their house, having in fact entered their compound. 
Indeed, only Florthelito Vergara corroborated petitioner’s testimony 
that he shot the victims because they had come close to their house by 
getting inside their compound. 
</p><p>The defense tries to explain the contrary testimonies of the 
witnesses by pointing out that there are actually two compounds - a big 
compound fronting Flerida Street, which is occupied by his uncles’ 
houses, and a small one in which petitioner’s parents live. It claims 
that petitioner shot the Noras outside the small, but inside the big, 
compound. But, as the Court of Appeals held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>. . . . No matter how the defense try to belabor the issue by 
claiming in its reply brief that there were in fact two (2) compounds . .
 . the evident fact remains that the victims were shot not in the 
vicinity of appellant’s residence as claimed by the defense but in the 
streets . . . </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner contends that between the prosecution testimony and his 
testimony which is corroborated by two disinterested witnesses for the 
defense, their testimonies should be preferred. He cites the ruling in <em>People v. Quiritan</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>In a serious charge of murder, the guilt of the accused cannot be 
predicated on delayed and even inconclusive testimonies of alleged 
eyewitnesses which manifest signs of fabrication.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, in that case, the delay in producing the witnesses (two years), 
coupled with the generally weak and confusing testimonies given by them,
 showed that their statements had been concocted. There is nothing to 
show that the testimonies of prosecution witnesses in this case were 
fabricated. The <em>Quiritan</em> case is a very different case from that at bar.
</p><p>Findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are 
entitled to great respect because it has the opportunity to observe the 
deportment of the witnesses and their manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 The decision of the trial court in this case is notable for its 
painstaking analysis of the evidence of the parties. Its conclusion that
 the prosecution witnesses were more credible than the defense witnesses
 should be upheld in the absence of proof that it has overlooked certain
 important matters as to the credibility of the witnesses.
</p><p>In shooting the victims, petitioner was not acting to protect 
himself but retaliating for the insult and physical violence he had 
received at the hands of the victims and their group. In retaliation, 
the aggression that was begun by the injured party has already ceased 
when the accused attacks him. In self-defense, the aggression still 
exists when the aggressor is injured or disabled by the person making 
the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>In this case, defense witness Inocencio Antonio said that the 
victims and their companions were already running away because they saw 
petitioner armed with a gun. The unlawful aggression had thus already 
ceased when the latter fired at them. As Antonio testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. CRESCINI:
  </p>
  <p>Q:    Now, what did those teenagers, do after Jake David fired two (2) warning shots in the air?
  </p>
  <p>A:     They were frightened and retreated towards Flerida Street and some at Kapitan Tiago Street, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q:    How about Jake David, what did he do when those teenagers ran some to Flerida Street and other [<em>sic</em>] at Kapitan Tiago Street?
  </p>
  <p>A:     He advanced up to the corner of Flerida and Capitan Tiago Street, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An act of aggression, when its author does not persist in his 
purpose, or when he discontinues his attitude to the extent that the 
object of his attack is no longer in peril, is not unlawful aggression 
warranting self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
</p><p><em>Second</em>. Petitioner claims that the appellate court failed to consider exculpatory facts in his favor.
</p><p>1. Petitioner claims he was injured and that his injuries, 
although minor, show that he was attacked by the Noras, for which reason
 he filed a complaint for frustrated homicide against them in the 
fiscal’s office.
</p><p>This fact was not overlooked by the appellate court. However, it 
found that “While the accused was indeed mauled and beaten up by the 
deceased and his companions, the aggression stopped when the accused was
 able to free himself from the assault of the group and thereafter 
sought refuge in his house.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
</p><p>2. Petitioner felt depressed after the shooting. He vomited and 
could not eat and had to be hospitalized. These circumstances show that 
he is not a killer at heart and certainly not the villain that the lower
 court pictured him to be. Furthermore, petitioner was so afraid he had 
to close his eyes in firing his gun. Proof of this is that Narciso Nora 
was only hit at the ankle. 
</p><p>The undisputed fact is that the petitioner fired four shots, one a
 warning shot and three others directed at the victims. Two (2) of the 
three (3) shots directed against the victims hit their marks. One bullet
 killed Noel Nora and the other almost killed Narciso Nora, Jr. If the 
testimony of the prosecution witnesses is to be believed, the third 
bullet almost hit the zipper of Arturo Nora. This fact belies 
petitioner’s assertion that he fired the gun with his eyes closed and 
only to defend himself.
</p><p>The fact that one shot hit Noel Nora on the chest, while the 
other hit Narciso, Jr. only on the ankle, could be due to petitioner’s 
nervousness and unsteady hand, but not to the fact that he did not 
really mean to shoot them. 
</p><p>Petitioner said he fired warning shots even as he warned them not
 to come near because, up to the last moment, he did not want to shoot 
the victims. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals gave no 
weight to this claim, apparently because of the inconsistency in the 
testimonies of the defense witnesses. Petitioner said he fired only one 
warning shot: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. CRESCINI:
  </p>
  <p>Q:    You declared that when you saw them approaching and taking 
advantage of your having slipped, they were armed and you felt very 
afraid and nervous, what did you do when you saw them approaching?
  </p>
  <p>WITNESS JOAQUIN DAVID
  </p>
  <p>A:     I fired the gun upwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But defense witness Inocencio Antonio said petitioner fired two warning shots:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. CRESCINI:
  </p>
  <p>Q:    Now according to you, he came out with a gun and fired two (2) shots, in what direction, did he fire those two (2) shots?
  </p>
  <p>A:     In the air, warning shots.
  </p>
  <p>Q:    Now what did those teenagers, do after Jake David fired two (2) warning shots in the air?
  </p>
  <p>A:     They were frightened and retreated towards Flerida Street and some at Kapitan Tiago Street, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antonio later tried to correct his mistake but in doing so, only 
succeeded in showing that he had lied. Testifying again on October 29, 
1985, Antonio said: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. CRESCINI: 
  </p>
  <p>Q:    You testified during the last hearing that you heard two (2) 
warning shots on the evening of March 28, 1981, do you remember that?
  </p>
  <p>A:     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q:    What made you say that there were, I am referring to the 
first two (2) warning shots, what made you say that they were warning 
shots?
  </p>
  <p>A:     I remember that I did not hear two (2) shots but only one, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q:    What made you say that the one (1) shot was a warning shot?
  </p>
  <p>A:     Because the gun was pointing upward, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inconsistency in the testimonies of the defense witnesses so 
undermined their credibility that both trial court and the Court of 
Appeals disregarded the testimonies. 
</p><p>3. It is claimed that petitioner is effeminate while in contrast,
 the deceased Noel Nora, his brother Lito, and a John Doe were bullies 
who, even at a very young age, had already been charged with slight 
physical injuries in two cases filed in the Municipal Court of Malabon. 
</p><p>The purpose is apparently to show the bad moral character and 
troublesome nature of the deceased and his brothers, and thereby to show
 the improbability of the offenses charged pursuant to Rule 130, §51 of 
the Revised Rules on Evidence. It is true that where self-defense is 
claimed and the character of the slaying is doubtful, evidence of the 
violent and dangerous character of the deceased is admissible for the 
purpose of determining whether the deceased or the accused was the 
aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The fact, 
however, is that the cases filed against the deceased had been 
dismissed. No inference of the violent character of the victims can be 
drawn from the mere fact that criminal cases had been filed against one 
of them.
</p><p><em>Third</em>. It is argued that, at any rate, petitioner should
 have been given credit for incomplete self-defense. It is not stated 
what element of self-defense is absent to make it incomplete. Be that as
 it may, our finding that there was no longer any unlawful aggression 
when petitioner shot the victims rules out the possibility of 
self-defense, whether complete or incomplete. 
</p><p>Petitioner further contends that certain mitigating 
circumstances, besides voluntary surrender, should have been considered 
in his favor, to wit: (a) that sufficient provocation or threat on the 
part of the offended party immediately preceded the act;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (b) that he acted in the immediate vindication of a grave offense committed against him;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (c) that he acted upon an impulse so powerful as to produce passion or obfuscation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><p>The mitigating circumstance of having acted in the immediate 
vindication of a grave offense may be appreciated. As the trial court 
and the Court of Appeals found, the petitioner had been beaten up by the
 Noras and their companions. Although the unlawful aggression had ceased
 when petitioner shot the Nora brothers, it was nonetheless a grave 
offense for the vindication of which petitioner may be given the benefit
 of a mitigating circumstance. As petitioner’s mother testified:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. RODRIGUEZ: [Private Prosecutor]
  </p>
  <p>Q:    Did you ask your son who fired the shots?
  </p>
  <p>A:     I told him, “Ikaw ba, Jake?” I told him, “Are you the one?” “Pinagtulung-tulungan nila po ako kasi.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the mitigating circumstances of passion or obfuscation and 
sufficient provocation cannot be considered apart from the circumstance 
of vindication of a grave offense. These circumstances all arose from 
one and the same incident, <em>i.e.</em>, the attack on the petitioner 
by the victims and their companions, so that they should be considered 
as one mitigating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
</p><p>Nor is the fact that petitioner has not shown himself to be 
incorrigible a ground for reducing the penalty on him, as the Court of 
Appeals held in its resolution on the motion for reconsideration. This 
is a ground for suspension of judgment of youthful offenders, <em>i.e.</em>, those over 9 but under 18 years of age,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 which of course could no longer be ordered since at the time the trial 
court rendered its decision petitioner was already over 18 years of age.
 Clearly, this is not a mitigating circumstance and should not be used 
as basis for reducing the penalty. 
</p><p>One circumstance not raised by the defense but evident from the 
record of this case is minority. In his statement to the police given on
 April 2, 1981, petitioner gave his personal circumstances as follows: 
“Joaquin David y Ejercito, 17 taong gulang, 2nd year college, binata at 
naninirahan sa 12-C Flerida St., Acacia, Malabon, Metro Manila.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 At the hearing on November 11, 1987, petitioner’s mother stated that he
 was 16 or 17 years old when the shooting incident happened:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>ATTY. RODRIGUEZ: 
  </p>
  <p>Q:    You know for a fact that your son Jake being only 17 on March . . . . 
  </p>
  <p>A:     16 or 17.
  </p>
  <p>Q:    Because he was only 16 or 17, as a young man and quite 
curious, you know for a fact that sometimes your son got hold of it?
  </p>
  <p>A:     I never saw him hold the gun of his father. I never for an instance saw him hold the gun of his father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the petitioner testified on March 11, 1987, he gave his age at that time as 22 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 
</p><p>It is thus clear that on March 28, 1981, when the crime was committed, he was only 17 years old. We have held in many cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 that if the accused alleges minority and the prosecution does not 
disprove his claim by contrary evidence, such allegation can be accepted
 as a fact. Thus, in <em>United States v. Bergantino</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 the accused testified that she was below 15 when the crime was 
committed. This was corroborated by her mother and her husband. No other
 evidence, such as the baptismal certificate, was presented to support 
this claim. The prosecution did not offer any contradictory evidence. 
This Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>While the evidence upon this point is not entirely satisfactory, 
yet it is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt upon this material 
question in the case, to the benefit of which the defendant is entitled.
 The baptismal certificate or other evidence of this character would 
have been much more satisfactory to the court, and, if obtainable, 
should have been introduced. Neither the prosecution nor the defendant 
saw fit to introduce such evidence.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any doubt in respect of the age of the accused is resolved in his favor. In <em>United States v. Barbicho</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> it was held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>In regard to the doubt as to whether the accused is over or under 
18 years of age, and in the absence of proof that on the day he 
committed the crime he was 18 years old, he must perforce be considered 
as still under that age, and therefore, the mitigating circumstance 
mentioned in paragraph No. 2 of article 9 of the code should be applied 
in his favor . . . .
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>United States v. Agadas</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> this Court similarly held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>While it is true that in the instant case Rosario testified that he
 was 17 years of age, yet the trial court reached the conclusion, 
judging from the personal appearance of Rosario, that “he is a youth 18 
or 19 years old.” Applying the rule enunciated in the case just cited, 
we must conclude that there exists a reasonable doubt, at least, with 
reference to the question whether Rosario was, in fact, 18 years of age 
at the time the robbery was committed. This doubt must be resolved in 
favor of the defendant. . . . </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are therefore present in this case the privileged mitigating 
circumstance of minority and two ordinary mitigating circumstances 
(voluntary surrender and immediate vindication of a grave offense). 
Because of the presence of the privileged mitigating circumstance of 
minority, the penalty of <em>reclusion temporal</em> should be reduced by one degree to <em>prision mayor</em>, pursuant to Art. 68 of the Revised Penal Code. The penalty of prision mayor should further be reduced to <em>prision correccional</em>
 because of the presence of two ordinary mitigating circumstances 
without any aggravating circumstance, pursuant to Art. 64, par. 5 of the
 same Code. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, petitioner should 
be made to suffer imprisonment, the minimum of which should be within 
the range of <em>arresto mayor</em> and the maximum of which within the range of <em>prision correccional</em>. 
</p><p>On the other hand, for the crime of frustrated homicide, the 
penalty imposable for the consummated crime of homicide should be 
reduced by one degree, <em>i.e.</em>, to <em>prision mayor</em>. Because
 of the presence of one privileged mitigating circumstance and two 
ordinary mitigating circumstances and no aggravating circumstance, the 
penalty of <em>prision mayor</em> should be reduced by two degrees, <em>i.e.</em>, to <em>arresto mayor</em>. 
</p><p>With respect to the award of damages, the amount of P30,000 
awarded as indemnity for the death of Noel Nora should be increased to 
P50,000.00 pursuant to current rulings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> But the award of P37,000.00 for actual damages should be reduced to P22,000.00. As held in <em>Fuentes, Jr. v. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 only expenses supported by receipts and which appear to have been 
actually expended in connection with the death of the victim should be 
allowed. The award of actual damages cannot be based on the allegation 
of a witness without any tangible document to support such claim. In 
this case, only P22,000.00 is supported by a receipt (Exh. X) for 
funeral expenses.
</p><p>The amount of moral damages (P30,000.00) and attorney’s fees (P20,000.00) appear to be reasonable and may therefore be allowed. 
</p><p>With respect to the damages awarded for the shooting of Narciso 
Nora, Jr., the award of P8,728 as actual damages should be reduced to 
P1,928.65 as the receipts (Exhs. Y and Z) presented show the payment of 
this amount only to the National Orthopedic Hospital. 
</p><p>The award of P20,000.00 as moral damages appears to be just and 
reasonable and therefore should be allowed under the circumstances.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Court of Appeals 
is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that, for the crime of homicide, the 
petitioner is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of 6 months 
of <em>arresto mayor</em>, as minimum, to 6 years of <em>prision correccional</em>, as maximum, and, for the crime of frustrated homicide, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 6 months of <em>arresto mayor</em>. 
</p><p>In addition, petitioner is hereby ordered to pay the following:
</p><ol><li> To the heirs of the deceased Noel Nora, the sums of P50,000.00, 
as indemnity for the death of Noel Nora; P22,000.00, as actual damages; 
P30,000.00, as moral damages, and P20,000.00, as attorney’s fees; </li><br><li> The sums of P1,928.65, as actual damages, and P20,000.00, as 
moral damages and P20,000.00, as attorney’s fees to Narciso Nora, Jr. 
for wounding the latter. </li></ol>
