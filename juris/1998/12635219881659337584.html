<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court
gave a full account of the evidence submitted by the prosecution that led to
the indictments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It was about
3:30 in the afternoon of 12 January 1994. Agnes Guirindola, a 20-year old De La
Salle University student, was driving a red Nissan Sentra car with Plate No.
TKR-837 along Panay Avenue, Quezon City, on her way to a bookstore, and
thereafter, to fetch her mother, Mrs. Elvira Guirindola, from work when a man,
passing himself off as a traffic enforcement officer and wearing a “PNP”
reflectorized vest, flagged her down and motioned her to execute a U-turn
towards him. She complied. Lowering the right front window of her car, she
asked the man, whose name she later learned to be Venancio Roxas, what traffic
violation she had committed. Roxas replied that she had wrongly traversed a
one-way street where, barely two days ago, a little girl had figured in an
accident. Agnes surrendered her driver’s license. Roxas, giving her what
appeared to be a ticket, remarked, “Miss, kunwari pirmahan mo ito,”</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> but seeing that it was not the
usual traffic ticket, she merely put a check sign and returned it. Roxas told
her to open the door. He came on board the car and directed Agnes to proceed to
the next intersection where Roxas motioned her to turn left. After executing a
left turn, she stopped and handed over to him a fifty pesos (<s>P</s>50.00)
bill which he accepted. He then returned her license. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Agnes asked
Roxas where she could drop him off, instead, he suddenly pointed a gun at her
and switched off the engine, saying, “Miss kailangan ko lang ito,”</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> referring to the car. Agnes started
to cry. She pleaded with Roxas to let her go and not harm her. Instead, Roxas
unlocked the rear door to let another man in. The man, identified in open court
as accused-appellant Roberto Gungon, immediately reclined her seat and pulled
her over to the back seat by her arms while Roxas promptly slid into the
driver’s seat. She was told that they were taking her to Philcoa but, after
glancing at his beeper, Gungon, told Roxas, “Boss, negative Philcoa.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Roxas nodded. After a while, Gungon
spoke to Roxas, “Boss, dalhin na natin siya sa dati at doon na natin i-s.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> to which Roxas again simply nodded
his head without a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Agnes, now
really scared, took out a rosary from her bag and prayed. Momentarily, Roxas
pulled over and alighted from the vehicle while Gungon held Agnes and poked a
gun at her. When Roxas returned, he had with him a bottle of softdrink and
skyflakes which he offered to Agnes. Agnes refused to drink after seeing some
tablets floating inside the bottle. Gungon tried to persuade Agnes to take the
drink, advising her, “Sige na, makakatulong ito sa iyo.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The car stopped a second time to
load gas at a gasoline station. Escape was nil; Guirindola made sure of that.
The car thereafter proceeded southwards and on to the South Superhighway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Roxas took time
out from the wheel at a deserted area to allow him and Gungon to relieve
themselves one after the other. Back on the road, Roxas told Gungon to have
Agnes partake of the softdrink but she continued to resist. Agnes took out her
wallet to get a prayer leaflet Gungon saw a picture and asked Agnes who it was
in the photograph. She replied that it was her sister. Gungon then also took
out some pictures from his wallet to show to her, identifying one photograph as
that of his niece and two others as those of his girlfriend and of Roxas and
his girlfriend and child. Once again, Gungon insisted that she take the drink.
Fearing his menacing look and the gun pointed at her, she took a sip from the
bottle. She was, still later, also forced to swallow two tablets which Roxas
gave to Gungon. She took the tablets but had them under her tongue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">When asked what
she wanted to eat, she said she would prefer a McDonald’s sandwich. The car
stopped at a bakery shop, where she noticed the address on the signboard
reading, “Sto Tomas Batangas.” Roxas went out and returned with a “taisan” cake
which he handed over to Agnes but she just held it. Time passed, and somehow
she lost consciousness. It was about 9:30 p.m. when she found herself lying at
the back seat with her legs on the lap of Gungon. She noticed that her pieces
of jewelry, bracelets, earrings, ring, necklace and a wristwatch, as well as
cash, were missing and that her pair of shoes had been removed. She was told
that the items were just being meanwhile kept for her. The pair of shoes,
however, were returned to her. By this time, a third man was already seated in
front of the car with Roxas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">When it was her
turn to relieve herself, Roxas stopped the car at a deserted area. Gungon
escorted her to a place not far away from the car. Just as she was getting up,
after relieving herself, she saw a “white spark” to her right and she fell. She
was shot. Feeling weak and unable to get up, she was still able to get a glance
at Roxas walking back to the car. Then she passed out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">When she came
to, Roxas, Gungon, and the third man, as well as the car, were nowhere insight.
She managed to get up and slowly walked down the road until she reached a small
house. Inside were two kids and a teenager, who, apparently shocked by her
appearance, hurriedly left. She was bleeding profusely from the neck and face.
She looked around the house but not finding anyone, she went to the sala to lie
down. People soon arrived on a vehicle. She again lost consciousness and
regained it only at the Batangas Regional Hospital.</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The hospital, which was ill
equipped to give full medical treatment advised her to transfer to a Manila
hospital. The medical certificate described the gunshot wound:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">“Gunshot wound,
POE, Zygomatic area (R), POX Sub-mandibular area (L); Fx, zygomatic arch &amp;
condylar area, (R) Sec to GSW; Submandibular Gland Involvement with sinus
tract.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Recounting the
circumstances that paved the way for the ultimate arrest of Gungon, the trial
court narrated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“xxx. The crimes charged herein
could have easily remained unsolved because the victim <i>did not know</i> any
of her tormentors. That she was abandoned in a dark and far away place strange
to her, having been saved from the claws of sure death only by her abductor’s
false belief of having already done her in with a single gunshot, would have
made the escape of the criminals irreversible. Fate had it that her survival
spelled the beginning of her tormentors’ undoing, for her ordeal was
immediately brought to the attention of the NBI which moved and investigated
without delay and hesitation. Cartographic sketches drawn from the
recollections of the victim later started the procedure to identify the unknown
perpetrators. The alacrity, coordination, and ingenuity of NBI agents Regner
Feneza and Miralles led to the success of the procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Feneza recounted that on January
17, 1994 he met at the NBI offices in Manila with Miralles, who was earlier
assigned to the case of Agnes, because Miralles had left word that he wanted to
consult with Feneza. It seems that Feneza was the agent handling the Virginia
Samaniego Villena case, another kidnapping case where the <i>modus operandi</i>
had <i>striking similarities</i> with the kidnapping of Agnes. In their
meeting, Miralles showed and lent to Feneza the cartographic sketches in the
Agnes kidnapping. Feneza referred to his Villena files and discovered a
distinct similarity of a cartographic sketch to some of the Villena suspects
with pictures in his files. With Miralles’ permission, Feneza met with and
talked to Agnes at the V. Luna Medical Center, and showed her about 3 or 4
pictures from his files.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“As Feneza testified: ‘<i>When I
gave the pictures to her, she looked at them and she positively identified one
in the pictures to be one of her abductors, she nearly fainted at that time.</i>’
Agnes had thereby positively identified Roberto Gungon, whom Feneza had already
met in October or November, 1992 in connection with the Villena case. He
reported this breakthrough to his superiors, who immediately authorized the
search for Gungon.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Gungon could not be arrested
sooner. Based on information given to the NBI, he and his live-in partner had
left Manila by car on a Wednesday, passed through Catbalogan Samar, and were
bound for Davao. According to Feneza, an informant provided the information
about Davao being the final destination; he testified: ‘Before he left, he left
his pocket bell to somebody whom he was able to talk to. At the same time; they
were calling a person and they told this person that they were in Legaspi about
to board a ferry boat going to Davao.’ The information, Feneza disclosed how
the NBI discovered the informant. It seems that Manila Prosecutor Alice Vidal
had been approached by a certain Mrs. Atencio, supposedly Gungon’s
mother-in-law, to confide Gungon’s whereabouts and to seek help; Prosecutor
Vidal, in turn, notified the Makati Police Department, which happened to be
collaborating with the NBI on the case. The Makati Police Department relayed
the developments to NBI, which sent agents to meet with Mrs. Atencio in the
office of Prosecutor Vidal, and it was there where Mrs. Atencio disclosed the
destination of Gungon and his partner. The pocketbell beeper was subsequently
delivered my Mrs. Atencio to Feneza in Cubao, under a receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Feneza and fellow agent Arnold
Lazaro flew to Davao on the following Friday, still in January, but Gungon and
his partner could arrive there only on Saturday. On Sunday evening, the agents
located the arrested him and detained him at their Regional Office in Davao.
They flew him back to Manila of the first available flight on Monday. At the <i>lineup</i>
held on February 1, 1994 at the NBI offices in Manila, Agnes picked Gungon out
and positively identified him as one of her kidnappers.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">“After the <i>lineup</i>
identification, the NBI checked the contents of the <i>blue bag</i> that Gungon
had brought along from Davao and found therein, among others, a <i>Nissan</i>
key chain with a key; a picture of a woman, another picture of a man (Venancio
Roxas), woman, and child; and a rosary. These articles were turned over to the
NBI evidence custodian and were later presented in court. Feneza and Lazaro
prepared their joint affidavit and other papers before transmitting the matter
to the Department of Justice. Feneza readily identified and pointed to Gungon
in open court during trial.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense
version varies materially from that given by the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Roberto Gungon,
an employee of the Metropolitan Manila Authority, testified that between 3:30
and 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon of 12 January 1994, he had just come from a
friend’s house and was waiting for a taxicab along Panay Avenue, Quezon City,
when a car stopped in front of him. It was Venancio Roxas, an acquaintance he
once met at a New Year’s party, who asked him where he was going. Gungon
replied that he was waiting for a taxicab to get him to Cubao. Roxas, who was
with a lady companion, opened the door of the car and said, “<i>Halika na, at
idadaan ka na namin</i>.” He boarded and sat at the rear. Roxas drove towards
Cubao. Gungon alighted at the foot of the underpass in Cubao, only to again
board the car when Roxas invited him to go with them to Batangas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Roxas proceeded
to the South Superhighway with Agnes in the front right seat. On the way, Agnes
reminded Roxas that her mother was waiting for her. Agnes took out her wallet
and showed Gungon her ID, her picture, and her sister’s picture, and in turn,
he, too, drew out his wallet from his pocket and showed Agnes his wife’s
picture. The car stopped at a bakery in Sto. Tomas, Batangas, where Agnes and
Roxas alighted to buy a piece of cake and some softdrinks. Tired, after along
drive, Gungon and Agnes had both fallen asleep. She awoke after some time and
requested that the car stop to allow her to relieve herself. Gungon later
learned from an investigator that the place was somewhere in Batangas City.
Roxas accompanied Agnes. Gungon was left alone in the car. After about 3 to 5
minutes, he heard a gunshot and felt that something untoward had happened. He
lowered the car window to look, and he saw someone, whom he presumed to be
Roxas, coming towards his direction, holding a gun. Agnes was not with him. Out
of apprehension, he alighted from the car, ran away, and hid in the nearby
trees until Roxas finally drove away. He took a bus back to Manila, reaching
home at about 10:30 that evening.</span><a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Appellant’s
challenges, in essence, would revolve on the issue, once again, of credibility
of witnesses. In monotone, this Court has constantly ruled that in the determination
of the veracity of testimony, the assessment by the trial court is accorded the
highest degree of respect and will not be distrubed of appeal unless, of
course, it is seen to have acted arbitrarily or with evident partiality.
Contrary to appellant’s contention, however, it is the Court’s view that the
trial court has taken due care in evaluating the testimonies given at the
witness stand. This much would easily be apparent from the following excerpts
of the appealed decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Upon thorough consideration of the
evidence, the Court finds the testimony and version of Agnes to be the truth of
what transpired on January 12, 1994 and that there was no credible fact or
circumstance presented in the entire course of the trial, including her
cross-examination by the Defense, by the which the neutral objective, and
uninvolved mind could reasonably doubt her sincerity and trustworthiness. The
complainant and the accused were subjected to the closest personal observation
during their stints as witnesses. There were contrasts in their demeanors on
the one hand, the victim was <i>firm, sincere, and collected </i>when she
narrated even the most painful parts of her ordeal, easily impressing the Court
by her straightforward manner and strong recall of the details; while, <i>on
the other hand</i>, although Gungon tried very much to appear cool and
composed, he could not deceive the Court by hiding behind the veneer of his
feigned expressions and concealing what happened by a clever <i>façade</i> of
denials.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">“Gungon failed the
test of credibility by relying on an implausible defense and on mere denials.
To decide issues of credibility, the testimonies of witnesses are tested for
their plausibility of probability, i.e., whether they were contrary to the
natural course of things, or to common observation, experience, and common
sense, or to contrary to natural laws, or exhibit incredible coincidences.
Evidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible
witness, but it must be credible in itself – such as the common experience and
observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances. We have
no test of the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge,
observation, and experience. Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the
miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The defense,
verily anchors itself on the bare denial of appellant of the specific acts
imputed by the prosecution against him. Certainly, this negative assertion
cannot prevail over the unimpeached testimony of the victim describing in
sufficient detail the active participation of appellant in the commission of
the crimes charged. In the face of the clear and positive declaration of the
victim herself, the defense of denial hardly assumes probative value and sinks
down the drain even further with the absence of any evidence of a sinister or
nefarious motive on the part of the complainant to impute a crime so grave a
wrong as that made out in the Information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The argument
that the finding of conspiracy between appellant and Venancio Roxas to commit
the crimes charged has been based by the trial court merely on inferences,
conjectures and presumptions is bereft of merit. A conspiracy exists when two

decide to commit it.</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The proof of the agreement need not

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court,
exhibiting keen perception on the whole bulk of evidence before it, has come up
with a number of observations not only to prove conspiracy but likewise to
establish appellant’s own part therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gungon’s
presence on Panay Avenue and his meeting with Roxas were not purely
coincedental and by chance but intentional and prearranged. Roxas was
representing himself to Agnes as a traffic officer by his wearing of the PNP
reflectorized vest while Gungon was employed by the MMA, which had a direct
connection with the functions assumed by Roxas. Roxas and Gungon were
associated with each other far longer than the latter has admitted.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gungon’s
insistence that Roxas was only a casual acquaintance is rejected as devoid of
truth because it is inconsistent with and contrary to the established facts and
circumstances. The records already showed that Gungon knew several personal
circumstances about Roxas, including the fact that Roxas was formerly employed
at MMA and that Roxas was unemployed when the incident tool place, but was the
president of a homeowner’s association in Commonwealth Avenue. Moreover,
Gungon’s conduct in relation to Roxas during the entire duration of the trip
from Panay Avenue to Batangas City, be it judged from Agnes’ point of view or
from Gungon’s own, exhibited a deeper and closer familiarity and association
that Gungon would admit. He called Roxas ‘boss,’ an appellation of familiarity,
if not also subordination. He never protested his being invited to the unplanned
Batangas trip. He never asked who Agnes was, not where Roxas and Agnes had come
from.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“In any case, even assuming that
Gungon, indeed, just happened to be on Panay Avenue that afternoon, implying
thereby that he had no prior understanding with Roxas to meet thereat and also
indicating thereby that their acquaintance was merely casual, the Court is
still puzzled: (a) why Roxas on his part, should have stopped for him; should
have offered to convey him to wherever he was going; and should even invite him
to go on the unplanned trip to distant Batangas without notice to the latter’s
family, unless they were more familiar and closer, and (b) why Gungon, on his
part, should have agreed to go to Batangas unless he was in on the plans of
Roxas. The unbelievable unnaturalness of Gungon’s disavowal of his connection
with Roxas rendered his testimony suspect and implausible.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
inconsistency was detected between Gungon’s allegations, on one hand, that he
concealed himself in the nearby trees from the returning Roxas after the
shooting of Agnes and allowed Roxas to leave in the Nissan car without him, so
that he returned to Manila by bus, and, on the other hand, that the Nissan
keychain and the key of the bar lock were recovered from his blue bag. If he
was to be believed, how did he come into the subsequent possession of the
keychain and the key unless he and Roxas had met after the shooting?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. On account of his admitted
presence during the trip, although protesting his innocence, the Court has also
carefully analyzed Gungon's conduct following the criminal incidents and found
such conduct indicative of guilt rather than innocence. Despite his insistence
to the contrary, he knew that at least one serious crime had been perpetrated
because he had heard a shot and had seen Roxas returning with a firearm at hand
but without Agnes. Yet, he never reported the incidents to anyone else, most of
all to the authorities, despite his allegations that he thereafter continued to
report to work at MMA. The civic-minded and dedicated public servant that he
alleged himself to be notwithstanding, he did not impress the Court that he was
truly guiltless because of his unexplained failure to report to the
authorities.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">“On the matter of
the Davao land trip being taken on January 28, 1994, the Court must have to
consider it as positively indicative of flight. It should first be mentioned,
as a premise for this conclusion, that Gungon inextricably contradicted himself
on this point, since, in his direct testimony, he cited the calls made by
somebody about two or three days before to the office of Ms. Atencio asking her
to meet a person near the Makati Police Department about an alleged estafa case
in relation to a roofing transaction as justification for the trip, implying
that it was sudden and unplanned; whereas, in the cross-examination, he stated
that he and his wife had planned the Davao trip for vacation purposes even
before New Year’s Day, 1994. Aside from negatively reflecting of Gungon’s testimonial
integrity, such self-contradiction, not being a merely minor or inconsequential
development in the Defense’s presentation, exposed the Davao trip to be for
what is was – the flight of a guilty man.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

logic and common sense to conclude that the above circumstances and events
implicating appellant to the crime were all purely coincidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Nor did the
trial court err in convicting appellant of the crime of kidnapping and serious

its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the
offended party might take.</span><a style="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> It bears stressing that the

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Court finds
merit, however, in appellant’s third assigned error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Appellant would
have it that the trial court erred in convicting him of robbery considering
that the taking of the victim’s jewelry and cash were perpetrated while the
latter was asleep. The victim herself testified that shortly after the car had
proceeded from Sto. Tomas, Batangas, she lost consciousness and regained it
only at about 9:30 that evening. She then found herself lying at the back seat
minus her personal belongings with a total value of <s>P</s>38,000.00.</span><a style="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Article 293 of
the Revised Penal Code defines robbery to be one committed by any “person who,
with intent to gain, shall take any personal property belonging to another, by
means of violence against or intimidation of any person, or using force upon
anything xxx.” Robbery may thus be committed two ways: (a) with violence, or
intimidation of persons</span><a style="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> and (b) by the use of force upon

violence against or intimidation of persons, the following elements must
concur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">1)  that there be personal property belonging to
another;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">2)  that there is unlawful taking of that
property;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">3)  that the taking must be with intent to gain;
and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">4)  that there is violence against or
intimidation of any person or use of force upon things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It would appear
that the taking of the victim’s jewelry and cash came only by way of an
afterthought on the part of the appellant. The taking was not attended by
violence or intimidation upon the person of Agnes. The absence, however, of
violence or intimidation did not exculpate appellant from liability for the
crime of theft, punishable by Article 308, in relation to Article 309, of the
Revised Penal Code, <i>viz</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Art. 308.  Who are liable for theft. – Theft is
committed by any person who, with intent to gain but without violence against,
or intimidation of persons nor force upon things, shall take personal property
of another without the latter’s consent.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Art. 309.  Penalties. – Any person guilty of theft
shall be punished by:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum ans medium periods, if the value
of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos;
but if the value of the things stolen exceed the latter amount, the penalty
shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph, and one
year for each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which
may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Information
in Criminal Case No. Q-94-54287 contains sufficient allegations, adequately
proven by the prosecution during the trial, to warrant a conviction of
appellant for the crime of theft. Section 4, Rule 120, of the 1988 Rules on
Criminal Procedure provides on this score; thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Section 4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof. –
When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or
information, and that proved or established by the evidence, and the offense as
charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, included in
that which is charged, or of the offense charged included in that which is
proved.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Since the value
of the personal property taken from the victim amounted to <s>P</s>38,000.000
the penalty imposable is the maximum period of the penalty prescribed by
Article 309 which is the maximum of <i>prision</i> <i>mayor</i> in its minimum
and medium periods plus one year for the additional ten thousand pesos in
excess of <s>P</s>22,000.00. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
penalty for this particular offense of theft that may thus be imposed is
anywhere from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision
correctional</i> minimum period to six (6) years of prision correccional
maximum period, as minimum, to anywhere from eight (8) years, eight (8) months
and one (1) day to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> medium period, plus
one (1) for the additional <s>P</s>10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00 value of
the property taken, or eleven (11) years of prision mayor maximum period, as
maximum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Lastly,
appellant contends that he should not have been convicted of violation of

finding of conspiracy between appellant and Venancio Roxas. In conspiracy, to
once again stress it, the act of the other co-conspirator and, therefore it is
