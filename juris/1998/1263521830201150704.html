				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">This petition
for <i>certiorari</i> assails the resolution of the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC) dated October 24, 1995, setting aside the Labor Arbiter’s
decision and its resolution denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">From August 1985
up to his dismissal on September 1988, private respondent Buenaventura F. Abajo
was employed by petitioner Greenhills Products Inc. (GPI), a company engaged in
the manufacture and export of rattan furnitures, as a laborer assigned at its
Bending Department.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Sometime in June
1988, he was allegedly offered by one Ruben Godornes, petitioner’s Assistant
Production/Preparation Manager, to be the president of a union which the
company intended to organize which the former, however, refused.  At the time, the existing collective
bargaining agreement between petitioner and the then bargaining agent
Nagkakaisang Lakas ng Manggagawa was about to expire. During the 60-day freedom
period from August 14 to October 14, 1988, respondent actively campaigned for
the recognition of the Association of Labor Union (ALU) of which he was the
local president.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On September 3,
1988, respondent was summoned to appear before company owner and manager Jessie
Yu’s office to explain his unyielding stand to their offer.  When respondent argued that the proposed
union could not guarantee his members their security of tenure, Yu was
infuriated and thereupon directed the latter to withdraw his membership with
ALU which order was, however, disobeyed.  In view of  his unrelenting
refusal, his services were terminated.  He was made to sign a memorandum dated September 3, 1988, effecting his
immediate severance therefrom, on grounds that his honesty, sincerity and
loyalty to the company has become suspect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner, on
the other hand, recounted that respondent was initially assigned at its Bending
Department.  Claiming that his
performance was lackluster and that he has become a problem employee in view of
his tardiness, he was transferred to the Parts Preparation Department where he
allegedly continue to perform inefficiently.  As penalty therefore, he was assigned as a stockman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On June 30,
1988, Godornes conducted an inventory of company properties and he reported
that several furniture parts and samples entrusted to respondent were found
missing.  When confronted with the missing
properties, the latter allegedly promised to produce them, but that due to the
pressing production schedule, Godornes simply forgot all about the incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Sometime in July
1988, a certain Roberto Caramelo inquired from Josephine Angbetic, petitioner’s
purchaser of rattan poles, whether he could secure additional rattan furniture
parts and samples which he previously bought from respondent.  Yu immediately inquired from Godornes about
the alleged missing furniture parts and samples.  Forthwith, Godornes confronted respondent about the same and of
his previous promise to surrender them.  The latter was allegedly stunned and refused to comment on its loss,
prompting the former to report the matter to Yu.  For loss of trust and confidence, respondent was therefore
dismissed from employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In a complaint
for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice against petitioner, Labor
Arbiter Dominador A. Almirante rendered a decision dated December 7, 1993, the
decretal portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“Wherefore, foregoing premises
considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the dismissal of this case for

1995, decreeing in this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shortcut that effectively allows an employer to assume the roles of both
accuser and judge at the same time should not be countenanced.  Thus, the employer must furnish the worker
with two (2) written notices before termination of employment can be legally
effected: (a) notice which apprises the employee of the particular acts or
omissions for which his dismissal is sought, and (b) the subsequent notice
which informs the employee of the employer’s decision to dismiss him.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In the case at
bar, respondent was not furnished with either of the two written notices
required by law.  This finding is
buttressed by the Labor Arbiter’s decision which petitioner, surprisingly,
seeks to restore.  Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">“We find,
however, that complainant was not accorded adequate due process before
dismissal.  It is true he was issued
memoranda to explain his side.  According
to respondent complainant refused to sign receipt of a copy thereof and failed
to make an explanation.  To complainant,
he failed to receive any copy of such memoranda.  Indeed there is no proof that complainant did receive them.  Respondent should have sent them by
registered mail with return card or other means by which evidence of service
can be proven.  Be that as it may,
however, the supposed investigation on September 3, 1988 (page 4 of
respondent’s position paper) is not the kind of investigation that would
suffice to comply with the procedural  requirement.  Firstly, there was
no evidence that he was represented by counsel or a union representative.  All the persons named therein were personnel
and officers of respondent.  There was
no evidence adduced that there was an actual hearing conducted where
complainant was given the opportunity to be heard and defend himself.  The best evidence would have been the
minutes of the proceedings of the alleged investigation.  Parenthetically, it is the result of the
supposed investigation that precipitated complainant’s dismissal on the same
day September 3, 1988.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On the contrary,
there is nothing in the records which would warrant the termination of
respondent from his employment.  As
amply expounded by the NLRC:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“His transfer from one kind of work
to another from the bending department to parts preparation department and from
a piece rate to a daily rate status, and later as stockman is too far an
indication of a poor performance.  If
one appears to be inefficient in ordinary course of things or under human
experience, he should remain a piece rate worker because conversion to a daily
rate basis would be incongruous to management goal for higher productivity and
profits.  Besides, the task at the bending
department appears to be much easier and less complicated than that in the
parts preparation department and significantly the complainant’s transfer to a
lighter and convenient job as stockman though with the same rate as when he was
in the parts preparation department is in a way a promotion and an appreciation
of satisfactory services rendered.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">We likewise find less convincing or
unbelievable the acts of dishonesty imputed to the complainant in allegedly
selling furniture parts and samples to a certain Roberto Carmelo amounting to <s>P</s>8,000.00.  <u>First, the lost or missing furniture
parts and samples have not been sufficiently established by evidence on record</u>.  Assuming in the remote possibility that some
furniture parts were really lost or missing, <u>there is no evidence  on record to establish or pinpoint that the
complainant  was responsible for the
said losses, except the general allegation of the respondent that the furniture
parts stored in the stockroom are entrusted to the complainant</u>.  It is unrefuted on record that aside from
the complainant, there were other stockmen in the framing department and <u>no
investigation was conducted to find out  who among the three (3) could be held responsible for the losses if
indeed such were incurred</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Above all, there is no doubt that
furniture parts stored in the stockroom could be brought out only upon proper
documentation or could not be brought out without being intercepted by the
security guard always posted at least at respondents’ only ingress to or egress
from its premises.  <u>It would be too
naive to believe the theory that the complainant bore a hole at the roof top
through  which the missing parts were
spirited away.  As we note, no hearing
was conducted at which the complainant will be afforded ample opportunity to
defend himself against those serious accusations</u>.  At most, the alleged purchaser of the supposed lost or missing
furniture parts and the hole at the roof top could be a part of the ploy or
plot of the respondents to cover up or justify the complainant’s termination
from employment on the account of his union activities.  To repeat, the requirement that the
dismissal of an employee due to loss of trust and confidence must be based on
reasonable basis and supported by substantial evidence has not been met in the
instant case.” (NLRC Decision, pp. 12-14; Underscoring supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The guidelines
for the doctrine of loss of confidence to apply are: (1) loss of confidence
should not be simulated; (2) it should not be used as a subterfuge for causes
which are improper, illegal, or unjustified; (3) it may not be arbitrarily
asserted in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary; and (4) it must
be genuine, not a mere afterthought to justify an earlier action taken in bad
faith.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner’s
arguments are not persuasive since these must be read in light of the
circumstances prevailing at the time the matter in dispute occurred.  Notably, during the 60-day freedom period,
respondent was actively campaigning to have ALU as their next bargaining
representative.  Conceivably, his
efforts earned the ire of management which looked askance at ALU as a
“troublemaker.”  When respondent opted
to stay with ALU, petitioner dismissed him on trumped-up charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
