<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The prosecution presented the
police officers who apprehended accused-appellants.  Police Investigator Gil A. Colcol said that he was assigned to
investigate the case involving a female cadaver found in a vacant lot in
Barangay Cupang, Antipolo, Rizal.  The
cadaver could not be recognized because it had been severely burned.  It was later brought to the PNP crime
laboratory for examination.  SPO1 Colcol
testified that accused-appellant Domingo Francisco admitted his guilt and
implicated Randy Mantes, Jerome Garcia, and Jovy Velasco, who are all relatives
of Domingo Francisco's paramour.  These
persons allegedly admitted their culpability to the police investigator.  On the basis of his investigation, SPO1
Colcol filed the case against accused-appellants with the fiscal's office.</span><a

<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>On cross-examination, Colcol said
that accused-appellant Francisco was taken to the police station by his
mother-in-law and relatives on March 5, 1992.  He claimed that he informed accused-appellant of his right to remain
silent and to retain the services of counsel, but he admitted that
accused-appellant was not assisted by counsel during the interrogation.  SPO1 Colcol further testified that Randy
Mantes also admitted having hit the victim on the head with a softdrink bottle,
while Jerome Garcia allegedly admitted he had strangled the victim with a piece
of wire after accused-appellant Domingo Francisco allegedly told them
&quot;Patayin na ninyo, pag binuhay ninyo iyan, masasabit tayo.&quot;  SPO1 Colcol claimed that accused-appellants
admitted having been paid <s>P</s>5,000.00 for the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The supposed confessions made by
the accused-appellants were not put in writing.  SPO1 Colcol stated that the cadaver could hardly be recognized
because it was badly burnt.  It was only
Mrs. Dominga Arcilla who identified it as that of her daughter Erliste Arcilla.</span><a

Dimaculangan, and PO3 Tamondong, went to the office of SPO1 Colcol and then,
together with other policemen, and accused-appellant Domingo Francisco,
proceeded to the Quirino High School construction site.  Upon arrival at the site, accused-appellant
Domingo Francisco led them to Randy Mantes, Jerome Garcia, and Jovy Velasco,
who were all apprehended.  Accused-appellant Randy Mantes allegedly admitted to SPO1 Colcol that he
(Mantes) was one of those instructed by accused-appellant Domingo Francisco to
kill Erliste Arcilla.  SPO1 Tarasona
said that he, along with the other members of the team, executed an affidavit
regarding the incident.  On cross-examination,
SPO1 Tarasona said that during the investigation, only accused-appellants and
the policemen were present.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn8' href="#_edn8"

the testimonies of SPO1 Tarasona and SPO1 Colcol.  He said that he was working at Substation 1 in Mayamot, Antipolo,
Rizal on March 5, 1992 when he was asked to go to the Quirino High School in
Quezon City with SPO1 Colcol, PO3 Tarasona, PO3 Quiambao, PO3 Dimaculangan, PO3
Ravaca, PO3 Tamondong, and accused-appellant Domingo Francisco.  Accused-appellant Domingo Francisco led them
to the other suspects in the killing of Erliste Arcilla.  He said that at the Quirino High School
construction site, they arrested the persons pointed out by Domingo Francisco.  He was the one who personally apprehended
accused-appellant Jovy Velasco and took him to the station.  Jovy Velasco and the other persons arrested
were subjected to an investigation.  During the investigation, he heard SPO1 Colcol ask accused-appellant
Francisco why he killed his wife.  The  latter allegedly answered
that it was because the victim was having an affair with another man.  When the other accused-appellants were asked
the same question, they answered it was because they had been ordered to do so.</span><a

<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The prosecution then presented
witnesses to establish the motive for the killing of Erliste Arcilla. Maria
Vda. de Tawat testified that she had known accused-appellant Domingo Francisco
and Erliste Arcilla for a long time as they were her neighbors in Tatalon,
Quezon City.  During the time that they
were neighbors, Erliste would go to her house to complain about her husband's
extra-marital affair and his beating her up.  Erliste also told Maria Vda. de Tawat that accused-appellant asked her
(Erliste) to leave their house so that he could live there with his paramour.  Maria Vda. de Tawat said that she and
Erliste reported the incident to Barangay Captain Dominador Baniega.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Maria Vda. de Tawat said that on
February 28, 1992 she read about Erliste's death in a newspaper.  She was not able to identify the body found
in Antipolo because it was burned beyond recognition.  They suspected Domingo Francisco to be the culprit, and so she
sought the help of policemen.  The
latter went to the house of Domingo Francisco and informed him that Erliste had
died, but accused-appellant allegedly said nothing.  The policemen then invited him to the station for
questioning.  As a result,
accused-appellant was imprisoned in Antipolo.  In jail, accused-appellant Domingo Francisco allegedly asked Maria Vda.
de Tawat for her forgiveness, saying: &quot;...Inaamin ko na Ka Maring,
patawarin mo na ako, nangyari na iyon kaya maski magkano magbabayad
ako.&quot;  She said she asked
accused-appellant why he had committed the crime, but accused-appellant did not
answer.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn11' href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"

of accused-appellant's children, told her that his father wanted his mother
Erliste to leave the house so he could live there together with his

<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>  Rachel Loyola, another neighbor of the spouses Domingo and
Erliste, corroborated the testimony of Maria Vda. de Tawat.  Rachel Loyola's house adjoined that of the
spouses; it was separated only by a &quot;lawanit&quot; walling.  The relationship of the spouses was good
until the year 1990 when Rachel observed that the two were always
quarreling.  Erliste's face was often
swollen and bruised.  She heard that
Domingo wanted his paramour to live in the house.  She suspected that the woman she once saw staying in the house of
the couple for four days was the paramour.  Erliste complained to the Barangay Captain, who went to
accused-appellant's house and talked to accused-appellant and his paramour.  Rachel Loyola added that she herself was not
on good terms with Erliste because the latter suspected her of also having an
affair with accused-appellant Domingo Francisco.  Rachel, however, denied she was having an affair with Domingo
Francisco.  She also testified that
Domingo Francisco left his house with his paramour in 1990 and did not come
back until January 1992, this time with a child, who was later taken care of by
Erliste.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"

went to the Antipolo Headquarters to see the body, they were shown a wrist
watch with brand name &quot;Audi&quot; and a ring with the name &quot;Evelyn
Roda&quot; engraved on it. She was not sure who the owner of the articles was.  Nor could she identify the burnt cadaver on
which the same were found.  It was
Erliste's children who identified the articles as those of their mother.  When the children were asked why the name
engraved on the ring was that of &quot;Evelyn Roda&quot; and not that of their
mother, the eldest child, Alicia, answered that the ring had merely been found
by her mother.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn14' href="#_edn14"

<p class=BODY><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Barangay Captain Dominador Baniega
also testified.  He said that he knew
Domingo Francisco and Erliste Arcilla Francisco because they were his
godchildren.  In the past, Erliste would
go to his residence to ask for help regarding her problem with Domingo
Francisco.  Erliste complained that
Domingo Francisco was keeping a woman in their house and had forbidden her to
enter their house.  Erliste also told
him that Domingo Francisco beat her up.  Baniega said he sent for Domingo Francisco and the other woman and told
accused-appellant that it was wrong for the other woman to stay in their
house.  Domingo Francisco allegedly
promised he would look for another house where he could stay.  He later learned from Maria Vda. de Tawat
that Domingo Francisco and his paramour were no longer in the house of
Erliste.  Sometime in 1991, Baniega said
it was accused-appellant who complained to him that Erliste had brought a man
to their house.  Accused-appellant
Domingo Francisco could not, however, prove his claim.  As a result, he dismissed
accused-appellant's complaint.  Accused-appellant
then informed him that he would look for another lawyer to help him in filing
charges against Erliste.  No case was,
however, filed.  In March 1992, he came
to know about Erliste's death.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn15'

Erliste from the time she disappeared until the time he was picked up by the
police.  In the past, Erliste had left
their house several times.  He would
look for her everytime she left and did not come home.  A month before February 28, 1992, Erliste
told Domingo Francisco that she wanted to take a vacation.  Accused-appellant suspected that his wife
was still alive and was just hiding.  He
was not able to see the body, which the prosecution claimed to be that of
Erliste, and he could not recognize the watch, keys, nail cutter, ring (with

could not identify the cadaver as the same was burnt beyond recognition.  In particular, both Vda. de Tawat and Loyola
testified that the identification of the cadaver was made not by them but only
by Erliste's children.  Police
investigator Gil Colcol, on the other hand, admitted that the same was
identified not by him but only by Mrs. Dominga Arcilla.  For his part, Dr. Gajardo stated that the
said cadaver was identified by Ernesto Arcilla, the brother of Erliste
Arcilla.  However, not one of those who
