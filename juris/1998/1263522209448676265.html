				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The main issues to be resolved in this petition for certiorari are: <em>First</em>,
 who has the burden of proving a claim for night shift differential pay,
 the worker who claims not to have been paid night shift differentials, 
or the employer in custody of pertinent documents which would prove the 
fact of payment of the same? Second, were the requirements of due 
process substantially complied with in dismissing the worker?
<p>Petitioner National Semiconductor (HK) Distribution, Ltd. (NSC 
for brevity), a foreign corporation licensed to do business in the 
Philippines, manufactures and assembles electronic parts for export with
 principal office at the Mactan Export Processing Zone, Mactan, 
Lapu-Lapu City. Private respondent Edgar Philip C. Santos was employed 
by NSC as a technician in its Special Products Group with a monthly 
salary of P5,501.00 assigned to the graveyard shift starting at ten o’ 
clock in the evening until six o’ clock in the morning.
</p><p>On 8 January 1993 Santos did not report for work on his shift. He
 resumed his duties as night shift Technician Support only on 9 January 
1993. However, at the end of his shift the following morning, he made 
two (2) entries in his daily time record (DTR) to make it appear that he
 worked on both the 8th and 9th of January 1993.
</p><p>His immediate supervisor, Mr. Joel Limsiaco, unknown to private 
respondent Santos, received the report that there was no technician in 
the graveyard shift of 8 January 1993. Thus, Limsiaco checked the DTRs 
and found out that Santos indeed did not report for work on 8 January. 
But when he checked Santos’ DTR again in the morning of 9 January 1993 
he found the entry made by Santos for the day before.
</p><p>Informal investigations were conducted by management. Santos was 
required in a memorandum to explain in writing within 48 hours from 
notice why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for 
dishonesty, falsifying daily time record (DTR) and violation of company 
rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On 
11 January 1993 Santos submitted his written explanation alleging that 
he was ill on the day he was absent. As regards the entry on 8 January, 
he alleged that it was merely due to oversight or carelessness on his 
part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
</p><p>Finding Santos' explanation unsatisfactory, NSC dismissed him on 
14 January 1993 on the ground of falsification of his DTR, which act was
 inimical to the company and constituted dishonesty and serious 
misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>Thus, on 20 January 1993, Santos filed a complaint for illegal 
dismissal and non-payment of back wages, premium pay for holidays and 
rest days, night shift differential pay, allowances, separation pay, 
moral damages and attorney’s fees.
</p><p>Labor Arbiter Dominador A. Almirante found that Santos was 
dismissed on legal grounds although he was not afforded due process, 
hence, NSC was ordered to indemnify him P1,000.00. The Labor Arbiter 
likewise ordered the payment of P19,801.47 representing Santos’ unpaid 
night shift differentials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>NSC appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). 
In its Decision of 29 September 1995 the NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter
 holding that his conclusions were sufficiently supported by the 
evidence and therefore must be respected by the appellate tribunal 
because the hearing officer was in a unique position to observe the 
demeanor of witnesses and to judge their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>NSC imputes grave abuse of discretion to the NLRC in affirming 
the Labor Arbiter’s award of night shift differentials and P1,000.00 
indemnity for alleged violation of due process. It contends that the 
question of non-payment of night shift differentials was never raised as
 an issue nor pursued and proved by Santos in the proceedings before the
 Labor Arbiter; that Santos was already paid his night shift 
differentials, and any further payment to him would amount to unjust 
enrichment; and, that the P1,000.00 indemnity is totally unjustified as 
he was afforded ample opportunity to be heard.
</p><p>We now resolve. A perusal of Santos’ position paper filed before 
the Labor Arbiter reveals that the question of non-payment of night 
shift differentials was specifically raised as an issue in the 
proceedings below which was never abandoned by Santos as erroneously 
claimed by NSC thus - 
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">I S S U E S 
  </p>
  <p>1. Did respondent National Semiconductor (HK) Distribution Ltd. illegally dismiss complainant Edgar Philip Santos?
  </p>
  <p>2. <em>Is complainant Edgar Philip Santos entitled to recover 
unpaid salary, holiday pay, night shift differential, allowances, 
separation pay, retirement benefits and moral damages?</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, in his prayer, Santos sought to be afforded the reliefs prayed for in his complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>The fact that Santos neglected to substantiate his claim for 
night shift differentials is not prejudicial to his cause. After all, 
the burden of proving payment rests on petitioner NSC. Santos’ 
allegation of non-payment of this benefit, to which he is by law 
entitled, is a negative allegation which need not be supported by 
evidence unless it is an essential part of his cause of action. It must 
be noted that his main cause of action is his illegal dismissal, and the
 claim for night shift differential is but an incident of the protest 
against such dismissal. Thus, the burden of proving that payment of such
 benefit has been made rests upon the party who will suffer if no 
evidence at all is presented by either party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Moreover, in <em>Jimenez v. National Labor Relations Commission</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> we declared - 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>As a general rule, one who pleads payment has the burden of proving
 it. Even where the plaintiff must allege non-payment, the general rule 
is that the burden rests on the defendant to prove payment, rather than 
on the plaintiff to prove non-payment. The debtor has the burden of 
showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by 
payment.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For sure, private respondent cannot adequately prove the fact of 
non-payment of night shift differentials since the pertinent employee 
files, payrolls, records, remittances and other similar documents - 
which will show that private respondent rendered night shift work; the 
time he rendered services; and, the amounts owed as night shift 
differentials - are not in his possession but in the custody and 
absolute control of petitioner.
</p><p>Private respondent has been in petitioner’s employ for five (5) 
years - starting 13 January 1988 when he was hired to 14 January 1993 
when his services were terminated - and petitioner never denied that 
private respondent rendered night shift work. In fact, it even presented
 some documents purporting to prove that private respondent was assigned
 to work on the night shift.
</p><p>By choosing not to fully and completely disclose information to 
prove that it had paid all the night shift differentials due to private 
respondent, petitioner failed to discharge the burden of proof. 
Consequently, no grave abuse of discretion can be ascribed to the NLRC 
for sustaining the Labor Arbiter when it ruled thus -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>It is not disputed that complainant was regularly assigned to a 
night shift (10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.). Under Section 2, Rule II, Book 
Three of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code, complainant is 
entitled to an additional benefit of not less than ten percent (10%) of 
his regular wage for each hour of work performed. The record is bereft 
of evidence that respondent has paid complainant this benefit. The best 
evidence for respondent corporation would have been the payrolls, 
vouchers, daily time records and the like which under Sections 6, 7, 8, 
11 and 12, Rule X, Book III of the Implementing Rules it is obliged to 
keep. Its failure gives rise to the presumption that either it does not 
have them or if it does, their presentation is prejudicial to its cause.
  </p>
  <p>We rule therefore that complainant should be awarded a night shift 
differential but limited to three (3) years considering the prescriptive
 period of money claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the issue of due process, we agree with petitioner that Santos was
 accorded full opportunity to be heard before he was dismissed. 
</p><p>The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard, 
or as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain 
one’s side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In the instant
 case, petitioner furnished private respondent notice as to the 
particular acts which constituted the grounds for his dismissal. By 
requiring him to submit a written explanation within 48 hours from 
receipt of the notice, the company gave him the opportunity to be heard 
in his defense. Private respondent availed of this chance by submitting a
 written explanation. Furthermore, investigations on the incident were 
actually conducted on 9 January 1993 and 11 January 1993. Mr. Reynaldo 
Gandionco, petitioner’s witness, testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Q: I reform my question. Was there an investigation conducted on 
the            complainant regarding the alleged falsification of DTR?
  </p>
  <p>A: Yes, ma’am, there was. </p>
  <p>Q: Who was present during the alleged investigation? I am referring to          the first investigation?
  </p>
  <p>A: The first investigation we were many. We were Daryll Go, Joel      Limsiaco, Edgar Philip Santos and me.
  </p>
  <p>Q: When was the first investigation conducted?
  </p>
  <p>A: On the night of January 9, 1993.
  </p>
  <p align="center">x x x x
  </p>
  <p>Q: During the second investigation, who were present?
  </p>
  <p>A: We were: Daryll Go, Edgar Philip Santos and me.
  </p>
  <p>Q: And when was the second investigation conducted?
  </p>
  <p>A: It was on January 11, 1993 in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, private respondent was notified on 14 January 1993 of the management’s decision to terminate his services.
</p><p>Thus, it is clear that the minimum requirements of due process have been fulfilled by petitioner.
</p><p>That the investigations conducted by petitioner may not be considered <em>formal</em> or <em>recorded</em>
 hearings or investigations is immaterial. A formal or trial type 
hearing is not at all times and in all instances essential to due 
process, the requirements of which are satisfied where the parties are 
afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their side of the 
controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It is deemed sufficient for the employer to follow the natural sequence of notice, hearing and judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, petition is DISMISSED. The NLRC 
Decision of 29 September 1995 is AFFIRMED subject to the modification 
that the award of P1,000.00 as indemnity is DELETED in accordance with 
the foregoing discussion.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
