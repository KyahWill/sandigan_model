the sequel to A.M. No. RTJ-91-672 filed by herein complainants Spouses Jose Sy
Bang and Iluminada Tan against the same respondent Judge Antonio Mendez.  The antecedents facts are narrated in the
decision in A.M. No. RTJ-91-672 dated September 28, 1993,  as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Two (2) lots, with an ice plant and improvements thereon situated
at Calauag, Quezon, were originally owned by DBP and were leased to Suarez
Agro-Industrial Corporation (corporation, for brevity) for a period of one year
starting on July 1, 1983.  After the one
year period, DBP allowed the corporation to continue leasing said properties on
a monthly basis .  The corporation,
however, became delinquent in its rental payments.  From the period July 1987 until September 1990, its unpaid
rentals amounted to <s>P</s>650,000.00.  Thus, on August 16, 1990, DBP demanded that the corporation vacate the
properties.  It refused.  On December 15, 1990, DBP sold the
properties to complainant-spouses.  They
were duly registered in their names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On December 21, 1990, complainants again demanded that the
corporation vacate the properties.  Once
more, the demand was  refused.  The complainants then filed with the
Municipal Trial Court of Calauag, Quezon an ejectment suit (docketed as Civil
Case No. 814) against the corporation.  The  Court issued a restraining
order enjoining the corporation from further operating the ice plant.  Not to be outdone, the corporation filed an
action for specific performance and annulment of sale with preliminary injunction
against DBP and the spouses before the Makati, RTC, Branch 134 (docketed as
Civil Case No. 90-3511).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The spouses filed a motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 90-3511 for
improper venue considering that the subject lots were situated in Calauag,
Quezon.  The motion was, however, denied
and a writ of preliminary injunction was issued enjoining the spouses from
taking possession of the subject properties.  The spouses elevated the case to the Court of  Appeals on certiorari.  In a decision dated April 15, 1991, the Court of Appeals declared the
Makati RTC to be devoid of authority to hear the case and ordered its
dismissal.  A motion for
reconsideration filed on May 10, 1991 was denied in a Resolution dated May 22,
1991 on the ground that it was filed out of time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the above case was pending before the Makati RTC (the
corporation’s period to file a motion for reconsideration not having as yet
lapsed), the corporation filed on April 24, 1991 the same action (for specific
performance and annulment of sale, with preliminary and prohibitory injunction)
against the same parties (DBP and the spouses), this time before the RTC of
Gumaca, Quezon, Branch 62, presided by respondent judge (docketed as Civil Case
No. 2137-G).  At this point, it is
noteworthy to mention that there were only two (2) RTC branches in Gumaca,
Quezon (Branches 61 and 62) and both were then presided by the respondent
judge, he  being the pairing judge in
Branch 61.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On even date, respondent judge issued a temporary restraining order
(TRO) against DBP and the spouses. Hearing on the prayer for injunction was set
on May 9, 1991.  However, the TRO was
not implemented for the spouses had already entered and were in possession of
the premises even before the petition was filed.  Since the court failed to order the spouses to restore
possession of the property to the corporation, an <i>ex-parte </i>motion to
amend said TRO was made by the corporation.  The motion was granted in an Order dated April 30, 1991 and the date of
hearing was reset to May 7, 1991.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The spouses still refused to leave the premises claiming that the
plaintiff corporation had not posted a bond and the writ did not state to whom
possession of the premises should be surrendered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the hearing held on May 8, 1991, both parties presented evidence
on the issue of whether or not the preliminary mandatory injunction should be
granted.  In an Order of even date,
respondent judge considered the case submitted for decision within twenty (20)
days from April 30, 1991.  Thereafter,
on May 14, 1991, respondent judge granted the writ of injunction upon the
filing of a one million peso bond by the corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 17, 1991, the corporation filed an <i>ex-parte</i> motion to
approve the bond issued by Plaridel Surety and Insurance Co.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On May 18, 1991, the spouses filed a
Manifestation and Motion before respondent judge informing the latter of the
pendency before the Makati RTC of the same action between the same parties and
thus prayed for the dismissal of the Gumaca case.  The motion was denied by respondent judge in an Order dated May
21, 1991, for being moot and academic.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

motion and Atty. Joyas did not file a substitute bond, prompting complainants
to reiterate on October 25, 1993 their motion to dissolve the writ. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Respondent judge and Atty. Joyas

inhibited himself from hearing Civil Case No.2137-G.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As to the second charge, we find
that respondent judge was unable to explain satisfactorily his failure to act

been informed of the invalidity of the Plaridel bond.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It appears that on June 25, 1993,
complainants filed a manifestation and motion praying for an order requiring
Suarez Agro-Industrial Corporation to file another bond in lieu of the Plaridel
bond.  The corporation, through Atty.
Joyas, filed on July 9, 1993 a motion praying that it be given a period of
fifteen days within which to file a substitute bond.  On September 17, 1993, the corporation, after failing to file a bond
within the fifteen days, filed a motion praying that it be given a further ten
days to file a bond.  In an Order dated
September 21, 1993, the court gave the corporation a period of ten days from
even date.  The ten days passed without
a bond being filed, prompting complainants to file again on November 3, 1993
still another motion to dissolve the writ on the ground that it is not covered
by a valid bond.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> In an Order dated November 3, 1993 the court

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We note furthermore the urgency
involved in the resolution of the motions.  Respondent judge was informed as early as February 10, 1992 of the fact
that Plaridel Surety and Insurance Co. had become bankrupt and its authority as
a bonding entity suspended,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> and through the repeated filing of motions by
complainants calling attention to such fact.  The Rules of Court explicitly requires a bond for the purpose of such
bond answering for damages which the party enjoined may sustain by reason of
the injunction if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not
entitled thereto.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> It was prejudicial to the interest of complainants
here that respondent judge, by his inaction, allowed a lacuna in time where no
bond at all covered the writ, particularly, as it would later be resolved, that
the corporation had no clear and existing right over the subject properties as
would entitle it to the writ demanded.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On the matter of the fake second
bond, the investigating justice made the following findings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt">That while the case folio was still
in his Sala, a fake bond was filed on November 17, 1993 at 1:10 in the
afternoon (Exhibits “7” and “7-A” – Mendez) and he was not informed by then
Clerk of Court Atty. Benno L. Bonifacio, because there was already an order for
the respondent Judge to transfer the case to Branch 61 and in fact the case was
transferred on November 19, 1993, hence respondent Judge explained that he had
no knowledge of the existence of Exhibit “7”, the fake bond.  The Presiding Judge of the Sala controls the
case and makes decision on the matter sought to be resolved, but he is not the
Record Custodian of more than 400 cases that he is hearing.  That the said bond was found out to be fake
only on March 7, 1994 (Exhibits “8” and “8-A” – Mendez) when the case was
already being tried by Branch 61.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We agree with the investigating
justice that respondent judge cannot be held liable with knowledge of the
insertion of the fake bond in the record, absent substantial evidence.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn17" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Nor can we ascribe to the court
personnel knowledge that the bond was fake.  The fake bond was received by one of the employees of the trial court at
1:10 in the afternoon of November 17, 1993, as shown by the stamped box on the
left hand corner of the document, but was not accompanied by any letter or
motion.  The bond and the attached
documents were then tacked to the records of Civil Case No. 2137-G at pages 641
to 647.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn18" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> While the inclusion of the bond in the record may
have been irregular or may be the result of oversight or carelessness on the
part of the court personnel, as it was not introduced therein via any pleading,
we cannot readily conclude that such inclusion was “surreptitiously” made with
full knowledge that the bond was bogus, as charged by complainants.  After all, the documents were received in
the course of the court’s business and stamped accordingly, and made part of
the records with appropriate pagination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We also adopt the findings of the
investigating justice relative to Atty. Vicente Joyas involvement in the
procuring and filing of the fake bond, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In the present case, I find no conspiracy in the filing of the fake
bond.  The respondent Judge did not know
of its existence, whereas, Atty. Vicente Joyas, although he admitted he was asked
to replace the bond posted by the bankrupt Plaridel Surety and Insurance
Company, he was not the one who processed it and he did not file the said bond
himself and was not cognizant of the defect of the bond.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Beyond the circumstance that Atty.
Joyas was the counsel for the corporation, complainants failed to substantiate
their charges against him.  Atty. Joyas
explained in his Comment that the corporation and not he himself procured the
bond.  His participation was to simply
examine the bond, particularly whether it was accompanied by the required
certifications from the Supreme Court and the Insurance Commissioner, and
finding the same to be on its face in order, and furthermore, notarized, caused
the same to be brought to the trial court for filing.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Atty. Joyas further pointed out that the corporation
“if only to show to the Court that it will not willingly allow itself nor that
of its counsel to be a party in posting a fake bond”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn20" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> posted a cash bond in the amount of <s>P</s>1,000,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It is imperative however to
pinpoint with certitude the person or persons responsible for the fake
bond.  The certification dated March 21,
1994 of Country Bankers Insurance Corporation from whom the bond was allegedly
procured states that the signature of the surety’s agent appearing on the
document was not genuine, that this agent was not authorized to issue bonds,
and that the entity which issued the receipt for the premium was not an agent.
The certifying officer, the Senior Manager of the Bonding Department of Country
Bankers Insurance Corporation, intimated that “a syndicate is definitely behind
the proliferation of fake bonds.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn21" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> We thus must order an investigation into this matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Respondent judge compulsorily
retired on January 5, 1998.  His
retirement does not however render this administrative case moot and
academic.  As we have stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
