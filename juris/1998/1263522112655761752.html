				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The right to
preliminary investigation is not a mere formal right, it is a substantive
right.  To deny the accused of such
right would be to deprive him of due process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In this special
civil action for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction, petitioners
seek to set aside the Order of the Sandiganbayan dated 27 June 1997 denying the
Motion to Quash the information filed against them for violating Sec. 3(g) of
R.A. No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft And Corrupt Practices Act.  Petitioners similarly impugn the Resolution
of the Sandiganbayan dated 5 August 1997 which denied their Motion for
Reconsideration thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Pertinent to
this case are the following facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1990, the Davao City Local
Automation Project was launched by the city government of Davao.   The goal of said project was to make Davao
City a leading center for computer systems and technology development.  It also aimed to provide consultancy and
training services and to assist all local government units in Mindanao set up
their respective computer systems.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">To implement the project, a
Computerization Program Committee, composed of the following was formed:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Committee’s duty was to “conduct a thorough study of the
different computers in the market, taking into account the quality and
acceptability of the products, the reputation and track record of the
manufacturers and/or their Philippine distributors, the availability of service
centers in the country that can undertake preventive maintenance of the
computer hardwares to ensure a long and uninterrupted use and, last but not the
least, the capability of the manufacturers and/or Philippine distributors to
design and put into place the computer system – complete with the flow of
paperwork, forms to be used and personnel required.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Following these
guidelines, the Committee recommended the acquisition of Goldstar computers
manufactured by Goldstar Information and Communication, Ltd., South Korea and
exclusively distributed in the Philippines by Systems Plus, Inc. (SPI).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">After obtaining
prior clearance from COA Auditor Kintanar, the Committee proceeded to negotiate
with SPI, represented by its President Rodolfo V. Jao and Executive Vice
President Manuel T. Asis, for the acquisition and installation of the computer
hardware and the training of personnel for the Electronic Data-Processing
Center.  The total contract cost
amounted to <s>P</s>11,656,810.00<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 5 November
1990, the City Council (Sangguniang Panlungsod) of Davao unanimously passed
Resolution No. 1402 and Ordinance No. 173 approving the proposed contract for
computerization between Davao City and SPI.  The Sanggunian, likewise, authorized the City Mayor (petitioner Duterte)
to sign the said contract for and in behalf of Davao City.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On the same day,
the Sangguniang issued Resolution No. 1403 and Ordinance No. 174, the General
Fund Supplemental Budget No. 07 for CY 1990 appropriating <s>P</s>3,000,000.00
for the city’s computerization project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Given the
go-signal, the contract was duly signed by the parties thereto and on 8
November 1990, petitioner City Administrator de Guzman released to SPI PNB
Check No. 65521 in the amount of <s>P</s>1,748,521.58 as downpayment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 27 November
1990, the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao received a letter-complaint from a
“concerned citizen,” stating that “some city officials are going to make a
killing” in the transaction.</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The complaint was docketed as
OMB-MIN-90-0425.  However, no action was
taken thereon.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Thereafter,
sometime in February 1991, a complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 20,550-91,
was instituted before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 12 by Dean
Pilar Braga, Hospicio C. Conanan, Jr. and Korsung Dabaw Foundation, Inc.
against the petitioners, the City Council, various city officials and SPI for
the judicial declaration of nullity of the aforestated resolutions and
ordinances and the computer contract executed pursuant thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 22 February
1991, Goldstar, through its agent, Mr. S.Y. Lee sent a proposal to petitioner
Duterte for the cancellation of the computerization contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Consequently, on
8 April 1991, the Sangguniang issued Resolution No. 449 and Ordinance No. 53
accepting Goldstar’s offer  to cancel
the computerization contract provided the latter return the advance payment of <s>P</s>1,748,521.58
to the City Treasurer’s Office within a period of one month.  Petitioner Duterte, as city mayor, was thus
authorized to take the proper steps for the mutual cancellation of the said
contract and to sign all documents relevant thereto.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Pursuant to the
aforestated authority, on 6 May 1991, petitioner Duterte, in behalf of Davao
City, and SPI mutually rescinded the contract and the downpayment was duly
refunded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the meantime,
a Special Audit Team of the Commission on Audit was tasked to conduct an audit
of the Davao City Local Automation Project to determine if said contract
conformed to government laws and regulations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 31 May 1991,
the team submitted its Special Audit Report (SAR) No. 91-05 recommending
rescission of the subject contract.  A
copy of the report was sent to petitioner Duterte by COA Chairman Eufemio C.
Domingo on 7 June 1991.  In the latter’s
transmittal letter, Chairman Domingo summarized the findings of the special
audit team, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
award of the contract for the “Davao City Local Automation Project” to Systems
Plus, Inc., for <s>P</s>11,656,810 was done thru negotiated contract rather
than thru competitive public bidding in violation of Sections 2 and 8 of PD
526.  Moreover, there was no sufficient
appropriation for this particular contract in violation of Sec. 85 of PD 1445.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Advance
payment of <s>P</s>1.7M was made to Systems Plus, Inc. covering 15% of the
contract cost of <s>P</s>11.6M in violation of Sec. 45 of PD 477 and Sec. 88 of
PD 1445.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
cost of computer hardware and accessories under contract with “Systems Plus,
Inc. (SPI)” differed from the team’s canvass by as much as 1200% or a total of <s>P</s>1.8M.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
City had no Information System Plan (ISP) prior to the award of the contract to
SPI in direct violation of Malacañang Memo. Order No. 287 and NCC Memo.
Circular 89-1 dated June 22, 1989.  This
omission resulted in undue disadvantage to the City Government.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
remedy the foregoing deficiencies, the team recommends that the contract with
Systems Plus, Inc. be rescinded in view of the questionable validity due to
insufficient funding.  Further, the
provisions of NCC-Memorandum Circular 89-1 dated June 22, 1989 regarding
procurement and/or installation of computer hardware/system should be strictly
adhered to.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The city
government, intent on pursuing its computerization plan, decided to follow the
audit team’s recommendation and sought the assistance of the National Computer
Center (NCC).  After conducting the
necessary studies, the NCC recommended the acquisition of Philips computers in
the amount of <s>P</s>15,792,150.00.  Davao City complied with the NCC’s advice and hence, was finally able to
obtain the needed computers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Subsequently, on
1 August 1991, the Anti-Graft League-Davao City Chapter, through one Miguel C.
Enriquez, filed an unverified complaint with the Ombudsman-Mindanao against
petitioners, the City Treasurer, City Auditor, the whole city government of
Davao and SPI.  The League alleged that
the respondents, in entering into the computerization contract, violated R.A.
No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), PD No. 1445 (Government
Auditing Code of the Philippines), COA circulars and regulations, the Revised
Penal Code and other pertinent laws.  The case was docketed as OMB-3-91-1768.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 9 October
1991, Graft Investigation Officer (GIO) Pepito A. Manriquez of the Office of
the Ombudsman sent a letter</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> to COA Chairman Domingo requesting
the Special Audit Team to submit their joint affidavit to substantiate the
complaint in compliance with Section 4, par. (a) of the Rules of Procedure of
the Office of the Ombudsman (A. O. No. 07).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 14 October
1991, Judge Paul T. Arcangel, issued an Order dismissing Civil Case No.
20,550-91.  The dispositive portion
reads, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE, in view of all the
foregoing, this case is hereby dismissed on the ground of prematurity and that
it has become moot and academic with the mutual cancellation of the
contract.  The other claims of the parties
are hereby denied.  No pronouncement as
to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">SO ORDERED.</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 12 November
1991, Graft Investigator Manriquez issued an order in OMB-3-91-1768 directing
petitioners, Jorge Silvosa (City Treasurer), Mariano Kintanar (City Auditor)
and Manuel T. Asis of SPI to:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">xxx file in ten (10) days (1) their
respective verified point-by-point comment under oath upon every allegation of
the complaint in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 in the Regional Trial Court (RTC),
Branch 12, Davao City “Dean Pilar C. Braga, et al. vs. Illegality of City
Council of Davao Resolutions and Ordinances, and the Computer Contract executed
Pursuant Thereto, for Recovery of Sum of Money, Professional Fees and Costs –
with Injunctive Relief, including the Issuance of a Restraining Order and/or a
Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction in which they filed a motion to
dismiss, not an answer and (2) the respective comments, also under oath, on the

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 4 December
1991, the Ombudsman received the affidavits of the Special Audit Team but
failed to furnish petitioners copies thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 18 February
1992, petitioners submitted a manifestation adopting the comments filed by
their co-respondents Jorge Silvosa and Mariano Kintanar dated 25 November 1991
and 17 January 1992, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Four years
after, or on 22 February 1996, petitioners received a copy of a Memorandum
prepared by Special Prosecution Officer I, Lemuel M. De Guzman dated 8 February
1996 addressed to Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto regarding OMB-MIN-90-0425 and
OMB-3-91-1768.  Prosecutor De Guzman
recommended that the charges of malversation, violation of Sec. 3(e), R.A. No.
3019 and Art. 177, Revised Penal Code against petitioners and their
co-respondents be dismissed.  He opined
that any issue pertaining to unwarranted benefits or injury to the government
and malversation were rendered moot and academic by the mutual rescission of
the subject contract before the COA submitted its findings (SAR No. 91-05) or
before the disbursement was disallowed.   However, Prosecutor De Guzman recommended that petitioners be
charged under Sec. 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 “for having entered into a contract
manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government, the elements of profit,
unwarranted benefits or loss to government being immaterial.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Accordingly, the
following information dated 8 February 1996 was filed against petitioners
before the Sandiganbayan (docketed as Criminal Case No. 23193):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">That on or about November 5, 1990,
in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, both public officers, accused
Benjamin C. De Guzman being then the City Administrator of Davao City,
committing the crime herein charged in relation to, while in the performance and
taking advantage of their official functions, and conspiring and confederating
with each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally enter
into a negotiated contract for the purchase of computer hardware and
accessories with the Systems Plus, Incorporated for and in consideration of the
amount of PESOS:  ELEVEN MILLION SIX
HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TEN (<s>P</s>11,656,810.00), which
contract is manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government, said
accused knowing fully-well that the said acquisition cost has been overpriced
by as much as twelve hundred (1200%) percent and without subjecting said
acquisition to the required public bidding.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">CONTRARY TO LAW.</span><a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 27 February
1996, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration and on 29 March 1996, a
Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration on the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
were deprived of their right to a preliminary investigation, due process and
the speedy disposition of their case;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
Duterte acted in good faith and was clothed with authority to enter into the
subject contract;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is no contract manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government since
the subject contract has been duly rescinded.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 19 March
1996, the Ombudsman issued a Resolution denying petitioners’ motion for
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 18 June 1997,
petitioners filed a Motion to Quash which was denied by the Sandiganbayan in
its Order dated 27 June 1997.  The
Sandiganbayan ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">It appears, however, that the accused
were able to file motions for the reconsideration of the Resolution authorizing
the filing of the Information herein with the Ombudsman in Manila.  This would mean, therefore, that whatever
decision which might have occurred with respect to the preliminary
investigation would have been remedied by the motion for consideration in the
sense that whatever the accused had to say in their behalf, they were able to
do in that motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Considering the denial thereof by
the Office of the Ombudsman, the Court does not believe itself empowered to
authorize a reinvestigation on the ground of an inadequacy of the basic
preliminary investigation nor with respect to a dispute as to the proper
appreciation by the prosecution of the evidence at that time.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">In view hereof, upon further
representation by Atty. Medialdea that he represents not only Mayor Duterte but

Manriquez had intended merely to adopt the allegations of the plaintiffs in the

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In what passes
off as application of the foregoing rules, all that petitioners were asked to
do was merely to file their comment upon every allegation of the complaint in
Civil Case No. 20,550-91 in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and on the COA
Special Audit Report.  The comment referred
to in Section 2(b) Rule II, of A.O. No. 07 is not part of or is equivalent to
the preliminary investigation contemplated in Sec. 4, Rule II, of the same
Administrative Order.  A plain reading
of Sec. 2 would convey the idea that upon evaluation of the complaint, the
investigating officer may recommend its outright dismissal for palpable want of
merit; otherwise, or if the complaint appears to have some merit, the
investigator may recommend action under any of those enumerated from (b) to
(f), that is, the investigator may recommend that the complaint be:  referred to respondent for comment, or
endorsed to the proper government office or agency which has jurisdiction over
the case; or forwarded to the appropriate office of official for fact-finding
investigation.  Now, if the investigator
opts to recommend the filing of a comment by the respondent, it is presumably
because he needs more facts and information for further evaluation of the
merits of the complaint.  That being
done, the investigating officer shall again recommend any one of the actions
enumerated in Section 2, which include the conduct of a preliminary
investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A preliminary
investigation, on the other hand, takes on an adversarial quality and an
entirely different procedures comes into play.  This must be so because the purpose of a preliminary investigation or a
previous inquiry of some kind, before an accused person is placed on trial, is
to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution, and
to protect him from an open and public accusation of a crime, from the trouble,
expenses and anxiety of public trial.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> It is also intended to protect the
state from having to conduct useless and expensive trials.</span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> While the right is statutory rather
than constitutional in its fundament, it is a component part of due process in
criminal justice. The right to have a preliminary investigation conducted
before being bound over to trial for a criminal offense and hence, formally at
risk of incarceration or some other penalty, is not a mere formal or technical
right; it is a substantive right. To deny the accused’s claim to a preliminary
investigation would be to deprive him of the full measure of his right to due
process.</span><a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Note that in
preliminary investigation, if the complaint is unverified or based only on
official reports (which is the situation obtaining in the case at bar), the
complainant is required to submit affidavits to substantiate the complaint. The
investigating officer, thereafter, shall issue an order, to which copies of the
complaint-affidavit are attached, requiring the respondent to submit his
counter-affidavits. In the preliminary investigation, what the respondent is
required to file is a counter-affidavit, not a comment. It is only when the
respondent fails to file a counter-affidavit may the investigating officer
consider the respondent’s comment as the answer to the complaint. Against the
foregoing backdrop, there was a palpable non-observance by the Office of the
Ombudsman of the fundamental requirements of preliminary investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Apparently, in
the case at bar, the investigating officer considered the filing of
petitioner’s comment as a substantial compliance with the requirements of a
preliminary investigation. Initially, Graft Investor Manriquez directed the
members of the Special Audit Team on 9 October 1991 to submit their affidavits
relative to SAR No. 91-05. However, on 12 November 1991, before the affidavits
were submitted, Manriquez required petitioners to submit their respective
comments on the complaint in the civil case and on Special Audit Report (SAR)
91-05. Even when the required affidavits were filed by the audit team on 4
December 1991, petitioners were still not furnished copies thereof. The
Ombudsman contends that failure to provide petitioners the complaint-affidavits
is immaterial since petitioners were well aware of the existence of the civil
complaint and SAR No. 91-05. We find the Ombudsman’s  reasoning flawed. The civil complaint and the COA Special Audit
Report are not equivalent to the complaint-affidavits required by the rules.
Moreover, long before petitioners were directed to file their comments, the
civil complaint (Civil Case No. 20, 550-91) was rendered moot and academic and,
accordingly, dismissed following the mutual cancellation of the computerization
contract. In SAR No. 91-05, on the other hand, petitioners were merely advised
to rescind the subject contract – which was accomplished even before the audit
report came out. In light of these circumstances, the Court cannot blame
petitioners for being unaware of the proceedings conducted against them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In <i>Olivas vs.
Office of the Ombudsman</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> this Court, speaking through
Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, emphasized that it is mandatory requirement for the
complaint to submit his affidavit and those of his witnesses before the
respondent can be compelled to submit his counter-affidavits and other
supporting documents. Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Even in investigations looking to
the prosecution of a party, Rule I, § 3 can only apply to the general criminal
investigation, which in the case at bar was already conducted by the PCGG. But
after the Ombudsman and his deputies have gathered evidence and their
investigation has ceased to be a general exploratory one and they decide to
bring the action against a party, their proceedings become adversary and Rule
II § 4(a) then applies. This means that before the respondent can be required
to submit counter-affidavits and other supporting documents, the complaint must
submit his affidavit and those of his witnesses. This is true not only of
prosecutions of graft cases under Rep. Act No. 3019 but also of actions for the
recovery of unexplained wealth under Rep. Act No. 1379, because § 2 of this
latter law requires that before a petition is filed there must be a “previous inquiry
similar to preliminary investigation in criminal cases.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Indeed, since a preliminary
investigation is designed to screen cases for trial, only evidence may be
considered. While reports and even raw information may justify the initiation
of an investigation, the stage of preliminary investigation can be held only
after sufficient evidence has been gathered and evaluated warranting the
eventual prosecution of the case in court. As this Court held in <i>Cojuangco,
Jr. v. PCGG:<o:p></o:p></i></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although such a preliminary investigation
is not a trial and is not intended to usurp the function of the trial court, it
is not a casual affair. The officer conducting the same investigates or
inquires into the facts concerning the commission of the crime with the end in
view of determining whether or not an information may be prepared against the
accused. Indeed, a preliminary investigation is in effect a realistic judicial
appraisal of the merits of the case. Sufficient proof of the guilt of the
accused must be adduced so that when the case is tried, the trial court may not
be bound as a matter of law to order an acquittal. A preliminary investigation
has then been called a judicial inquiry. It is a judicial proceeding. An act
becomes judicial when there is opportunity to be heard and for the production
and weighing of evidence, and a decision is rendered thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-family: Arial;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Compounding the
deprivation of petitioners of their right to a preliminary investigation was
the undue and unreasonable delay in the termination of the irregularity conducted
preliminary investigation. Petitioners’ manifestation adopting the comments of
their co-respondents was filed on 18 February 1992. However, it was only on 22
February 1996 or four (4) years later, that petitioners received a memorandum
dated 8 February 1996 submitted by Special Prosecutor Officer I Lemuel M. De
Guzman recommending the filing of information against them for violation of
Sec. 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The
inordinate delay in the conduct of the “preliminary investigation” infringed
upon their constitutionally guaranteed right to a speedy disposition of their
case.</span><a style="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> In <i>Tatad vs. Sandiganbayan</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> we held that an undue delay of
close to three (3) years in the termination of the preliminary investigation in
the light of the circumstances obtaining in that case warranted the dismissal
of the case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">We find the long delay in the
termination of the preliminary investigation by the Tanodbayan in the instant
case to be violative of the constitutional right of the accused to due process.
Substantial adherence to the requirements of the law governing the conduct of
preliminary investigation, including substantial compliance with the time
limitation prescribed by the law for the resolution of the case by the
prosecutor, is part of the procedural due process constitutionally guaranteed
by the fundamental law. Not only under the broad umbrella of the due process
clause, but under the constitutional guarantee of “speedy disposition” of cases
as embodied in Section 16 of the Bill of Rights (both in the 1973 and 1987
Constitution), the inordinate delay is violative of the petitioner’s
constitutional rights. A delay of close to three (3) years can not be deemed
reasonable or justifiable in the light of the circumstances obtaining in the
case at bar. We are not impressed by the attempt of the Sandiganbayan to
sanitize the long delay by indulging in the speculative assumption that “the
delay may be due to a painstaking and grueling scrutiny by the Tanodbayan as to
whether the evidence presented during the preliminary investigation merited
prosecution of a former high-ranking government official.” In the first place,
such a statement suggests a double standard of treatment, which must be
emphatically rejected. Secondly, three out of the five charges against the
petitioner were for his alleged failure to file his sworn statement of assets
and liabilities required by Republic Act No. 3019, which certainly did not
involve complicated legal and factual issues necessitating such “painstaking
and grueling scrutiny” as would justify a delay of almost three years in
terminating the preliminary investigation. The other two charges relating to
alleged bribery and alleged giving of unwarranted benefits to a relative, while
presenting more substantial legal and factual issues, certainly do not warrant
or justify the period of three years, which it took the Tanodbayan to resolve
the case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">It has been suggested that the long
delay in terminating the preliminary investigation should not be deemed fatal,
for even the complete absence of a preliminary investigation does not warrant
dismissal of the information. True – but the absence of a preliminary
investigation can be corrected by giving the accused such investigation. But an
undue delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation can not be
corrected, for until now, man has not yet invented a device for setting back
time.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the recent
case of <i>Angchangco, Jr. vs. Ombudsman</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> the Court upheld Angchangco’s right
to the speedy disposition of his case. Angchangco was a sheriff in the Regional
Trial Court of Agusan del Norte and Butuan City. In 1990 criminal complaints
were filed against him which remained pending before the Ombudsman even after
his retirement in 1994. The Court thus ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Here, the Office of the Ombudsman,
due to its failure to resolve the criminal charges against petitioner for more
than six years, has transgressed on the constitutional right of petitioner to
due process and to a speedy disposition of the cases against him, as well as
the Ombudsman’s own constitutional duty to act promptly on complaints filed
before it. For all these past 6 years, petitioner has remained under a cloud,
and since his retirement in September 1994, he has been deprived of the fruits
of his retirement after serving the government for over 42 years all because of
the inaction of respondent Ombusman. If we wait any longer, it may be too late
for petitioner to receive his retirement benefits, not to speak of clearing his
name. This is a case of plain injustice which calls for the issuance of the
writ prayed for.</span><a style="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">We are not

apply to the present case which is not politically motivated unlike the former,
pointing out the following findings of the Court in the <i>Tatad</i> decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">A painstaking review of the facts
can not but leave the impression that political motivations played a vital role
in activating and propelling the prosecutional process in this case. Firstly,
the complaint came to life, as it were, only after petitioner Tatad had a
falling out with President Marcos. Secondly, departing from established
procedures prescribed by law for preliminary investigation, which require the
submission of affidavits and counter-affidavits by the complainant and the
respondent and their witnesses, the Tanodbayan referred the complaint to the
Presidential Security Command for fact-finding investigation and report.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">We find such blatant departure from
the established procedure as dubious, but revealing attempt to involve an
office directly under the President in the prosecutional process lending
credence to the suspicion that the prosecution was politically motivated. We
cannot emphasize too strongly that prosecutors should not allow, and should
avoid, giving the impression that their noble office is being used or
prostituted, wittingly or unwittingly, for political ends, or other purposes
alien to, or subversive of, the basic and fundamental objective observing the
interest of justice evenhandedly, without fear or favor to any and all
litigants alike whether rich or poor, weak or strong, powerless or mighty. Only
by strict adherence to the established procedure may be public’s perception of
the impartiality of the prosecutor be enhanced.</span><a style="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Ombudsman
endeavored to distinguish the present suit from the <i>Angchangco</i> case by
arguing that in the latter, Angchangco filed several motions for early
resolution, implying that in the case at bar petitioners were not as vigilant
in asserting or protecting their rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">We
disagree.  The constitutional right to
speedy disposition of cases does not come into play only when political
considerations are involved.  The
Constitution makes no such distinction.  While political motivation in <i>Tatad </i>  may have been a factor in the undue delay in the termination of
the preliminary investigation therein to justify the invocation of their right
to speedy disposition of cases, the particular facts of each case must be taken
into consideration in the grant of the relief sought.  In the <i>Tatad</i> case, we are reminded:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a number of cases, this Court
has not hesitated to grant the so-called “radical relief” and to spare the
accused from the undergoing the rigors and expense of a full-blown trial where
it is clear that he has been deprived of due process of law or other
constitutional guaranteed rights.  Of
course, it goes without saying that in the application of the doctrine
enunciated in those cases, particularly regard must be taken of the facts and
circumstances peculiar to its case.</span><a style="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In <i>Alviso vs.
Sandiganbayan,</i></span><a style="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> the Court observed that the concept
of speedy disposition of cases “is a relative term and must necessarily be a
flexible concept” and that the factors that may be considered and balanced are
the “length of the delay, the assertion or failure to assert such right by the
accused, and the prejudice caused by the delay.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Petitioners in
this case, however, could not have urged the speedy resolution of their case
because they were completely unaware that the investigation against them was
still on-going.  Peculiar to this case,
we reiterate, is the fact that petitioners were merely asked to comment, and
not file counter-affidavits which is the procedure to follow in a preliminary
investigation.  After giving their
explanation and after four long years of being in the dark, petitioners,
naturally, had reason to assume that the charges against them had already been
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On the other
hand, the Office of the Ombudsman failed to present any plausible, special or
even novel reason which could justify the four-year delay in terminating its
investigation.  Its excuse for the
delay-the many layers of review that the case had to undergo and the meticulous
scrutiny it had to entail – has lost its novelty and is no longer appealing, as
was the invocation in the <i>Tatad</i> case.  The incident before us does not involve complicated factual and legal
issues, specially in view of the fact that the subject computerization contract
had been mutually cancelled by the parties thereto even before the Anti-Graft
League filed its complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Office of
the Ombudsman capitalizes on petitioners’ three motions for extension of the
time to file comment which it imputed for the delay.  However, the delay was not caused by the motions for
extension.  The delay occurred after
petitioners filed their comment.  Between 1992-1996, petitioners were under no obligation to make any move
because there was no preliminary investigation within the contemplation of
Section 4, Rule II of A.O. No. 07 to speak of in the first place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-family: Arial;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Finally, under
the facts of the case, there is no basis in the law or in fact to charge
petitioners for violation of Sec. 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019.  To establish probable cause against the
offender for violation of Sec. 3(g), the following elements must be
present:  (1) the offender is a public
officer; (2) he entered into a contract or transaction in behalf of the
government; (3) the contract or transaction is grossly and manifestly
disadvantageous to the government.  The
second element of the crime – that the accused public officers entered into a
contract in behalf of the government – is absent.  The computerization contract was rescinded on 6 May 1991 <i>before</i>
SAR No. 91-05 came out on 31 May 1991 and <i>before</i> the Anti-Graft League
filed its complaint with the Ombudsman on 1 August 1991.  Hence, at that time the Anti-Graft League
instituted their complaint and the Ombudsman issued its Order on 12 November 1991,
there was no longer any contract to speak of.  The contract, after 6 May 1991 became in contemplation of the law,
non-existent, as if no contract was ever executed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
