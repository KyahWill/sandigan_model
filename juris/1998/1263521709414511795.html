Blooming Mills (hereinafter referred to as PBM) obtained a <s>P</s>50,300,000.00

bond, a writ of execution dated May 12, 1982 was issued.  Thereafter, petitioner Abelardo Magsajo,
Sr., Deputy Sheriff of Rizal and appointed sheriff in Civil Case No. 42228,
caused the issuance and service upon respondents-spouses of a notice of sheriff
sale dated May 20, 1982 on three (3) of their conjugal properties.  Petitioner Magsajo then scheduled the

1983, AIDC filed a motion to dismiss the petition for injunction filed before
Branch XIII of the CFI of Rizal (Pasig) on the ground that the same had become
moot and academic with the consummation of the sale.  Respondents filed their opposition to the motion arguing, among
others, that where a third party who claims ownership of the property attached
or levied upon, a different legal situation is presented; and that in this
case, two (2) of the real properties are actually in the name of Encarnacion
Ching, a non-party to Civil Case No. 42228.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The lower court

contracted for the benefit of the conjugal partnership of gains, lies with the
creditor-party litigant claiming as such.  In the case at bar, respondent-appellant AIDC failed to prove that the

their appeal point out that there is no need to prove that actual benefit

that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“The wordings of Article

should be one which normally would produce benefit to the partnership,

with petitioners that there is a difference between the terms “redounded to the
benefit of” or “benefited from” on the one hand; and “for the benefit of” on
the other.  They mean one and the same
thing.  Article 161 (1) of the Civil
Code and Article 121 (2) of the Family Code are similarly worded, i.e., both
use the term “for the benefit of.”  On
the other hand, Article 122 of the Family Code provides that “The payment of
personal debts by the husband or the wife before or during the marriage shall
not be charged to the conjugal partnership except insofar as <u>they redounded
to the benefit of the family</u>.”  As
can be seen, the terms are used interchangeably. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“In the most categorical language,
a conjugal partnership under Article 161 of the new Civil Code is liable only
for such ‘debts and obligations contracted by the husband for the benefit of
the conjugal partnership.’  There must
be the requisite showing then of some advantage which clearly accrued to the
welfare of the spouses.  Certainly, to
make a conjugal partnership respond for a liability that should appertain to
the husband alone is to defeat and frustrate the avowed objective of the new
Civil Code to show the utmost concern for the solidarity and well-being of the
family as a unit.  The husband,
therefore, is denied the power to assume unnecessary and unwarranted risks to
the financial stability of the conjugal partnership.” (Luzon Surety, Inc.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">From the foregoing
jurisprudential rulings of this Court, we can derive the following conclusions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">(A) If the husband himself is the
principal obligor in the contract, i.e., he directly received the money and
services to be used in or for his own business or his own profession, that
contract falls within the term “x x x x obligations for the benefit of the
conjugal partnership.”  Here, no actual
benefit may be proved.  It is enough
that the benefit to the family is apparent at the time of the signing of the
contract.  From the very nature of the
contract of loan or services, the family stands to benefit from the loan
facility or services to be rendered to the business or profession of the
husband.  It is immaterial, if in the
end, his business or profession fails or does not succeed.  Simply stated, where the husband contracts
obligations on behalf of the family business, the law presumes, and rightly so,
that such obligation will redound to the benefit of the conjugal partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">(B) On the other hand, if the money
or services are given to another person or entity, and the husband acted only
as a <u>surety</u> or <u>guarantor</u>, that contract cannot, by itself, alone
be categorized as falling within the context of “obligations for the benefit of
the conjugal partnership.”  The contract
of loan or services is clearly for the benefit of the principal debtor and not
for the surety or his family.  No
presumption can be inferred that, when a husband enters into a contract of
surety or accommodation agreement, it is “for the benefit of the conjugal
partnership.”  Proof must be presented
to establish benefit redounding to the conjugal partnership.  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

distinction between the Cobb-Perez case, and we add, that of  the three other companion cases, on the one
hand, and that of Ansaldo, Liberty Insurance and Luzon Surety, is that in the
former, the husband contracted the obligation for his own business; while in
the latter, the husband merely acted as a surety for the loan contracted by
another for the latter’s business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioners
contend that no actual benefit need accrue to the conjugal partnership.  To support this contention, they cite
Justice J.B.L. Reyes’ authoritative opinion in the Luzon Surety Company case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“I concur in the result,
but would like to make of record that, in my opinion, the words ‘all debts and
obligations contracted by the husband for the benefit of the conjugal
partnership’ used in Article 161 of the Civil Code of the Philippines in describing
the charges and obligations for which the conjugal partnership is liable do not
require that actual profit or benefit must accrue to the conjugal partnership
from the husband’s transaction; but it suffices that the transaction should be
one that normally would produce such benefit for the partnership.  This is the ratio behind our ruling in
Javier <i>vs</i>. Osmeña, 34 Phil. 336, that obligations incurred by the
husband in the practice of his profession are collectible from the conjugal
partnership.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The aforequoted
concurring opinion agreed with the majority decision that the conjugal
partnership should not be made liable for the surety agreement which was
clearly for the benefit of a third party.  Such opinion merely registered an exception to what may be construed as
a sweeping statement that in all cases actual profit or benefit must accrue to
the conjugal partnership.  The opinion
merely made it clear that no actual benefits to the family need be proved in
some cases such as in the Javier case.  There, the husband was the principal obligor himself.  Thus, said transaction was found to be “one
that would normally produce x x x benefit for the partnership.”  In the later case of G-Tractors, Inc., the
husband was also the principal obligor - not merely the surety.  This latter case, therefore, did not create
any precedent.  It did not also
supersede the Luzon Surety Company case, nor any of the previous accommodation
contract cases, where this Court ruled that they were for the benefit of third
parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">But it could be
argued, as the petitioner suggests, that even in such kind of contract of
accommodation, a benefit for the family may also result, <u>when the guarantee
is in favor of the husband’s employer</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In the case at

anticipate were the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">However, these
are not the benefits contemplated by Article 161 of the Civil Code.  The benefits must be one directly resulting

of some benefit to the family.”  Unfortunately, the petition did not present any proof to show:  (a) Whether or not the corporate existence
of PBM was prolonged and for how many months or years; and/or (b) Whether or
not the PBM was saved by the loan and its shares of stock appreciated, if so,
how much and how substantial was the holdings of the Ching family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(prospects of longer employment and probable increase in the value of stocks)
might have been already apparent or could be anticipated at the time the
accommodation agreement was entered into.  But would those “benefits” qualify the transaction as one of the
“obligations x x x for the benefit of the conjugal partnership”? Are indirect
and remote probable benefits, the ones referred to in Article 161 of the Civil
Code?  The Court of Appeals in denying
the motion for reconsideration, disposed of these questions in the following
manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“No matter how one looks at
it, the debt/credit extended by respondents-appellants is purely a corporate debt
granted to PBM, with petitioner-appellee-husband merely signing as surety.  While such petitioner-appellee-husband, as
such surety, is solidarily liable with the principal debtor AIDC, such
liability under the Civil Code provisions is specifically restricted by Article
122 (par. 1) of the Family Code, so that debts for which the husband is liable
may not be charged against conjugal partnership properties.  Article 122 of the Family Code is explicit –
‘The payment of personal debts contracted by the husband or the wife before or
during the marriage shall not be charged to the conjugal partnership except
insofar as they redounded to the benefit of the family.’<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Respondents-appellants
insist that the corporate debt in question falls under the exception laid down
in said Article 122 (par. one).  We do
not agree.  The loan procured from
respondent-appellant AIDC was for the sole advancement and benefit of
Philippine Blooming Mills and not for the benefit of the conjugal partnership
of petitioners-appellees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">x
x x appellee-husband derives salaries, dividends benefits from Philippine
Blooming  Mills (the debtor
corporation), only because said husband is an employee of said PBM.  These salaries and benefits, are not the
‘benefits’ contemplated by Articles 121 and 122 of the Family Code.  The ‘benefits’ contemplated by the exception
in Article 122 (Family Code) is that benefit derived directly from the use of
the loan.  In the case at bar, the loan
is a corporate loan extended to PBM and used by PBM itself, not by petitioner-appellee-husband
or his family.  The alleged benefit, if
any, continuously harped by respondents-appellants, are not only incidental but
also speculative.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the respondent court.  Indeed,
considering the odds involved in guaranteeing a large amount (<s>P</s>50,000,000.00)
of loan, the probable prolongation of employment in PBM and increase in value
of its stocks, would be too small to qualify the transaction as one “for the
benefit” of the surety’s family.  Verily, no one could say, with a degree of certainty, that the said
contract is even “productive of some benefits” to the conjugal partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

agree with the respondent court (and this view is not contested by the
