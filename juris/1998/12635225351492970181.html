				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This Court repeats: men who rape children, worse, their own daughters, are "filthier than the slime where they belong.

He charged that Myrna Ignacio, his common law wife and mother of his children, coached his daughters to lie. He claimed that he had seriously hurt her in the past, twice by electrocution on suspicion of infidelity. He also accused her of using the criminal cases to force him to waive his ownership rights over their house and lot in her favor.<br><br>Seeking to help accused-appellant, his mother, Catalina Calma, his neighbor, Gloria Ceraus, his motherâs laundrywoman, Eugenia Lontoc, his sister-in-law, Lolita Calma, family friend, Rosalie Ofrecio, and a confidante of Annalyn, Larry Laurora, attested to the close family ties of the Calmas. They testified that accused-appellantâs daughters, especially Annalyn, showed much affection towards their father. Catalina Calma, Lolita Calma and Larry Laurora even insinuated that Annalyn was in love with her father and was seducing him.<br><br>On September 25, 1996, the trial court convicted the accused on all three (3) charges. It ruled:<br><blockquote>"The defenseâs position that the charges were fabricated and that the private complainants were coached is untenable. A teenage unmarried lass would not ordinarily file a rape complaint against anybody much less her own father if it were not true (People v. Matrimonio, 215 SCRA 613). A daughter, especially one of tender age would not accuse her own father of this heinous crime had she really not have been aggrieved (People v. Dusohan, 227 SCRA 87; People v. Magpayo, 226 SCRA 13). In their childhood innocence and naivete they could not have concocted the story of how they were wantonly ravished and sexually assaulted (see People v. Magallanes, 218 SCRA 109; People v. Joya, 227 SCRA 9).<br><br>"Neither is there no [sic] merit in the accusedâs argument that the abuses if true could not have been endured by the private complainants for almost a year without telling anyone. It is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of the rapistâs threats on their lives. Delay or vaccilation in making a criminal accusation does not necessarily impair the credibility of the witness if such delay is satisfactorily explained (People v. Errojo, 229 SCRA 49 x x x). The fact that there was no outcry from the offended party is immaterial in the rape of a child below twelve years old (People v. Ylarde, 224 SCRA 405). Also, the precise date when complainant was sexually abused is not an essential element of the offense (People v. Ocampo, 206 SCRA 223).<br><br>"The defense also argues that there was no external evidence of the use of force. In the case of People v. Coloma it has held that âprevious passivity of a daughter in allowing her father to have carnal knowledge of her for eight (8) years is not a valid defense against unconsented intercourse. The kind of force or violence, threat or intimidation as between father and daughter need not be of such nature and degree as would be required in other cases, for the father in this particular instance exercises strong moral and physical influence and control over his daughter (People v. Coloma, 222 SCRA 255). In a rape case committed by a father against his own daughter the fatherâs moral ascendancy and influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation (People v. Matrimonio, 215 SCRA 613).<br><br>"It was held in People v. Ignacio, 233 SCRA 1, that courts may take judicial notice of the interesting fact that among poor couples with big families living in small quarters, copulation does not seem to be a problem despite the presence of other persons around them. Rape can be committed even if the victim is sleeping on the same bed with others (People v. Villorente, 210 SCRA 647). Thus it was not impossible for the accused to commit the abuses on his daughters simply because they were sleeping on the same bed.<br><br>"It was also argues [sic] that the extent of the injuries sustained by the two younger complainants are not enough to support the charges. Suffice it to say that healed lacerations in the hymen do not negate rape; neither does the absence of spermatozoa in the vaginal canal (People v. Liquiran, 228 SCRA 62; People v. Magallanes, 218 SCRA 109). Even if there were no lacerations of the hymen this fact alone does not necessarily mean that there was no rape. The merest introduction of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum is sufficient. The mere penetration of the penis by the entry thereof into the labia majora of the female organ even without rupture of the hymen suffices to warrant a conviction for rape (People v. Sanchez, 250 SCRA 14). Annalyn and Roselyn testified that there was penetration and that it was very painful. The pain could be nothing but the result of penile penetration, sufficient to constitute rape (People v. Sanchez, supra).<br><br>"The mother of the accused, as well as his sister-in-law imply (sic) that an amorous relationship could exist between the accused and Annalyn, and such is one of the theories of the defense. However, where the accused adopted the theory that the victim consented to his sexual desires, the sexual act itself is deemed admitted except as to consent [but] x x x as contrary evidence showed the victim sustained physical injuries consistent with her claim that she was sexually abused without her consent (People v. Saluna, 226 SCRA 447). The charge that the complainant in a rape case has loose morals must be supported by strong evidence (People v. Coloma, 222 SCRA 255). Such a claim could only lead this court to believe that the defense would try to exculpate the accused by blaming the victim, which this court is not inclined to do.<br><br>"The accused imputes false motive in the filing of these case[s] on the part of Myrna. It is unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as an engine of malice, especially if it will subject a daughter to embarassment and even stigma (People v. Ching, 240 SCRA 267; People v. Ignacio, 233 SCRA 1). No mother would stoop so low as to subject her daughter to physical hardship and shame concommittant to a rape prosecution just to assuage her own hurt feelings (People v. Rejano, 237 SCRA 627).<br><br>"A violation of a womanâs chastity becomes doubly repulsive where the outrage is perpetrated on oneâs own flesh and blood, for the culprit is reduced to a level lower than a beast (People v. Dusohan, 227 SCRA 87).

He pleads this Court to consider his daughters to have lied under oath because:<br><blockquote>1. Annalyn and Roselyn both testified that he always withdrew his penis and ejaculated outside them, but such self-control and willpower is impossible for a man who lusted even for his own daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>2. His daughters did not behave like rape victims. They continued to be close and affectionate towards him, hugging and kissing him in public. They always slept together in one room. They continuously attended their classes and even got high grades.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>3. His daughters should have died or suffered some serious physical injury if it were true that his penis forcefully penetrated their vaginas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>All these, accused-appellant submits, cast reasonable doubt on his guilt.<br><br>The law presumes that an accused is innocent and this presumption stands until it is overturned by competent and credible proof. It is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The reasonable doubt should necessarily pertain to the facts constitutive of the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Discrepancies that touch on significant facts are crucial on the guilt or innocence of an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Conversely, inconsistencies and discrepancies in details which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime are not grounds for acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The rule of <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i> has never been regarded as positive, mandatory, or inflexible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Surmises and conjectures have no place in a judicial inquiry and are especially anathema in a criminal prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In a criminal prosecution a reasonable doubt can be created by many things but to be sufficient to prevent a conviction, it must arise from the evidence adduced or from the lack of evidence, and can arise from no other legitimate source.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> While no test definitively determines which is and which is not considered reasonable doubt under the law, it must necessarily involve genuine and irreconcilable contradictions based, not on suppositional thinking, but on the hard facts constituting the elements of the crime. It is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It should not be vague, speculative or whimsical, but intelligent, reasonable and impartial and based on a careful examination and conscious consideration of all the evidence in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> A reasonable doubt is not such a doubt as any man may start by questioning for the sake of a doubt; nor a doubt suggested or surmised without foundation in facts or testimony, for it is possible always to question any conclusion derived from testimony, but such questioning is not what is reasonable doubt. Rather, it is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence leaves the mind of the judge in that condition that he cannot say that he feels an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Absolute certainty is not demanded by the law to convict of any criminal charge but moral certainty is required, and this certainty must attend every proposition of proof requisite to constitute the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Absolute, mathematical, or metaphysical certainty is not essential, and besides, in judicial investigation, it is wholly unattainable. Moral certainty is all that can be required.<br><br>In the instant case, accused-appellant exhorts this court to consider the lack of internal ejaculation and the absence of any injury on the part of the victims, which were testified to by the prosecution witnesses themselves, and their continuous show of affection towards their father, as testified to by the defense witnesses, as indicia of reasonable doubt warranting his acquittal. They lied, argues accused-appellant, because their testimony is improbable, if not impossible, and their affectionate behavior towards him, their alleged rapist, was a contradiction in terms.<br><br>We agree with the Solicitor General that these contentions are conjectural. On the charge that the narrations of the victims were fabricated for the purpose of evading the questions as to why no spermatozoa was found in them during the physical examinations and why they did not get pregnant, the Solicitor General correctly noted that Annalyn and Roselyn were last sexually abused by appellant in March 1996 while the physical examinations were conducted on May 3, 1996 or almost two (2) months thereafter. Hence, even assuming that he ejaculated while they had intercourse, the spermatozoa would have been washed off by May 3, 1996, not to mention that the lifetime of spermatozoa definitely does not run to two (2) months. In any event, the presence or absence of spermatozoa in the vagina is not even determinative of the commission of rape because a sperm test is not a sine qua non for the successful prosecution of a rape case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The important element in rape is penetration of the pudenda and not emission of seminal fluid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The Court is also not impressed by accused-appellant's claim that he could not have raped Annalyn and Roselyn because they continued to be close to him, i.e., they still hugged and kissed him in public and continued to sleep with him in one room. They were also allegedly able to continue attending their classes and obtain good grades at the time they were supposedly molested by him.<br><br>It was Catalina Calma, mother of accused-appellant, , who testified about Annalynâs and Roselynâs supposed show of affection towards him and their supposed normal life during that trying period. But Catalinaâs testimony is hard to believe. Annalyn herself testified that at that time, she was cutting classes and in school, her classmates saw her crying at the library.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Roselyn, on her part, testified that she was greatly bothered by what appellant had done to her and after the case was filed, she felt at peace and was able to continue with her studies.[34]<br><br>There is also nothing commendable in accused-appellant's contention that the forceful insertion of a normal-size adult male penis into the vagina of girls of victims' ages would have required hospitalization and medical attention. Again, we sustain the Solicitor General's argument that full penetration of the vagina is not necessary to constitute the consummated crime of rape. It is settled that the mere entry of the penis into the labia majora of the female organ, even without rupture of the hymen, suffices to warrant a conviction of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The arguments of accused-appellant are premised on the misconception that reasonable doubt is anything and everything that removes a statement from the matrix of certitude. Were we to agree with him and treat every unlikely or uncommon trait characterizing a person, each strange or unusual event in the occurrence of a crime, or just any unexplained, irregular or dysfunctional behavior on the part of the accused or his victims, as basis for reasonable doubt, no criminal prosecution would prevail. It bears repeating that even inconsistencies and discrepancies in the prosecution evidence, unless treating of the elements of the crime, would not necessarily bring about a judgment of acquittal. In this case, there is not even any inconsistency or discrepancy to speak of. Accused-appellant denied criminal liability by simply insisting that his daughters, with coaching from their mother, lied on the witness stand. But during cross examination, they never flinched in their testimony. They spoke in simple, direct words customary of children of their ages, and they maintained their testimony amidst warnings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> by the court and the defense counsel that their father may be meted out the death penalty if found guilty of the crimes that they were charging him with. Significantly, their testimony was corroborated by the medical findings of vaginal lacerations on all three victims and their non-virgin state.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Neither may any of the defense evidence be attributed with having materially negated the positive testimony of accused-appellantâs daughters regarding their defilement in the hands of their father. The defense witnesses may have testified that they remained affectionate towards their father and continued to earn high grades in school, but they denied these statements and countered that they had cut classes and were sometimes seen crying in the library by some of their classmates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> All things considered, we find the evidence against the accused-appellant established his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>HEREBY DENIED,</b> and the judgment of conviction rendered by the Regional Trial Court, 3rd Judicial Region, Malolos Bulacan, Branch 14, finding Rodrigo Calma y Sacdalan guilty beyond reasonable doubt for two (2) counts of Rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Sec. 11 of Republic Act No. 7659, and one (1) count of Acts of Lasciviousness under Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Sec. 5(B) of Art.
