				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It is axiomatic that once an accused-appellant admits killing the victim, he bears the burden of establishing the presence of any circumstance like self-defense, performance of a lawful duty or, for that matter, double jeopardy, which may relieve him of responsibility, or which may mitigate his criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> If he fails to discharge this burden, his conviction becomes inevitable. In this Decision, we also reiterate the following doctrines: (1) the regional trial court, not the Sandiganbayan, has jurisdiction over informations for murder committed by public officers, including a town mayor; (2) the assessment of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies deserve great respect; (3) the equipoise rule cannot be invoked where the evidence of the prosecution is overwhelming; (4) alibi cannot be believed in the face of credible testimony identifying the appellants; and (5) conspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is an appeal from the 34-page Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 21, 1994, promulgated by the Regional Trial Court of Romblon in Criminal Case No. OD-269.

When they stood up to go home, Luz Venus, the wife of Diosdado Venus, told them not to go out because the accused were watching them outside about three (3) meters from the restaurant. Diosdado Venus accompanied them upon their request and they went out and walked towards home. About a hundred meters from the restaurant, the six (6) accused, that is, Mayor Cawaling, the four (4) policemen, namely, Hilario Cajilo, Andres Fontamillas, Ernesto Tumbagahan and Ricardo delos Santos, and civilian Alex Batuigas, the mayor’s brother-in-law, flashlighted them and Diosdado Venus ran going back. The two (2) brothers also ran towards home to the house of their elder sister Imelda Elisan Tumbagahon. Co-accused Andres Fontamillas and Hilario Cajilo blocked them on the gate of the fence of their sister’s house. Ronie Elisan ran towards the ricefield. The accused were chasing them. Vicente Elisan saw his brother Ronie f[a]ll down on the ricefield while he ran towards the bushes and la[y] on the ground. Ronie Elisan rose up by kneeling and raising his two (2) hands. All the six (6) accused approached him with their flashlights and shot him. Ronie fell down about twenty (20) meters from the bushes where Vicente Elisan hid behind the coconut tree. Co-accused Cawaling said [“]you left him, he is already dead.[“] Mayor Cawaling was armed with .45 caliber, policemen Andres Fontamillas and Hilario Cajilo were both with armalites, Ernesto Tumbagahan and Ricardo delos Santos were both with .38 caliber and so with civilian Alex Batuigas. They left towards the house of Mayor Cawaling. After they were gone, Vicente Elisan ran towards the house of his older brother Nelson Elisan. Upon seeing him, Vicente told Nelson that Ronie was already dead. Nelson said nothing. While they were there, elder sister Imelda Elisan Tumbagahon, who was crying came. She said: “Manong, patay ron si Ronie.” (Brother, Ronie is already dead). Nelson said [“]do not be noisy; they might come back and kill all of us.[“] Imelda stopped crying.<br><br>After a while, brothers Nelson and Vicente Elisan went to the house of barangay captain Aldolfo Tumbagahon. The three (3) went to the townhall and called the police but there was none there. Going to the house of the Chief of Police Oscar Montero, they were told by his wife that Commander Montero was in the house of Mayor Cawaling. They proceeded to the place where Ronie Elisan was shot. The cadaver was brought to the house of Nelson Elisan. Vicente Elisan found an empty shell of a .45 caliber about three (3) arm’s length from the body of the victim. They surrendered it to the Napolcom.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Dr. Blandino C. Flores described the gunshot wounds of the victim as follows:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Gunshot Wounds:</span><br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoulder:<br>Gun shot wound ½ x ½ inch in diameter shoulder right 2 inches from the neck with contussion [sic] collar s[u]rrounding the wound.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Axilla:<br>Gun shot wound ¼ x ¼ inch in diameter, 2 inches below the right nipple with contussion [sic] collar s[u]rrounding the wound.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left Axilla:<br>Exit of the gun shot wound from the right axilla, measuring ½ x ½ inch with edges everted, one inch below the axilla and one inch below the level of the nipple.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back:<br>Gun shot wound measuring ¼ x ¼ inch, along the vertebral column, right at the level of the 10th ribs with contussion [sic]collar.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leg, Left:<br>Gun shot wound measuring ¼ x ¼ anterior aspect upper third leg with contussion [sic] collar, with the exit ½ x ½ posterior aspect upper third leg, left.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Based on the death certificate (Exhibit E) issued by Dr. Flores, Ronie Ilisan died of “severe hemorrhage and gun shot wo[unds].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Version of the Defense</span><br></div><br>Appellant Cawaling, in his 47-page Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> presented his own narration of the incident as follows:<br><blockquote>“At around 7:00 in the evening of December 4, 1982, Ulysses Cawaling, then the mayor of the [M]unicipality of San Jose in the [P]rovince of Romblon, arrived aboard a hired motorized boat from Manila in the seashore of San Jose. From the seashore, he immediately proceeded to his home. At around 7:30 in the evening, Cawaling went to the municipal hall to check on administrative matters that piled up in the course of his trip to Manila. He also went inside the police station (located inside the municipal building) to be apprised of any developments, after which he went out and joined Pfc. Tumbagahan and Pfc. Cajilo who were standing near the flagpole in front of the municipal building. The three engaged in a conversation. Cawaling learned that the two police officers were the ones assigned for patrol/alert for that night. The three of them went inside the INP office and there Cawaling informed the two policemen that he received information from reliable persons that certain persons were plotting to kill him and a member of the town’s police force. It is to be noted that this occurred at the height of the communist insurgency and political violence in the countryside in the early 80’s. Hence, such information was taken very seriously, having been relayed by sources independent of each other.<br><br>Cawaling, as town chief then empowered with supervisory authority over the local police, accompanied Pfc. Tumbagahan and Pfc. Cajilo in conducting patrol and surveillance operations around the small municipality. He usually did this as routine since Romblon was then plagued with political assassinations and armed conflict. On their way to the seashore, they passed by C &amp; J-4 Kitchenette, and chanced upon Ronnie Ilisan and his brother Vicente Ilisan drinking liquor and discussing in very loud voices. They stopped right in the front of the restaurant and there they heard Ronnie Ilisan state in a every loud voice that he will kill a person that night. Inside the restaurant, without the knowledge then of Cawaling and the two police officers, witness Gil Palacio, who was buying cigarettes and Luz Venus, the cook/server of the restaurant, saw Ronnie Ilisan, very drunk, brandishing in the air a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver with a protruding screw.<br><br>Initially dismissing Ronnie Ilisan’s statement as just another hollow swagger of an intoxicated person (“salitang lasing”), Cawaling and the two policemen proceeded on their way. After the patrol, they returned to the municipal building and stationed themselves in front. At around 8:30 in the evening, Ronnie Elisan passed by the municipal hall walking towards the direction of the house of Nelson Ilisan, another brother, and shouted the challenge, “gawas ang maisog”, meaning THOSE WHO ARE BRAVE, COME OUT. Cawaling and the two police officers again brushed aside [the] challenge as just another foolish drunken revelry [o]n the part of Ronnie Ilisan, a well-known troublemaker in the small municipality.<br><br>A few moments later, after Ronie Ilisan had passed by, they distinctly heard a gunshot and hysterical female voices shouting, “pulis, tabang” meaning POLICE! HELP! four times. Impelled by the call of duty, Cawaling and the two policemen immediately ran in the direction of the gunshot and the desperate female voices until they reached the house of Nelson Ilisan in San Jose Street. At this point, they saw Ronnie Ilisan holding a .38 caliber revolver. They also saw Vicente Ilisan, Francisco Tesnado, Fe Ilisan, the wife of Nelson and Delma Ilisan, the wife of Vicente, the latter two being the same persons who cried “pulis, tabang” four times. Cawaling then told Ronnie to surrender his gun but the latter responded by pointing the gun at Cawaling and pulling the trigger.<br><br>At the precise moment that the gun fired, Cawaling warned the two policemen to drop to the ground by shouting “dapa”. Fortunately, Cawaling was not hit. Ronnie Ilisan then turned around and ran towards the church. The two policemen gave chase. Cawaling, still shaken and trembling after the mischance was initially left behind but followed shortly. When Ronnie Ilisan reached the church, he turned around and again fired at the pursuing Pfc. Cajilo. Fortunately, the gun misfired. When they finally reached the ricefield, Pfc. Cajilo fired two (2) warning shots in the air for Ronnie to surrender. Ronnie responded by firing once again at Pfc. Tumbagahan but failed to hit the latter. At that instance, Pfc. Cajilo counter-fired at Ronnie Ilisan hitting him. Pfc. Tumbagahan also fired his weapon in the heat of exchange and also hit Ronnie Ilisan. As a result of the gunshot wounds, Ronnie Ilisan later on succumbed.<br><br>Pfc. Tumbagahan picked up the gun still in the hand of the dead Ronnie Ilisan and gave it to Pfc. Cajilo. The three, Cawaling, who subsequently caught up with them after the incident, and the two police officers, then proceeded to the police station located in the municipal building to formally report the incident in their station blotter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The “Brief for All of the Accused-Appellants” filed by Atty. Napoleon U. Galit and the “Brief for Appellants Ernesto Tumbagahan and Hilario Cajilo” submitted by Atty. Joselito R. Enriquez merely repeated the facts as narrated by the trial court.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>Finding the prosecution witnesses and their testimonies credible, the court a quo convicted the appellants. The killing was qualified to murder because of the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and treachery. The trial court ruled that there was a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and his assailants, as the latter were greater in number and armed with guns. It further ruled that abuse of superior strength absorbed treachery, as it ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>“‘Certain cases,’ an authority wrote, ‘involving the killing of helpless victim by assailants superior to them in arms or numbers, or victims who were overpowered before being killed, were decided on the theory that the killing was treacherous, when perhaps the correct qualifying circumstance would be abuse of superiority. In these cases the attack was not sudden nor unexpected and the element of surprise was lacking.’ (Id., I Aquino, pp. 423-424). In the instant case, we earlier ruled that the qualifying treachery should be considered as an exception to the general rule on treachery because it was not present at the inception of the attack. The killing was not sudden nor unexpected and the element of surprise was lacking. It is for this reason that we hold that alevosia should be deemed absorbed or included in abuse of superiority. Even assuming ex-gratia argumenti that it should be the other way around, the situation will not be of help, penaltywise, to the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The defenses raised by the appellants were dismissed and their witnesses declared unworthy of belief for the following reasons:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was highly improbable that Defense Witness Tesnado would not tell his wife (Dory) and Bebelinia Ilisan Sacapaño about the incident he had allegedly witnessed; more so when Sacapaño was the victim’s first cousin.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spot report prepared by Station Commander Oscar M. Montero, the testimonies of Cajilo and Tumbagahan and the medical findings of Dr. Flores contradicted one another on the following details: the caliber of the gun used in shooting the victim, the wounds inflicted and the whereabouts of Cawaling during the shoot-out.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cawaling and his men, armed with guns, could have immediately disarmed the victim at the initial encounter. The court could not understand why the victim was able to fire his gun, run, then stop and again fire his gun, without being caught.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses prevails over the alibi posed by De los Santos and Fontamillas, a defense that was not corroborated by any other witness. <br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The .38 caliber revolver, allegedly owned by the victim, was in fact owned and used by Alex Batuigas.<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defense presented a photo and a sketch to prove that Imelda Ilisan Tumabagahan had an obstructed view of the killing. The trial court ruled that such evidence was misleading, because the window, from where said witness allegedly saw the incident, was at the eastern side of her house, and thus afforded a clear view of the incident, while the window referred to by the defense was at the southern portion.<br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questioned testimonies of Dr. Flores, Nelson Ilisan and Provincial Prosecutor Pedro Victoriano, Jr., though not formally offered as evidence, may be admitted because of the failure of the defense to object thereto at the time they were called to testify.<br><br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defense failed to prove that the prosecution witnesses had any ill motive to testify falsely against the appellant.<br><br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellants had a motive to kill the victim. Nelson Ilisan testified that his brother Ronie (the victim) had witnessed Bonifacio Buenaventura (a former chief commander of the San Jose Police Force) kill a certain Ruben Ventura. Cawaling, who was Buenaventura’s first cousin, wanted Ronie dead, because the latter had not followed his instruction to leave town to prevent him from testifying in said case.<br></blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Assignment of Errors</span><br></div><br>The appellants, through their common counsel, Atty. Napoleon Galit, assign the following errors to the lower court:<br><br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in sustaining prosecutor’s theory of conspiracy and thus renders nugatory or has totally forgotten that policemen when in actual call of duty normally operate in group but not necessarily in conspiracy.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in believing the theory of the prosecution that accused-appellant Ulysses Cawaling was one of the alleged co-conspirators in the killing of the deceased Ronnie Elisan.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not believing the defense of accused-appellant Ulysses Cawaling that he has nothing to do with the shooting incident except to shout to arrest the accused[,] which prompted his co-accused policemen to chase the accused and sho[o]t him when he resisted, after he fired at Mayor Cawaling.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not giving weight to accused-appellant policemen[‘s] testimonies which carry the presumption of regularity.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not acquitting all the accused-appellants by applying ‘the equipoise rule’ thereby resulting [i]n reasonable doubts on the guilt.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>In their joint brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Appellants Tumbagahan and Cajilo cite these other errors:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in relying on the theory of the prosecution that accused-appellants Ernesto Tumbagahan and Hilario Cajilo were alleged co-conspirators in the killing of the victim, Ronie Ilisan.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not believing the defense that herein accused-appellants merely did a lawful duty when the shooting incident happened which led to the death of Ronnie Ilisan.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not acquitting herein accused-appellants by applying the equipoise rule, thereby resulting in reasonable doubt on their guilt.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prescinding from the foregoing, herein accused-appellants do press and hold, that the lower court committed grave, serious and reversible error in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery (alevosia).<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court committed grave, serious and reversible error in convicting both accused-appellants of murder, instead merely of homicide, defined and penalized under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court committed grave, serious and reversible error in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength.<br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consummated crime being merely homicide, the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be considered to lower the penalty of homicide.<br><br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court committed error in not considering double jeopardy.<br><br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court committed error in not dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant Cawaling imputes these additional errors to the court a quo:<br><blockquote><br>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not acquitting herein accused-appellant, Ulysses M. Cawaling, considering that he had no part in the killing and the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not finding the shooting incident a result of hot pursuit and shoot-out between the deceased Ronnie Ilisan and the police officers in the performance of their duty and self-defense, and in sustaining the prosecution’s conspiracy theory;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court gravely erred in not acquitting Accused-Appellant Ulysses M. Cawaling considering that there was blatant absence of due process in the proceedings tantamount to mistrial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>We affirm the conviction of the appellants. In so ruling, we will resolve the following issues: (1) jurisdiction of the trial court, (2) double jeopardy, (3) credibility of prosecution witnesses and their testimonies, (4) self-defense, (5) performance of lawful duty, (6) alibi, (7) conspiracy, (8) rule on equipoise, (9) qualifying circumstances, (10) damages and (11) attending circumstances as they affect the penalty.<br><br>We shall address the first two issues as important preliminary questions and discuss the merits of the remaining ones, which we have culled from the errors cited by the appellants in their aforementioned briefs.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">First Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Jurisdiction of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>Appellants Tumbagahan and Cajilo argue that the trial court erred when it assumed jurisdiction over the criminal case. They insist that the Sandiganbayan, not the regular courts, had jurisdiction to try and hear the case against the appellants, as they were public officers at the time of the killing which was allegedly committed by reason of or in relation to their office.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>The jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal case is determined by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action.

To fall into the intent of the Constitution, the relation has to be such that, in the legal sense, the offense cannot exist without the office. In other words, the office must be a constituent element of the crime as defined in the statute, such as, for instance, the crimes defined and punished in Chapter Two to Six, Title Seven, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Public office is not the essence of murder. The taking of human life is either murder or homicide whether done by a private citizen or public servant, and the penalty is the same except when the perpetrator, being a public functionary, took advantage of his office, as alleged in this case, in which event the penalty is increased.<br><br>But the use or abuse of office does not adhere to the crime as an element; and even as an aggravating circumstance, its materiality arises, not from the allegations but on the proof, not from the fact that the criminals are public officials but from the manner of the commission of the crime.”<br></blockquote>Furthermore, the Information filed against the appellants contains no allegation that appellants were public officers who committed the crime in relation to their office.

There, on bended knees and with hands raised, Ronie was shot by Cawaling and his men.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Nelson Ilisan also heard his younger brother Ronie shouting for help while being chased by the group of Cawaling. As Cajilo and Fontamillas blocked Ronie from entering the gate of Imelda’s house, the victim ran towards a rice field. Nelson stopped Cawaling and asked, “Nong, basi guinalagas ninyo ang acon hali? (Nong, why do you chase my brother?)” But the mayor merely continued chasing Ronie. Thereafter, Nelson saw his brother, on his knees with both hands raised, shot by appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The three aforementioned witnesses narrated in detail the assault against their brother Ronie and positively identified the appellants as the perpetrators. The trial court cannot be faulted for relying on their testimonies and accepting them as true,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> especially when the defense failed, to prove any ill motive on their part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In addition, family members who have witnessed the killing of their loved one usually strive to remember the faces of the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, the relationship per se of witnesses with the victim does not necessarily mean that the former are biased. On the contrary, it is precisely such relationship that would impel them to seek justice and put the real culprit behind bars, rather than impute the offense to the innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Appellant Cawaling submits that the prosecution witnesses tampered with the evidence by cleaning the cadaver before an autopsy could be done. “Such irregular washing of the cadaver by a close relative of the deceased, who is educated and who presumably knew perfectly well the need to preserve it in its original state for the medico-legal examination[,] is highly suspicious. It points to the fact that the relatives of the deceased wanted to hide, or erase something that would bolster and assist the defense (that is, state of drunkenness, powder burns or lack thereof, indicating the firing of a weapon or the proximity of the weapon used on the deceased, etc.).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Such contention is unavailing. First, Bebelinia Sacapaño merely cleaned the cadaver and made no further examination. Second, appellants had an opportunity to have the body examined again to determine or prove important matters, such as whether Ronie was drunk, if he fired a gun, how many and what caliber of guns were used in shooting him; they did not, however, avail themselves of this opportunity. As public officers, appellants knew that it was within their power to request or secure from the court, or any other competent authority, an order for another autopsy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> or any such evidence as may affirm their innocence. Third, their conviction lies in the strong and convincing testimonial evidence of the prosecution, not in the corroborative testimony of Bebelinia Sacapaño.<br><br>Relying on the testimonies of Luz Venus and Gil Palacio, Appellant Cawaling also pointed out that “[t]he power of observation of alleged eyewitness Vicente was severely affected by his intoxication. It may be inferred that an intoxicated person’s sense[s] of sight and hearing and of touch are less acute than those of a sober person and that his observation are inexact as to what actually occurred.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>This argument is not persuasive. The evidence presented fails to show that Vicente was so intoxicated that night as to affect his powers of observation and retrospection. Defense Witness Palacio merely saw the witness drinking tuba on the night of the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Meanwhile the whole testimony of Luz on the matter mainly reveals that Ronie was the person she was referring to as drunk, as shown by this portion:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><blockquote><br>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; When Ronie and Vicente both surnamed Ilisan entered the C &amp; J-4 kitchenette what if any did you observe?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw them so dr[u]nk (Nakita ko sila lasing na lasing).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was lasing na lasing or so dr[u]nk?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ronie Ilisan sir.”<br></blockquote><br>Granting that Vicente was drunk, the conviction of the appellants is still inevitable in view of the positive declarations of Witnesses Nelson and Imelda, who unequivocally identified appellants as perpetrators of the senseless killing of their brother Ronie.<br><br>Appellant Cawaling also questions the trial court’s reliance on the testimonies of Dr. Blandino Flores,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Nelson Ilisan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and Prosecutor Pedro Victoriano, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> for failure of the prosecution to offer them as evidence. In People vs. Java,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> this Court ruled that the testimony of a witness, although not formally offered in evidence, may still be admitted by the courts, if the other party does not object to its presentation. The Court explained: “Section 36 of [Rule 132] requires that an objection in the course of the oral examination of a witness should be made as soon as the grounds therefor shall become reasonably apparent. Since no objection to the admissibility of evidence was made in the court below, an objection raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.” In the present case, a cursory reading of the stenographic notes reveals that the counsel for the appellants did not raise any objection when said witnesses testified on the matters now being impugned. Moreover, they repeatedly cross-examined the witnesses, which shows that they had waived their objections to the said testimonies of such witnesses.<br><br>Lastly, Appellant Mayor Cawaling questions the motive of Prosecutor Pedro Victoriano Jr. This contention is likewise bereft of merit. Unlike judges who are mandated to display cold neutrality in hearing cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> prosecutors are not required to divest themselves of their personal convictions and refrain from exhibiting partiality. In this case, there is reasonable ground for Prosecutor Victoriano to believe that an offense has been committed and that the accused was probably guilty thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Under the circumstance, it is his sworn duty to see that justice is served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Thus, “[h]e may prosecute with earnestness and vigor - - indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Further,<br><br>“Under the prevailing criminal procedure, the fiscal’s sphere of action is quite extensive, for he has very direct and active intervention in the trial, assuming as the Government’s representative the defense of society, which has been disturbed by the crime, and taking public action as though he were the injured party, for the purpose of securing the offender’s punishment, whenever the crime has been proved and the guilt of the accused as the undoubted perpetrator thereof established.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Fourth Issue:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Self-Defense</span><br></div><br>To escape criminal liability, the appellants also invoke the justifying circumstances of self-defense and lawful performance of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Allegedly, Ronie was firing his gun and shouting “Guwa ang maisog! (Come out who is brave!).” Then the mayor and the policemen arrived at the scene to pacify him. Ronie fired at them, which forced them to chase him and return fire.<br><br>We find this scenario bereft of plausibility.<br><br>Unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is a condition sine qua non for the successful invocation of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> As factually found by the trial court, unlawful aggression did not start with the victim, but rather with the appellants. Cawaling and his men proceeded to the C &amp; J-4 Kitchenette and waited for Ronie to come out. When the victim did, they chased and shot him without giving him any opportunity to defend himself.<br><br>Granting arguendo the veracity of the defense’s factual version, it is important to note that appellants admitted that Ronie was running away from them when they chased and shot him. Thus, unlawful aggression -- assuming it was initially present – had ceased, and the appellants no longer had any right to pursue the offender. Basic is the rule that when unlawful aggression ceases, the defender no longer has the right to kill or even wound the former aggressor. Upon the cessation of the unlawful aggression and the danger or risk to life and limb, there should be a corresponding cessation of hostilities on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the means employed to ward off the attack was unreasonably excessive. Being armed, the appellants could have easily ordered the victim to surrender. Even the first shot at his shoulder would have been sufficient to immobilize him, yet they fired a succession of shots at him while he was in no position to put up a defense.<br><br>Jurisprudence teaches that when an accused admits having committed the crime but invokes self-defense to escape criminal liability, the burden of proof is reversed and shifted to him. He must then prove the elements of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> It necessarily follows that he must now rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution; for even if the latter evidence were weak, it could not be disbelieved after the accused has admitted the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, appellants must establish with clear and convincing evidence that the killing was justified, and that they incurred no criminal liability therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> They failed to do so, and their conviction thus becomes inevitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fifth Issue:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lawful Performance of Duties</span><br></div><br>Appellants contend that the killing of Ronie resulted from the lawful performance of their duties as police officers. However, such justifying circumstance may be invoked only after the defense successfully proves that (1) the accused acted in the performance of a duty, and (2) the injury or offense committed is the necessary consequence of the due performance or lawful exercise of such duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> These two requisites are wanting in this case.<br><br>The appellants, except Mayor Cawaling, were men in uniform who happened to be on duty when they killed Ronie. The victim was not committing any offense at the time. Killing the victim under the circumstances of this case cannot in any wise be considered a valid performance of a lawful duty by men who had sworn to maintain peace and order and to protect the lives of the people. As aptly held in People vs. De la Cruz,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> “Performance of duties does not include murder.” That Ronie was a troublemaker in their town is not an excuse; as the Court declared in the same case of People vs. De la Cruz, “Murder is never justified, regardless of the victim.”<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Sixth Issue:<br>Alibi<br></div><br>We likewise brush aside the defenses of alibi and denial raised by Appellant De los Santos. Prosecution witnesses positively identified him and Fontamillas as part of the group which chased and shot Ronie Ilisan. It is elementary that alibi and denial are outweighed by positive identification that is categorical, consistent and untainted by any ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In fact, De los Santos failed to establish with clear and convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime during its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The evidence he had presented demonstrated only that, at the time, he was sleeping in his house, which was near the locus criminis.<br><br>Alibi is always considered with suspicion and received with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable, but also because it is easily fabricated and concocted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It is therefore incumbent upon the appellant to prove that he was at another place when the felony was committed, and that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> This he failed to prove.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Seventh Issue:<br>Conspiracy<br></div><br>The trial court correctly appreciated the presence of conspiracy. Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Direct proof of conspiracy is rarely found, for criminals do not write down their lawless plans and plots. The agreement to commit a crime, however, may be deduced from the mode and manner of the commission of the offense or inferred from acts that point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action, and community of intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> It does not matter who inflicted the mortal wound, as the act of one is the act of all, and each incurs the same criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> We concur with the trial court’s elucidation:<br><blockquote><br>“All of the accused chased the victim and his brother; four (4) of whom blocked their ways, first, to their elder brother Nelson Elisan’s house and, second, to their elder sister Imelda Elisan Tumbagahon’s house. Having changed course by proceeding to the ricefield in their desperate attempt to evade the accused, all the six (6) armed accused continued their pursuit. Their victim, having fallen on the rice paddy, and rising and kneeling on it with raised hands, all the said accused with their flashlights beamed on their victim, in a united and concerted manner, shot him. After Ronie Elisan had fallen down, co-accused Mayor Cawaling was even heard as saying ‘(Y)ou left [sic] him, he is already dead.’ x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eighth Issue:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equipoise Rule</span><br></div><br>We reject appellants’ position that the equipoise rule should apply to this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> In People vs. Lagnas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> the Court through Mr. Justice Florenz D.

As amplified in the discussion above, the Court agrees with the trial court that the guilt of the appellants was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ninth Issue:<br>Murder or Homicide?<br></div><br>The Information alleges three qualifying circumstances: treachery, evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength. If appreciated, any one of these will qualify the killing to murder. However, Appellants Tumbagahan and Cajilo posit that there was no treachery, reasoning that Ronie was not an unsuspecting victim, as he had been forewarned by Diosdado Venus of the presence of the appellants inside the restaurant and there had been a chase prior to the killing. Further, they contend that abuse of superior strength is deemed absorbed in treachery, and that “the addition of abuse of superior strength to qualify the case to murder is nothing more than mere repetition - a legal chicanery, so to say. Similarly, where treachery is not proved, there can be no abuse of superior strength, vice-versa.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>We partly agree.<br><br>Treachery exists when the malefactors employ means and methods that tend directly and especially to insure their execution without risk to themselves arising from the defense which the victims might make. The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack without the slightest provocation on the part of the person attacked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> While we do not disregard the fact that the victim, together with his brother Vicente, was able to run towards a rice field, we still believe that treachery attended the killing.<br><br>In People vs. Landicho,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> we ruled that treachery might still be appreciated even when the victim was warned of danger to his person, for “what is decisive is that the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself or to retaliate.”<br><br>The appellants waited for Ronie to come out of the restaurant. All of them chased the victim and prevented him from seeking refuge either in the house of his sister Imelda or that of his brother Nelson. All of them carried firearms and flashlights. They fired their guns at the victim while he was on his knees with arms raised, manifesting his intention not to fight back.<br><br>We cannot appreciate the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, however, as we have consistently ruled that it is deemed absorbed in treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>We also affirm the finding of the trial court that the prosecution failed to prove the attending circumstance of evident premeditation. To prove this aggravating circumstance, the prosecution must show the following: (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the offender clung to his determination; and (3) a lapse of time, between the determination to commit the crime and the execution thereof, sufficient to allow the offender to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Nothing in the records shows how and when the plan to kill was hatched, or how much time had elapsed before it was carried out.<br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Tenth Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Damages</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"></div><br>The trial court awarded the following: (a) P50,000.00, as civil indemnity; (b) P6,000.00, as actual damages; and (c) P116,666.66, for lost earnings.
