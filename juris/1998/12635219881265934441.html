				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For damages suffered by a third
party, may an action based on <i>quasi-delict</i>  prosper against a rent-a-car company and, consequently, its
insurer for fault or negligence of the car lessee in driving the rented
vehicle?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was a two-car collision at
dawn.  At around 3 o'clock of 21 April
1987, two (2) vehicles, both Mitsubishi Colt Lancers, cruising northward along
Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, Mandaluyong City, figured in a traffic
accident.  The car bearing Plate No.
PDG 435 owned by Lydia F. Soriano was being driven at the outer lane of the
highway by Benjamin Jacildone, while the other car,  with  Plate  No.  PCT  792, owned by respondent
FILCAR Transport, Inc. (FILCAR), and driven by Peter Dahl-Jensen as
lessee,  was  at the center lane, left of the other vehicle.  Upon approaching the corner of  Pioneer Street, the car owned  by FILCAR swerved to the right hitting the
left side of the car of Soriano.  At
that time Dahl-Jensen, a Danish tourist, did not possess a Philippine driver's
license.</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a consequence, petitioner FGU
Insurance Corporation, in view of its insurance contract with Soriano, paid the
latter <s>P</s>25,382.20.  By way of
subrogation,</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> it sued Dahl-Jensen and respondent FILCAR as well as
respondent Fortune Insurance Corporation (FORTUNE) as insurer of FILCAR for <i>quasi-delict</i>  before the Regional Trial Court of Makati
City.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unfortunately, summons was not
served on Dahl-Jensen since he was no longer staying at his given address;  in fact, upon motion of petitioner, he was
dropped from the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On 30 July 1991 the trial court
dismissed the case for failure of petitioner to substantiate its claim of
subrogation.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On 31 January 1995 respondent
Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the trial court although based on
another ground, i.e., only the fault or negligence of Dahl-Jensen was
sufficiently  proved but not  that of respondent FILCAR.</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> In other words, petitioner failed to establish its
cause of action for sum of money  based
on <i>quasi-delict. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In this appeal, petitioner
insists that respondents are liable on the strength of the ruling in
MYC-Agro-Industrial Corporation v. Vda.  de  Caldo</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> that the registered owner of a vehicle is liable for
damages suffered by third persons although the vehicle is leased to another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We find no reversible error
committed by respondent court in upholding the dismissal of petitioner's
complaint.  The pertinent provision is
Art. 2176 of the Civil Code which states:  "Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being
fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done.  Such fault or negligence, if there is no
pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a
quasi-delict  x x x x"  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To sustain a claim based thereon,
the following requisites must concur:  (a)  damage suffered by the
plaintiff; (b) fault or negligence of the defendant; and, (c) connection of
cause and effect between the fault or negligence of the defendant and the
damage incurred by the plaintiff.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We agree with respondent court
that petitioner failed to prove the existence of the second requisite, i.e.,
fault or negligence of defendant FILCAR, because only the fault or negligence
of Dahl-Jensen was sufficiently established, not that of FILCAR.  It should be noted that the damage caused on
the vehicle of Soriano was brought about by the circumstance that Dahl-Jensen
swerved to the right while the vehicle that he was driving was at the center
lane.  It is plain that the negligence
was solely attributable to Dahl-Jensen thus making the damage suffered by the
other vehicle his personal liability.  Respondent FILCAR did not have any participation therein. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Article 2180 of the same Code
which deals also with <i>quasi-delict</i>  provides:  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The obligation imposed by article
2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those
of persons for whom one is responsible. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The father and, in case of his
death or incapacity, the mother, are responsible for the damages caused by the
minor children who live in their company. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Guardians are liable for damages
caused by the minors or incapacitated persons who are under their authority and
live in their company. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The owners and managers of an
establishment or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages caused by
their employees in the service of the branches in which the latter are employed
or on the occasion of their functions. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Employers shall be liable for the
damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope
of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business
or industry.  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The State is responsible in like
manner when it acts through a special agent; but not when the damage has been
caused by the official to  whom  the  task  done  properly  pertains,  in  which  case what is provided in article 2176 shall be applicable.   <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lastly, teachers or heads of
establishments of arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused by their
pupils and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in their
custody.  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The responsibility treated of in
this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they
observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The liability imposed by Art.
2180 arises by virtue of a presumption <i>juris tantum</i>  of negligence on the part of the persons
made responsible  thereunder,  derived  from  their  failure  to  exercise due care and
vigilance over the acts of subordinates to prevent them from causing damage.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Yet, as correctly observed by respondent court, Art.
2180 is hardly applicable because none of the circumstances  mentioned  therein  obtains  in  the  case  under  consideration.  Respondent
FILCAR being engaged in a rent-a-car business was only the owner of the car
leased to Dahl-Jensen.  As such, there
was no <i>vinculum juris</i>  between
them as employer and employee.  Respondent FILCAR cannot in any way be responsible for the negligent act
of Dahl-Jensen, the former not being an employer of the latter.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We now correlate par. 5 of Art.
2180 with Art. 2184 of the same Code which provides: <i>  </i>"In motor vehicle mishap, the owner
is solidarily liable with his driver, if the former, who was in the vehicle,
could have by the use of due diligence, prevented the misfortune x x x x  If the owner was not in the motor vehicle,
the provisions of article 2180 are applicable."<i>  </i>  Obviously, this provision of Art. 2184  is  neither applicable
because of the absence of master-driver relationship between respondent FILCAR  and Dahl-Jensen.  Clearly, petitioner has no cause of action against respondent
FILCAR on the basis of <i>quasi-delict;</i> logically, its claim against
respondent FORTUNE can neither prosper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Petitioner's insistence on
MYC-Agro-Industrial Corporation is rooted in a misapprehension of our ruling
therein.  In that case, the negligent
and reckless operation of the truck owned by petitioner corporation caused
injuries to several persons and damage to property.  Intending to exculpate itself from liability, the corporation
raised the defense  that at the time of
the collision  it  had  no  more  control  over the vehicle as it was leased to another; and, that the driver  was  not  its employee but of the
lessee.  The trial court was not
persuaded as it found that the true nature of the alleged lease contract was
nothing more than a disguise effected by the corporation to relieve itself of
the burdens and responsibilities of an employer.  We upheld this finding and affirmed the declaration of joint and
several liability of the corporation with its driver. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">, the petition is DENIED.  The decision of respondent Court of Appeals dated 31 January 1995
sustaining the dismissal of petitioner's complaint by the trial court is
AFFIRMED.  Costs against petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

right, so that he who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in
relation to the debt or claim, and its rights, remedies, or securities (Gerken <i>v.</i>
Davidson Grocery Co., 57 Idaho 670, 69 P. 2d  122,  126).  Subrogation denotes the exchange of a third

so that he may exercise against the debtor all the rights which the creditor,
if unpaid, might have done x x x x Insurance companies, guarantors and bonding
