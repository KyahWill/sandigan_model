LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND MR. ROBERTO NIEVA, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMERO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner seeks, in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> under
Rule 65, the reversal of the resolution of the National Labor Relations
Commission dated November 29, 1995, ordering petitioner to pay private
respondent Roberto Nieva back wages and separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Roberto Nieva who was employed as a driver by petitioner Philtranco
Services Enterprises, Inc. (hereafter Philtranco) on April 13, 1977, was
assigned to the Legaspi City-Pasay City route.  On May 15, 1989, Nieva sideswiped an owner-type jeep, damaging the
latter’s park light. Unfortunately, the vehicle’s owner turned out to be a PC
colonel who arrested Nieva and brought him to Camp Crame where the
corresponding criminal complaint was filed against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nieva obtained his release from detention by virtue of a bail bond
secured by Philtranco.  He was suspended
by the latter for thirty days effective June 8, 1989. Nieva reported back to
work after serving his suspension. A few days after resuming his driving
duties, however, he was re-arrested on the ground that his bail bond was fake.  Nieva reported the incident to the
management of Philtranco. On October 15, 1989, Nieva was advised by
Philtranco’s administrative officer, Epifanio Llado, that to avoid re-arrest,
he would have to refrain from driving until a settlement could be reached with
the jeep owner.  From then on, Nieva
would report for work only to be told to wait until his case was settled.  The case was finally settled on July 20,
1991, with Philtranco paying for the damages to the jeep.  Three days thereafter, Nieva reported for
work, but he was requested to file a new application as he was no longer
considered an employee of Philtranco, allegedly for being absent without leave
from October 19 to November 20, 1989.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved by this turn of events, Nieva filed a complaint for
illegal dismissal and 13<sup><span style="font-size: 8pt;">th</span></sup>
month pay with the NLRC’s National Capital Region Arbitration Branch in Manila,
which docketed the same as NLRC NCR Case No. 03-01891-92.  The case was subsequently assigned to Labor
Arbiter Cornelio L. Linsangan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Philtranco did not appear at the first four conferences scheduled
by the arbiter, prompting the latter to warn Philtranco that it would be
declared in default if it failed to appear at the next hearing. Threatened with
such an eventuality, Philtranco’s representative finally appeared.  On August 28, 1992, it filed a position
paper with motion to dismiss, stating, among other things, that the complaint
should have been lodged with the NLRC’s Regional Arbitration Branch in Legaspi
City, not only because Nieva was a resident thereof, but also because the
latter was hired, assigned, and based in Legaspi City.<a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss was denied by the labor arbiter in an order
dated January 26, 1993. Nieva then presented his evidence. On August 30, 1993,
Philtranco filed a second motion to dismiss, which was likewise denied by the
arbiter on the ground that the same did not raise any new arguments.
Thereafter, Philtranco presented its evidence to prove that Nieva had abandoned
his work, having been absent without leave from October 19 to November 20,
1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the evidence of the parties, the labor arbiter
gave more credence to Nieva’s version of facts, finding that the latter’s
absences were incurred with Philtranco’s permission, since he was instructed not
to drive until his case was settled.  The arbiter dismissed Philtranco’s allegation that Nieva had abandoned
his work, stating that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“Persistence in pursuing
his claim before the Labor Arbiter negates allegation of abandonment (Antonio
Evangelista vs. NLRC and Arturo Mendoza, 195 SCRA 603). In the instant case,
even before complainant filed his present complaint he had already shown his
determination (and) persistence to return to his work as he untiringly kept on
reporting for duty. In fact, as ordered by his supervisor in Legaspi City, he
even went to respondent’s main office in Pasay City to talk to the operations
manager regarding his return to work. There could be no better manifestation of
one’s interest to his work than what complainant had done. Definitely,
therefore, complainant did not abandon his job.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on June 14, 1994, the labor arbiter rendered a decision
awarding back wages and separation pay to Nieva.  Said decision was seasonably appealed to the NLRC by Philtranco.  In a resolution issued on September 15,
1995, the NLRC affirmed the decision of the labor arbiter, granting back wages
and separation benefits as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“PREMISES CONSIDERED, WHEREFORE, respondent is directed to pay
individual complainant Roberto Nieva both his backwages in the amount of <s>P</s>67,392.00
PESOS and separation benefits in the amount of <s>P</s>33,696.00 PESOS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<span style="font-size: 12pt;">”</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Philtranco’s motion for reconsideration of said resolution having
been likewise denied by the NLRC in its resolution of November 29, 1995,
Philtranco elevated its case to this Court, raising the following issues:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.  The NLRC committed
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it denied the
motion of Philtranco to dismiss complaint based on improper venue;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.  The Commission gravely
abused its discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in ruling
that Philtranco should be imposed backwages and separation pay;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.  Respondent Commission
acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction as to
its findings of facts and when it confirmed the labor arbiter’s decision that
there was no abandonment of work by the private respondent and that the latter
showed his persistence to return to work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition lacks merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first issue, this Court has previously declared
that the question of venue essentially pertains to the trial and relates more
to the convenience of the parties rather than upon the substance and merits of
the case.<a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Provisions on venue are intended to assure convenience for the plaintiff and
his witnesses and to promote the ends of justice.  In fact, Section 1(a), Rule IV of the New Rules of Procedure of
the NLRC, cited by Philtranco in support of its contention that venue of the
illegal dismissal case filed by Nieva is improperly laid, speaks of the
complainant/petitioner’s workplace, evidently showing that the rule is intended
for the exclusive benefit of the worker.  This being the case, the worker may waive said benefit.<a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the aforesaid Section has been declared by this
Court to be merely permissive.  In Dayag
vs. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>“This provision is obviously permissive, for the said section uses
the word ‘may,’ allowing a different venue when the interests of substantial
justice demand a different one. In any case, as stated earlier, the
Constitutional protection accorded to labor is a paramount and compelling
factor, provided the venue chosen is not altogether oppressive to the employer.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Nieva, as a driver of Philtranco, was assigned to the
Legaspi City-Pasay City route.  Sulpicio
Lines, Inc. vs. NLRC<a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>is exactly in point.  In said case,
we held that:</p>

<blockquote>“Section 1, Rule IV of the 1990 NLRC Rules additionally provides
that, ‘for purposes of venue, workplace shall be understood as the place or locality
where the employee is regularly assigned when the cause of action arose.’ Since
the private respondent’s regular place of assignment is the vessel MV Cotabato
Princess which plies the Manila-Estancia-Iloilo-Zamboanga-Cotabato route, we
are of the opinion that Labor Arbiter Arthur L. Amansec was correct in
concluding that Manila could be considered part of the complainant’s
territorial workplace.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is obvious that the filing of the
complaint with the National Capital Region Arbitration Branch was proper,
Manila being considered as part of Nieva’s workplace by reason of his plying
the Legaspi City-Pasay City route.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second and third issues, Philtranco contends that
the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the labor
arbiter’s finding of non-abandonment by Nieva of his work.  It harps on the alleged paucity of Nieva’s
evidence, while citing the numerous exhibits marshaled on its behalf.  Philtranco cites, as proof of Nieva’s
abandonment of his work, two irregularity reports to the effect that  Nieva  was absent without  leave from  October 19-31  and  November 1-20, 1989;
a letter from Philtranco’s assistant manager to Nieva requiring the latter to
report within five days from receipt thereof, on pain of being dropped from the
roll;  and a termination letter from
Philtranco’s company lawyer to Nieva, for his failure to report for work as
directed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to say that these issues raised by Philtranco relate
to the veracity of the findings of fact of the NLRC and the labor arbiter.  It should be noted that a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court will prosper only if there is a showing of
grave abuse of discretion or an act without or in excess of jurisdiction on the
part of the National Labor Relations Commission.  It does not include an inquiry as to the correctness of the
evaluation of evidence which was the basis of the labor official or officer in
determining his conclusion.  It is not
for this Court to re-examine conflicting evidence, re-evaluate the credibility
of witnesses, nor substitute the findings of fact of an administrative tribunal
which has gained expertise in its special field.<a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the labor arbiter, in finding that Nieva did not
abandon his job, held that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“Complainant categorically
stated in his position paper and <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> that on 15 October
1989 he was instructed by Epifanio Llado, respondent company’s administrative
officer, not to drive his vehicle until the case filed by the PC Colonel
arising from the vehicular accident is settled. This assertion repeatedly made
by complainant was never refuted by respondent. Such being the case, the
respondent cannot conveniently contend that the absence of complainant was without
permission.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter and
the NLRC are supported by evidence on record, the same must be accorded due
respect and finality.<a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the labor arbiter considered Nieva’s absence from work
as not equivalent to abandonment. We agree. Time and again, we have held that
the immediate filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal by an employee, as in
this case, is inconsistent with abandonment.<a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, we hold that the NLRC did not commit abuse of
discretion, much less grave abuse, when it denied Philtranco’s motion to
dismiss Nieva’s complaint on the ground of improper venue and affirmed the
labor arbiter’s award of back wages and separation pay to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no grave abuse of discretion committed
by public respondent NLRC, the assailed Resolution of November 29, 1995 is
AFFIRMED and this petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.  Costs against petitioner.</p>
