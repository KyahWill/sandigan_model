Included in said amount was the price of P13,500,000.00 for the supply, delivery and supervision of installation of new pump units ( prime cost items) for the project.<br><br>On 14 October 1982, MWSS awarded petitioner the contract pursuant to Board Resolution No. 121-82 adopted on 9 September 1982.<br><br>On 21 December 1982, MWSS and petitioner executed the contract for the RS-4 project.<br><br>On 15 March 1983, MWSS issued petitioner the Notice to Proceed, upon receipt of which petitioner commenced construction of the project.<br><br>On 3 May 1983, MWSS released P9,000,000.00 to petitioner as advance payment for mobilization.<br><br>During the construction period, petitioner furnished MWSS eight (8) vehicles to be used in the RS-4 project and for which MWSS agreed to compensate petitioner.<br><br>On 14 August 1984, due to his tight financial situation brought about by rising inflation, petitioner wrote MWSS requesting a joint termination of the contract.<br><br>On 16 July 1984, pursuant to General Condition No. 62<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the bid documents providing force majeure as basis for joint termination, MWSS and petitioner approved the joint termination of said project.<br><br>On 28 September 1984, MWSS informed petitioner that effective 1 October 1984, it would take over the rehabilitation of the Cubao, Makati and Novaliches pumping stations.<br><br>On 14 February 1989, due to MWSS’ refusal to pay petitioner its alleged indebtedness, the latter filed a complaint for sum of money with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, to collect from MWSS the following:<br><br><blockquote><br>1).

This contention lacks merit. Although Section 2, Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> provides that only questions of law may be raised on appeal, this rule is not without exception. In the following instances, factual issues may be resolved by this Court.<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise and conjecture; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case and its findings are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellees; (7) the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) said findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner’s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>In this case, as can readily be discerned, the findings of fact of the trial court and respondent appellate court are at variance.

MWSS will support an application by a Philippine Contractor for purchase of foreign currencies with pesos, to the extent of the Foreign Currency requirements submitted with the Contractor’s bid and accepted or modified for award of Contract. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To compensate a Philippine Contractor for any devaluation or revaluation in the exchange rate of the Peso during the construction, completion and Guarantee Period of the Work, the equivalent in pesos of the foreign exchange requirements shall be increased or decreased in the same proportion as the Current Value of each foreign currency bears in relation to its Base Value.</span> For this purpose the Base Value of a foreign currency in relation to the Peso shall be the Philippine National Bank’s official selling rate as established in IB-18 for determination of bid prices in pesos and the Current Value of a foreign currency in relation to the Peso shall be the Philippine National Bank’s official selling rate prevailing on the last day of the period relating to a Payment Certificate. In the event that a currency is not covered by the PNB’s official rates, the CO will determine and adopt a conversion rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Underscoring ours.) </blockquote>Petitioner’s contention is without merit. Petitioner is entitled to foreign currency adjustment only if he procured and used his own dollars to purchase the needed materials from the foreign suppliers. In this case, however, said suppliers were paid by MWSS itself through its loan with the ADB under the latter’s Qualified Commitment Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Although it is his duty to furnish all materials, supplies and tools,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> due to difficulties in procuring his own dollars to import the required equipment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> petitioner agreed with MWSS to avail of the latter’s standing credit with ADB. The terms and conditions of this agreement were embodied in the letter of MWSS to petitioner dated 29 February 1984, (which was duly accepted and signed by petitioner)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which in effect modified the original contract between the parties.<br><br>Petitioner’s argument that the aforementioned letter was actually a loan agreement between MWSS and himself and that what ADB charged to MWSS’ account for paying the foreign suppliers was in turn charged by the latter to him under the alleged loan contract and therefore he, in effect, used his own pesos to purchase the dollars to pay the said suppliers, is simply untenable. There is nothing in the aforesaid agreement that indicates that it is a contract of loan. It is more logical to consider the agreement as a modification of the original contract (RS-4) between the two parties pursuant to Art. 15.01<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the same. Hence, under this new arrangement, MWSS in effect became the importer of the materials and equipment since it paid for the same and petitioner was relegated to the role of a conduit.<br><br>Unmeritorious, likewise, is the claim of petitioner that the payments made to the foreign suppliers by the ADB should be deemed as his own payment since he was the one who made all the arrangements for the importation (opening the letters of credit, for instance). The records show that petitioner has been separately and duly compensated for these arrangements with a 5% mark-up based on the cost of all imported items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Further, when petitioner opened the letters of credit for use in the importation of equipment, he indubitably stated therein that said letters of credit were for his and MWSS’ account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Finally, since it was its loan with ADB that was used to import the required materials, any and all foreign currency exchange risks were naturally shouldered by MWSS.

Indeed, MWSS has no obligation to pay petitioner’s claim because, as previously emphasized, all the imported materials and equipment were paid for by MWSS through the loan it acquired from ADB.<br><br>The primordial consideration in resolving this issue is not who made the physical arrangements to import the materials but who actually paid for the importation.<br><br>To grant petitioner’s claim is to require MWSS to pay twice for the same imported items. This we cannot allow for it would be tantamount to unjust enrichment on the part of petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">For the balance of the bid price for<br>&nbsp;prime cost items in the<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;amount of P13,500,000.00</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Regarding this item, we fully concur with the findings of the Court of Appeals, thus:<br><blockquote>Re the fifth assigned error: In his complaint Sarmiento alleged that the P13,500,000.00 for prime cost items was part of his bid price of P60,000,000.00; and that since the actual cost for the prime cost items and their installation amounted only to P7,364,212.86, he is therefore entitled to the difference between the said actual cost of P7,364,212.86 and the prime cost of P13,500,000.00 as the latter amount was part of his bid price of P60,000,000.00. Thus, the lower court awarded Sarmiento the difference which amounts to P6,135,784.14.<br><br>The lower court erred. The explanation given by MWSS regarding this P13,500,000.00 for prime cost items is clear and substantiated by testimonial and documentary evidence (TSN, May 22, 1990, pp. 8-9; TSN, May 24, 1990, p. 9; Exhs. C &amp; 19-A). This amount was not bid in by Sarmiento. If it appears in the RS-4 Bid Form (Exh. C), corresponding to the description “Allow the Prime Cost Sum for the Supply, Delivery and Supervision of Installation of New Pump Units as Outlined in TS-15.6,” it is because MWSS typed the entries therein prior to the bidding, and the form was distributed to all the prospective bidders. This amount was made part of the total bid for budgetary purposes only so that MWSS would have a uniform basis in comparing the bid amounts submitted later since during the bidding period there was yet no exact specification upon which the bidders could base the amount of their bid.<br><br>Under the section “Prime Cost Items” in General Conditions Clause (GC-53) (should be GC-54), the following stipulation appears:<br></blockquote>‘Where Prime Cost lump sums or unit prices are designated under particular items in the Bid Form, they are intended to cover the purchase price of materials or equipment where the exact details or quality of the materials or equipment is not determined at the time of Contract Document preparation, but where the Contractor is able to determine the cost of installation, the unit prices of lump sum prices as bid by the Contractor shall include for the purchase of the materials or equipment at the Prime Cost stated and all profit, overhead and installation costs.<br><br>‘Subsequent to execution of Contract, the Contractor shall, upon request of the CO, obtain at least three (3) quotations for equipment or materials meeting the Specifications, or such amplified Specifications as may be provided by the CO, and shall submit them to the CO. The CO will review the quotations and will instruct the Contractor to proceed with purchase in accordance with the quotation selected by the CO.<br><br>‘The unit prices or lump sums as bid, will be adjusted by deduction of the Prime Cost stated and the addition of the actual net cost to the Contractor of the materials or equipment. Actual net cost shall allow for any trade discounts. No adjustment will be made to the Contractor’s overhead, profit or installation rates regardless of any difference between the Prime Cost stated and the final actual net cost.’ (Exh. 19-A). (Underscoring Ours).<br><blockquote>Thus, applying the aforequoted provision, this amount of P13,500.00 shall be deducted from Sarmiento’s bid price of P60,000,000.00, resulting in the difference of P46,500,000.00; and, after such deduction, the actual net cost of the prime items which is P7,364,212.86 shall be added to said amount of P46,500,000.00. The result then is that Sarmiento’s actual bid price was only P53,864,212.85 and not P60,000,000.00.<br><br>We rule therefore that Sarmiento is not entitled to be paid the amount of P6,135,784.14 representing the unexpended portion of the provisional or budgeted amount of P13,500,000.00 for the prime cost items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Although the amount of P13,500,000.00 was included in petitioner’s total bid of P60,000,000.00, GC-54 specifically laid down the condition that the actual cost shall be deducted from the prime cost stated in the bid form. There is, therefore, no basis for petitioner’s claim. To award petitioner the balance of P6,135,784.14 would, likewise, be tantamount to enriching him unjustly.<br><br>The amount of P500,000.00 as <br>petitioner’s loss on trade <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">discount for prime cost pump units.</span><br><br>Petitioner anchors his claim for trade discount on the third paragraph of General Condition No. 54 which provides that:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">PRIME COST ITEMS</span><br><br>xxx.<br><br>The unit prices or lump sums as bid, will be adjusted by deduction of the Prime Cost stated and the addition of the actual net cost to the Contractor of the materials or equipment. Actual net cost shall allow for any trade discounts. No adjustment will be made to the Contractor’s overhead, profit or installation rates regardless of any difference between the Prime Cost stated and the final actual net cost. (Underscoring ours)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals, however, denied this claim and ruled in this wise:<br><br>However, GC 54 was amended or supplemented by Supplemental General Conditions (SGC). The effect of such amendment or supplement is provided for under SGC-1 thereof which reads in full as follows:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“General</span><br><br>The Supplemental General Conditions amend or supplement the General Conditions. Both shall be read together, with the Supplemental General Conditions prevailing where there is conflict. Clauses of the General Conditions not specifically amended or supplemented shall remain in effect.” (Exh. 18).<br><br>Of the General Conditions (GC), one was affected by the Supplemental General Conditions (SGC). Thus, SGC-21 provides:<br><br>“<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">PRIME COST PROCUREMENT OF NEW PUMP UNITS</span><br><br>This Clause supplements GC-54.<br><br>The twenty-two (22) New Pump Units, each consisting of a pump bed plate and associated electric motor, will be procured on a Prime Cost basis.<br><br>Specifically, for this Contract the following procedure will apply.<br><br><blockquote>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after contract award the CO will be issued detailed specifications for the pump units to the Contractor.<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Contractor shall invite quotations from a list of potential suppliers prepared by the CO. The CO may also at his discretion cause invitations to Quote to be placed in various publications.</span><br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quotations will be received by the Contractor at a place and time to be mutually agreed upon and opened under the supervision of the CO.<br><br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CO will assume custody of the original and one copy of the quotations and will analyze and advise the Contractor of the selected supplier.<br><br>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequent to notification by the CO of the selected supplier the Contractor shall assume responsibility of the procurement of the pump units in exactly the same manner as for any other item of equipment which he is supplying under this contract (including purchase, submission of shop drawings, customs clearance, transportation in the Philippines, storage, installation, etc.). There will be no direct contract between the pump unit supplier and the Owner.<br><br>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual net cost to the Contractor will be the C.I.F. Manila value paid by him, plus the paid cost of installation supervision which will be included as a separately priced item in the quotation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only this net cost will be used in the adjustment of the original Price Cost Allowance.</span><br><br>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis of payment (which will be stated in the Invitation to Quote) by the Contractor to the pump unit supplier will be by Letter of Credit for the full C.I.F. Manila value. All costs incurred by the Contractor to open the Letter of Credit will be for the Contractor’s account and will not form part of the net costs to the Contractor under the Prime Cost amount. The Letter of Credit will be subject to the usual shipping documentation plus shop inspection and approval of shop tests. All inspection in the manufacturer’s shop will be arranged and paid for separately by the CO. (Exhs. 17, 17-A &amp; 17-B).</blockquote>Under GC-54, before it was supplemented by SGC-21, the original net cost used for adjustment, i.e. the net cost to be added to the P60,000,000.00 bid price after deducting the provisional or budget amount of P13,500,000.00 for the prime cost items, consisted of these amounts, namely: 1) trade discount, 2) profit, 3) overhead, and 4) installation costs.<br><br>However, under SGC-21, the net cost to be used for adjustment consisted only of the amounts paid by Sarmiento on the following: 1) C.I.F. Manila value of the pump units paid by Sarmiento, and 2) cost of installation supervision. There is no mention of profit and trade discount. And only this statement appears that is related to overhead: “All costs incurred by the Contractor to open the Letter of Credit will be for the Contractor’s account and will not form part of the net cost to the Contractor under the Prime Cost amount.”<br><br>Clearly, there is a conflict between G.C-54 and SGC-21 insofar as concerns what constitutes the “actual net cost” for the purpose of adjusting the P60,000,000.00 bid price. In which case, as provided for by the aforequoted SGC-1, the provisions in the Supplemental General Conditions shall prevail.<br><br>Thus, under the subject contract RS-4, Sarmiento is not entitled to trade discount in the procurement of the 22 pump units of the prime cost items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>We disagree. There is no conflict between GC-54 and SGC-21. Paragraph (f) of SGC-21, which states that only the CIF Manila value paid by petitioner shall be used in the adjustment of the original price cost allowance (with the cost of installation supervision to be priced as a separate item) refers specifically and solely to the procurement of the pump units. In other words, in going through the process of, or following the procedure for, the acquisition of the pump units, this is the only expense that petitioner may include in his net cost.<br><br>SGC-21 supplements or is an addition to GC-54. Nowhere in the said provision (SGC-21) is it stated that the costs for overhead, installation, profit and trade discount are no longer included in petitioner’s actual net cost. The two provisions must be read together and harmonized, otherwise, petitioner would be greatly disadvantaged. Hence, petitioner’s claim for trade discount in the amount of P500,000.00 is granted.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price escalation in the </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">amount of P192,000.00</span><br><br>We grant this claim on the basis of private respondent’s own admission, thus:<br><br>xxx<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="12%"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td width="88%"><div align="left"><br>Aside from this price escalation that was already paid, how much price escalation that has not yet been paid to the contractor, more or less?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">The approximate amount is P192,000.00.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">That is not yet paid up to the present madam witness?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">And the contractor is entitled to that amount?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>xxx.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">MWSS’ Counterclaims</span><br><br>Regarding its counterclaims, we rule that MWSS is entitled to the balance of the mobilization fund it advanced to petitioner in the amount of P4,089,809.37.
