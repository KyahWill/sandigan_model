<p>said accused well knowing at the time of issue he did not have 
sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment in 
full of the face amount of such check upon presentment which check when 
presented for payment within ninety (90) days from the date thereof was 
subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank for the reason "Account 
Closed" and despite the lapse of three (3) banking days from receipt of 
notice that said check has been dishonored, the accused failed to pay 
said payee the face amount of such check or to make arrangement for full
 payment thereof, to the damage and prejudice of said Carmelita Santos 
in the total amount of P100,000.00.

</p><p>CONTRARY TO LAW."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Accused pled not guilty and underwent trial.
</p><p>The evidence for the prosecution shows that on September 21, 1990, accused opened savings and current accounts with Amanah Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 In the morning of August 20, 1993, Marites Bo-ot brought the accused to
 the office of Carmelita V. Santos at Room 504 Pacific Place, Pearl 
Drive, Ortigas Center, Pasig City to borrow money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The accused asked for P50,000.00 to be paid not later than December 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 He assured Santos that his receivables would come in by November 1993. 
He persuaded Santos to give the loan by issuing five (5) checks, each in
 the sum of P10,000.00, postdated December 20, 1993 and by signing a 
promissory note.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The 
promissory note was co-signed by Bo-ot. In the afternoon of the same 
date, the accused returned to Santos and borrowed an additional 
P50,000.00. Again, he issued five (5) checks, each worth P10,000.00 
postdated December 20, 1993. He also signed a promissory note together 
with Bo-ot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>On September 14, 1993, Amanah Bank closed accused's current 
account for lack of funds. On October 19, 1993, accused himself 
requested for the closing of his savings account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>Santos did not present accused's checks to the drawee bank on their due date upon the request of accused himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Instead, the checks were presented on March 1, 1994 but were dishonored as accused's accounts had been closed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 Accused was informed that his checks had bounced. He promised to make 
good the checks. He failed to redeem his promise, hence, the case at 
bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>The accused testified for himself. Nobody corroborated his 
testimony. He admitted the evidence of the prosecution but alleged that 
the postdated checks were issued a day or two after he signed the 
promissory notes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Obviously, he was relying on the defense that the checks were in payment of a pre-existing obligation.
</p><p>As aforestated, the trial court convicted the accused. He appealed to this Court and changed his counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He now contends:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">"I </p>
  <p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE ISSUANCE OF THE TEN (10) 
POSTDATED CHECKS (EXHS. "C" TO "L") BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT CONSTITUTED
 FRAUD WHICH INDUCED THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT TO EXTEND THE LOANS. IT IS 
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED THAT THE INDUCEMENT WAS THE EXECUTION OF THE TWO 
(2) PROMISSORY NOTES AS WELL AS THE CO-SIGNING THEREOF BY MA. THERESA 
DEL ROSARIO BO-OT (WHO INTRODUCED ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO PRIVATE 
COMPLAINANT), IN A JOINT AND SEVERAL CAPACITY. </p>
  <p align="center">II
  </p>
  <p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE POST-DATED CHECKS WERE IN PAYMENT OF PRE-EXISTING OBLIGATIONS.
  </p>
  <p align="center">III
  </p>
  <p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF 
ESTAFA AS CHARGED, AND IN IMPOSING A STIFF PRISON TERM OF 27 YEARS OF 
RECLUSION PERPETUA, A PENALTY "TOO HARSH AND OUT OF PROPORTION" AS TO BE
 VIOLATIVE OF THE CONSTITUTION."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appeal is without merit.
</p><p>Estafa, under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal 
Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, has the following elements: 
(1) postdating or issuance of a check in payment of an obligation 
contracted at the time the check was issued; (2) lack of sufficiency of 
funds to cover the check; and (3) damage to the payee thereof.
</p><p>To avoid the first element, appellant contends that he was able 
to borrow P100,000.00 from Santos due to the promissory notes he 
co-signed with Bo-ot and not due to the postdated checks he issued. We 
reject this contention. Firstly, this contention was contrived only 
after appellant's conviction in the trial court. The records show that 
appellant did not raise this defense in the trial court. He cannot fault
 the trial court for failing to consider a defense which he never 
raised. Secondly, Santos is the best person who can testify on what 
induced her to lend P100,000.00 to the appellant. Santos categorically 
declared that it was the issuance of postdated checks which persuaded 
her to part with her money. We quote her testimony, viz.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Q    What happened to those checks you mentioned in the promissory note? </p>
  <p>A      When presented to the bank they were all returned by the bank for reason, account closed.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Before this was deposited to the bank when the accused came 
to your office and loaned money from you, what was his representation if
 any to you?
  </p>
  <p>A      That his collection will come in by Nov. 1993 and also the 
checks issued to me will be definitely funded on the date that it will 
become due.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Were you persuaded as a result of the statement of the 
accused that these checks will be good that you parted away the amount?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is likewise no merit to the submission of appellant that his 
postdated checks were in payment of a pre-existing obligation. Again, we
 note appellant's change of theory in foisting this argument. In the 
trial court, appellant testified that he issued the postdated checks, 
thru Bo-ot, a day or two after he obtained the P100,000.00 loan from 
Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The falsity of the
 uncorroborated claim, however, is too obvious and the trial court 
correctly rejected it. The claim cannot succeed in light of Santos' 
testimony that the issuance of said checks persuaded her to grant the 
loans. A look at the two promissory notes will show that they bear the 
date August 20, 1993 and they referred to the postdated checks issued by
 the appellant. There could be no reference to the postdated checks if 
they were issued a day or two after the loans. In this appeal, however, 
appellant offers the new thesis that since the checks were postdated 
December 1993, ergo, they were issued in payment of the P100,000.00 he 
got from Santos on August 20, 1993. The postdating of the checks to 
December 1993 simply means that on said date the checks would be 
properly funded. It does not mean that the checks should be deemed as 
issued only on December 1993.
</p><p>Lastly, appellant contends that the penalty of twenty seven (27) 
years of reclusion perpetua is too harsh and out of proportion to the 
crime he committed. He submits that his sentence violates section 19(1),
 Article III of the Constitution which prohibits the infliction of 
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment. We are not persuaded. In People 
v. de la Cruz,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> we held 
that "x x x the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments is 
generally aimed at the form or character of the punishment rather than 
its severity in respect of duration or amount, and apply to punishments 
which never existed in America or which public sentiment has regarded as
 cruel or obsolete x x x for instance those inflicted at the whipping 
post, or in the pillory, burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, 
disemboweling, and the like..." In People v. Estoista,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> we further held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"It takes more than merely being harsh, excessive, out of 
proportion, or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to the Constitution.
 The fact that the punishment authorized by the statute is severe does 
not make it cruel and unusual. Expressed in other terms, it has been 
held that to come under the ban, the punishment must be "flagrantly and 
plainly oppressive," "wholly disproportionate to the nature of the 
offense as to shock the moral sense of the community."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature was not thoughtless in imposing severe penalties for 
violation of par. 2(d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code. The 
history of the law will show that the severe penalties were intended to 
stop the upsurge of swindling by issuance of bouncing checks. It was 
felt that unless aborted, this kind of estafa "... would erode the 
people's confidence in the use of negotiable instruments as a medium of 
commercial transaction and consequently result in the retardation of 
trade and commerce and the undermining of the banking system of the 
country."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The Court cannot impugn the wisdom of Congress in setting this policy.
</p><p><strong>IN VIEW WHEREOF</strong>, the Decision dated January 16, 
1996 of the RTC of Pasig City, Br. 156 in Criminal Case No. 106614
