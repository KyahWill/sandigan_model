				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Accused-appellant Rizalino Fundano (hereafter RIZALINO) seeks to reverse the 26 February 1996 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 150, in 
Criminal Cases Nos. 94-4887, 94-4888 and 94-4889, which found him guilty
 beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of rape. The complaints in 
those cases were signed by the complainant Melody Fundano and her mother
 and filed with the court below on 4 July 1994.
<p>In Criminal Case No. 94-4887, RIZALINO was charged with rape committed as follows: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>That on or about the 10th day of September, 1993, in the 
Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means 
of force, violence and intimidation did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the undersigned 
MELODY G. FUNDANO, a 15-year old girl, without her consent and against 
her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaints in Criminal Cases Nos. 94-4888 and 94-4889 were 
similarly worded, except as to the dates the crimes were committed, <em>i.e.</em>, 11 September 1993<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and 12 September 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> respectively. 
</p><p>The National Bureau of Investigation (hereafter NBI), after 
initial investigation, transmitted the results of its investigation to 
the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal on 26 November 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Attached to the report was the affidavit of NBI agent Atty. Carlo Magno Uminga,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 dated 26 November 1993, stating that RIZALINO had a “Standing Warrant 
of Arrest for Homicide” issued by the Regional Trial Court of Makati, 
Branch 134, on 26 November 1985, and that efforts to locate RIZALINO had
 failed as he was “in hiding at Bulan, Sorsogon.”
</p><p>On 6 July 1994, the court below issued a warrant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 for the arrest of RIZALINO at his address at 7123 Langka St., Comembo, 
Makati, Metro Manila. No bail was recommended for his provisional 
liberty. He was subsequently apprehended and detained at the NBI 
Detention Center, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>At his arraignment on 14 July 1994, RIZALINO refused to be 
represented by Atty. Gesiree Abong of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO)
 as he wanted to have counsel <em>de parte</em> assist him and file a motion for reinvestigation. Thus, the court reset arraignment to 26 July 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 On the latter date, RIZALINO, assisted by Atty. Gesiree Abong 
nonetheless, entered a plea of not guilty to each of the three counts of
 rape charged against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After pre-trial was declared terminated on 25 August 1994, trial on the merits was scheduled to commence on 30 August 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>The prosecution presented complainant Melody Fundano (hereafter 
MELODY) and NBI Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Rolando Victoria for its 
evidence in chief; and Ma. Luz Goña and Orlando Oseo, as rebuttal 
witnesses. The defense presented RIZALINO, Oscar Quelas and Luzviminda 
Gregana for its evidence in chief; and RIZALINO and Vida Fundano, as 
surrebuttal witnesses.
</p><p>The prosecution established the following facts:
</p><p>MELODY was the seventh of nine children of RIZALINO with his 
common-law wife, Maria Fundano. The family resided at 7123 Langka St., 
Comembo, Makati, although RIZALINO seldom stayed there. In 1974, 
RIZALINO married one Flora Granada with whom he begot two children. 
While he maintained a relationship with her since 1960, he claimed he 
had separated from Flora in 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
</p><p>RIZALINO left his family with Maria in 1985 and moved to Bicol in
 1986. In 1991, in Bicol, he started cohabiting with one Vida Joya, with
 whom he had no issue. Nevertheless, he would return to Comembo and stay
 there for one to three months at a time. When he was not in Comembo, he
 was usually with “his other wife” in Bicol and, according to MELODY, he
 was in Bicol in August and October 1993, and in Comembo in September 
1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
</p><p>The Fundano residence at Comembo, Makati, was a one-room house 
partitioned into two sections by a curtain. One of the sections served 
as the sleeping quarters, which had a bed on one side and a <em>papag</em>, or makeshift wooden bed, beside it. From the beds one could hear whatever was happening in the other section.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
</p><p>Five of MELODY’s siblings used to live in Comembo, but later 
moved to their sister-in-law’s house at Fembo, Makati. For some time, 
MELODY stayed with her siblings at Fembo but, before she was raped, 
RIZALINO fetched her and her youngest sister, Rosemarie, from Fembo and 
took them to Comembo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>On the night of 10 September 1993, only RIZALINO and his 
daughters MELODY and Rosemarie, were in the Comembo house. RIZALINO and 
Rosemarie slept on the floor while MELODY slept on the papag. At around 
midnight, MELODY stirred from her sleep and found herself lying beside 
RIZALINO on the floor. RIZALINO, who was already naked, removed MELODY’s
 panty and went “on top of her.” He forced her and boxed her even as she
 pleaded, <em>“Tay, huwag”</em> [Father, don’t]. After removing MELODY’s
 panty, RIZALINO boxed her three times on the stomach, thereby 
preventing her from asking for help. He then inserted his penis into 
MELODY’s vagina and kept it there for a long time. MELODY kept crying, 
but she could not move as RIZALINO held both her hands. After the act, 
he warned her not to tell anyone, not even her mother, about the 
incident, as it would “only be [her] shame.” That rape was her first 
sexual experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
</p><p>The next day, after school, MELODY went to the house of Lucita 
Fundano, her sister-in-law, at Fembo. She told Lucita that she would be 
sleeping there and asked the latter to tell her father RIZALINO of her 
intention. But RIZALINO fetched MELODY from Lucita’s house, and because 
she was afraid that he would harm her if she disobeyed, MELODY went with
 him back to Comembo. That night, Rosemarie slept in a different part of
 the house. However, at around midnight, MELODY again found herself 
“being there in the <em>papag</em> already or lying on the floor” beside
 RIZALINO. The latter, who was naked, removed MELODY’s panty and 
“place[d] himself on top of” her. He appeared to her to be drunk, which 
he was every night. RIZALINO then inserted his penis into MELODY’s 
vagina and kissed her on the cheeks. After he finished, he warned her 
that if she told anyone about the incident, he would kill her and her 
relatives. Out of fear and confusion, MELODY did not reveal her ordeal 
to anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>The following morning, MELODY attended class and went home to Comembo at around 3:00 p.m. In the evening, she slept on the <em>papag</em>,
 while her younger sister slept elsewhere. Again RIZALINO carried MELODY
 from the bed to the floor and removed her panty. She begged him to 
stop, but he did not heed her plea. He held both her hands to keep her 
from breaking away, then mounted her and inserted his penis into her 
vagina. After his misdeed, he simply went to sleep. MELODY then put on 
her undergarment and cried herself to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
</p><p>From school the next day, MELODY went to Lucita’s house, where 
she stayed until the end of September 1993. During that entire period, 
MELODY kept silent about her ordeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>On 26 October 1993, while she was at Lucita’s house, MELODY 
learned that her father was no longer at the Comembo house. That night, 
as MELODY thought about why her father abused her, she started crying. 
Awakened, Lucita asked MELODY why she was crying. MELODY finally 
revealed what RIZALINO did to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 Lucita then asked MELODY why she kept this matter to herself all this 
time. MELODY answered that she was afraid and ashamed, and that RIZALINO
 had told her he would bring her to Bicol so that, MELODY believed, “he 
may continue what he had done to” her. She could not even tell her 
eighteen-year old brother about her nightmares because he was equally 
afraid of RIZALINO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><p>The next morning, Lucita went to Maria, MELODY’s mother, in 
Manila and told her about MELODY’s complaint, while MELODY went to 
Cavite to see her friends. MELODY did not return to Comembo, and on 7 
November, she went to her mother in Manila. Four days later, or on 11 
November 1993, MELODY, accompanied by Maria and Lucita, went to the NBI 
and accomplished a complaint sheet,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> executed a sworn statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and submitted herself to a medical examination, with the findings summarized in Living Case No. MG-93-1053.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 After the examination, MELODY, Lucita and Maria went to the house of 
Abe and Sandoy Fundano, RIZALINO’s brothers, who agreed that the case 
against RIZALINO should be pursued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
</p><p>Dr. Rolando Victoria, who examined MELODY, found no extra-genital
 physical injuries nor hymenal lacerations, and while her hymen was 
intact, it admitted a 2.8-centimeter diameter tube without producing any
 injury. Dr. Victoria thus concluded that MELODY’s hymenal orifice could
 admit an adult male organ in full erection without suffering injury, 
and that it was possible she engaged in sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
</p><p>On the other hand, RIZALINO testified that he left Manila for 
Bicol in 1986 and had stayed there ever since, although he would visit 
Manila once in a while and stay at his children’s residence in Kakarong,
 Makati. Sometimes he dropped by the house of his common-law wife and 
mother of MELODY, Maria Gerola,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 at Langka Street, Fort Bonifacio, Makati. After he moved to Bicol, he 
gave financial support to Maria only once, when she went to Bicol to get
 the money. RIZALINO declared that days before the dates he allegedly 
raped MELODY, he was bedridden as his legs were wounded and swollen; in 
fact, he was under medical treatment by an <em>arbularyo</em> (herbal doctor) named Oscar Buelas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 The treatments were administered at RIZALINO’s house in Iraya, Bulan, 
Sorsogon, on Saturdays and Sundays beginning 11 September 1993 until 
October 1993. RIZALINO was able to walk only on or about 15 October 1993
 and was completely healed sometime in November 1993. He never went to 
Manila while he was bedridden and undergoing treatment, even until he 
was healed. He knew nothing about the rapes for which he was indicted 
nor of any reason why MELODY accused him of committing them. 
</p><p>RIZALINO’s witnesses, Oscar Quelas and Luzviminda Gregana, corroborated his alibi. 
</p><p>Oscar Quelas, a farmer who doubled as an <em>arbularyo</em> and 
lived in Barangay Lagong, Bulan, Sorsogon, declared that RIZALINO became
 Oscar’s patient sometime in September 1993. On 11 and 12 September 
1993, Oscar treated RIZALINO for rheumatism, which immobilized the 
latter. The treatment was administered three times a day from 7:00 a.m. 
to 7:00 p.m. at RIZALINO’s house in Iraya, Zone 7, Bulan, Sorsogon. 
Since RIZALINO did not heal well, Oscar made crutches for RIZALINO a 
week after 12 September. Oscar still treated RIZALINO after 12 September
 1993, but could not remember the exact dates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
</p><p>Luzviminda Gregana, RIZALINO’s neighbor in Bulan, Sorsogon, 
averred that sometime during the last week of August 1993, and in 
September and November 1993, she would see RIZALINO either seated or on 
crutches outside his house. Although she would see him whenever she went
 to market, it was only in September 1993 when she saw him sick. 
According to Luzviminda, two “quack” doctors, one of them Oscar Quelas, 
treated RIZALINO every Saturday and Sunday of September 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> 
</p><p>Rebuttal witness Ma. Luz Goña claimed that she was a neighbor of 
RIZALINO in Comembo, Makati, and he mortgaged his house at Comembo to 
her on 14 September 1993, as security for a P10,000.00 loan. The 
transaction was reduced to writing, and on 14 September 1993, RIZALINO 
and Maria Fundano signed the document in front of Goña at 3123 Langka 
St., Comembo, Makati. Orlando Oseo, Antonio Oseo, Josie Castillo and 
Teofilo Maghanoy signed the document as witnesses. Goña had been in 
possession of the document since 1993. Goña further declared that she 
disbelieved RIZALINO’s claim that he was in Bicol during the entire 
month of September of 1993 as they discussed the mortgage on 12 
September 1993 and she gave the money to him on 14 September 1993, both 
in Comembo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
</p><p>Rebuttal witness Orlando Oseo, a neighbor and cousin of RIZALINO,
 testified that he had been seeing RIZALINO at Langka Street, Makati, 
during the entire month of September 1993. In fact, Orlando was even one
 of the witnesses to the mortgage document earlier mentioned. While he 
admitted that he and RIZALINO had a misunderstanding in 1978, which 
lasted for two months, they reconciled thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
</p><p>On surrebuttal, RIZALINO asserted that he signed the mortgage 
contract in his house in Sorsogon on 14 September 1993. MELODY’s mother,
 Maria Gerona, brought the document to Sorsogon as she knew he was sick.
 To explain the transaction, RIZALINO declared that Maria had asked 
P10,000.00 from him for the expenses of their eldest son who was to 
leave for abroad, but since he could not produce the money, Maria asked 
him to mortgage the house in Makati. After acceding to the request, 
Maria presented the document for his signature. There were no witnesses 
to the signing, and although he knew all the witnesses who signed the 
document, their signatures were not on the document when he signed it. 
Finally, RIZALINO claimed that the transaction was between Goña and 
Maria and that the document was brought to him only for his conformity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
</p><p>Surrebuttal witness Vida Joya presented herself in court as Vida 
Fundano, the current common-law wife of RIZALINO. She testified that on 
14 September 1993, Maria Gerona went to the Fundano residence in 
Sorsogon. Vida read the mortgage document and explained it to RIZALINO 
who could not read it because of his poor vision and his eyeglasses were
 not available then. Vida confirmed that the document was not signed by 
any witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> 
</p><p>In its decision of 26 February 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 the trial court found RIZALINO guilty of rape as charged in Criminal 
Cases Nos. 94-4887, 94-4888 and 94-4889, and taking into account “the 
alternative circumstance of relationship, which is aggravating in crimes
 against chastity such as rape,” sentenced him “to suffer the penalty of
 RECLUSION PERPETUA in each of the three (3) cases against him” and “to 
pay P50,000.00 as moral damages in each of these cases and P25,000.00 as
 exemplary damages in each case.”
</p><p>The court <em>a quo</em> found that the threat RIZALINO made 
against MELODY and her family was sufficient to produce a reasonable 
fear, thereby compelling her to submit to his bestial demands. Moreover,
 his moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter MELODY substituted
 for violence or intimidation. 
</p><p>The trial court gave full faith and credit to MELODY’s testimony 
who declared in court, “in a straight forward (sic) and categorical 
manner,” and exhibited no ulterior motive which “could have removed the 
sense of modesty and shame in a 15-year old girl and impelled her to 
concoct a story that would certainly bring ignominy, dishonor and 
humiliation to her and her family.” The RCT thus concluded:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>If she had not in fact been raped, [MELODY] could not have narrated
 the details of her horrifying experience to the NBI authorities, 
submitted herself to genital examination and signed a criminal complaint
 for rape against the accused. Certainly, it was only to vindicate her 
honor that gave her the courage to face the ordeal of a public trial in 
making a narration of rape perpetrated by her own father.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the trial court found unworthy of credence RIZALINO’s 
defense of alibi, which was belied by the witnesses for the prosecution,
 including his first cousin, Orlando Oseo.
</p><p>In this appeal, RIZALINO assigns this lone error:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING [HIM] FOR THREE COUNTS OF RAPE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In support thereof, he argues that, first, MELODY had a motive to 
fabricate charges against him as he abandoned MELODY’s family for 
another woman and failed to give them financial support. Second, if 
indeed MELODY was raped, and three times at that, it was highly 
improbable that no physical injuries on her genital area were detected. 
He thus doubted the expertise of the examining physician, Dr. Rolando 
Victoria, because it was unscientific for a doctor to opine that rape 
could have been committed without physical findings to support such 
opinion. Third, in disregarding his surrebuttal testimony, the trial 
court actually harbored doubts as to his guilt.
</p><p>In the Appellee’s Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General 
urges us to affirm the challenged judgment, reiterating the trial 
court’s assessment of the credibility of MELODY’s testimony, <em>i.e.</em>,
 that it would be unnatural for a young and innocent girl to concoct a 
story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and 
subject herself to public trial or ridicule, if she were not deeply 
moved by a sincere desire to apprehend and punish the culprit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
 Equally stressed by the Solicitor was MELODY’s coherence throughout her
 direct and cross-examination as she narrated three incidents of rape 
with clarity. The Solicitor likewise argued that the absence of hymenal 
and extra-genital injuries did not preclude a finding of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
 Indeed, Dr. Victoria explained that MELODY’s hymenal orifice was 
distensible and allowed penetration by an adult male organ without 
incurring injury. Lastly, the Solicitor contended that RIZALINO’s alibi,
 even after considering his surrebuttal testimony, could not overcome 
MELODY’s positive identification of RIZALINO, as well as the testimonies
 of Ma. Luz Goña and Orlando Oseo.
</p><p>This appeal is devoid of merit. 
</p><p>Critical to any rape prosecution is the complainant’s credibility, for that factor alone is sufficient to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 It is to be expected then that the defense will attempt to destroy the 
complainant’s trustworthiness. In this case, the defense labored to 
ascribe ill motive to MELODY in that she hated her father because he did
 not give her support and he cohabited with another woman. However, 
RIZALINO failed to prove these allegations with credible evidence. Thus 
does a sound and time-tested judicial dictum come to fore, that where 
there is no evidence and nothing to indicate that the principal witness 
for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is 
that she was not so actuated and her testimony is entitled to full faith
 and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> 
</p><p>Assuming, however, that MELODY indeed fostered rancor against 
RIZALINO, it is nonetheless inconceivable that she would subject herself
 to the trauma, inconvenience, distress, anxiety, humiliation, public 
scrutiny and loss of privacy, among other vexations, attendant a trial 
for rape, if only to vent her resentment of RIZALINO’s failure to give 
financial support or his cohabiting with a woman disagreeable to MELODY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
 In MELODY’s case, even before court proceedings began, she already 
exposed herself to revealing questions in executing her sworn statement,
 then to a physical examination in which she was told to undress and 
allow the intrusion of a 2.8-centimeter diameter tube into her most 
private organ, after which she further divulged her ordeal to her 
uncles. She later suffered three trial dates on the witness stand, 
enduring a most taxing cross-examination where defense counsel even 
insinuated that MELODY enjoyed sexual intercourse with her father. 
</p><p>RIZALINO’s claims of trumped-up charges are even more absurd 
when, as in this case, one considers that the complainant is the 
daughter of the accused; for then the disgrace is absorbed not only by 
complainant, but by her entire family as well, who would, it stands to 
reason, dissuade complainant from pursuing her cause unless it were 
true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Plainly, only a woman seeking justice with truth as her weapon could have braved this calvary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
</p><p>Anent the absence of hymenal and extra-genital injuries on 
MELODY, such does not persuade us. The examining physician explained 
that her hymen was distensible or elastic, hence could allow the 
penetration of an adult male organ in full erection without sustaining 
or incurring any injury. 
</p><p>RIZALINO, moreover, may not decry Dr. Victoria’s alleged lack of 
expertise. Before one may be allowed to testify as an expert witness, 
his qualifications must first be established by the party presenting 
him, i.e., he must be shown to possess the special skill or knowledge 
relevant to the question to which he is to express an opinion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 In Dr. Victoria’s case, the prosecution examined his past and present 
employment, his experience and duties as an NBI medico-legal officer, 
and the lectures and seminars he attended and conducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
 An expert witness may be impeached, or the weight of his opinion 
lessened, by introducing evidence or pointing out paradoxes in his 
testimony; and in the cross-examination of such a witness, great 
latitude is allowed the examining counsel to test the credibility of the
 expert for the guidance of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
 In the instant case, defense counsel’s lone remark was that “the 
prosecution has not established the qualification of” Dr. Victoria, 
which, by itself, did not impair the expertise already established by 
the prosecution. At any rate, neither the medical report nor the 
testimony of witnesses other than the complainant is indispensable when,
 as here, the complainant’s testimony is credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>
</p><p>All told, we are convinced, with moral certainty, that RIZALINO 
raped his daughter MELODY thrice as charged in Criminal Cases Nos. 
94-4887, 94-4888 and 94-4889 before the court below. 
</p><p>While the trial court made no reference to RIZALINO’s surrebuttal
 testimony, such did not indicate that the court a quo harbored doubts 
as to his guilt. On the contrary, this silence only meant that the trial
 court did not find the testimony credible or found nothing therein to 
alter the fact of his presence in Comembo on the questioned dates. More 
importantly, the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive 
identification by credible witnesses that the accused in this case was 
the perpetrator of the offenses charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
</p><p>The trial court correctly appreciated the alternative 
circumstance of relationship under Article 15 of the Revised Penal Code 
as an aggravating circumstance. It is settled that in the crimes of rape
 under Article 335 and acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the 
Revised Penal Code, relationship is aggravating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Parenthetically, it may be pointed out that under Section 11 of R.A. No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
 which amended Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the relationship 
of father-daughter in rape makes the imposition of the death penalty 
mandatory.
</p><p>The penalty for rape under the law in force then was <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, a single indivisible penalty, which should be applied regardless of the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Thus, the trial court correctly sentenced RIZALINO to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> for each act of rape. The rape victim then is entitled to civil indemnity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> set by jurisprudence at P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
 Since there were three counts of rape in this case, the trial court 
should have imposed P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for each count, yet it
 failed to fix any such amount. Nevertheless, said court condemned 
RIZALINO to pay the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count
 of rape, or a total of P150,000.00. While moral damages may be awarded 
the victim in a rape case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>
 in this instance, we reduce the amount to P25,000.00 in each case. 
Finally, exemplary damages may be adjudicated against an accused when 
the crime was attended by an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>
 Here, the trial court correctly awarded exemplary damages because of 
the presence of the aggravating circumstance of relationship. 
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the instant appeal is DISMISSED, and 
the challenged decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati 
City, Branch 150, in Criminal Cases Nos. 94-4887, 94-4888 and 94-4889 
finding accused-appellant RIZALINO FUNDANO guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt as principal of rape in each of said cases and sentencing him to 
suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> in each case is 
AFFIRMED, subject to the modifications reducing the moral damages to 
P25,000.00 in each case and, furthermore, ordering him to pay the 
victim, Melody Fundano, indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 in each of
 said cases. The rest of the appealed judgment stands. 
</p><p>Costs against accused-appellant RIZALINO FUNDANO.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
