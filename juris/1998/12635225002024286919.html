				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In resolving this appeal, the Court reiterates the following doctrines: (1) the factual findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies deserve great respect; (2) positive identification prevails over denial and alibi; (3) the testimony of a single witness, if positive and credible, is sufficient to support a conviction even in a charge for murder; and (4) where the killing was qualified by treachery, as alleged in the Information, and there were no other attendant aggravating circumstances, the crime committed was murder, and the proper penalty imposable is <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>On December 9, 1994, before the Regional Trial Court of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, an amended Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for murder was filed against Jimmy Laurente, Raymun[2] Rios, Rogelio Andres, Antonio Sumilata,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Bernardo Largo, Roberto Tugado<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and Rufo Advincula.

He came from Guimbang, Nueva Ecija. He [had been] in prison for murder for more than 5 years.<br><br>"He [was] a trustee inside the prison. He guard[ed] prisoners like himself.<br><br>"On June 20, 1994, at about 6:00 p.m., he was inside the compound of the quarters. He was still there at 8:00 p.m. These quarters [were] in the guard house. At 9:50 p.m. he was still within the quarters resting. With him were his co-trustees, namely Edwin Pascua, Moises Scablanca, Alexander de la Vega and their head, Zacarias Harola.<br><br>"There was no prison guard sleeping at the security guard house.<br><br>"Nothing happened at 10:00 that night. He slept until morning.<br><br>"These quarters [were] around 300 meters away from the hospital (TSN, Jan. 31, 1995, pp. 1-6).<br><br>"Under cross examination, he said he knew his co-accused Sumilata, Largo, Tugado, Advincula, Rios and Laurente. They [were] in fact, his close friends. (TSN, Jan. 31, 1995, pp. 6-7)<br><br>"Under re-cross examination, he said the guardhouse [was] enclosed with a fence. You cannot go outside without passing the gate of the fence. The hospital [was] outside the fence.<br><br>"The two accused who escaped were not staying in the guardhouse where he was sleeping. The two men [were] not trustees. (TSN, Jan. 31, 1995, pp. 7-9).<br><br>"Bernardo Largo testified that he [was] detained at the Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm and he was formerly a member of the CAFGU.<br><br>"He was convicted [of] the crime of parricide having killed his wife. He [had] been [in] the prison for more than one (1) year.<br><br>"He [was] an attendant at the hospital. His job [was] to follow the instructions of the doctor.<br><br>"On June 20, 1994, at around 9:00 p.m., he was inside the hospital watching television. With him were Gonzales and the victim Astrande. At around 9:50 p.m., Laurente and Rios arrived and suddenly stabbed Astrande. He (witness) was not able to move. Gonzales was just standing. Then [the] the two (2) assailants ran away.<br><br>"He and Winston Gonzales ran to the central gate. They asked help from the employees of the prison, Bong Catsuela and Sir Marlon. The duo went back to the hospital together with Winston.<br><br>"When he (witness) returned, an employee instructed him to fetch the doctor who was playing mahjong that night. He returned to the hospital together with Tabar.<br><br>"They helped carry the cadaver to the house where they washed it. Tugado was with him in washing the body.<br><br>"Then they were brought to the guard house. Tugado was still with him.<br><br>"He did [not] know about Andres. He knew him only by face. (TSN, February 1, 1995, pp. 1-6).<br><br>"Under cross examination, he said when Laurente and Rios stabbed the victim in front, his (witness) attention was focused on the tv.<br><br>"He denied that Laurente and Rios [were] his friends. These men were not employees or workers in the hospital.<br><br>"At the time of the incident, Tugado was in the medical ward because he was admitted as a patient together with Tabar.<br><br>"Laurente was the first one to stab the victim. He stabbed him many times. Rios hacked and stabbed the victim using a bolo. (TSN, February 1, 1995, pp. 6-10).<br><br>"Roberto Tugado testified that he [had been] detained at [the] Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm since 1991.<br><br>"On June 20, 1994, at around 9:00 p.m., he was sleeping in the medical ward of the prison where he was admitted.<br><br>"He stood up when he heard a ‘kalabugan’. He saw Laurente and Rios hacking and stabbing Domingo Astrande who was sitting next to the tv. He (witness) was inside the medical ward.<br><br>"Domingo Astrande was the guard on duty at the hospital.<br><br>"When he saw the incident, he was shocked and could not talk. He saw the two men [run] away.<br><br>"Then, he saw Gonzales and Largo going out of the hospital and he followed. They fetched an employee, Sir Marlon Oare, in the compound. Then, they returned to the hospital.<br><br>"The employees instructed Largo and Gonzales to fetch the doctor. When Dr. Barreto arrived, he told them to bring the cadaver of the victim to the house. There they washed and cleaned the body and changed his clothes. He was with Largo and Astrande’s wife.<br><br>"Then Mr. Gangat picked them up and they were brought to the guard house.<br><br>"The next morning, Andres was picked up also and brought to Brigade 4 (TSN, March 1, 1995, pp. 1-6).<br><br>"Under cross examination, he said that Bondying or Diada [was] the ‘aso-aso’ of the employees.

Olarte and on December 9, 1994, an amended Information was filed by the prosecution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>In finding appellants guilty of murder, the trial court explained:<br><blockquote>"As to the rest of the accused, they [deserve] to be convicted for their culpable part in the stabbing, hacking and killing of the victim, Domingo Astrande. The chief of the hospital at the Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm, Dr. Vicente Barreto, testified that around five (5) to six (6) sharp instruments were used in inflicting the 27 incised and [hack] wounds sustained by the deceased Domingo Astrande. Since there are only seven (7) accused in this case with the accused Rufo Advincula out of the picture, the testimony of the doctor would show that five (5) or six (6) persons helped each other in killing the victim. All accused were seen in the vicinity or scene of the crime by all prosecution witnesses except the widow of the victim and Dr. Barreto. All prosecution witnesses saw the actual participation of all accused except Rufo Advincula, who were around with knives and ‘balila’.<br><br>"The five (5) accused in this case: Laurente, Rios, Tugado, Largo, Simulata and Andres are all hardened criminals, serving and facing long sentences for conviction [for] either rape, murder, homicide, parricide and illegal possession of firearms. All the accused in this case, except for Rufo Advincula, are friends and close to each other and with their presence at the scene of the crime armed with knives and "balila" and their actual participation testified to by the prosecution witnesses, conspiracy among the accused could easily be deduced from their presence and actual participation in the commission of the crime. With thirteen (13) wounds on the back of the victim, it could easily be deduced that there was treachery in the commission of the crime which would elevate it to the crime of murder, a heinous crime, covered by the new law reimposing the death penalty. Also present [was] the aggravating circumstance of superior strength considering that six (6) persons helped each other in the commission of [the] crime of murder which could be absorbed by the qualifying circumstance of treachery."</blockquote>The trial court also debunked Sumilata’s assertion that he was maltreated to force him to confess his participation in the crime:<br><blockquote>"The defense allegation of accused Simulata that he was subjected to third degree or corporal punishment by prison guard does not hold water, because he could not show any medical certificate to that effect when easily, he could have subjected himself to medical examination at the prison and penal farm hospital. No doctor in the Sablayan Penal Colony Hospital testified that accused Simulata was treated for injuries he suffered in the hands of prison guards. The testimony of Winston Gonzales for and in behalf of accused Simulata does not, and could not help the latter because they are considered to be very close friends staying in the attendants’ quarters of the hospital for quite some time with Winston Gonzales reputed to be "gay". The testimony of Winston Gonzales could easily be considered as biased and slanted in favor of accused Simulata.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Assigned Errors</u></b></center><br>Appellants Andres, Largo and Tugado fault the trial court with the following:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>"The trial court erred in giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and disregarding the evidence for the defense.<br><br><center>II</center><br>"The trial court erred in finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder."</blockquote>Appellant Sumilata, on the other hand, advances the following contentions:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>"[T]he Honorable Presiding Judge erred in not giving due course to the fact that the appellants did not run away despite the opportunity to do so and especially if there was conspiracy.<br><br><center>II</center><br>"[T]he Honorable Presiding Judge erred in not giving credence to the testimony of Appellant Antonio Sumilata.<br><br><center>III</center><br>"[T]hat the Honorable Presiding Judge erred in not giving credence to the testimony of prosecution witnesses Nicomedes Tabar and Ante Fernando. Likewise, the defense testimony of Winston Gonzales.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>"[T]he Honorable Presiding Judge erred in not considering that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of accused Antonio Sumilata beyond reasonable doubt."</blockquote>The four appellants raise arguments revolving around essentially two points: <i>first,</i> the credibility of the witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution; and <i>second,</i> the characterization of the crime committed.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>The appeal is devoid of merit.<br><br><center><b><u>First Issue: Credibility of Witnesses and Sufficiency of Evidence</u></b></center><br>Countless times we have ruled that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to the highest respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the result of the case. This is because the trial court is in a better position to decide the question of credibility, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their behavior and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the present case, the Court finds no reason to disturb the factual findings and conclusion of the trial court.<br><br><b><u>Alleged Inconsistencies</u></b><br><br>Appellants Andres, Largo and Tugado argue in their Brief that the lower court erred in giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, even if the same were inconsistent in alleged "material points." <i>First,</i> Prosecution Witnesses Danilo dela Cruz and Herbert Diada identified all the appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, but Ante Fernando, another prosecution witness, implicated only Laurente and Rios. <i>Second,</i> Dela Cruz maintained that he alone noticed the stabbing incident, as the other inmates with him were asleep, but Diada and Pablo Cuden also claimed that they were awake at the time. <i>Third,</i> Dela Cruz declared that the door of the medical ward was padlocked, but Nicomedes Tabar asserted that it was open. <i>Fourth,</i> Tabar, in his sworn statement, pointed to Laurente and Rios as the malefactors, but he contradicted himself during the trial when he identified all the appellants as the culprits.<br><br>The arguments do not persuade. The alleged inconsistencies disclose no material discrepancies which destroy the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. <i>First,</i> the testimonies of Dela Cruz, Diada and Fernando may all be true -- Dela Cruz and Diada saw all the appellants participating in the crime, while Fernando witnessed only Laurente and Rios running away from the crime scene. It must also be noted that Fernando did not see the fracas that led to Astrande’s death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>Second,</i> that Dela Cruz failed to notice that the other inmates were also able to observe the stabbing incident does not necessarily taint his credibility. Apparent conflict in testimonies of eyewitnesses in describing an occurrence may be due to differences in observation and memory which do not necessarily imply falsehood on their part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Also, it has been held that the recollection of different witnesses with respect to time and place and other circumstances of a criminal event would naturally differ in various details.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Third, the alleged conflict between Tabar’s testimony and his sworn statement does not denigrate the credibility of the said witness. It has been held that "an affidavit taken ex parte is judicially considered to be almost incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from partial suggestions and sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for his accurate recollection of the subject."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In any event, a careful perusal of appellants’ arguments reveals that the alleged inconsistencies refer only to minor details<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>and not to the crux of the case -- that each of the appellants participated in the killing of Domingo Astrande. It bears emphasis that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses put the appellants at the scene of the crime. Moreover, the witnesses declared that appellants were not passive observers. Dela Cruz and Diada positively identified all of them as the perpetrators of the attack. Fernando also saw Andres, Largo and Tugado beside or near the dead body of Astrande. Tabar further declared that these three were among those who stabbed Astrande; and that Sumilata, who was holding a knife, was near Astrande’s body.<br><br>Granting <i>arguendo</i> that the testimonies of Diada and Tabar should not be given much weight, because the former was allegedly close<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the prison employees and the latter gave conflicting statements, such circumstances would not negate the fact that the appellants were positively identified by Danilo dela Cruz as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td width="91%"><div align="LEFT">"xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Will you tell us what incident happened on June 20, 1994?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> What incident happened?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">That night, I was awakened by the noise I heard and after that, I peeped [through] the window.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> When you peeped [through] the window of the hospital, what happened, if any.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> I saw Antonio Simulata striking Astrande.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> You said Simulata [struck] Astrande[;] where is Simulata now?

They were present at the crime scene, and they helped each other in attacking Astrande to death.<br><br><b><i><u>Evidence Against Sumilata</u></i></b><br><br>Appellant Sumilata contends that the lower court erred in not giving credence to the testimonies of Winston Gonzales and Prosecution Witnesses Ante Fernando and Nicomedes Tabar, which allegedly exculpated him from any wrongdoing. He avers that there was no reason for Gonzales, Fernando and Tabar to testify falsely in his behalf. As has been discussed, Fernando testified that he observed Laurente and Rios running away from the dead body of Astrande. Tabar, on the other hand, stated that he saw Sumilata holding a knife, but did not see him stab Astrande.<br><br>These contentions are not convincing. Sumilata’s identity as one of the killers of Astrande was sufficiently established by Danilo dela Cruz, who had witnessed the killing of Astrande. Nothing was shown to prove that dela Cruz was motivated by any ill motive or bias in giving his testimony, and the Court has held that "an affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony, especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Sumilata’s Denial and Alibi</u></i></b><br><br>Sumilata likewise avers that the court a quo was wrong in not giving credence to his denial and alibi -- he had claimed that he was already asleep at the attendants’ quarters when the commotion happened. To bolster his defense, he said that he was maltreated to force him to confess to the crime, but he remained steadfast in his denial.<br><br>His denial and alibi fail in light of the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses -- he was after all, only "ten arms’ length" away from the <i>locus criminis,</i> and it was therefore not physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. It is an oft quoted doctrine that positive identification prevails over denial and alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>While the maltreatment to which Sumilata was subjected, if true, must be condemned and addressed in the proper forum, his conviction was not based on any confession or admission illegally obtained. Hence, the alleged violation of his constitutional rights is immaterial to the disposition of this case. Allegations of impropriety during custodial investigation are relevant and material only to cases in which an extrajudicial admission or confession extracted from the accused is the basis of conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Other Circumstances</u></i></b><br><br>Appellant Sumilata further posits that the trial court should have considered certain circumstances:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>First,</i> unlike Laurente and Rios, the appellants did not escape despite their opportunity to do so. <i>Second,</i> he had no reason or motive to kill the victim, because he was about to finish serving his sentence. <i>Third,</i> the victim having been a prison guard, the testimonies of the other prisoners could have been tainted with ulterior consideration, force and intimidation.<br><br>These arguments do not persuade. That the appellants did not escape or flee from the crime scene does not conclusively show their innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In <i>People v. Layno,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court held that "there is no law or principle which guarantees that non-flight per se is proof, let alone conclusive proof, of one’s innocence and, as in the case of alibi, such a defense is unavailing when placed astride the undisputed fact that there is positive identification of the felon."<br><br>Equally unavailing is Sumilata’s contention that he had no motive in killing Astrande. Motive is not an element of murder. It has been held that proof of motive is not necessary where there is a clear and positive identification of the accused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Just as unacceptable is appellant’s imputation of improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses. Because the deceased was a prison guard, Sumilata contends that the prosecution witnesses, who were prisoners, had been induced to testify or coerced to do so. Other than appellant’s allegation, however, no proof was presented to substantiate this claim. In fact, the trial judge, who was able to observe the said witnesses during trial, gave credence to their testimonies. The self-serving allegations of Appellant Sumilata do not justify a modification of the trial judge’s assessment.<br><br>The foregoing considered, we find that the prosecution has proven the appellants’ guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b><i><u>Conspiracy</u></i></b><br><br>There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The existence of conspiracy may be inferred and proved through acts of the accused that point to a common purpose, a concert of action, and a community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> That there was a conspiracy in the killing of Astrande can be seen from the way the appellants attacked him, as testified to by Danilo dela Cruz, and as can be seen from the wounds the victim suffered. We have held that numerous wounds in the body of the victim indicate a plurality of assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b><i><u>Second Issue: Murder or Homicide?</u></i></b></center><br>Appellants Andres, Largo and Tugado assert that, even assuming that they had indeed killed Astrande, they can only be found guilty of homicide, not murder, because treachery was not conclusively proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> They maintain that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses did not even reveal how the attack began.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The crime committed was murder, not homicide. The trial court correctly held that treachery, which was alleged in the Information, qualified the killing of Domingo Astrande. The essence of treachery is a sudden and unexpected attack without the slightest provocation on the part of the person attacked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> There is treachery where the attack on the unarmed victim was sudden, unexpected, with neither warning nor provocation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> as in the present case.<br><br>The evidence shows that Domingo Astrande was lying on the bench, watching television, when the appellants suddenly ganged up on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Even when the victim was already pleading for his life and trying to break free, the appellants continued their assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Granting <i>arguendo</i> that no evidence was presented to show the start of the attack, the fact that appellants continued to stab Astrande, even when he was already pleading for his life, sufficiently proves the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> That Astrande was overwhelmed by the attack can be gleaned from the fact that he suffered multiple stab wounds -- twenty-seven in all -- as confirmed by Dr. Barreto, the medicolegal officer who autopsied the body of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Abuse of superior strength, not having been alleged in the Information, can be considered merely as a generic aggravating circumstance. The lower court, however, correctly stated that this was deemed absorbed by treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Murder is punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659. Because the killing of Domingo Astrande, although qualified by treachery, was not attended by any other aggravating circumstance, the proper imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> not "<i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death" as imposed by the trial court.<br><center><b><i><u>Damages</u></i></b></center><br>The Court affirms the award of P50,000 as indemnity for the death of Domingo Astrande. However, the award of P70,000 as actual damages must be reduced, as the duly documented receipts add up to only P32,000. It is a rule that an alleged pecuniary loss must be established by credible evidence before actual damages may be awarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is DENIED. The assailed Decision is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that Appellants Rogelio Andres, Bernardo Largo, Roberto Tugado and Antonio Sumilata are sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua.</i> The award of actual damages is hereby reduced to P32,000.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr. (Chairman), Bellosillo, Vitug, and Quisumbing, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> This amended Information, signed by Provincial Prosecutor Gorgonio D.
