IS DULY NOTARIZED IN SO FAR AS THE VENDORS AND VENDEES ARE CONCERNED AND THAT, FURTHERMORE, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE VALIDITY OF THE PETITIONERS’ DOCUMENTS, WHICH WERE ALL DULY EXECUTED.</blockquote>The petitioners, spouses Sonya Mathay and Ismael Mathay, Jr., claim to be buyers in good faith, reasoning out that TCT No. T-111070, the derivative title of their TCT No. T-113047, appeared to be free from any encumbrance. They argue that a person dealing on a registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the covering certificate of title and is not required to go beyond the certificate of title to determine the condition of the property.<br><br>A purchaser in good faith and for value is defined as "one who buys property of another, without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays a full and fair price for the same at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claims or interest of some other person in the property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As a rule, he who asserts the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value, has the burden of proving such assertion. This onus probandi cannot be discharged by mere invocation of the legal presumption of good faith, i.e., that everyone is presumed to act in good faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioners cannot be categorized as purchasers in good faith. Prior to the fencing of subject land, neither they (Mathays) nor their predecessors-in-interest (Banayo and Pugay) ever possessed the same. In fact, at the time the said property was sold to petitioners, the private respondents were not only in actual possession of the same but also built their houses thereon, cultivated it and were in full enjoyment of the produce and fruits gathered therefrom. Although it is a recognized principle that a person dealing on a registered land need not go beyond its certificate of title, it is also a firmly settled rule that where there are circumstances which would put a party on guard and prompt him to investigate or inspect the property being sold to him, such as the presence of occupants/tenants thereon, it is, of course, expected from the purchaser of a valued piece of land to inquire first into the status or nature of possession of the occupants, i.e., whether or not the occupants possess the land en concepto de dueño, in concept of owner. As is the common practice in the real estate industry, an ocular inspection of the premises involved is a safeguard a cautious and prudent purchaser usually takes. Should he find out that the land he intends to buy is occupied by anybody else other than the seller who, as in this case, is not in actual possession, it would then be incumbent upon the purchaser to verify the extent of the occupant’s possessory rights. The failure of a prospective buyer to take such precautionary steps would mean negligence on his part and would thereby preclude him from claiming or invoking the rights of a "purchaser in good faith."<br><br>So also, before the fence around subject property was erected, private respondents communicated their objection to the fencing of the area by petitioners but they were ignored by the petitioners, who continued enclosing the premises under controversy in the presence of armed men employed by them (<i>petitioners</i>).<br><br>Consequently, not being "innocent purchasers for value," within legal contemplation, petitioners’s reliance on Article 1544 of the New Civil Code is misplaced. Such stance of theirs lacks legal and factual basis. The fundamental premise of preferential rights under the law is <i>good faith.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Viewed in proper perspective, we uphold the finding by the Court of Appeals that the petitioners cannot invoke Art. 1544 of the Civil Code in view of the questionable documents from which their title emanated. As the Court of Appeals ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>"We think the applicable rule as stated in Baltazar v. Court of Appeals, No. L-78728, December 8, 1988, 168 SCRA 334, is that as between two persons both of whom are in good faith and both innocent of any negligence, the law must protect and prefer the lawful holder of registered title over the transferee of a vendor bereft of any transmissible rights. Under the foregoing principle derived from the above case law, the Mathays have no rights as against plaintiffs-appellants, their recourse is against their vendors Banayo and Pugay."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote>The aforesaid ruling of the Court of Appeals accords with the Latin maxim: <i>nemo potest plus juris ad alium transferre quam ipse habet.</i> "No one can transfer a greater right to another than he himself has". Thus, in Calalang vs. Register of Deeds of Quezon City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> this Court held :<br><blockquote>"Needless to state, all subsequent certificates of title including petitioner’s titles are void because of the legal truism that <b>the spring cannot rise higher than its source.</b> The law must protect and prefer the lawful owner of registered title over the transferee of a vendor bereft of any transmissible rights."</blockquote>In sum, "defective titles cannot be upheld against the unblemished titles of the private respondents."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further submit that requiring them to inquire beyond the face of the torrens title defeats the primordial objective of the torrens system, which is that a person dealing on registered land has the right to rely on the torrens title.<br><br>But "a certificate is not conclusive evidence of title if it is shown that the same land had already been registered and an earlier certificate for the same is in existence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In the case at bar, as borne out by pertinent records, the private respondents obtained their rights and title from TCT No. T-85866, which was registered on August 9, 1976 under the name of Heirs of Onofre Batallones and Patronillo Quimio. On the part of petitioners, their supposed title originated from a spurious title of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay illegally registered on February 28, 1980.<br><br>So also, where two <i>transfer</i> certificates of title have been issued on different dates, to two different persons, for the same parcel of land, even if both are presumed to be title holders in good faith, it does not necessarily follow that he who holds the earlier title should prevail. On the assumption that there was regularity in the registration leading to the eventual issuance of subject transfer certificates of title, the better approach is to trace the <i>original</i> certificates from which the certificates of title in dispute were derived. Should there be only one common original certificate of title, as in this case under consideration, the transfer certificate issued on an earlier date along the line must prevail, absent any anomaly or irregularity tainting the process of registration.<br><br>In light of the attendant facts and circumstances, there is therefore a need to refer to the background or history of the land under controversy. As conceded by petitioners, their TCT No. T-113047 was derived from TCT No. 111070 under the names of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay. Hence, the necessity of looking into and determining the legitimacy of the title of the two, Banayo and Pugay.<br><br>In an effort to support their claim of ownership over subject Lot 2186, Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay presented two theories. First, they theorize that on October 17, 1970, under Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 3397,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Tomas Lucido assigned and transferred to them all his interests in the contested land. Their second theory is that subject real property was sold to them by then Director of Lands Ramon N. Casanova, under Deed No. V-12918 and Sales Certificate No. 2454.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>After a careful examination of germane records, however, we are of the conclusion, and so find, that the aforestated theories of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay are without any factual and legal basis.<br><br>The assignment of Sales Certificate No. 3397 allegedly executed by Tomas Lucido in favor of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay was not signed by the said Tomas Lucido. Neither does it bear the signature of the latter. Worse, the same Tomas Lucido testified on the witness stand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> that he does not know Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay, and he never received P50,000.00 from them. What is more, Tomas Lucido reiterated that he really sold the land in question to the herein private respondents, spouses Teodulfo Atangan and Sylvia Atangan, the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. TM - 175, as shown by the two Deeds of Sale <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>he executed in favor of the said spouses, Teodulfo Atangan and Sylvia Atangan.<br><br>To reinforce their aforesaid second theory, Banayo and Pugay declared that, for and in consideration of Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty Eight (P8,958.00) Pesos, former Director of Lands Ramon Casanova issued Deed No. V-12918 with Sales Certificate No. 2454, which Deed was the basis of the issuance to them of TCT No. T-111070 by the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite.<br><br>But Mr. Marcelino Freiras, Chief of Reservation and Special Land Grant Section of the Bureau of Lands, stressed that the signature of former Lands Director Ramon Casanova on the said Deed No. V-12918 with Sales Certificate No. 2454, was forged. According to him (Freiras), having worked with him for the past thirty (30) years, he is familiar with the signature of Director Casanova.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Then, too, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> addressed to Atty. Franco Loyola, counsel for private respondents, the same Mr. Freiras informed that, as indicated by the entries in the Deed of Conveyance Book,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Deed V-12918 was issued on October 10, 1979, for Lot No. 18, Block 16, Tala Estate, Caloocan City, in the name of one Zaida C. Calado, and not for the subject land, identified as Lot 2186 of Sta. Cruz de Malabon Estate, Cavite City, originally registered under the names of the Heirs of Onofre Batallones and Patronillo Quimio. In another letter <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>sent in answer to the query of Juana Motas, one of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. TM-180, Alicia V. Dayrit, Office Caretaker of Land Management Division of the Bureau of Lands, corroborated what Mr. Freiras disclosed, as aforementioned. In her said letter, Alicia V. Dayrit revealed to Mrs. Motas that there is really no record of any Deed No. V-12918 issued for Lot 2186 of Sta. Cruz de Malabon Estate, Cavite City, in favor of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay, and that what appears in the Registry Book of Deeds of Conveyance is Deed of Conveyance No. V-11692 issued on July 1, 1976 in favor of Onofre Batallones and Norberto Quimio by the then Secretary of Natural Resources, which Deed pertains to Lot 2186 of Sta. Cruz de Malabon Estate. The aforesaid revelations were corroborated in open court by witness Freiras.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Further, the Court detected discrepancies in the entries of the documents above mentioned. Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay contended that by virtue of Sales Certificate No. 2454, the then Director of Lands Ramon Casanova issued Deed V-12918, on February 18, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> However, after a meticulous examination of the evidence on record, the Court noticed that former Director Ramon Casanova issued another Deed V-12918 but, bearing Sales Certificate No. 3397 and dated February 19, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> It should be remembered that Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay declared that the issuance of TCT No. T-111070 in their favor was based on the said two documents, both bearing the signature of Director Casanova.<br><br>The foregoing observations jibe with the revelation of Freiras that the alleged signatures of former Lands Director Ramon Casanova appearing on the said documents in question were forged. Also strengthened thereby is the testimony of Mrs. Adelwisa O. Ong, former Record Officer and now Acting Administrative Officer of the Bureau of Lands in Cavite, that subject land was patented under Deed No. V-11692, registered under the name of the Heirs of Onofre Batallones and Norberto Quimio, and the name of Tomas Lucido was mentioned in the Old Sales Register Book as he was the approved vendee of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Besides, it is too evident to be overlooked that the number of the Sales Certificate of the second Deed V-12918 (<i>bearing Sales Certificate No. 3397</i>) is the same number of the Sales Certificate appearing in the Assignment of Sale allegedly executed by Tomas Lucido in favor of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay. This fact alone, which this Court cannot ignore, is fatal to the cause of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay.<br><br>Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>by Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay in favor of the spouses Sonya Mathay and Ismael Mathay, Jr. beclouded the issuance of TCT No. 113047.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Records disclose that the said Deed of Absolute Sale did not comply with legal formalities and was not duly notarized. Atty. Mapalad Santera, who signed the document as Notary Public, had no commission as Notary Public for the Province of Cavite, at the time subject document was supposedly notarized,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and the residence certificates of vendors Banayo and Pugay appeared to be of dubious source.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>To bolster their submission that their title is genuine and authentic, private respondents introduced several documentary evidence. They also presented officials concerned and the caretakers of the said documents, who all testified for the private respondents.<br><br>On the other hand, the petitioners, spouses Sonya Mathay and Ismael Mathay, Jr., who claim to be buyers in good faith, utterly failed to discharge the burden of proving the sustainability of their posture. Worse for them, as above discussed, the title of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay relied upon by petitioners has been shown by preponderance of evidence to be the product of forgery.<br><br>All things studiedly considered, we are of the irresistible conclusion that the respondent Court of Appeals did not err in reversing the appealed decision of the trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petiton is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit, and the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CV No. 37902 <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto.</i> No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Romero, and Kapunan JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman),</i> no part: Close personal relation to a party.<br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 34-80.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Fourth Division, composed of Associate Justices Corona Ibay-Somera (ponente), Nathanael O.
