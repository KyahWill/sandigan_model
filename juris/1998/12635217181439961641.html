<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In Civil Case
No. D-8835 of the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan City, plaintiff Pacita Viray,
petitioner herein, entered into a compromise agreement with defendant spouses
Hilarion and Gliceria Pinlac whereby the spouses bound themselves to pay their
indebtedness to the former amounting to <s>P</s>160,000.00 in eighty (80) equal
monthly installments of <s>P</s>2,000.00 each, subject to the condition
that  failure  to   pay  two (2) installments would render the
outstanding amount due and payable.  The
agreement was approved by the trial court.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Meanwhile, a
parcel of land owned by the Pinlac spouses and mortgaged  with the Social Security System (SSS) was
sold at public auction after the same was foreclosed for non-payment of
amortizations.  On 14 April 1989 the
spouses redeemed the property and sold it a few days later to private
respondent Johnson Chua. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 4 May 1989,
for failure of the Pinlac spouses to pay two (2) installments as stipulated in
the compromise agreement, petitioner Pacita Viray filed with the trial court a
motion for the issuance of a writ of execution.  Alleging that the Pinlac spouses had paid her only <s>P</s>2,500.00  and then failed to pay the succeeding
installments,  petitioner demanded
execution in the amount of <s>P</s>57,500.00 as unpaid balance thereunder.  On 5 May 1989 the motion was granted, and on
22 May 1989 a writ of execution was issued by the Clerk of Court for the amount
of <s>P</s>57,500.00 as prayed for.  Three (3) days later the Deputy Sheriff annotated the notice of levy on
the transfer certificate of title covering the parcel of land in the name still
of the Pinlac spouses but which had been sold earlier to respondent Chua.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In a letter
dated 9 June 1989 to the Clerk of Court, Atty. Alicia Bravo-Fabia, petitioner
Viray requested that the writ of execution  issued on 22 May l989  be
amended  by changing the amount to be
satisfied.  She explained that in her
motion for issuance of the writ the entire  amount  due  her  was  erroneously  stated as <s>P</s>57,500.00 when in fact the
correct amount due was <s>P</s>157,500.00, or a difference<b> </b>of <s>P</s>100,000.00.  On 13 June 1989, acting on Viray's letter,
the Clerk of Court  without a prior
order from the court granted the request and issued an amended writ increasing
the amount to be collected from <s>P</s>57,500.00 to <s>P</s>157,500.00.  On the same day respondent Chua registered
with the Registry of Deeds the deeds of redemption and sale executed in his
favor by the Pinlac spouses.  Accordingly,
at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, a new title was issued in his
name.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The new title
contained Entry No. 135748/T-37005 referring to  the notice of levy.  The
entry however did not specify  the
amount to be levied.  Upon verification
from the Sheriff's notice of levy that the amount due was <s>P</s>57,500.00,
and after consulting a lawyer upon advice of a sister, respondent Chua tendered
the amount to Clerk of Court Fabia.  The
tender was however rejected by the Clerk of Court who informed Chua that the
amount was insufficient as the writ and the notice of levy had already been
amended to reflect the correct amount of  <s>P</s>157,000.00.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Subsequently, a
notice of sale at public auction dated 20 June 1989 based on the amended writ
was published and the sale set on 24 July 1989.  On the day of the auction, respondent Chua filed a complaint for
injunction with prayer for a restraining order.  The auction sale nevertheless proceeded with petitioner Viray as
the highest bidder.  A certificate of sale
in her favor was correspondingly issued by the Sheriff.  Because of this turn of events, Chua
amended his complaint by adding to his causes of action a declaration of
nullity of sale plus damages.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">During the trial
of the case, respondent Chua consigned the amount of <s>P</s>57,500.00 which
was approved by the trial court.  Accordingly,  the amount was
deposited with the Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC), Dagupan City
Branch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 11 July 1990
the trial court rendered judgment in favor of respondent Chua declaring null
and void the amended writ of execution dated 13 June 1989, the notice of sale
at public auction dated 20 June 1989 and the sheriff's certificate of sale
dated 24 July 1989.  The court also
directed the Register of Deeds of Dagupan City to  cancel the registration of the notice of levy and the sheriff's
certificate of sale  and ordered FEBTC
to pay to petitioner Viray the consigned amount of <s>P</s>57,500.00 even as it
dismissed her counterclaim.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> It also ruled that in the absence
of a court order, the Clerk of Court had no authority whatsoever to amend the
writ of execution.  This obtaining,
respondent Chua's obligation was deemed discharged upon his consignation of <s>P</s>57,000.00
pursuant to the writ of execution originally issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 29 March 1995
respondent Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling with the
additional finding that the deed of sale between the Pinlac  spouses and respondent Chua was not
simulated.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

not show that at the time of its execution Chua knew of the case between
petitioner and the Pinlac spouses nor was he aware of any lien on the property,
except the mortgage  in  favor  of the SSS, as to impute bad faith to him.  On 7 June 1995 the appellate court denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner
maintains that (1) respondent Chua had knowledge of the actual amount to be
executed before he registered the deeds of redemption and  sale; (2) Chua was a buyer in bad faith;
and, (3) the Clerk of Court had the authority to amend a purely clerical error
in the writ of execution.  She
postulates that respondent Chua is charged with the duty of ascertaining the
actual amount to be executed since the notice of levy annotated in the TCT
mentions Civil Case No. D-8835 as the source of the obligation of the Pinlac
spouses.  The fact that  Chua did not refer to the records of the
case which show that the property was being levied for <s>P</s>157,500.00 is an
eloquent manifestation of  his bad
faith.  This, she adds, is not enhanced
any by the fact that prior to the registration of the deeds of redemption and
sale she had already informed Chua that the balance of the spouses' obligation
with her was <s>P</s>157,500.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The Court is
unpersuaded by these ratiocinations.  Respondent Chua was not mandated to dig deep into the records of Civil
Case No. D-8835 to ascertain the amount  subject of the notice of levy, for he had every right to rely on the
amount stated in the notice itself, i.e., <s>P</s>57,500.00.  Assuming that petitioner had informed him of
the correct outstanding balance of the Pinlac spouses, this happenstance did
not in any way overrule the amount stated in the notice of levy precisely
because it was this amount ordered by the Clerk of Court for levy as directed
by the trial court which approved petitioner's motion for execution.  We have ruled many times over that a
purchaser is not  required to explore
beyond what the record in the Registry indicates on its face, in quest of any
hidden defect or inchoate right which may subsequently defeat his right
thereto.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner
insists that respondent Chua was a buyer in bad faith and the sale was
simulated because even after the purported sale he allowed the vendor spouses
to continue occupying the subject property without paying any rental while he
himself lived in a rented apartment.  This reasoning may otherwise be persuasive but we agree with the
observation of respondent appellate court thus -<b> <o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

uncontroverted that at the time the deed of sale was executed, the title to the
property was in the possession of the Social Security System.  The appellee knew that he cannot (sic)
possibly register the deed of sale and acquire a new title in his name without
presenting at the same time the owner's copy of the title.  It was only on June 3, 1989 that he

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner
finally submits that when the discrepancy between the judgment and the writ of

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Before resolving
this issue, there is need to reiterate some basic principles.  In <i>Hidalgo v. Crossfield</i></span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> the Court distinguished between the
issuance of an execution and the awarding of an execution  -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The issuing of an execution is a
ministerial act, and must be carefully distinguished from the awarding of
an  execution,  which  is  a judicial act.  'To award is to adjudge, to give anything by judicial
sentence,'  and when it is said that a
party is awarded an execution upon a judgment it should be understood thereby
that it is judicially declared that the party has a right to have the judgment
executed x x x x The right of a party to have an execution having been duly
adjudged, the mere issuing of the writ when the time for its issuance as
prescribed by law has arrived; that is to say, the preparation and delivery of
the formal writ  or order to the
sheriff, or other officer charged with the execution of judgments, directing
him to proceed with the execution is a mere compliance with the provisions of
the award of judgment, and the essentially a purely ministerial act.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In other words,
the function of ordering the execution of a judgment, being judicial, devolves
upon the judge whereas the act of issuing the writ of execution, being
ministerial, can be performed by another person, <i>viz,</i>  the clerk of court.  As the rule now stands the clerk of court
may, under the direction of the court or judge, make out and sign all writs and
processes issuing from the court.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We may recall
that petitioner moved for and was granted the execution amount of <s>P</s>57,500.00.  The order of the trial court granting the
motion was the foundation of the writ and bestowed vitality to it.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The order as worded is
unambiguous.  The court simply granted
the motion for a writ of execution after it was found to be in order.  Under the premises it is imperative that
before the Clerk of Court can amend the writ itself, the order of the court
granting its issuance should first be amended.  For the order granted what was prayed for by petitioner in her motion,
i.e., that a "writ of execution be issued for the sum of FIFTY SEVEN
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED (<s>P</s>57,500.00) PESOS representing defendants' unpaid
balance."  No one then but  the  court can amend what was granted, and its Clerk of Court has  no  other  duty  but to issue the writ in accordance with the grant.  It is settled  principle that a writ of execution should conform strictly with
the very essential particulars of the promulgated judgment</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

order granting execution of a judgment based on a compromise agreement.  In <i>Pacific Mills v. NLRC</i></span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

12.0pt;font-family:Arial">the court expressed in no uncertain terms that only
the judge is vested with authority to amend such order.  There was no such amendment of the order in the
case at bar which would provide a solid basis for the alteration of the
writ.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Verily, it was
petitioner's fault if not negligence which generated the present
controversy.  Her motion prayed for a
lesser amount giving rise to the logical conclusion that the Pinlac spouses
had, in the meantime, paid part of the judgment amount and that the prayer of
petitioner was only for the unpaid remainder.  Thus if anyone is to be blamed for the resultant aberration, it is petitioner
herself who compounded her woes by simply sending a letter to the Clerk of
Court requesting amendment of the writ of execution rather than directing the
matter to the attention of the judge by way of a motion for amendment of his
order and the writ.  Consequently, the
amended writ for <s>P</s>157,500.00 is void on two (2) grounds:  <i>first,</i>  it went beyond the order granting execution for <s>P</s>57,500.00;
and <i>second,</i>  the Clerk of Court
was not clothed with authority to issue the amended writ.  While an officer of the court, a public
officer and an "officer of the law," the Clerk of Court is not a
judicial officer.  Neither is the  position synonymous  with  the  court.  The  office  is  essentially  a  ministerial one.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> By amending the writ of execution
on her own  will,  the  Clerk of Court clearly usurped a judicial function.  She should have instead asked cousel for
Pacita Viray in the court below to file a motion for the issuance of an amended
writ.  Only then, when the motion to
amend the writ is granted, can she validly amend the writ and thus avoid
causing prejudice to the public she is bound to serve.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
