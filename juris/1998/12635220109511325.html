Sangguniang Bayan had not appropriated funds for the purpose. (Tsn, pp. 18, 30,
42-43, Aug. 10, 1994).  Nonetheless,
petitioner included Mrs. Fuertes’ name in the regular annual budget beginning

dispute.  With respect to her other
claims for past services in other offices, Municipal Treasurer, Mrs. Narcisa
Caber, informed that a supplemental budget for such purpose to be passed by the
Sangguniang Bayan was necessary before she could be paid thereof.  Being the municipal treasurer, Mrs. Caber
knew that without such supplemental budget, payment of Mrs. Fuertes’ other
claims could not be made because the law requires that ‘disbursements shall be
made in accordance with the ordinance authorizing the annual or supplemental
appropriations’ (Sec. 346, RA 7160) and that ‘no money shall be disbursed

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Respondent Court
held that the delay or withholding of complainant’s salaries and emoluments was
unreasonable and caused complainant undue injury.  Being then the sole breadwinner in their family, the withholding
of her salaries caused her difficulties in meeting her family’s financial
obligations like paying for the tuition fees of her four children.  Petitioner’s defense that complainant failed
to attach the required money and property clearance to her vouchers was held to
be an afterthought that was brought about, in the first place, by his own
failure to issue any memorandum requiring its submission.  That the voucher form listed the clearance
as one of the requirements for its approval had neither been brought to
complainant’s attention, nor raised by petitioner as defense in his
answer.  In any event, the payment of
complainant’s salary from January to November 1991, confirmed by the sheriff’s
return, showed that the clearance was not an indispensable requirement, because
petitioner could have acted upon or approved the disbursement even without
it.  The alleged lack of a supplemental
budget was also rejected, because it was petitioner’s duty as municipal mayor
to prepare and submit the “executive and supplemental budgets” under Sections
318, 320, and 444 (3)(ii) of the Local Government Code,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></b></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> and the complainant’s claims as
assistant municipal treasurer, a permanent position included in the plantilla
for calendar year 1990 and 1991, were classified as “current operating
expenditures” for the same calendar years, which were chargeable against the
general funds of the town of Sindangan.  Except for the representation and transportation allowance, Fuertes’
claims for thirteenth month pay, cash gift and clothing allowance were already
covered by Supplemental Budget No. 5 for calendar year 1990.  Petitioner’s contention that funds covering
complainant’s claims were made available only in December 1992 was
unbelievable, considering that an ordinance enacting a supplemental budget
takes effect upon its approval or on the date fixed therein under Sec. 320 of
the Local Government Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
Sandiganbayan also ruled that the petitioner’s evident bad faith was the direct
and proximate cause of Fuertes’ undue injury.  Complainant’s salaries and allowances were withheld for no valid or
justifiable reasons.  Such delay was
intended to harass complainant, because petitioner wanted to replace her with
his political protege whom he eventually designated as municipal treasurer,
bypassing Fuertes who was next in seniority.  Bad faith was further evidenced by petitioner’s instructions to the
outgoing municipal treasurer not to give the complaining witness any work
assignment, not to provide her with office table and chair, not to act on her
daily time record and application for leave of absence, instructions which were
confirmed in the municipal treasurer’s certification. (Exh. G-2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nonpayment.  The fact that the “injury”

may be true that a clearance is an indispensable requirement before complainant

the clearance requirement in order to exculpate himself from liability.  As the approving officer, it was his duty to
direct complainant to submit the same.  Moreover, accused could not just set aside the obligation he voluntarily
imposed upon himself when he entered into a compromise agreement binding
himself to sign complainant’s vouchers without any qualification as to the
clearance requirement.  Perforce, he
could have seen to it that complainant secured the same in order that he could

on the Sangguniang Bayan, Budget Officer and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, is
unavailing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family:Arial">As revealed in the alleged newly
discovered evidence themselves, particularly x x x SB Res. No. 202 and
Appropriation Ordinance No. 035, both dated May 21, 1990 (Exh. ‘5-a’- Motion),
the Sangguniang Bayan appropriated a budget of <s>P</s>5M in the General Fund
for calendar year 1991 [the Budget Officer does not approve the budget but
assists the Municipal Mayor and the Sangguniang Bayan in the preparation of the
budget (Sec. 475, Local Government Code of 1991)].  Complainant’s claims consisted of her salaries and other benefits
for 1990 and 1991 which were classified as Current Operating Expenditures
chargeable against the General Fund.  It
is undisputed that she was holding her position as Assistant Municipal
Treasurer in a permanent capacity (her position was also designated Assistant
Department Head), which was included in the plantilla for calender years 1990
and 1991 (Exhs. ‘4-a’ &amp; '4-b', Motion).  In Program Appropriation and Obligation by Object (Exhs. ‘4-c’ &amp;
‘4-c’, Motion), appropriations were made for current operating expenditures to
which complainant’s claims properly appertained.  xxx.  Verily,
complainant’s claims were covered by appropriations duly approved by the
officials concerned, signifying that adequate funds were available for the
purpose.  In fact, even complainant’s
claims for her 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, cash gift and clothing allowance,
subject matter of Disbursement Voucher marked Exhibit ‘J’ which would need a
supplemental budget was covered by ‘Supplemental Budget No. 5 for CY 1990 duly
approved by the authorities concerned’ as shown in the voucher itself.  This means that the said claim was already
obligated (funds were already reserved for it) as of calendar year 1990.
xxxx.  It is clear, then, that as
regards availability of funds, there was no obstacle for the release of all the
complainant’s claims.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The Court
disagrees.  Respondent Court cannot
shift the blame on the petitioner, when it was the complainant who failed to
submit the required clearance.  This
requirement, which the complainant disregarded, was even printed at the back of
the very vouchers sought to be approved.  As assistant municipal treasurer, she ought to know that this is a
condition for the payment of her claims.  This clearance is required by Article 443 of the Implementing Rules and
Regulations of the Local Government Code of 1991:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“Art. 443.  <i>Property Clearances</i> – When an
employee transfers to another government office, retires, resigns, is
dismissed, or is separated from the service, he shall be required to secure
supplies or property clearance from the supply officer concerned, the
provincial or city general services officer concerned, the municipal mayor and
the municipal treasurer, or the punong barangay and the barangay treasurer, as
the case may be.  The local chief
executive shall prescribe the property clearance form for this purpose.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">For her own
failure to submit the required clearance, complainant is not entirely blameless
for the delay in the approval of her claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Also, given the
lack of corresponding appropriation ordinance and certification of availability
of funds for such purpose, petitioner had the duty not to sign the
vouchers.  As chief executive of the
municipality Llorente could not have approved the voucher for the payment of
complainant’s salaries under Sec. 344, Local Government Code of 1991.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></b></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Also, Appropriation Ordinance No.
