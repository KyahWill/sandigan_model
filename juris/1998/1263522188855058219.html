				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review filed by petitioners from the 
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA GR SP No. 31130 dated September 
30, l993<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which affirmed the
 decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 39, Manila, in Civil Cases
 No. 92-62298 to 92-62301 dated May 7, l993, the dispositive portion of 
which reads, to wit:
<blockquote>
  <p>“WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered reversing the decision of 
the Metropolitan Trial Court in the (four) instant appealed cases. 
Accordingly, the defendants are hereby ordered to vacate their 
respective occupations in the lot in question, and for them to surrender
 the same to the plaintiffs. </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The antecedent facts as found by the respondent court, are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Plaintiff Honorio L. Carreon and his wife Remedios Beloria-Carreon
 (now deceased) were formerly lessees since l964 of the 60 square meters
 of the lot in question and which is included in the Gabriel Estate 
located at what is formerly known as Anak Bayan, Manila as evidenced by a
 contract of lease (Annex A-1 to the position paper of the plaintiffs, 
pp. 93-94, rec.) executed on October 20, 1964 by the Philippine Trust 
Co., a banking institution as trustee of the spouses Dr. and Mrs. 
Francisco Gabriel, who apparently were the former registered owners of 
the estate. The Carreon spouses had a house in this leased premises but 
the area of their occupation had become bigger when they bought the 
two-storey house of their neighbor, Tiburcio Ocampo which was 
constructed or standing on the adjacent portion of their leased lot. 
This sale of the house by the vendor had given the Carreon spouses 
whatever rights the former may have acquired as occupant of the property
 pending the decision on the Gabriel estate for the subdivision of the 
land (of. Deed of Absolute Sale marked as Annex A-2, p. 118, rec. ). 
With the sale of the house and acquisition of the rights to the property
 wherein it stood, the house of the Carreons and with the newly acquired
 house had become joint as one and was known thereafter as 1220 Mataas 
na Lupa, Malate, Manila. After the sale, the lot earlier leased to them 
and the lot adjacent thereto where the house of Tiburcio Ocampo was 
erected had an aggregate area of 99.50 square meters. In the meanwhile, 
the Carreon spouses as occupants or tenants of the Gabriel Estate had 
become members of the Mataas na Lupa Tenants Association, Inc. as shown 
by their Certification of Membership marked as Annex “B” to the 
complaint (p. 8, Record). </p>
  <p>All the 4 defendants herein, Virginia Carreon, Wilson Aguilar, 
Myrna Bondoc and Milagros Vocal (Bocal) for a time had been room renters
 in the house of the Carreon spouses until the conflagration that took 
place in 1985, burning many if not all houses in the area, including the
 house of the Carreons. After the fire, defendants had asked plaintiff 
Honorio L. Carreon that they be allowed to construct temporary quarters 
with the understanding that the defendants will leave and vacate the 
same when the plaintiff will need the lot upon demand. 
  </p>
  <p>Plaintiff Honorio Carreon II, one of the married children of the 
Carreon spouses who is presently living at Barrio Caniogan, Taguig, 
Rizal with his family and herein joined as co-plaintiff had wanted to 
build a house in Manila. His father, Honorio L. Carreon then asked the 
defendants to leave but the latter refused. With the refusal of the 
defendants to leave the premises, the matter was referred by the 
plaintiffs to the barangay chairman for conciliation but the parties 
herein were not able to arrive to an amicable settlement. As a result 
thereof, the barangay chairman issued a barangay certification dated 
July 15, 1990 (Annex “E” to the complaint, p. 29, Rec.). Thereafter, 
i.e., on August 13, 1990, plaintiffs sent through counsel separate 
letters to each of the defendants (Annex “F” to the complaint, p. 30, 
Rec.). All the defendants received the letters as shown by Annex “F-1” 
(p. 31. Rec.) but did not even respond thereto. When the defendants 
refused to heed the demand to vacate separate complaints were filed 
against them on September 4, 1991. </p>
  <p>Apparently, the Mataas na Lupa Tenants Association, Inc. pursued 
its plan to acquire the estate after the promulgation of the Supreme 
Court decision in Civil Case No. L-32048, entitled “Mataas na Lupa 
Tenants Association, Inc., et al. vs. Carlos Dimayuga and Juliana Diez 
Vda. de Gabriel on June 25, l994 (130 SCRA 30). (Its) in this case that 
the Supreme Court had recognized the rights of first refusal or option 
to buy pursuant to the constitution as well as the previous P.D. 1517. </p>
  <p>The records show that the Gabriel Estate had been earlier included 
in the list of areas for priority development (APD) per proclamation No.
 1967 (Exhibits 1,2 and 3, pp. 135-137, rec.). The records further show 
that as per reply of the National Housing Authority (NHA) to a letter of
 Atty. Floriano Par, counsel for the defendants dated July 20, 1990, the
 NHA’s previous attempts to acquire said property was to no avail as the
 negotiations failed (Exh. 4, p. 138, Rec.). </p>
  <p>In the meanwhile, the Tenants Association may have acquired the 
estate through negotiation with the owners thereof because a title was 
thereafter issued to the said association under TCT No. 189116. This is 
evident from Annex 5 of the defendants (p. 139, Rec.). Significantly, 
this reply of the NHA also stated that it cannot rule on the authority 
of the president of the association, Ella Demandante to sell the land 
because it has no jurisdiction on the matter; that the association had 
an earlier request to a certificate of registration and license to sell 
the lots but such action is being held in abeyance; and that the agency 
has not authorized the sale of the lots of the estate. 
  </p>
  <p>The Metropolitan Trial Court dismissed the respondent Honorio L. 
Carreon’s complaint against the petitioners (p. 4, decision, p.59, 
rollo). On appeal by the private respondent, the respondent Regional 
Trial court reversed the judgment of the of the Metropolitan Trial Court
 and ordered the petitioners “ to vacate their respective occupations in
 the lot in question, and for them to surrender the same to the 
plaintiffs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On appeal, the respondent court sustained the findings of the 
respondent Regional Trial Court and dismissed the petition for review of
 petitioners.
</p><p>Hence, this petition.
</p><p>The issues: (1) whether or not petitioners are “legitimate 
tenants” of the land in question within the meaning of Section 3(f) and 
Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1517; and, (2) whether the sale by 
the owner of the Gabriel Estate which includes the disputed lot to the 
Mataas na Lupa Association, Inc. violates the provisions of Presidential
 Decree No. 1517, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 2016. 
</p><p>We find the petition to be without merit.
</p><p>We are not persuaded by petitioners’ argument that the respondent
 court erred in declaring their eviction from the disputed premises 
contending that they were the actual occupants of the said property and 
were among those listed in the NHA census conducted thereon. Petitioners
 are not tenants pursuant to P.D. No. 1517.
</p><p>Section 3(f) of Presidential Decree No. 1517 otherwise known as 
the Urban Land Reform Act, defines the term “tenant” covered by the said
 decree, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Tenant refers to the rightful occupant of land and its structures,
 but does not include those whose presence on the land is merely 
tolerated and without the benefit of contract, those who enter the land 
by force or deceit, or those whose possession is under litigation.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stated differently, occupants of the land whose presence therein is 
devoid of any legal authority or those whose contracts of lease were 
already terminated, or had already expired, or their possession is under
 litigation are not considered “<strong>tenants</strong>” under the aforesaid section. 
</p><p>In the case at bar, the records reveal that petitioners were 
originally room renters of the house owned by Remedios Beloria Carreon 
(already deceased), wife of private respondent Honorio L. Carreon. Said 
house was constructed on the lot which private respondents leased from 
the Philippine Trust Co., trustee of the spouses Dr. and Mrs. Francisco 
Gabriel, the former registered owners of the estate. When the house was 
razed to the ground in l985, petitioners asked private respondent 
Honorio L. Carreon that they be allowed to construct temporary quarters 
on the lot with the understanding that they will leave and vacate the 
same when private respondent will need the lot upon demand. Later, 
Honorio Carreon II, one of the children of the Carreon spouses, who has a
 family of his own, wanted to construct a house on the said lot. 
Respondent Honorio Carreon then asked petitioners to leave but the 
latter refused. 
</p><p>Obviously, petitioners’ stay in the premises was merely an act of
 tolerance on the part of private respondents and carries with it the 
implied obligation to vacate the property should the need arise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 Considering that they were just room renters of the house of private 
respondents before its destruction in l985, they are now estopped in 
denying the title of private respondents, as their landlord.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 Indeed, petitioners’ status as occupants of the contested lot cannot be
 classified as “ tenants” within the purview of Section 3(f) of 
Presidential Decree No. 1517. 
</p><p>Furthermore, Section 6 of the aforesaid Decree provides that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“SECTION 6. <em>Land Tenancy in Urban Reform Areas</em>: Within the
 Urban Zones legitimate tenants who have resided on the land for ten 
years or more who have built their homes on the land by contract, 
continuously for the last ten years shall not be dispossessed of the 
land and shall be allowed the right of first refusal to purchase the 
same within a reasonable time and at reasonable prices, under terms and 
conditions to be determined by the Urban Zone Expropriation and Land 
Management Committee created by Section 8 of this Decree.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners cannot seek the protection of Presidential Decree No. 
1517 and its amendatory decree, Presidential Decree No. 2016, since they
 are not “legitimate tenants.” The aforesaid section is clear and 
unambiguous. To be able to qualify and avail of the rights and 
privileges granted by the said decree, one must be: (1) a legitimate 
tenant of the land for ten(10) years or more; (2) must have built his 
home on the land by contract; and, (3) has resided continuously for the 
last ten (10) years. Obviously, those who do not fall within the said 
category cannot be considered “legitimate tenants” and therefore not 
entitled to the right of first refusal to purchase the property should 
the owner of the land decide to sell the same at a reasonable price 
within a reasonable time. 
</p><p>We fully agree with the findings of the respondent court, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“From the facts established before the Metropolitan Trial Court 
(pp. 1-2 of said Court’s decision, pp. 54-55, rollo), adopted and 
amplified by the respondent Court (pp. 2-4 of respondent’s Court’s 
decision, pp. 59-61, rollo), admitted by the petitioners as correct 
except as to the exact location of the land (p. 3 of the petition, p.11,
 rollo), the petitioners were but room renters in a house owned by the 
late Remedios Beloria Carreon, wife of private respondent Honorio L. 
Carreon, which was destroyed by fire in l985. They were only allowed to 
put up their respective quarters/ houses on condition that they will 
leave the premises when needed by the private respondent. the private 
respondent was the legitimate lessee of the land in question and a 
member of the Mataas na Lupa tenant Association. </p>
  <p>Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to the protection afforded
 by Presidential Decrees Nos. 1517 and 2016 because they are not 
legitimate tenants or occupant families who have resided on the land for
 ten years or more. Their ejectment from the disputed land is therefore,
 not improper, much less incorrect.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, under Section 5 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 877, one of the grounds for judicial ejectment is:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“(c) Legitimate need of owner/lessor to repossess his property for 
his own use or for the use of any immediate member of his family as a 
residential unit, such owner or immediate member not being the owner of 
any other available residential unit within the city or municipality: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the lease for a definite period has expired: <em>Provided, further</em>,
 That the lessor has given the lessee formal notice three (3) months in 
advance of the lessor’s intention to repossess the property: and <em>Provided finally</em>,
 That the owner/ lessor is prohibited from leasing the residential unit 
or allowing its use by a third party for at least one year.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private respondent Honorio Carreon II, the son, resides with his 
family in Barrio Caniogan, Taguig. He has no other dwelling or any other
 available lot in Manila where he could build a family home other than 
the lot occupied by petitioners. In other words, the requirements set 
forth under Section 5 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 877 have been fully met by 
private respondents. Petitioners have no other recourse but to give up 
physical possession of the lot in favor of private respondents. 
</p><p>There is likewise no merit to petitioners’ contention that the 
sale between the owner of the land and the Mataas na Lupa Tenants 
Association, Inc. is null and void on the ground that it violates the 
provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1517 as amended by Presidential 
Decree No. 2016 and the directive of this Court in the case of Mataas na
 Lupa Tenants Association, Inc. vs. Carlos Dimayuga, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 to the Ministry of Human Settlements to facilitate the acquisition of 
the Gabriel Estate for distribution to the tenants thereon.
</p><p>Settled is the rule that the issue in an ejectment case is the right to physical possession of the premises or <em>possession de facto</em>.
 The suit is intended to restore to the aggrieved party the possession 
of the premises which had been detained from him. It is independent of 
any claim of ownership or <em>possession de jure</em> that either party may set forth in his pleadings or in other cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In <em>Asset Privatization Trust vs. Court of Appeals</em>, the Court <em>En Banc</em> held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“The judgment rendered in an ejectment suit shall not bar an action
 between the same parties respecting title to the land or building nor 
shall it be held conclusive of the facts therein found in a case between
 the same parties upon a different cause of action involving possession.
 Furthermore, in ejectment cases the jurisdiction of the court is 
determined by the allegations of the complaint not by the defense raised
 by the defendant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the focal point in this case is whether or not private 
respondents have a better right to possession of the contested lot. 
Since this is a case of ejectment, the dispute focuses on possession <em>de facto</em> or physical or material possession and not possession <em>de jure</em>
 of the lot in question. The issue of ownership cannot be raised by 
petitioners unless it is intertwined with the issue of possession.
</p><p>Thus, even if the question of ownership is raised in the 
pleadings, as in this case, the court may pass upon such issue but only 
to determine the question of possession especially if the former is 
inseparably linked with the latter. It cannot resolve the issue of 
ownership - such issue being inutile in an ejectment suit except to 
throw light on the question of possession. This is why the issue of 
ownership or title is generally immaterial and foreign to an ejectment 
suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
</p><p>In the case of <em>San Pedro vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 the Court ruled that the finality of the decision with respect to 
possession de facto cannot be affected by the pendency on appeal of a 
case where ownership of the property is being contested. In <strong>Dizon vs. Court of Appeals</strong>, we held that,
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Such certificate of title is a conclusive evidence of their 
ownership. It does not even matter if their title is questionable, 
because this is only an ejectment. As owners, the Santiagos are entitled
 to possession of the property from the time Dizon failed to exercise 
the option within the given period. The latter’s possession ceased to be
 legal from that moment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners’ protestations on the validity of private respondents 
acquisition of the contested lot and the subsequent issuance of title in
 their favor cannot be a bar to the successful resolution of this case. 
In fact, a certificate of title cannot be subject to collateral attack 
and can be altered, modified or cancelled only in a direct proceeding in
 accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly held that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“The only issue to be resolved in ejectment proceedings is that of 
physical or material possession; possession de facto and not possession 
de jure. Evidence of title to the land or building may be received 
solely for the purpose of determining the character and extent of 
possession and damages for detention(Section 4, Rule 70, Revised Rules 
of Court; see Section 33, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129). The judgment 
rendered in ejectment cases shall be effective with respect to the 
possession only and in no wise bind the title or affect the ownership of
 the land or building, nor shall it be conclusive of the facts therein 
found in a case between the same parties upon a different cause of 
action not involving possession (Sec. 7, <u>ibid</u>.) </p>
  <p>Thus, an action for ejectment shall proceed independently of any 
action with the NHA or HLURB involving the alleged illegality of the 
sale of the disputed land in favor of the private respondent. The case 
for ejectment cannot render moot and academic any proceeding with the 
administrative bodies as it is not conclusive with respect to the issue 
of the legality of the sale of the land to the private respondent.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Settled is the rule that findings of facts of the trial courts and 
the Court of Appeals are conclusive upon the Supreme Court when 
supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This is the case here.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals 
dated September 30, l993 is hereby AFFIRMED and the petition for review
