				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner asks this Court to define the nature and the extent of the people’s constitutional right to information on matters of public concern. Does this right include access to the terms of government negotiations <i>prior</i>&nbsp; to their consummation or conclusion? May the government, through the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), be required to reveal the proposed terms of a compromise agreement with the Marcos heirs as regards their alleged ill-gotten wealth? More specifically, are the "General Agreement" and "Supplemental Agreement," both dated December 28, 1993 and executed between the PCGG and the Marcos heirs, valid and binding?<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>These are the main questions raised in this original action seeking (1) to prohibit and "[e]njoin respondents [PCGG and its chairman] from privately entering into, perfecting and/or executing any agreement with the heirs of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos x x x relating to and concerning the properties and assets of Ferdinand Marcos located in the Philippines and/or abroad -- including the so-called Marcos gold hoard"; and (2) to "[c]ompel respondent[s] <i>to make public</i> all negotiations and agreement, be they ongoing or perfected, and all documents related to or relating to such negotiations and agreement between the PCGG and the Marcos heirs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>Petitioner Francisco I. Chavez, as "taxpayer, citizen and former government official who initiated the prosecution of the Marcoses and their cronies who committed unmitigated plunder of the public treasury and the systematic subjugation of the country’s economy," alleges that what impelled him to bring this action were several news reports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> bannered in a number of broadsheets sometime in September 1997. These news items referred to (1) the alleged discovery of billions of dollars of Marcos assets deposited in various coded accounts in Swiss banks; and (2) the reported execution of a compromise, between the government (through PCGG) and the Marcos heirs, on how to split or share these assets.<br><br>Petitioner, invoking his constitutional right to information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and the correlative duty of the state to disclose publicly all its transactions involving the national interest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> demands that respondents make public any and all negotiations and agreements pertaining to PCGG’s task of recovering the Marcoses’ ill-gotten wealth. He claims that any compromise on the alleged billions of ill-gotten wealth involves an issue of "paramount public interest," since it has a "debilitating effect on the country’s economy" that would be greatly prejudicial to the national interest of the Filipino people. Hence, the people in general have a right to know the transactions or deals being contrived and effected by the government.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, do not deny forging a compromise agreement with the Marcos heirs. They claim, though, that petitioner’s action is premature, because there is no showing that he has asked the PCGG to disclose the negotiations and the Agreements. And even if he has, PCGG may not yet be compelled to make any disclosure, since the proposed terms and conditions of the Agreements have not become effective and binding.<br><br>Respondents further aver that the Marcos heirs have submitted the subject Agreements to the Sandiganbayan for its approval in Civil Case No. 141, entitled <i>Republic v. Heirs of Ferdinand E. Marcos,</i> and that the Republic opposed such move on the principal grounds that (1) said Agreements have not been ratified by or even submitted to the President for approval, pursuant to Item No. 8 of the General Agreement; and (2) the Marcos heirs have failed to comply with their undertakings therein, particularly the collation and submission of an inventory of their assets. The Republic also cited an April 11, 1995 Resolution in Civil Case No. 0165, in which the Sandiganbayan dismissed a similar petition filed by the Marcoses’ attorney-in-fact.<br><blockquote>Furthermore, then President Fidel V. Ramos, in his May 4, 1998 Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to then PCGG Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo, categorically stated:<br><br>"This is to reiterate my previous position embodied in the Palace Press Release of 6 April 1995 that I have not authorized you to approve the Compromise Agreements of December 28, 1993 or any agreement at all with the Marcoses, and would have disapproved them had they been submitted to me.<br><br>"The Full Powers of Attorney of March 1994 and July 4, 1994, did not authorize you to approve said Agreements, which I reserve for myself as President of the Republic of the Philippines."<br><br>The assailed principal Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> reads:<br><br>"GENERAL AGREEMENT<br><br>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:<br><br>This Agreement entered into this 28th day of December, 1993, by and between -<br><br>The Republic of the Philippines, through the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), a governmental agency vested with authority defined under Executive Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 14, with offices at the Philcomcen Building, Pasig, Metro Manila, represented by its Chairman referred to as the FIRST PARTY,<br><br>-- and --<br><br>Estate of Ferdinand E.

Ramos, has adopted a policy of unity and reconciliation in order to bind the nation’s wounds and start the process of rebuilding this nation as it goes on to the twenty-first century;<br><br>WHEREAS, this Agreement settles all claims and counterclaims which the parties may have against one another, whether past, present, or future, matured or inchoate.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:<br><br>1.&nbsp; The parties will collate all assets presumed to be owned by, or held by other parties for the benefit of, the PRIVATE PARTY for purposes of determining the totality of the assets covered by the settlement. The subject assets shall be classified by the nature thereof, namely: (a) real estate; (b) jewelry; (c) paintings and other works of art; (d) securities; (e) funds on deposit; (f) precious metals, if any, and (g) miscellaneous assets or assets which could not appropriately fall under any of the preceding classification. The list shall be based on the full disclosure of the PRIVATE PARTY to insure its accuracy.<br><br>2.&nbsp; Based on the inventory, the FIRST PARTY shall determine which shall be ceded to the FIRST PARTY, and which shall be assigned to/retained by the PRIVATE PARTY. The assets of the PRIVATE PARTY shall be net of, and exempt from, any form of taxes due the Republic of the Philippines. However, considering the unavailability of all pertinent and relevant documents and information as to balances and ownership, the actual specification of assets to be retained by the PRIVATE PARTY shall be covered by supplemental agreements which shall form part of this Agreement.<br><br>3.&nbsp; Foreign assets which the PRIVATE PARTY shall fully disclose but which are held by trustees, nominees, agents or foundations are hereby waived over by the PRIVATE PARTY in favor of the FIRST PARTY. For this purpose, the parties shall cooperate in taking the appropriate action, judicial and/or extrajudicial, to recover the same for the FIRST PARTY.<br><br>4.&nbsp; All disclosures of assets made by the PRIVATE PARTY shall not be used as evidence by the FIRST PARTY in any criminal, civil, tax or administrative case, but shall be valid and binding against said PARTY for use by the FIRST PARTY in withdrawing any account and/or recovering any asset. The PRIVATE PARTY withdraws any objection to the withdrawal by and/or release to the FIRST PARTY by the Swiss banks and/or Swiss authorities of the $356 million, its accrued interests, and/or any other account; over which the PRIVATE PARTY waives any right, interest or participation in favor of the FIRST PARTY. However, any withdrawal or release of any account aforementioned by the FIRST PARTY shall be made in the presence of any authorized representative of the PRIVATE PARTY.<br><br>5.&nbsp; The trustees, custodians, safekeepers, depositaries, agents, nominees, administrators, lawyers, or any other party acting in similar capacity in behalf of the PRIVATE PARTY are hereby informed through this General Agreement to insure that it is fully implemented and this shall serve as absolute authority from both parties for full disclosure to the FIRST PARTY of said assets and for the FIRST PARTY to withdraw said account and/or assets and any other assets which the FIRST PARTY on its own or through the help of the PRIVATE PARTY/their trustees, etc., may discover.<br><br>6.&nbsp; Any asset which may be discovered in the future as belonging to the PRIVATE PARTY or is being held by another for the benefit of the PRIVATE PARTY and which is not included in the list per No. 1 for whatever reason shall automatically belong to the FIRST PARTY, and the PRIVATE PARTY in accordance with No. 4 above, waives any right thereto.<br><br>7.&nbsp; This Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns and shall supersede any other prior agreement.<br><br>8.&nbsp; The PARTIES shall submit this and any other implementing Agreements to the President of the Philippines for approval. In the same manner, the PRIVATE PARTY shall provide the FIRST PARTY assistance by way of testimony or deposition on any information it may have that could shed light on the cases being pursued by the FIRST PARTY against other parties. The FIRST PARTY shall desist from instituting new suits already subject of this Agreement against the PRIVATE PARTY and cause the dismissal of all other cases pending in the Sandiganbayan and in other courts.<br><br>9.&nbsp; In case of violation by the PRIVATE PARTY of any of the conditions herein contained, the PARTIES shall be restored automatically to the status quo ante the signing of this Agreement.<br><br>For purposes of this Agreement, the PRIVATE PARTY shall be represented by Atty.

MESINA, JR.<br><br>Counsel &amp; Attorney-in-Fact"</blockquote>Acting on a motion of petitioner, the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated March 23, 1998, enjoining respondents, their agents and/or representatives from "entering into, or perfecting and/or executing any agreement with the heirs of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos relating to and concerning their ill-gotten wealth."<br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b></center><br>The Oral Argument, held on March 16, 1998, focused on the following issues:<br><blockquote>"(a) Procedural:<br><br>(1) Whether or not the petitioner has the personality or legal standing to file the instant petition; and<br><br>(2) Whether or not this Court is the proper court before which this action may be filed.<br><br>(b) Substantive:<br><br>(1) Whether or not this Court could require the PCGG to disclose to the public the details of any agreement, perfected or not, with the Marcoses; and<br><br>(2) Whether or not there exist any legal restraints against a compromise agreement between the Marcoses and the PCGG relative to the Marcoses’ ill-gotten wealth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>After their oral presentations, the parties filed their respective memoranda.<br><br>On August 19, 1998, Gloria, Celnan, Scarlet and Teresa, all surnamed Jopson, filed before the Court a Motion for Intervention, attaching thereto their Petition in Intervention. They aver that they are "among the 10,000 claimants whose right to claim from the Marcos Family and/or the Marcos Estate is recognized by the decision in <i>In re Estate of Ferdinand Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, Maximo Hilao, et al., Class Plaintiffs No. 92-15526, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit US App. Lexis 14796, June 16, 1994</i> and the Decision of the Swiss Supreme Court of December 10, 1997." As such, they claim to have personal and direct interest in the subject matter of the instant case, since a distribution or disposition of the Marcos properties may adversely affect their legitimate claims. In a minute Resolution issued on August 24, 1998, the Court granted their motion to intervene and required the respondents to comment thereon. The September 25, 1998 Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the solicitor general on said motion merely reiterated his aforecited arguments against the main petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>The petition is imbued with merit.<br><br><center><b><u>First Procedural Issue: Petitioner’s Standing</u></b></center><br>Petitioner, on the one hand, explains that as a taxpayer and citizen, he has the legal personality to file the instant petition. He submits that since ill-gotten wealth "belongs to the Filipino people and [is], in truth and in fact, part of the public treasury," any compromise in relation to it would constitute a diminution of the public funds, which can be enjoined by a taxpayer whose interest is for a full, if not substantial, recovery of such assets.<br><br>Besides, petitioner emphasizes, the matter of recovering the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses is an issue "of transcendental importance to the public." He asserts that ordinary taxpayers have a right to initiate and prosecute actions questioning the validity of acts or orders of government agencies or instrumentalities, if the issues raised are "of paramount public interest;" and if they "immeasurably affect the social, economic, and moral well-being of the people."<br><br>Moreover, the mere fact that he is a citizen satisfies the requirement of personal interest, when the proceeding involves the assertion of a public right,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> such as in this case. He invokes several decisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of this Court which have set aside the procedural matter of <i>locus standi,</i> when the subject of the case involved public interest.<br><br>On the other hand, the solicitor general, on behalf of respondents, contends that petitioner has no standing to institute the present action, because no expenditure of public funds is involved and said petitioner has no actual interest in the alleged agreement. Respondents further insist that the instant petition is premature, since there is no showing that petitioner has requested PCGG to disclose any such negotiations and agreements; or that, if he has, the Commission has refused to do so.<br><br>Indeed, the arguments cited by petitioner constitute the controlling decisional rule as regards his legal standing to institute the instant petition. Access to public documents and records is a public right, and the real parties in interest are the people themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In <i>Tañada v. Tuvera,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court asserted that when the issue concerns a public right and the object of mandamus is to obtain the enforcement of a public duty, the people are regarded as the real parties in interest; and because it is sufficient that petitioner is a citizen and as such is interested in the execution of the laws, he need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result of the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the aforesaid case, the petitioners sought to enforce their right to be informed on matters of public concern, a right then recognized in Section 6, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in connection with the rule that laws in order to be valid and enforceable must be published in the Official Gazette or otherwise effectively promulgated. In ruling for the petitioners’ legal standing, the Court declared that the right they sought to be enforced "is a public right recognized by no less than the fundamental law of the land."<br><br><i>Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> while reiterating <i>Tañada,</i> further declared that "when a mandamus proceeding involves the assertion of a public right, the requirement of personal interest is satisfied by the mere fact that petitioner is a citizen and, therefore, part of the general ‘public’ which possesses the right."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Further, in <i>Albano v. Reyes,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we said that while expenditure of public funds may not have been involved under the questioned contract for the development, the management and the operation of the Manila International Container Terminal, "public interest [was] definitely involved considering the important role [of the subject contract] x x x in the economic development of the country and the magnitude of the financial consideration involved." We concluded that, as a consequence, the disclosure provision in the Constitution would constitute sufficient authority for upholding the petitioner’s standing.<br><br>Similarly, the instant petition is anchored on the right of the people to information and access to official records, documents and papers -- a right guaranteed under Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Constitution. Petitioner, a former solicitor general, is a Filipino citizen. Because of the satisfaction of the two basic requisites laid down by decisional law to sustain petitioner’s legal standing, i.e. (1) the enforcement of a public right (2) espoused by a Filipino citizen, we rule that the petition at bar should be allowed.<br><br>In any event, the question on the standing of Petitioner Chavez is rendered moot by the intervention of the Jopsons, who are among the legitimate claimants to the Marcos wealth. The standing of the Jopsons is not seriously contested by the solicitor general. Indeed, said petitioners-intervenors have a legal interest in the subject matter of the instant case, since a distribution or disposition of the Marcoses’ ill-gotten properties may adversely affect the satisfaction of their claims.<br><br><center><b><u>Second Procedural Issue:The Court’s Jurisdiction</u></b></center><br>Petitioner asserts that because this petition is an original action for mandamus and one that is not intended to delay any proceeding in the Sandiganbayan, its having been filed before this Court was proper. He invokes Section 5, Article VIII of the Constitution, which confers upon the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over petitions for prohibition and mandamus.<br><br>The solicitor general, on the other hand, argues that the petition has been erroneously brought before this Court, since there is neither a justiciable controversy nor a violation of petitioner’s rights by the PCGG. He alleges that the assailed agreements are already the very <i>lis mota</i> in Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 0141, which has yet to dispose of the issue; thus, this petition is premature. Furthermore, respondents themselves have opposed the Marcos heirs’ motion, filed in the graft court, for the approval of the subject Agreements. Such opposition belies petitioner’s claim that the government, through respondents, has concluded a settlement with the Marcoses as regards their alleged ill-gotten assets.<br><br>In <i>Tañada</i> and <i>Legaspi,</i> we upheld therein petitioners’ resort to a mandamus proceeding, seeking to enforce a public right as well as to compel performance of a public duty mandated by no less than the fundamental law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Further, Section 5, Article VIII of the Constitution, expressly confers upon the Supreme Court <i>original</i> jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari, <i>prohibition, mandamus,</i> quo warranto and habeas corpus.<br><br>Respondents argue that petitioner should have properly sought relief before the Sandiganbayan, particularly in Civil Case No. 0141, in which the enforcement of the compromise Agreements is pending resolution. There may seem to be some merit in such argument, if petitioner is merely seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the compromise and/or to compel the PCGG to disclose to the public the terms contained in said Agreements. However, petitioner is here seeking the public disclosure of "all negotiations and agreement, be they ongoing or perfected, and documents related to or relating to such negotiations and agreement between the PCGG and the Marcos heirs."<br><br>In other words, this petition is not confined to the Agreements that have already been drawn, but likewise to any other ongoing or future undertaking towards any settlement on the alleged Marcos loot. Ineluctably, the core issue boils down to the precise interpretation, in terms of scope, of the twin constitutional provisions on "public transactions." This broad and prospective relief sought by the instant petition brings it out of the realm of Civil Case No. 0141.<br><br><center><b><u>First Substantive Issue:<br><br>Public Disclosure of Terms of Any Agreement, Perfected or Not</u></b></center><br>In seeking the public disclosure of negotiations and agreements pertaining to a compromise settlement with the Marcoses as regards their alleged ill-gotten wealth, petitioner invokes the following provisions of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 7 [Article III]. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents, and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law."<br><br>"Sec. 28 [Article II]. Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest."</blockquote>Respondents’ opposite view is that the above constitutional provisions refer to completed and operative official acts, not to those still being considered. As regards the assailed Agreements entered into by the PCGG with the Marcoses, there is yet no right of action that has accrued, because said Agreements have not been approved by the President, and the Marcos heirs have failed to fulfill their express undertaking therein. Thus, the Agreements have not become effective. Respondents add that they are not aware of any ongoing negotiation for another compromise with the Marcoses regarding their alleged ill-gotten assets.<br><br>The "information" and the "transactions" referred to in the subject provisions of the Constitution have as yet no defined scope and extent. There are no specific laws prescribing the exact limitations within which the right may be exercised or the correlative state duty may be obliged. However, the following are some of the recognized restrictions: (1) national security matters and intelligence information, (2) trade secrets and banking transactions, (3) criminal matters, and (4) other confidential information.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>Limitations to the Right: (1) National Security Matters</u></b><br><br>At the very least, this jurisdiction recognizes the common law holding that there is a governmental privilege against public disclosure with respect to state secrets regarding military, diplomatic and other national security matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> But where there is no need to protect such state secrets, the privilege may not be invoked to withhold documents and other information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> provided that they are examined "in strict confidence" and given "scrupulous protection."<br><br>Likewise, information on inter-government exchanges prior to the conclusion of treaties and executive agreements may be subject to reasonable safeguards for the sake of national interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>(2) Trade Secrets and Banking Transactions</u></b><br><br>The drafters of the Constitution also unequivocally affirmed that, aside from national security matters and intelligence information, trade or industrial secrets (pursuant to the Intellectual Property Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and other related laws) as well as banking transactions (pursuant to the Secrecy of Bank Deposits Act<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>) are also exempted from compulsory disclosure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>(3) Criminal Matters</u></b><br><br>Also excluded are classified law enforcement matters, such as those relating to the apprehension, the prosecution and the detention of criminals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which courts may not inquire into prior to such arrest, detention and prosecution. Efforts at effective law enforcement would be seriously jeopardized by free public access to, for example, police information regarding rescue operations, the whereabouts of fugitives, or leads on covert criminal activities.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>(4) Other Confidential Information</u></b><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>The Ethical Standards Act<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> further prohibits public officials and employees from using or divulging "confidential or classified information officially known to them by reason of their office and not made available to the public."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Other acknowledged limitations to information access include diplomatic correspondence, closed door Cabinet meetings and executive sessions of either house of Congress, as well as the internal deliberations of the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>Scope: Matters of Public Concern and Transactions Involving Public Interest</u></b><br><br>In <i>Valmonte v. Belmonte Jr.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court emphasized that the information sought must be "matters of public concern," access to which may be limited by law. Similarly, the state policy of full public disclosure extends only to "transactions involving public interest" and may also be "subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law." As to the meanings of the terms "public interest" and "public concern," the Court, in <i>Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> elucidated:<br><blockquote>"In determining whether or not a particular information is of public concern there is no rigid test which can be applied. ‘Public concern’ like ‘public interest’ is a term that eludes exact definition. Both terms embrace a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these directly affect their lives, or simply because such matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen. In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine on a case by case basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it relates to or affects the public."</blockquote>Considered a public concern in the above-mentioned case was the "legitimate concern of citizens to ensure that government positions requiring civil service eligibility are occupied only by persons who are eligibles." So was the need to give the general public adequate notification of various laws that regulate and affect the actions and conduct of citizens, as held in <i>Tañada.</i> Likewise did the "public nature of the loanable funds of the GSIS and the public office held by the alleged borrowers (members of the defunct Batasang Pambansa)" qualify the information sought in <i>Valmonte</i> as matters of public interest and concern. In <i>Aquino-Sarmiento v. Morato,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court also held that official acts of public officers done in pursuit of their official functions are public in character; hence, the records pertaining to such official acts and decisions are within the ambit of the constitutional right of<i> access to public records.</i><br><br>Under Republic Act No. 6713, public officials and employees are mandated to "provide information on their policies and procedures in clear and understandable language, [and] ensure openness of information, public consultations and hearings whenever appropriate x x x," except when "otherwise provided by law or when required by the public interest." In particular, the law mandates free public access, at reasonable hours, to the annual performance reports of offices and agencies of government and government-owned or controlled corporations; and the statements of assets, liabilities and financial disclosures of all public officials and employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In general, writings coming into the hands of public officers in connection with their official functions must be accessible to the public, consistent with the policy of transparency of governmental affairs. This principle is aimed at affording the people an opportunity to determine whether those to whom they have entrusted the affairs of the government are honestly, faithfully and competently performing their functions as public servants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Undeniably, the essence of democracy lies in the free flow of thought;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> but thoughts and ideas must be well-informed so that the public would gain a better perspective of vital issues confronting them and, thus, be able to criticize as well as participate in the affairs of the government in a responsible, reasonable and effective manner. Certainly, it is by ensuring an unfettered and uninhibited exchange of ideas among a well-informed public that a government remains responsive to the changes desired by the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>The Nature of the Marcoses’ Alleged Ill-Gotten Wealth</u></b><br><br>We now come to the immediate matter under consideration.<br><br>Upon the departure from the country of the Marcos family and their cronies in February 1986, the new government headed by President Corazon C. Aquino was specifically mandated to "[r]ecover ill-gotten properties amassed by the leaders and supporters of the previous regime and [to] protect the interest of the people through orders of sequestration or freezing of assets or accounts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, President Aquino’s very first executive orders (which partook of the nature of legislative enactments) dealt with the recovery of these alleged ill-gotten properties.<br><br>Executive Order No. 1, promulgated on February 28, 1986, only two (2) days after the Marcoses fled the country, created the PCGG which was primarily tasked to assist the President in the recovery of vast government resources allegedly amassed by former President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives and close associates both here and abroad.<br><br>Under Executive Order No. 2, issued twelve (12) days later, all persons and entities who had knowledge or possession of ill-gotten assets and properties were warned and, under pain of penalties prescribed by law, prohibited from concealing, transferring or dissipating them or from otherwise frustrating or obstructing the recovery efforts of the government.<br><br>On May 7, 1986, another directive (EO No. 14) was issued giving additional powers to the PCGG which, taking into account <i>the overriding considerations of national interest and national survival,</i> required it to achieve expeditiously and effectively its vital task of recovering ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>With such pronouncements of our government, whose authority emanates from the people, there is no doubt that the recovery of the Marcoses’ alleged ill-gotten wealth is a matter of public concern and imbued with public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We may also add that "ill-gotten wealth," by its very nature, assumes a public character. Based on the aforementioned Executive Orders, "ill-gotten wealth" refers to assets and properties purportedly acquired, directly or indirectly, by former President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives and close associates through or as a result of their improper or illegal use of government funds or properties; or their having taken undue advantage of their public office; or their use of powers, influences or relationships, "resulting in their unjust enrichment and causing grave damage and prejudice to the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines." Clearly, the assets and properties referred to supposedly originated from the government itself. To all intents and purposes, therefore, they belong to the people. As such, upon reconveyance they will be returned to the public treasury, subject only to the satisfaction of positive claims of certain persons as may be adjudged by competent courts. Another declared overriding consideration for the expeditious recovery of ill-gotten wealth is that it may be used for national economic recovery.<br><br>We believe the foregoing disquisition settles the question of whether petitioner has a right to respondents’ disclosure of any agreement that may be arrived at concerning the Marcoses’ purported ill-gotten wealth.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>Access to Information on Negotiating Terms</u></b><br><br>But does the constitutional provision likewise guarantee access to information regarding ongoing negotiations or proposals prior to the final agreement? This same clarification was sought and clearly addressed by the constitutional commissioners during their deliberations, which we quote hereunder:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><blockquote>"MR. SUAREZ. And when we say ‘transactions’ which should be distinguished from contracts, agreements, or treaties or whatever, does the Gentleman refer to the steps leading to the consummation of the contract, or does he refer to the contract itself?<br><br>"MR. OPLE. The ‘transactions’ used here, I suppose, is generic and, therefore, it can cover both steps leading to a contract, and already a consummated contract, Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>"MR. SUAREZ. This contemplates inclusion of negotiations leading to the consummation of the transaction?<br><br>"MR. OPLE. Yes, subject to reasonable safeguards on the national interest."</blockquote><b>Considering the intent of the framers of the Constitution, we believe that it is incumbent upon the PCGG and its officers, as well as other government representatives, to disclose sufficient public information on any proposed settlement they have decided to take up with the ostensible owners and holders of ill-gotten wealth.</b> Such information, though, must pertain to definite propositions of the government, not necessarily to intra-agency or inter-agency recommendations or communications<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> during the stage when common assertions are still in the process of being formulated or are in the "exploratory" stage. There is a need, of course, to observe the same restrictions on disclosure of information in general, as discussed earlier -- such as on matters involving national security, diplomatic or foreign relations, intelligence and other classified information.<br><br><center><b><u>Second Substantive Issue: Legal Restraints on a Marcos-PCGG Compromise</u></b></center><br>Petitioner lastly contends that any compromise agreement between the government and the Marcoses will be a virtual condonation of all the alleged wrongs done by them, as well as an unwarranted permission to commit graft and corruption.<br><br>Respondents, for their part, assert that there is no legal restraint on entering into a compromise with the Marcos heirs, provided the agreement does not violate any law.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>Prohibited Compromises</u></b><br><br>In general, the law encourages compromises in <i>civil</i> cases, except with regard to the following matters: (1) the civil status of persons, (2) the validity of a marriage or a legal separation, (3) any ground for legal separation, (4) future support, (5) the jurisdiction of courts, and (6) future legitime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> And like any other contract, the terms and conditions of a compromise must not be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy or public order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> A compromise is binding and has the force of law between the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> unless the consent of a party is vitiated -- such as by mistake, fraud, violence, intimidation or undue influence -- or when there is forgery, or if the terms of the settlement are so palpably unconscionable.

Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which affirmed the grant by the PCGG of civil and criminal immunity to Jose Y. Campos and family, the Court held that in the absence of an express prohibition, the rule on compromises in civil actions under the Civil Code is applicable to PCGG cases. Such principle is pursuant to the objectives of EO No. 14, particularly the just and expeditious recovery of ill-gotten wealth, so that it may be used to hasten economic recovery. The same principle was upheld in <i>Benedicto v. Board of Administrators of Television Stations RPN, BBC and IBC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and <i>Republic v. Benedicto,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> which ruled in favor of the validity of the PCGG compromise agreement with Roberto S. Benedicto.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>Immunity from Criminal Prosecution</u></b><br><br><b>However, any compromise relating to the civil liability arising from an offense does not automatically terminate the criminal proceeding against or extinguish the criminal liability of the malefactor.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> While a compromise in civil suits is expressly authorized by law, there is no similar general sanction as regards criminal liability. The authority must be specifically conferred. In the present case, the power to grant criminal immunity was conferred on PCGG by Section 5 of EO No. 14, as amended by EO No. 14-A, which provides:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 5. The Presidential Commission on Good Government is authorized to grant immunity from criminal prosecution to any person who provides information or testifies in any investigation conducted by such Commission to establish the unlawful manner in which any respondent, defendant or accused has acquired or accumulated the property or properties in question in any case where such information or testimony is necessary to ascertain or prove the latter’s guilt or his civil liability. The immunity thereby granted shall be continued to protect the witness who repeats such testimony before the Sandiganbayan when required to do so by the latter or by the Commission."</blockquote>The above provision specifies that the PCGG may exercise such authority under these conditions: (1) the person to whom criminal immunity is granted provides information or testifies in an investigation conducted by the Commission; (2) the information or testimony pertains to the unlawful manner in which the respondent, defendant or accused acquired or accumulated ill-gotten property; and (3) such information or testimony is necessary to ascertain or prove guilt or civil liability of such individual. From the wording of the law, it can be easily deduced that the person referred to is a <i>witness</i> in the proceeding, not the principal respondent, defendant or accused.<br><br>Thus, in the case of Jose Y. Campos, the grant of both civil and criminal immunity to him and his family was "[i]n consideration of the full cooperation of Mr. Jose Y. Campos [with] this Commission, his voluntary surrender of the properties and assets [--] disclosed and declared by him to belong to deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos [--] to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines[;] his full, complete and truthful disclosures[;] and his commitment to pay a sum of money as determined by the Philippine Government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Moreover, the grant of criminal immunity to the Camposes and the Benedictos was limited to acts and omissions prior to February 25, 1996. At the time such immunity was granted, no criminal cases have yet been filed against them before the competent courts.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic;"><u>Validity of the PCGG-Marcos Compromise Agreements</u></b><br><br>Going now to the subject General and Supplemental Agreements between the PCGG and the Marcos heirs, a cursory perusal thereof reveals serious legal flaws. <i>First,</i> the Agreements do not conform to the above requirements of EO Nos. 14 and 14-A. <b>We believe that criminal immunity under Section 5 cannot be granted to the Marcoses, who are the <i>principal defendants</i> in the spate of ill-gotten wealth cases now pending before the Sandiganbayan.</b> As stated earlier, the provision is applicable mainly to <i>witnesses</i> who provide information or testify against a respondent, defendant or accused in an ill-gotten wealth case.<br><br>While the General Agreement states that the Marcoses "shall provide the [government] assistance by way of testimony or deposition on any information [they] may have that could shed light on the cases being pursued by the [government] against other parties,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the clause does not fully comply with the law. Its inclusion in the Agreement may have been only an afterthought, conceived in <i>pro forma</i> compliance with Section 5 of EO No. 14, as amended. There is no indication whatsoever that any of the Marcos heirs has indeed provided vital information against any respondent or defendant as to the manner in which the latter may have unlawfully acquired public property.<br><br><i>Second,</i> under Item No. 2 of the General Agreement, the PCGG commits to exempt from all forms of taxes the properties to be retained by the Marcos heirs. This is a clear violation of the Constitution. The power to tax and to grant tax exemptions is vested in the Congress and, to a certain extent, in the local legislative bodies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Section 28 (4), Article VI of the Constitution, specifically provides: "No law granting any tax exemption shall be passed without the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress." <b>The PCGG has absolutely no power to grant tax exemptions, even under the cover of its authority to compromise ill-gotten wealth cases.</b><br><br>Even granting that Congress enacts a law exempting the Marcoses from paying taxes on their properties, such law will definitely not pass the test of the equal protection clause under the Bill of Rights. Any special grant of tax exemption in favor only of the Marcos heirs will constitute class legislation. It will also violate the constitutional rule that "taxation shall be uniform and equitable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Neither can the stipulation be construed to fall within the power of the commissioner of internal revenue to compromise taxes. Such authority may be exercised only when (1) there is r<i>easonable doubt as to the validity of the claim</i> against the taxpayer, and (2) the taxpayer’s financial position demonstrates a <i>clear inability to pay.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Definitely, neither requisite is present in the case of the Marcoses, because under the Agreement they are effectively conceding the validity of the claims against their properties, part of which they will be allowed to retain. Nor can the PCGG grant of tax exemption fall within the power of the commissioner to abate or cancel a tax liability. This power can be exercised only when (1) the tax appears to be unjustly or excessively assessed, or (2) the administration and collection costs involved do not justify the collection of the tax due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this instance, the cancellation of tax liability is done even before the determination of the amount due. In any event, criminal violations of the Tax Code, for which legal actions have been filed in court or in which fraud is involved, cannot be compromised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><i>Third,</i> the government binds itself to cause the dismissal of all cases against the Marcos heirs, pending before the Sandiganbayan and other courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This is a direct encroachment on judicial powers, particularly in regard to criminal jurisdiction. Well-settled is the doctrine that once a case has been filed before a court of competent jurisdiction, the matter of its dismissal or pursuance lies within the full discretion and control of the judge. In a criminal case, the manner in which the prosecution is handled, including the matter of whom to present as witnesses, may lie within the sound discretion of the government prosecutor;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> but the court decides, based on the evidence proffered, in what manner it will dispose of the case. Jurisdiction, once acquired by the trial court, is not lost despite a resolution, even by the justice secretary, to withdraw the information or to dismiss the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The prosecution’s motion to withdraw or to dismiss is not the least binding upon the court. On the contrary, decisional rules require the trial court to make its own evaluation of the merits of the case, because granting such motion is equivalent to effecting a disposition of the case itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><b>Thus, the PCGG, as the government prosecutor of ill-gotten wealth cases, cannot guarantee the dismissal of all such criminal cases against the Marcoses pending in the courts, for said dismissal is not within its sole power and discretion.</b><br><br><i>Fourth,</i> the government also waives all claims and counterclaims, "whether past, present, or future, matured or inchoate," against the Marcoses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Again, this all-encompassing stipulation is contrary to law. Under the Civil Code, an action for future fraud may not be waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The stipulation in the Agreement does not specify the exact scope of future claims against the Marcoses that the government thereby relinquishes. Such vague and broad statement may well be interpreted to include all future illegal acts of any of the Marcos heirs, practically giving them a license to perpetrate fraud against the government without any liability at all. This is a palpable violation of the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Constitution. It effectively ensconces the Marcoses beyond the reach of the law. It also sets a dangerous precedent for public accountability.<b> It is a virtual warrant for public officials to amass public funds illegally, since there is an open option to compromise their liability in exchange for only a portion of their ill-gotten wealth.</b><br><br><i>Fifth,</i> the Agreements do not provide for a definite or determinable period within which the parties shall fulfill their respective prestations. It may take a lifetime before the Marcoses submit an inventory of their total assets.<br><br><i>Sixth,</i> the Agreements do not state with specificity the standards for determining which assets shall be forfeited by the government and which shall be retained by the Marcoses. While the Supplemental Agreement provides that the Marcoses shall be entitled to 25 per cent of the $356 million Swiss deposits (less government recovery expenses), such sharing arrangement pertains only to the said deposits. No similar splitting scheme is defined with respect to the other properties. Neither is there, anywhere in the Agreements, a statement of the basis for the 25-75 percent sharing ratio. Public officers entering into an arrangement appearing to be manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government, in violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act,[69] invite their indictment for corruption under the said law.<br><br><i>Finally,</i> the absence of then President Ramos’ approval of the principal Agreement, an express condition therein, renders the compromise incomplete and unenforceable. Nevertheless, as detailed above, even if such approval were obtained, the Agreements would still not be valid.<br><br><b>From the foregoing disquisition, it is crystal clear to the Court that the General and Supplemental Agreements, both dated December 28, 1993, which the PCGG entered into with the Marcos heirs, are violative of the Constitution and the laws aforementioned.</b><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The General and Supplemental Agreements dated December 28, 1993, which PCGG and the Marcos heirs entered into are hereby declared <b>NULL AND VOID</b> for being contrary to law and the Constitution.

The procedural rules in the courts of law, like the locus standi of petitioner Francisco I. Chavez, the propriety of the special legal action of mandamus used as a vehicle to reach this Court on the issue involved and considered by the Court, as well as kindred technicalities and nicety raised by respondents to thwart the petition are no trickle matters, to be sure, but I do not see them to be cogent reasons to deny to the Court its taking cognizance of the case.<br><br>It is a cardinal principle in constitutional adjudiction that anyone who invokes it has a personal and substantial interest on the dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Jurisprudentially there is either the lenient or the strict approach in the appreciation of legal standing. The liberal approach recognizes legal standing to raise constitutional issues of nontraditional plaintiffs, such as taxpayers and citizens, directly affecting them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> A developing trend appears to be towards a narrow and exacting approach, requiring that a logical nexus be shown between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated in order to ensure that one is the proper and appropriate party to invoke judicial power<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>With respect to the right to information, it being a public right where the real parties in interest are the people themselves in general<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and where the only recognized limitation is "public concern," it would seem that the framers of the Constitution have favored the liberal approach. Rev. Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J., a member of the Constitutional Commission, observes:<br><br>The real problem, however, lies in determining what matters are of public concern and what are not. Unwittingly perhaps, by this provision the Constitution might have opened a Pandora's box. For certainly every act of a public officer in the conduct of the governmental process is a matter of public concern. Jurisprudence in fact has said that "public concern," like "public interest," eludes exact definition and embraces a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these directly affects their lives or simply because such matters arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Corrolarily, there is need of preserving a certain degree of confidentiality in matter involving nationl security and public relations, to cite a few,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and until a balance is struck, the Court may be constrained on occassions to accept a electric notion that frees itself from the shackles of the trechant requisites of locus standi.<br><br>The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) has a limited life in carrying out its task and time is running short. It is thus imperative tha the Court must hold even now, and remind PCGG, that it had indeed exceeded its bounds in entering into the General and Supplemental Agreements. The agreements clearly suffer from Constitutional and statutory infirmities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to wit: (1) The agreements contravene the statute in granting criminal immunity to the Marcos heirs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (2) PCGG's commitment to exempt from all forms of taxes the property to be retained the Marcos' heirs controverts the Constitution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and (3) the government's undertaking to cause the dismissal of all cases filed against the Marcoses pending before the Sandiganbayan and other courts enroaches upon judicial powers. I also see, like my other colleagues, too musch vagueness on such items as the period within the parties shall fulfill their respective prestations and the lack of appropriate standards for determining the assets to be forfeited by the goverment and those to be retained by the Marcoses.<br><br>In this respect, while there is legal possibility when the terms of a contract are not totally invalidated and only those opposed to law, morals, good custom, public order and public policy are rendered inefficacious, when, however, the assailed provisions can be seen to be of essence, like here, the agreement in its entirely can be adversely affected. True, the validity or invalidity of a contract is a matter that generally may not be passed upon in a mandamus petition, for it is as if petitioner were seeking declaratory relief or a advisory opinion from this Court over which it has no original jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the immendiacy and significance of the issues, nevertheless, has impelled the Court to rightly assume jurisdiction and to resolve the incidental, albeit major, issues that evidently and continually vex the parties<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> I vote to grant the petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> People vs. Vera, 65 Phil. 56, 89; Macasiano vs. National Housing Authority, 224 SCRA 236, 244.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Defensor Santiago, Miriam, Constitutional Law, First Edition, 1994, p.11<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Am Jur§ 189, p. 591, S v.
