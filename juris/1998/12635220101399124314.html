<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner was
employed by respondent Baliwag Transit, Inc. as a passenger bus driver. He is
paid compensation by way of commission at the rate of 11.5% of the daily gross
earnings of the bus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On May
20,1983,  the bus driven by petitioner
was heavily damaged in an accident with two other vehicles, a Ford Farm Tractor
towing a trailer loaded with sacks of palay and a Toyota gasoline tanker. As a
result of the accident, six passengers of the bus, a driver and a passenger of
one of the two other vehicles were seriously injured. Petitioner was
"grounded" and advised by respondent Baliwag to wait for the result
of the police investigation and the actions that might be taken by the owners
of the other vehicles. Petitioner patiently waited. Realizing that he has
waited too long, petitioner on December 11, 1986 requested respondent Baliwag
to reinstate him as he needed money to support his family. But, private
respondent formally informed him to look for another job because the management
has terminated his services on account of the May 20, 1983 vehicular accident. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On November 15,
1990, petitioner filed a complaint against respondent Baliwag for illegal
dismissal, damages and attorney's fees before the Arbitration Branch of the
NLRC. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In answer,
respondent Baliwag denied petitioner's allegation contending that petitioner
was not dismissed but abandoned his job after the incident of May 30, 1983.
Respondent likewise asserted that petitioner's cause of action had long
prescribed and that he is guilty of laches in not asserting his right sooner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On November 20,

ruling in this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"A
scrutiny of the record indubitably shows that the last day that complainant
worked was on  May 20, 1983 when that
vehicular accident occurred. This fact was admitted to by the parties, the
complainant as asserted to by him in his position paper as well as in his
Supplemental position paper and/or Reply to position paper of respondents, and
the respondent as asserted by it in its position paper and as categorically
testified to by its witness, respondent's Assistant Personnel Manager, Ricardo
Toledo, in latter's affidavit (par. 4 Annex "1", respondent's
position paper). With this admitted fact, it is safe to say that this complaint
principally for illegal dismissal, was filed more than seven (7) years after
the last day that complainant had worked or given/allowed to work by the
respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">A complaint for illegal dismissal
constitute an action predicated upon an injury to the rights of the
complainant. It being a violation of one's right, it prescribes in four (4)
years from the time of its accrual.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">In the instant case, the complaint
of complainant was filed on November 15, 1990, or more than four (4) years from
the accrual of the cause of action on May 20, 1983, which is complainant's last
working day.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Moreover, even if we consider
complainant's allegation that he was not allowed to work since December 1986
(paragraph 4, complaint) still, it is believed, his claims for reinstatement
with backwages and damages are still barred by laches. It took him almost four
(4) years to file his complaint on said date (November 15, 1990) when according
to him his cause of action accrued in December 1986. The doctrine of  laches or stale demand is based on public
policy "which  requires, for the
peace of society, the discouragement of stale claims", x x x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">In the case at bar, assuming it to
be true that it was only sometime in December 1986 where complainant was told
that he was already dismissed, still laches would lie as it took him almost
four (4) years before he instituted the instant complaint. Complainant never
tells us what he did between December 1986 and November 1990, whether he
constantly made follow-ups with respondent for him to be allowed to work. All
that he tells us is that it was sometime in December 1986 that he was told that
he is dismissed. By such, we cannot believe him that he was ever vigilant in
the enforcement of his right. x x x x <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

ruling that complainant's cause of action is barred by prescription, if not by
laches, it is believed that there would be no necessity to discuss the merits
of the case, i.e. whether or not complainant's dismissal was illegal. x x x <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The said
decision was affirmed by the NLRC in its Resolution of June 21, 1995.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Aggrieved by the
said decision, petitioner now comes to us contending that the NLRC gravely
erred in affirming the Labor Arbiter's decision dismissing the complaint on the
ground of prescription and laches. He argues that the four (4) year
prescriptive period should be counted from the time he was informed of his
dismissal and not from the time of the occurrence of the vehicular
accident.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In Baliwag
Transit, Inc. vs. Ople and Hughes,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> a case involving the same
respondent and one of its employees who similarly figured in a road mishap, we
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"Whatever prescriptive period
is applicable, the antecedent question that has to be settled is the date when
the cause of action accrued and from which the period shall commence to run.
The parties disagree on this date. The contention of the petitioner is that it
should be August 10, 1974, when the collision occurred. The private respondent
insists it is May 10, 1980, when his demand for reinstatement was rejected by
the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">It is settled jurisprudence that a
cause of action has three elements, to wit: (1) a right in favor of the
plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created; (2)
an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not to violate
such right; and (3) an act or omission on the part of such defendant violative
of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of the
defendant to the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The problem in the case at bar is
with the third element as the first two are deemed established.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">We hold that the private
respondent's right of action could not have accrued from the mere fact of the
occurrence of the mishap on August 10, 1974, as he was not considered
automatically dismissed on that date. At best, he was deemed suspended form his
work, and not even by positive act of the petitioner but as a result of the
suspension of his driver's license because of the accident. There was no
apparent disagreement then between Hughes and his employer. As the private
respondent was the petitioner's principal witness in its complaint for damages
against the Philippine National Railways, we may assume that Baliwag Transit
and Hughes were on the best of terms when the case was being tried. Hence,
there existed no justification at that time for private respondent to demand
reinstatement and no opportunity warrant either for the petitioner to reject
that demand.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">We agree with the private
respondent that May 10, 1980, is the date when his cause of action accrued, for
it was then that the petitioner denied his demand for reinstatement and so
committed the act of omission 'constituting a breach of the obligation of the
defendant to the plaintiff.' The earlier requests made by him having been
warded off with indefinite promises, and the private respondent not yet having
decided to assert his right, his cause of action could not be said to have then
already accrued. The issues had not yet been joined, so to speak. This happened
only when the private respondent finally demanded his reinstatement on May 2,
1980, and his demand was categorically rejected by the petitioner on May 10,
1980."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Applying the
aforesaid ruling, petitioner's cause of action accrued only in December 1986
when respondent Baliwag formally dismissed him from the service. The four-year
period should not be reckoned from the time of the accident on May 20, 1983
because petitioner was not yet considered terminated. Note that petitioner was
merely "grounded" and advised to wait for the result of the
investigation and the possible legal actions which may be taken against him.
Hence, there existed at that time no cogent reason for petitioner to
demand  reinstatement and no opportunity
for respondent Baliwag to warrant the rejection of such  demand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Thus, it is
clear from the foregoing, that the action for illegal dismissal filed by
petitioner had not yet prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Respondent
Baliwag likewise faults petitioner's lackadaisical attitude in enforcing his
right. It argues that petitioner's failure to question his dismissal sooner
bars him from assailing the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Respondent
Baliwag cannot invoke laches to bar a cause of action which was filed within

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"x x x Laches is a doctrine in
equity while prescription is based on law. Our courts are basically courts of
law not courts of equity. Thus, laches cannot be invoked to resist the
enforcement of an existing legal right. We have ruled in <i>Arsenal v.
Intermediate Appellate Court  </i>x x x
that it  is a long standing principle
that equity follows the law. Courts exercising equity jurisdiction are bound by
rules of law and have no arbitrary discretion to disregard them. In  <i>Zabat, Jr. v. Court of Appeals </i>x x x,
this Court was more emphatic in upholding the rules of procedure. We said
therein:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family:Arial">'As for equity, which has been
aptly described as a 'justice outside legality,' this is applied only in the
absence of, and never against, statutory law or, as in this case, judicial
rules of procedure. <i>Aequetas nunguam contravenit legis.</i> The pertinent
positive rules being present here, they should preempt and prevail over all
abstract arguments based only on equity.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">"Thus, where the claim was
filed within the three -year statutory period, recovery therefore cannot be
barred by laches. Courts should never apply the doctrine of laches earlier than
the expiration of time limited for the commencement of actions at law." <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Going now to the
issue of dismissal, respondent Baliwag insists that petitioner was not

driving was the cause of the accident. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">For abandonment
to be a valid ground for dismissal, two requisites must be present: the
intention by an employee to abandon coupled with an overt act from which it may

discharge this burden. It did not adduce any proof to show that petitioner
clearly and unequivocally intended to abandon his job. Moreover, petitioner's
filing of the complaint for illegal dismissal negates respondent Baliwag's
charge of abandonment.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

must furnish the worker with two (2) written notices before termination of

employee of the particular acts or omissions for which his dismissal is sought.
This may be loosely considered as the proper charge. The second is the notice
informing the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him. This
decision, however, must come only after the employee is given a reasonable
period from receipt of the first notice within which to answer the charge, and
ample opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of his
representative, if he so desires.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The requirement of notice is not a
