				<H3>JULIETA B. NARAG, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. DOMINADOR M. NARAG, RESPONDENT. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Good moral character is a continuing qualification required of 
every member of the bar. Thus, when a lawyer fails to meet the exacting 
standard of moral integrity, the Supreme Court may withdraw his or her 
privilege to practice law.      
  <p>On November 13, 1989, Mrs. Julieta B. Narag filed an administrative complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 for disbarment against her husband, Atty. Dominador M. Narag, whom she 
accused of having violated Canons 1 and 6, Rule 1.01 of the Code of 
Ethics for Lawyers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
  <p>The complainant narrated: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“The St. Louis College of Tuguegarao engaged the services of 
Atty. Dominador M. Narag in the early seventies as a full-time college 
instructor in the College of Arts and Sciences and as a professor in the
 Graduate School. In 1984, Ms. Gina Espita, 17 years old and a first 
year college student, enrolled in subjects handled by Atty. Narag. 
Exerting his influence as her teacher, and as a prominent member of the 
legal profession and then member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Tuguegarao,
 Atty. Narag courted Ms. Espita, gradually lessening her resistance 
until the student acceded to his wishes. </p>
    <p>They then maintained an illicit relationship known in various 
circles in the community, but which they managed to keep from me. It 
therefore came as a terrible embar[r]assment to me, with unspeakable 
grief and pain when my husband abandoned us, his family, to live with 
Ms. Espita, in utterly scandalous circumstances.      </p>
    <p>It appears that Atty. Narag used his power and influence as a 
member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cagayan to cause the 
employment of Ms. Espita at the Department of Trade and Industry Central
 Office at Makati, Metro Manila. Out of gratitude perhaps, for this 
gesture, Ms. Espita agreed to live with Atty. Narag, her sense of 
right[e]ousness and morals completely corrupted by a member of the Bar. 
     </p>
    <p>It is now a common knowledge in the community that Atty. 
Dominador M. Narag has abandoned us, his family, to live with a 
22-year-old woman, who was his former student in the tertiary level[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This Court, in a Resolution dated December 18, 1989, referred the 
case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, 
report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
  <p>On June 26, 1990, the office of then Chief Justice Marcelo B. 
Fernan received from complainant another letter seeking the dismissal of
 the administrative complaint. She alleged therein that (1) she 
fabricated the allegations in her complaint to humiliate and spite her 
husband; (2) all the love letters between the respondent and Gina Espita
 were forgeries; and (3) she was suffering from “emotional confusion 
arising from extreme jealousy.” The truth, she stated, was that her 
husband had remained a faithful and responsible family man. She further 
asserted that he had neither entered into an amorous relationship with 
one Gina Espita nor abandoned his family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Supporting her letter were an Affidavit of Desistance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and a Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> attached as Annexes “A” and “B,” which she filed before the IBP commission on bar discipline.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In a Decision dated October 8, 1991, the IBP Board of Governors <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dismissed the complaint of Mrs. Narag for failure to prosecute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
  <p>The case took an unexpected turn when, on November 25, 1991, this Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> received another letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> from the complainant, with her seven children<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 as co-signatories, again appealing for the disbarment of her husband. 
She explained that she had earlier dropped the case against him because 
of his continuous threats against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
  <p>In his Comment on the complainant’s letter of November 11, 1991, 
filed in compliance with this Court’s Resolution issued on July 6, 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 respondent prayed that the decision of the Board of Governors be 
affirmed. Denying that he had threatened, harassed or intimidated his 
wife, he alleged that she had voluntarily executed her Affidavit of 
Desistance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 even appearing before the investigating officer, Commissioner Racela, 
to testify under oath “that she prepared the Motion to Dismiss and 
Affidavit of Desistance on her own free will and affirmed the contents 
thereof.”    </p>
  <p>In addition, he professed his love for his wife and his children 
and denied abandoning his family to live with his paramour. However, he 
described his wife as a person emotionally disturbed, <em>viz</em>.: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“What is pitiable here is the fact that Complainant is an 
incurably jealous and possessive woman, and every time the streak of 
jealousy rears its head, she fires off letters or complaints against her
 husband in every conceivable forum, all without basis, and purely on 
impulse, just to satisfy the consuming demands of her ‘loving’ jealousy.
 Then, as is her nature, a few hours afterwards, when her jealousy cools
 off, she repents and feels sorry for her acts against the Respondent. 
Thus, when she wrote the Letter of November 11, 1991, she was then in 
the grips of one of her bouts of jealousy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On August 24, 1992, this Court issued another Resolution referring the Comment of respondent to the IBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In the hearing before IBP Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose, respondent alleged the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“2.      Your Respondent comes from very poor parents who have 
left him not even a square meter of land, but gave him the best legacy 
in life: a purposeful and meaningful education. Complainant comes from 
what she claims to be very rich parents who value material possession 
more than education and the higher and nobler aspirations in life. 
Complainant abhors the poor. </p>
    <p>3.        Your Respondent has a loving upbringing, nurtured in 
the gentle ways of love, forgiveness, humility, and concern for the 
poor. Complainant was reared and raised in an entirely different 
environment. Her value system is the very opposite.      </p>
    <p>4.        Your Respondent loves his family very dearly, and has 
done all he could in thirty-eight (38) years of marriage to protect and 
preserve his family. He gave his family sustenance, a comfortable home, 
love, education, companionship, and most of all, a good and respected 
name. He was always gentle and compassionate to his wife and children. 
Even in the most trying times, he remained calm and never inflicted 
violence on them. His children are all now full-fledged professionals, 
mature, and gainfully employed. x x x      </p>
    <p align="center">xxx            xxx      xxx      </p>
    <p>Your Respondent subscribes to the sanctity of marriage as a social institution.      </p>
    <p>On the other hand, consumed by insane and unbearable jealousy, 
Complainant has been systematically and unceasingly destroying the very 
foundations of their marriage and their family. Their marriage has 
become a torture chamber in which Your Respondent has been incessantly 
BEATEN, BATTERED, BRUTALIZED, TORTURED, ABUSED, and HUMILIATED, 
physically, mentally, and emotionally, by the Complainant, in public and
 at home. Their marriage has become a nightmare.      </p>
    <p>For thirty-eight years, your Respondent suffered in silence and 
bore the pain of his misfortune with dignity and with almost infinite 
patience, if only to preserve their family and their marriage. But this 
is not to be. The Complainant never mellowed and never became gentl[e], 
loving, and understanding. In fact, she became more fierce and 
predatory.      </p>
    <p>Hence, at this point in time, the light at the tunnel for Your 
Respondent does not seem in sight. The darkness continues to shroud the 
marital and familial landscape.      </p>
    <p>Your Respondent has to undergo a catharsis, a liberation from 
enslavement. Paraphrasing Dorfman in ‘Death and the Maiden’, can the 
torturer and the tortured co-exist and live together? </p>
    <p>Hence, faced with an absolutely uncomprehending and 
uncompromising mind whose only obsession now is to destroy, destroy, and
 destroy, Your Respondent, with perpetual regret and with great sorrow, 
filed a Petition for Annulment of Marriage, Spl. Proc. No. 566, RTC, 
Branch III, Tuguegarao, Cagayan. x x x.      </p>
    <p>5.        Complainant is a violent husband-beater, vitriolic and 
unbending. But your Respondent never revealed these destructive 
qualities to other people. He preserved the good name and dignity of his
 wife. This is in compliance with the marital vow to love, honor or obey
 your spouse, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health. . . 
Even in this case, Your Respondent never revealed anything derogatory to
 his wife. It is only now that he is constrained to reveal all these 
things to defend himself.      </p>
    <p>On the other hand, for no reason at all, except a jealous rage, 
Complainant tells everyone, everywhere, that her husband is worthless, 
good-for-nothing, evil and immoral. She goes to colleges and 
universities, professional organizations, religious societies, and all 
other sectors of the community to tell them how evil, bad and immoral 
her husband is. She tells them not to hire him as professor, as Counsel,
 or any other capacity because her husband is evil, bad, and immoral. Is
 this love? Since when did love become an instrument to destroy a man’s 
dearest possession in life - his good name, reputation and dignity? </p>
    <p>Because of Complainant’s virulent disinformation campaign against
 her husband, employing every unethical and immoral means to attain his 
ends, Your Respondent has been irreparably and irreversibly disgraced, 
shamed, and humiliated. Your Respondent is not a scandalous man. It is 
he who has been mercilessly scandalized and crucified by the 
Complainant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To prove the alleged propensity of his wife to file false charges, 
respondent presented as evidence the following list of the complaints 
she had filed against him and Gina Espita: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint for Immorality/Neglect of Duty x x x<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>In his desperate effort to exculpate himself, he averred: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“I.        That all the alleged love letters and envelopes (xxx),
 picture (xxx) are inadmissible in evidence as enunciated by the Supreme
 Court in ‘Cecilia Zulueta vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.’, G.R. No. 
107383, February 20, 1996. (xxx). </p>
    <p align="center">xxx                                                xxx                                        xxx  </p>
    <p>II.        That respondent is totally innocent of the charges: He
 never courted Gina Espita in the Saint Louis College of Tuguegarao. He 
never caused the employment of said woman in the DTI. He never had or is
 having any illicit relationship with her anywhere, at any time. He 
never lived with her as husband and wife anywhere at any time, be it in 
Centro Tumauini or any of its barangays, or in any other place. He never
 begot a child or children with her. Finally, respondent submits that 
all the other allegations of Mrs. Narag are false and fabricated, xxx   
   </p>
    <p align="center">xxx                                                xxx                                        xxx </p>
    <p>III.       Respondent never abandoned his family[.] Mrs. Narag 
and her two sons forcibly drove respondent Narag out of the conjugal 
home. After that, Atty. Narag tried to return to the conjugal home many 
times with the help of mutual friends to save the marriage and the 
family from collapse. He tried several times to reconcile with Mrs. 
Narag. In fact, in one of the hearings of the disbarment case, he 
offered to return home and to reconcile with Mrs. Narag. But Mrs. Narag 
refused all these efforts of respondent Narag. xxx  </p>
    <p>IV.       Complainant Julieta B. Narag is an unbearably jealous, 
violent, vindictive, scandalous, virulent and merciless wife since the 
beginning of the marriage, who incessantly beat, battered, brutalized, 
tortured, abuse[d], scandalized, and humiliated respondent Atty. Narag, 
physically, mentally, emotionally, and psychologically, xxx.  </p>
    <p>V.        Complainant Julieta Narag’s claim in her 
counter-manifestation dated March 28, 1996, to the effect that the 
affidavit of Dominador B. Narag, Jr., dated February 27, 1996 was 
obtained through force and intimidation, is not true. Dominador, Jr., 
executed his affidavit freely, voluntarily, and absolutely without force
 or intimidation, as shown by the transcript of stenographic notes of 
the testimonies of Respondent Atty. Narag and Tuguegarao MTC Judge 
Dominador Garcia during the trial of Criminal Case No. 12439, People vs.
 Dominador M. Narag, et. al., before the Tuguegarao MTC on May 3, 1996. x

    <p>VI.       Respondent Atty. Narag is now an old man - a senior 
citizen of 63 years - sickly, abandoned, disgraced, weakened and 
debilitated by progressively degenerative gout and arthritis, and hardly
 able to earn his own keep. His very physical, medical, psychological, 
and economic conditions render him unfit and unable to do the things 
attributed to him by the complainant. Please see the attached medical 
certificates, x x x, among many other similar certificates touching on 
the same ailments. Respondent is also suffering from hypertension.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On July 18, 1997, the investigating officer submitted his report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 recommending the indefinite suspension of Atty. Narag from the practice
 of law. The material portions of said report read as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Culled from the voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence 
submitted by the contending parties, two (2) issues are relevant for the
 disposition of the case, namely: </p>
    <p>a)             Whether there was indeed a commission of alleged 
abandonment of respondent’s own family and [whether he was] living with 
his paramour, Gina Espita; </p>
    <p>b)             Whether the denial under oath that his 
illegitimate children with Gina Espita (Aurelle Dominic and Kyle 
Dominador) as appearing on paragraph 1(g) of respondent’s Comment 
vis-a-vis his handwritten love letters, the due execution and contents 
of which, although he objected to their admissibility for being 
allegedly forgeries, were never denied by him on the witness stand much 
less presented and offered proof to support otherwise. </p>
    <p>Except for the testimonies of respondent’s witnesses whose 
testimonies tend to depict the complaining wife, Mrs. Narag, as an 
incurably jealous wife and possessive woman suffering everytime with 
streaks of jealousy, respondent did not present himself on the witness 
stand to testify and be cross-examined on his sworn comment; much less 
did he present his alleged paramour, Gina Espita, to disprove the 
adulterous relationship between him and their having begotten their 
illegitimate children, namely: Aurelle Dominic N. Espita and Kyle 
Dominador N. Espita. Worse, respondent’s denial that he is the father of
 the two is a ground for disciplinary sanction (Morcayda v. Naz, 125 
SCRA 467). </p>
    <p>Viewed from all the evidence presented, we find the respondent 
subject to disciplinary action as a member of the legal profession.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> 
issued on August 23, 1997, the IBP adopted and approved the 
investigating commissioner’s recommendation for the indefinite 
suspension of the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 Subsequently, the complainant sought the disbarment of her husband in a
 Manifestation/Comment she filed on October 20, 1997. The IBP granted 
this stiffer penalty and, in its Resolution dated November 30, 1997, 
denied respondent’s Motion for Reconsideration.  </p>
  <p>After a careful scrutiny of the records of the proceedings and the 
evidence presented by the parties, we find that the conduct of 
respondent warrants the imposition of the penalty of disbarment.  </p>
  <p>The Code of Professional Responsibility provides: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Rule 1.01--  A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.” </p>
    <p>”CANON 7-- A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and 
dignity of the legal profession, and support the activities of the 
Integrated Bar. </p>
    <p>Rule 7.03--    A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that 
adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor should he, 
whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the 
discredit of the legal profession.” </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus, good moral character is not only a condition precedent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to the practice of law, but a <em>continuing</em>
 qualification for all members of the bar. Hence, when a lawyer is found
 guilty of gross immoral conduct, he may be suspended or disbarred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p>
  <p>Immoral conduct has been defined as that conduct which is so 
willful, flagrant, or shameless as to show indifference to the opinion 
of good and respectable members of the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Furthermore, such conduct must not only be immoral, but <em>grossly</em> immoral. That is, it must be so corrupt as to constitute a criminal act <em>or so unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> or committed under such scandalous or revolting circumstances as to shock the common sense of decency.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p>
  <p>We explained in <em>Barrientos vs. Daarol</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 that, “as officers of the court, lawyers must not only in fact be of 
good moral character but must also be seen to be of good moral character
 and leading lives in accordance with the highest moral standards of the
 community. More specifically, a member of the Bar and officer of the 
court is not only required to refrain from adulterous relationships or 
the keeping of mistresses but must also so behave himself as to avoid 
scandalizing the public by creating the belief that he is flouting those
 moral standards.” </p>
  <p>Respondent Narag is accused of gross immorality for abandoning his 
family in order to live with Gina Espita. The burden of proof rests upon
 the complainant, and the Court will exercise its disciplinary power 
only if she establishes her case by clear, convincing and satisfactory 
evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p>
  <p>Presented by complainant as witnesses, aside from herself,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> were: Charlie Espita,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Magdalena Bautista,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Bienvenido Eugenio,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Alice Carag,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Dr. Jervis B.

  <p>Charlie Espita, brother of the alleged paramour Gina Espita, 
corroborated complainant’s charge against respondent in these 
categorical statements he gave to the investigating officer:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> “Q    Mr. Witness, do you know Atty. Narag? </p>
    <p>A      Yes, Your Honor, he is the live-in partner of my sister, Gina Espita.                </p>
    <p>Q     If Atty. Narag is here, can you point [to] him?                </p>
    <p>A      Yes, sir.

  </blockquote>
  <p>During cross-examination conducted by the respondent himself, 
Charlie Espita repeated his account that his sister Gina was living with
 the respondent, with whom she had two children: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Q    Mr. Espita, you claim that Atty. Narag is now living with your sister as husband and wife. You claim that? </p>
    <p>A      Yes, sir.                </p>
    <p>Q     Why do you say that?                </p>
    <p>A      Because at present you are living together as husband and 
wife and you have already two children and I know that that is really an
 immoral act which you cannot just allow me to follow since my moral 
values don’t allow me that my sister is living with a married man like 
you. </p>

    <p>Q     <u>How do you know that they are the children of Atty. Narag?</u> </p>

  <p>In addition, Charlie Espita admitted (1) that it was he who handed 
to Mrs. Narag the love letters respondent had sent to his sister, and 
(2) that Atty. Narag tried to dissuade him from appearing at the 
disbarment proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p>
  <p>Witness Bienvenido Eugenio strengthened the testimony of Charlie Espita in this wise: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Q    Mr. Witness, do you know the respondent in this case? </p>
    <p>A      I know him very well, sir.                </p>
    <p>Q     Could you please tell us why do you know him?                </p>

    <p align="center">xxx                                                xxx                                        xxx                </p>

    <p>Q     <u>And under oath this is where Atty. Narag and Gina Espita are allegedly living as husband and wife, is it not</u>?                </p>
    <p>A      Yes, sir.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Witness Nieves Reyes, a neighbor and friend of the estranged 
couple, testified that she learned from the Narag children -- Randy, 
Bong and Rowena -- that their father left his family, that she and her 
husband prodded the complainant to accept the respondent back, that the 
Narag couple again separated when the respondent “went back to his 
woman,” and that Atty. Narag had maltreated his wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p>
  <p>On the strength of the testimony of her witnesses, the complainant 
was able to establish that respondent abandoned his family and lived 
with another woman. Absent any evidence showing that these witnesses had
 an ill motive to testify falsely against the respondent, their 
testimonies are deemed worthy of belief.                </p>
  <p>Further, the complainant presented as evidence the love letters 
that respondent had sent to Gina. In these letters, respondent clearly 
manifested his love for Gina and her two children, whom he acknowledged 
as his own. In addition, complainant also submitted as evidence the 
cards that she herself had received from him. Guided by the rule that 
handwriting may be proved through a comparison of one set of writings 
with those admitted or treated by the respondent as genuine, we affirm 
that the two sets of evidence were written by one and the same person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
 Besides, respondent did not present any evidence to prove that the love
 letters were not really written by him; he merely denied that he wrote 
them.                </p>
  <p>While the burden of proof is upon the complainant, respondent has 
the duty not only to himself but also to the court to show that he is 
morally fit to remain a member of the bar. Mere denial does not suffice.
 Thus, when his moral character is assailed, such that his right to 
continue practicing his cherished profession is imperiled, he must meet 
the charges squarely and present evidence, to the satisfaction of the 
investigating body and this Court, that he is morally fit to have his 
name in the Roll of Attorneys.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This he failed to do.                </p>
  <p>Respondent adamantly denies abandoning his family to live with Gina
 Espita. At the same time, he depicts his wife as a “violent 
husband-beater, vitriolic and unbending,” and as an “insanely and 
pathologically jealous woman,” whose only obsession was to “destroy, 
destroy and destroy” him as shown by her filing of a series of allegedly
 unfounded charges against him (and Gina Espita). To prove his 
allegation, he presented ninety-eight (98) pieces of documentary 
evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and ten (10) witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p>
  <p>We note, however, that the testimonies of the witnesses of 
respondent did not establish the fact that he maintained that moral 
integrity required by the profession that would render him fit to 
continue practicing law. Neither did their testimonies destroy the fact,
 as proven by the complainant, that he had abandoned his family and 
lived with Gina Espita, with whom he had two children. Some of them 
testified on matters which they had no actual knowledge of, but merely 
relied on information from either respondent himself or other people, 
while others were presented to impeach the good character of his wife.  
              </p>
  <p>Respondent may have provided well for his family -- they enjoyed a 
comfortable life and his children finished their education. He may have 
also established himself as a successful lawyer and a seasoned 
politician. But these accomplishments are not sufficient to show his 
moral fitness to continue being a member of the noble profession of law.
                </p>
  <p>We remind respondent that parents have not only rights but also duties – <em>e.g.</em>,
 to support, educate and instruct their children according to right 
precepts and good example; and to give them love, companionship and 
understanding, as well as moral and spiritual guidance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
 As a husband, he is also obliged to live with his wife; to observe 
mutual love, respect and fidelity; and to render help and support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p>
  <p>Respondent himself admitted that his work required him to be often 
away from home. But the evidence shows that he was away not only because
 of his work; instead, he abandoned his family to live with his 
paramour, who bore him two children. It would appear, then, that he was 
hardly in a position to be a good husband or a good father. His 
children, who grew up mostly under the care of their mother, must have 
scarcely felt the warmth of their father’s love.                </p>
  <p>Respondent’s son, Jervis B. Narag, showed his resentment towards his father’s moral frailties in his testimony:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Q    My question is this, is there any sin so grievous that it 
cannot be forgiven, is there a fault that is so serious that it is 
incapable of forgiveness? </p>
    <p>A      That depends upon the sin or fault, sir, but if the sin or
 fault is with the emotional part of myself, I suppose I cannot forgive a
 person although I am a God-fearing person, but I h[av]e to give the 
person a lesson in order for him or her to at least realize his 
mistakes, sir.                  </p>
    <p align="center">xxx                                                xxx                                        xxx                  </p>
    <p>COMR. JOSE:                  </p>
    <p>I think it sounds like this. Assuming for the sake of argument 
that your father is the worst, hardened criminal on earth, would you 
send him to jail and have him disbarred? That is the question.          
        </p>
    <p>CONTINUATION.                  </p>
    <p>A      With the reputation that he had removed from us, I suppose
 he has to be given a lesson. At this point in time, I might just 
forgive him if he will have to experience all the pains that we have 
also suffered for quite sometime.                  </p>
    <p>Q     Dr. Narag, your father gave you life, his blood runs in 
your veins, his flesh is your flesh, his bones are your bones and you 
now disown him because he is the worst man on earth, is that what you 
are saying.                  </p>
    <p>A      Sort of, sir.                  </p>
    <p>Q     You are now telling that as far [as] you are concerned 
because your father has sinned, you have no more father, am I correct?  
                </p>
    <p>A      Long before, sir, I did not feel much from my father even 
when I was still a kid because my father is not always staying with us 
at home. So, how can you say that? Yes, he gave me life, why not? But 
for sure, sir, you did not give me love.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Another son, Dominador Narag, Jr., narrated before the investigating officer the trauma he went through:                  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q     In connection with that affidavit, Mr. Witness, which 
contains the fact that your father is maintaining a paramour, could you 
please tell this Honorable Commission the effect on you?</p>
    <p> A      This has a very strong effect on me and this includes my 
brothers and sisters, especially my married life, sir. And it also 
affected my children so much, that I and my wife ha[ve] parted ways. It 
hurts to say that I and my wife parted ways. This is one reason that 
affected us.                  </p>
    <p>Q     Will you please tell us specifically why you and your wife parted ways?                  </p>
    <p>A      Because my wife wa[s] ashamed of what happened to my 
family and that she could not face the people, our community, especially
 because my wife belongs to a well-known family in our community.       
           </p>
    <p>Q     How about the effect on your brothers and sisters? Please tell us what are those.                  </p>
    <p>A      Well, sir, this has also affected the health of my elder 
sister because she knows so well that my mother suffered so much and she
 kept on thinking about my mother.                  </p>
    <p align="center">xxx     xxx                                  xxx                  </p>
    <p>Q     Why did your wife leave you?                  </p>
    <p>A      The truth is because of the things that had happened in our family, Your Honor.                  </p>
    <p>Q     In your wife’s family? </p>
    <p>A      In our family, sir.                  </p>
    <p>Q     And what do you mean by that?                  </p>
    <p>A      What I meant by that is my father had an illicit 
relationship and that my father went to the extent of scolding my wife 
and calling my wife a “puta” in provincial government, which my 
mother-in-law hated him so much for this, which really affected us. And 
then my wife knew for a fact that my father has an illicit relationship 
with Gina Espita, whom he bore two children by the name of Aurelle 
Dominic and Kyle Dominador, which I could prove and I stand firm to 
this, Your Honor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Although respondent piously claims adherence to the sanctity of 
marriage, his acts prove otherwise. A husband is not merely a man who 
has contracted marriage. Rather, he is a partner who has solemnly sworn 
to love and respect his wife and remain faithful to her until death.    
              </p>
  <p>We reiterate our ruling in <em>Cordova vs. Cordova</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>
 “The moral delinquency that affects the fitness of a member of the bar 
to continue as such includes conduct that outrages the generally 
accepted moral standards of the community, conduct for instance, which 
makes a mockery of the inviolable social institution of marriage.” </p>
  <p>In <em>Toledo vs. Toledo</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>
 the respondent was disbarred from the practice of law, when he 
abandoned his lawful wife and cohabited with another woman who had borne
 him a child.                  </p>
  <p>Likewise, in <em>Obusan vs. Obusan</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>
 the respondent was disbarred after the complainant proved that he had 
abandoned her and maintained an adulterous relationship with a married 
woman. This Court declared that respondent failed to maintain the 
highest degree of morality expected and required of a member of the bar.
                  </p>
  <p>In the present case, the complainant was able to establish, by 
clear and convincing evidence, that respondent had breached the high and
 exacting moral standards set for members of the law profession. As held
 in <em>Maligsa vs. Cabanting</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>
 “a lawyer may be disbarred for any misconduct, whether in his 
professional or private capacity, which shows him to be wanting in moral
 character, in honesty, probity and good demeanor or unworthy to 
continue as an officer of the court.” </p>
