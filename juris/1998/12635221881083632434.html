  <p>In <em>Philippine Interisland Shipping Association of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court, <em>en banc</em>, ruled that Executive Order 1088<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> was not unconstitutional. We adhere to said ruling in this case.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><strong>The Case</strong></u><strong>  </strong></p>
  <p>This is a petition for certiorari under Rule 45, assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in CA-GR CV No. 34487 promulgated on July 18, 1994, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"WHEREFORE, finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby <em>AFFIRMED</em> in toto. With costs against defendant-appellant."    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Decision affirmed by Respondent Court disposed as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered directing the defendant:    </p>
  <ol><li>To pay plaintiff the sum of P602,710.04 with legal rate of 
interest commencing from the filing of the complaint representing unpaid
 pilotage fees;    </li><li>To pay attorney’s fees in the sum of P50,000.00; </li><li>And costs. </li></ol>
  <p>SO ORDERED." </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
  <p align="center"><u><strong>The Facts</strong></u><strong>    </strong></p>
  <p>As found by the trial court, these are the undisputed facts: </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>"On September 25, 1989, plaintiff [herein private respondent] 
elevated a complaint against defendant [herein petitioner] for sum of 
money and attorney’s fees alleging that plaintiff had rendered pilotage 
services to defendant between January 14, 1987 to July 22, 1989 with 
total unpaid fees of P703,290.18. Despite repeated demands, defendant 
failed to pay and prays that the latter be directed to pay P703,290.18 
with legal rate of interest from the filing of the complaint; attorney’s
 fees equivalent to 25% of the principal obligation and such other 
relief.    </p>
  <p>On November 18, 1989 defendant answered vigorously disputing the 
claims of plaintiff. It assailed the constitutionality of the Executive 
Order 1088 upon which plaintiff bases its claims; alleged that there is a
 pending case before the Court of Appeals elevated by the United Harbor 
Pilots Association of the Philippines of which plaintiff is a member[;] 
whereas defendant is a member of the Chamber of Maritime Industries of 
the Philippine[s] which is an Intervenor in CA-G.R. SP No. 18072; that 
there therefore is <u>lis pendens</u> by Section 1 (e), Rule 16 of the 
Rules; that the subject of the complaint falls within the scope and 
authority of the Philippine Ports Authority by virtue of PD No. 857 
dated December 23, 1975; that Executive Order No. 1088 is an unwarranted
 repeal or modification of the Philippine Ports Authority Charter; that 
the fees charged by plaintiff are arbitrary and confiscatory; and the 
basis of the Executive Order 1088 is offensive, sourced from Amendment 
No. 6 of the 1973 Constitution and rendered inoperative by the Freedom 
Constitution of March 25, 1986 and the present Constitution; and that 
the only agency vested by law to prescribe such rates, charges or fees 
for services rendered by any private organization like the plaintiff 
within a Port District is governed by Section 20 of PD 857. As regular 
patron of plaintiff, defendant has never been remiss in paying 
plaintiff’s claim for pilotage fees and the present complaint under the 
foregoing circumstances is without legal foundation. Defendant prays 
that plaintiff be advised to await the final outcome of the identical 
issues already elevated to and pending before the Court of Appeals as 
CA-G.R. SP No. 18072. Defendant prays for an award of damages, 
attorney’s fees, litigation expense and costs.    </p>
  <p>At the Pre-Trial Conference, the only issue raised by plaintiff is 
whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the money claims 
alleged in the complaint.
    The defendant on the other hand raised the following issues:    </p>
  <ol><li> Whether or not Executive Order 1088 is constitutional; </li><li> Whether or not Executive Order 1088 is illegal; </li><li> Whether or not the plaintiff may motu proprio and independently
 of the Public Estates Authority enforce Executive Order 1088 and 
collect the pilotage fees prescribed thereunder; </li><li> Assuming Executive Order 1088 is constitutional, valid and 
self-executory, whether or not the defendant is liable; and if so, to 
what extent and for what particular items; and </li><li> Whether or not the plaintiff is liable under the counterclaims (p. 102, Expediente). </li></ol>
  <p>On September 5, 1990, plaintiff presented witness Capt. Felix N. 
Galope, in the course of which testimony identified among others 
EXHIBITS “B” to "E-2" and "J" to to "I-2" consisting of documents 
related to the collection of the unpaid pilotage fees; basis for such 
computations; Statement of Accounts; demand letter and official 
recipients of payment made.    </p>
  <p>On September 6, 1990, Simplicio Barao, plaintiff’s Billing Clerk 
testified among others on the records of plaintiff’s Captain’s 
Certificate/Pilotage Chits and Bills/Statements of Accounts on the 
claims against defendant (EXHIBITS "G" to "H-48-A") and the details of 
the outstanding accounts in favor of plaintiff. The records show 
defendant raised no objection thereto and by virtue of which all of 
plaintiff’s documentary exhibits were admitted. (Order dated January 14,
 1991, p. 277 Expediente).    </p>
  <p>On March 14, 1991, defendant presented Celso Occidental, employee 
of defendant shipping company, in the course of which testimony 
submitted EXHIBITS "1" to "1-D" which is plaintiff’s Billing Rate, both 
old and new with a payment of P79,585.64; and "2" to "2-G" representing 
plane ticket paid for by defendant for transportation expenses of its 
counsel and cost of stenographic transcripts.    </p>
  <p>Defendant’s last witness, Capt. Jose Dubouzet, Jr. and a Harbor Pilot was briefly presented."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>After due trial, the trial court rendered its ruling, <em>viz</em>.: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Plaintiff’s evidence as to the unpaid pilotage services due from
 defendant duly supported by voluminous documentary exhibits has not 
been refuted nor rebutted by defendant. On the contrary, when 
plaintiff’s documentary exhibits were formally offered, defendant did 
not raise any objection thereby leaving the documents unchallenged and 
undisputed. </p>
    <p>Upon the other hand, while the records show that defendant raised
 no less than five (5) issues the evidence fails to show any proof to 
sustain defendant’s posture. On the contrary, neither of defendant’s two
 witnesses appear to have even grazed the outer peripheries of what 
could have been interesting issues with far-reaching consequences if 
resolved.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The factual antecedents of the controversy are simple. Petitioner 
insists on paying pilotage fees prescribed under PPA circulars. Because 
EO 1088 sets a higher rate, petitioner now assails its 
constitutionality.    </p>
  <p align="center"><u><strong>Public Respondent’s Ruling </strong></u></p>
  <p>As stated earlier, Respondent Court of Appeals affirmed the trial 
court’s decision. Respondent Court pointed out that petitioner, during 
the pre-trial, limited the issues to whether: (1) EO 1088 is 
unconstitutional; (2) EO 1088 is illegal; (3) private respondent itself 
may enforce and collect fees under EO 1088; and (4) petitioner is liable
 and, if EO 1088 is legal, to what extent. It then affirmed the factual 
findings and conclusion of the trial court that petitioner “fail[ed] to 
show any proof” to support its position. Parenthetically, Respondent 
Court also noted two other cases decided by the Court of Appeals, 
upholding the constitutionality of EO 1088.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
  <p align="center"><strong><u>The Issue    </u></strong></p>
  <p>In sum, petitioner raises this main issue: whether Executive Order 1088 is unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
  <p align="center"><u><strong>The Court’s Ruling </strong></u></p>
  <p>The petition is unmeritorious.    </p>
  <p align="center"><u><strong><em>EO 1088 Is Valid</em></strong></u><strong><em>    </em></strong></p>
  <p>Petitioner contends that EO 1088<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> is unconstitutional, because (1) its interpretation and application are left to private respondent, a private person,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 and (2) it constitutes an undue delegation of powers. Petitioner 
insists that it should pay pilotage fees in accordance with and on the 
basis of the memorandum circulars issued by the PPA, the administrative 
body vested under PD 857<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
with the power to regulate and prescribe pilotage fees. In assailing the
 constitutionality of EO 1088, the petitioner repeatedly asks: “Is the 
private respondent vested with power to interpret Executive Order No. 
1088?”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
  <p>The Court is not persuaded. The pertinent provisions of EO 1088 read: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“SECTION 1. The following shall be the rate of pilotage fees or 
charges based on tonnage for services rendered to both foreign and

  </blockquote>
  <p>In <em>Philippine Interisland Shipping Association of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 the Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, upheld the 
validity and constitutionality of Executive Order 1088 in no uncertain 
terms. We aptly iterate our pronouncement in said case, <em>viz</em>.: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“It is not an answer to say that E.O. No. 1088 should not be 
considered a statute because that would imply the withdrawal of power 
from the PPA. What determines whether an act is a law or an 
administrative issuance is not its form but its nature. Here as we have 
already said, the power to fix the rates of charges for services, 
including pilotage service, has always been regarded as legislative in 
character. </p>
    <p align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x </p>
    <p>It is worthy to note that E.O. NO. 1088 provides for adjusted 
pilotage service rates without withdrawing the power of the PPA to 
impose, prescribe, increase or decrease rates, charges or fees. The 
reason is because E.O. No. 1088 is not meant simply to fix new pilotage 
rates. Its legislative purpose is the “rationalization of pilotage 
service charges, through the imposition of uniform and adjusted rates 
for foreign and coastwise vessels in all Philippine ports. </p>
    <p align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x </p>
    <p>We conclude that E.O. No. 1088 is a valid statute and that the 
PPA is duty bound to comply with its provisions. The PPA may increase 
the rates but it may not decrease them below those mandated by E.O. No. 
1088. x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We see no reason to depart from this ruling. The Court’s holding 
clearly debunks petitioner’s insistence on paying its pilotage fees 
based on memorandum circulars issued by the PPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 Because the PPA circulars are inconsistent with EO 1088, they are void 
and ineffective. “Administrative or executive acts, orders and 
regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the laws 
or the Constitution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As stated by this Court in <em>Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 “[t]he conclusive effect of administrative construction is not 
absolute. Action of an administrative agency may be disturbed or set 
aside by the judicial department if there is an error of law, a grave 
abuse of power or lack of jurisdiction, or grave abuse of discretion 
clearly conflicting with either the letter or spirit of the law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 It is axiomatic that an administrative agency, like the PPA, has no 
discretion whether to implement the law or not. Its duty is to enforce 
it. Unarguably, therefore, if there is any conflict between the PPA 
circular and a law, such as EO 1088, the latter prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p>
  <p>Based on the foregoing, petitioner has no legal basis to refuse 
payment of pilotage fees to private respondent, as computed according to
 the rates set by EO 1088. Private respondent cannot be faulted for 
relying on the clear and unmistakable provisions of EO 1088. In fact, EO
 1088 leaves no room for interpretation, thereby unmistakably showing 
the duplicity of petitioner’s query: “Is the private respondent vested 
with power to interpret Executive Order No. 1088?” </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is hereby <em>DENIED</em> and the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is <em>AFFIRMED</em>. Costs against petitioner.    </p>
