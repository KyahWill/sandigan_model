motion for reconsideration thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The facts are as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Respondent
spouses Raul and Elea Claveria, doing business under the name "Agro
Brokers," applied for a loan with respondent Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation
(now SOLIDBANK) in the amount of Two Million Eight Hundred Seventy Five
Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>2, 875,000.00) to finance the purchase of two (2)
maritime barges and one tugboat</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> which would be used in their
molasses business. The loan was granted subject to the condition that
respondent spouses execute a chattel mortgage over the three (3) vessels to be
acquired and that a continuing guarantee be executed by Ayala International
Philippines, Inc., now herein petitioner E. Zobel, Inc. in favor of SOLIDBANK.
The respondent spouses agreed to the arrangement. Consequently, a chattel
mortgage and a Continuing Guaranty</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> were executed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Respondent
spouses defaulted in the payment of the entire obligation upon maturity. Hence,
on January 31,1991, SOLIDBANK filed a complaint for sum of money with a prayer
for a writ of preliminary attachment, against respondents spouses and
petitioner. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 91-55909 in the Regional
Trial Court of Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Petitioner moved
to dismiss the complaint on the ground that its liability as guarantor of the
loan was extinguished pursuant to Article 2080 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines. It argued that it has lost its right to be subrogated to the first
chattel mortgage in view of SOLIDBANK's failure to register the chattel
mortgage with the appropriate government agency. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">SOLIDBANK
opposed the motion contending that Article 2080 is not applicable because
petitioner is not a guarantor but a surety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On February 18,
1993, the trial court issued an Order, portions of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"After a careful consideration
of the matter on hand, the Court finds the ground of the motion to dismiss
without merit. The document referred to as 'Continuing Guaranty'  dated August 21,1985 (Exh. 7) states as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">'For and in consideration of any
existing indebtedness to you of Agro Brokers, a single proprietorship owned by
Mr. Raul Claveria for the payment of which the undersigned is now obligated to
you as surety and in order to induce you, in your discretion, at any other manner,
to, or at the request or for the account of the borrower, x x x '<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"The provisions of the
document are clear, plain and explicit.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"Clearly therefore, defendant
E. Zobel, Inc. signed as surety. Even though the title of the document is
'Continuing Guaranty', the Court's interpretation is not limited to the title
alone but to the contents and intention of the parties more specifically if the
language is clear and positive. The obligation of the defendant Zobel being
that of a surety, Art. 2080 New Civil Code will not apply as it is only for
those acting as guarantor.  In fact, in
the letter of January 31, 1986 of the defendants (spouses and Zobel) to the
plaintiff it is requesting that the chattel mortgage on the vessels and tugboat
be waived and/or rescinded by the bank inasmuch as the said loan is covered by
the Continuing Guaranty by Zobel in favor of the plaintiff thus thwarting the
claim of the defendant now that the chattel mortgage is an essential condition
of the guaranty. In its letter, it said that because of the Continuing Guaranty
in favor of the plaintiff the chattel mortgage is rendered unnecessary and
redundant.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"With regard to the claim that
the failure of the plaintiff to register the chattel mortgage with the proper
government agency, i.e. with the Office of the Collector of Customs or with the
Register of Deeds makes the obligation a guaranty, the same merits a scant
consideration and could not be taken by this Court as the basis of the
extinguishment of the obligation of the defendant corporation to the plaintiff
as surety. The chattel mortgage is an additional security and should not be
considered as payment of the debt in case of failure of payment. The same is
true with the failure to register, extinction of the liability would not lie.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">"WHEREFORE,
the Motion to Dismiss is hereby denied and defendant E. Zobel, Inc., is ordered
to file its answer to the complaint within ten (10) days from receipt of a copy
of this Order."</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Petitioner moved
for reconsideration but was denied on April 26,1993.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Thereafter,
petitioner questioned said Orders before the respondent Court of Appeals,
through a petition for certiorari, alleging that the trial court committed
grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On July 13,1993,
the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed decision the dispositive portion of
which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"WHEREFORE, finding that
respondent Judge has not committed any grave abuse of discretion in issuing the
herein assailed orders, We hereby DISMISS the petition."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A motion for reconsideration
filed by petitioner was denied for lack of merit on February 15,1994.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Petitioner now
comes to us <i>via</i> this petition arguing that the respondent Court of
Appeals erred in its finding: (1) that Article 2080 of the New Civil Code which
provides: "The guarantors, even though they be solidary, are released from
their obligation whenever by some act of the creditor they cannot be subrogated
to the rights, mortgages, and preferences of the latter," is not
applicable to petitioner; (2) that petitioner's obligation to respondent
SOLIDBANK under the continuing guaranty is that of a surety; and (3) that the
failure of respondent SOLIDBANK to register the chattel mortgage did not
extinguish petitioner's liability to respondent SOLIDBANK.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">We shall first
resolve the issue of  whether or not
petitioner under the "Continuing Guaranty" obligated itself to
SOLIDBANK as a guarantor or a surety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A contract of
surety is an  accessory promise by which
a person binds himself for another already bound, and agrees with the creditor
to satisfy the obligation if the debtor does not.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A contract of guaranty, on the other
hand, is a collateral undertaking to pay the debt of another in case the latter
does not pay the debt.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Strictly
speaking, guaranty and surety are nearly  related, and many of the principles are common to both. However, under
our civil law,  they  may be distinguished thus: A surety is
usually bound with his principal by the same instrument, executed at the same
time, and on the same consideration. He is an original promissor and debtor
from the beginning, and is held, ordinarily, to know every default of his
principal. Usually, he will not be discharged, either by the mere indulgence of
the creditor to the principal, or by want of notice of the default of the principal,
no matter how much he may be injured thereby. On the other hand, the contract
of guaranty is the guarantor's own separate undertaking, in which the principal
does not join. It is usually entered into before or after that of the
principal, and is often supported on a separate consideration from that
supporting the contract of the principal. The original contract of his
principal is not his contract, and he is not bound to take notice of its
non-performance. He is often discharged by the mere indulgence of the creditor
to the principal, and is usually not liable unless notified of the default of
the principal.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Simply put, a
surety is distinguished from a guaranty in that a guarantor is the insurer of
the solvency of the debtor and thus binds himself to pay if the principal is <b><i>unable
to pay </i></b>while a surety is the insurer of the debt, and he obligates
himself to pay if the principal <b><i>does not pay.</i></b></span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Based on the
aforementioned definitions, it appears that the contract executed by petitioner
in favor of SOLIDBANK,  albeit
denominated as a "Continuing Guaranty," is a contract of surety. The
terms of the contract categorically obligates petitioner as "<b>surety</b>"
to induce SOLIDBANK to extend credit to respondent spouses. This can be seen in
the following stipulations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"For and in consideration of
any existing indebtedness to you of AGRO BROKERS, a single proprietorship owned
by MR. RAUL P. CLAVERIA, of legal age, married and with business address x x x

advances or to extend credit in any other manner to, or at the request or for

make any loans or advances evidenced or secured by  any notes, bills receivable, drafts, acceptances, checks or other
instruments or evidences of indebtedness x x upon which the Borrower  is or may become liable as maker, endorser,
acceptor, or otherwise, <b>the undersigned agrees to guarantee, and does hereby

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">One need not
look too deeply at the contract to determine the nature of the undertaking and
the intention of the parties. The contract clearly disclose that petitioner
assumed liability to SOLIDBANK, as a regular party to the undertaking and
obligated itself as an original promissor. It bound itself jointly and
severally to the obligation with the respondent spouses. In fact, SOLIDBANK
need not resort to all other legal remedies or exhaust respondent spouses'
properties before it can hold petitioner liable for the obligation. This can be
gleaned from a reading of the stipulations in the contract, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The use of the
term "<b>guarantee</b>" does not <i>ipso facto</i> mean that the
contract is one of guaranty. Authorities recognize that the word "<b>guarantee</b>"  is frequently employed in business
transactions to describe not the security of the debt but an intention to be
bound by a primary or independent obligation.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> As aptly observed by the trial
court, the interpretation of a contract is not limited to the title alone but
to the contents and intention of the parties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Having thus
established that petitioner is a surety, Article 2080 of the Civil Code, relied
upon by petitioner, finds no application to the case at bar. In <i>Bicol
Savings and Loan Association vs. Guinhawa</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> we have ruled that Article 2080 of

guarantor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">But even
assuming that Article 2080 is applicable, SOLIDBANK's  failure to register the chattel mortgage did not release
petitioner from the obligation. In the Continuing Guaranty executed in favor of
SOLIDBANK, petitioner bound itself to the contract irrespective of the
existence of any collateral. It even released SOLIDBANK from any fault or
negligence that may impair the contract.  The pertinent portions of the contract so provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
