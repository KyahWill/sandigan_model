				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">At  bench  is a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, in conjunction
with Section 2, Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court, and Section 1, Rule 37 of the
1993 Comelec Rules of Procedure, to review and annul the Resolution of
respondent Commission on Elections which set aside the Order, dated March 28,
1996, of Branch 11 of the Regional Trial Court in Basilan Province, directing
execution of the judgment of said court which found and adjudged the herein
petitioner, Halim Asmala, as the duly elected Vice Mayor of the Municipality of
Tuburan, Province of Basilan, and ordering his proclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The antecedent
facts are, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the elections of May 8, 1995,
eight candidates vied for the position of Vice Mayor for the Municipality of
Tuburan, Province of Basilan.  The
canvass of votes by the Municipal Board of Canvassers, indicated that : <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hadji Husni Mohammad  garnered <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3,065
votes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Emmanuel  “Manny” Alano <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2,912
votes,  and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Halim Asmala got<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2,542
votes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On the basis of
the aforestated results of canvass of votes, Hadji Husni Mohammad was
proclaimed, and later he assumed office as Vice Mayor of  Tuburan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On May 22,
1995,  Halim Asmala filed an election
protest with the Regional Trial Court of Basilan.  Docketed as Election Case No. 4-95, the protest alleged that
election fraud and other irregularities tainted the election and canvass of
votes.  On the same day, another
candidate, Emmanuel Alano,  also filed
his protest.  Docketed as Election Protest
No. 6-95, it was consolidated with Election Protest No. 4-95.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">During the
hearing, the court <i><u>a</u></i> <i><u>quo</u></i> found that several ballots
were written by just  one hand while
other ballots were prepared by only two persons.  Consequently, such ballots were invalidated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On February 14,
1996, the trial court rendered its decision in said election cases, crediting
Halim Asmala, the herein petitioner,  with 2,130 votes, Emmanuel Alano with 1, 920 votes and Hadji Husni
Mohammad with 1,729  votes, and
adjudging petitioner the duly elected Vice Mayor of Tuburan, Province of
Basilan.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On February 26,
1996, after the promulgation of the aforementioned decision, private respondent
Hadji Husni Mohammad filed his Notice of Appeal with the same Regional Trial
Court.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On the following
day, February 27, 1996, petitioner presented a Motion for Execution Pending
Appeal.  Thereto, private respondent
Mohammad interposed  his
opposition,  theorizing that his
perfected appeal divested  the trial
court of jurisdiction to resolve the Motion for Execution Pending Appeal.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In his Rejoinder
to Respondent’s Opposition to the Motion for Execution Pending Appeal,
petitioner placed reliance on the ruling of this court in  Edding vs. COMELEC,  246 SCRA 502 to the effect that  the mere filing  of  a Notice of Appeal
does not divest the trial court of  jurisdiction over the case and to resolve pending incidents, including
motions  for execution of judgment
pending appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In his Comment
on  the Rejoinder, the private
respondent opined that the case of Edding aforecited is inapplicable for the
reason that the motion for execution in question was filed after perfection of
his appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On March 28,
1996, after due hearing, the trial court came out with a Special Order,
granting the Motion for Execution Pending Appeal, of petitioner who was
required to post therefor a bond in the amount of <s>P</s>30,000.00,  and instructing the sheriff concerned to
install petitioner as Vice Mayor of Tuburan, Province of Basilan, after the
latter’s  proclamation by the Commission
on Elections,  and taking oath of
office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On April 1,
1996, the trial court, after  approving  the property bond  posted by  petitioner, authorized him  to
assume office.  Also on the same day,
private respondent filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>  with the Commission on Elections, theorizing
that the assailed Order of March 28, 1996 of the trial court was issued without
or in excess of  jurisdiction,
considering that his appeal was perfected by the mere filing of the Notice of
Appeal  and payment of the necessary  appeal  fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On August 20,
1996, after submission by the parties of their respective memoranda, the COMELEC
granted the petition of private respondent and set aside the questioned
Order,  dated March 28, 1996, on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the respondent trial court to issue the same.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Undaunted,
petitioner found his way to this court <i>via</i> the instant  petition for <i>certiorari</i>,  filed  on September 19, 1996.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On September 21,
1996, two days  after the institution of
this case, private respondent Mohammad moved for the execution of the  August 20, 1996 COMELEC Resolution, setting
aside the Order of Execution pending appeal of the Regional Trial Court in
Election Protest Case No. 4-95; contending that the said COMELEC Resolution had
become final and executory  pursuant to
Section 13(a),  Rule 18  of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Although copy of
the said motion for execution was mailed to the lawyer of petitioner, it
contained no notice of hearing.  It was
only on September 26, 1996, when petitioner’s counsel received a copy thereof
by registered mail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On September 27,
1996, the herein petitioner , through counsel, submitted to COMELEC his
Opposition to the Motion for Execution, inviting attention to his Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>
before this court, seeking to set aside and annul subject COMELEC Resolution of
August 20, 1996.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">But, as it
turned out, on September 24, 1996, the COMELEC issued <i>ex parte</i> its
assailed Order granting private respondent’s motion for execution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On the same day,
September 24, 1996, the COMELEC caused the issuance of  the corresponding writ of execution,
which,  then,  prompted petitioner to file in this case a Supplemental Petition,
praying for a Temporary Restraining Order to forestall implementation of
the  COMELEC Resolution in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The issue raised
in the original petition is - whether or not the COMELEC  exceeded its jurisdiction and/or committed
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in setting aside
the Special Order issued on March 28, 1996 by  the Regional Trial Court of Basilan for the immediate execution pending
appeal of the decision  in favor of
the  herein petitioner, as
protestant  in Election Case No. 4-95.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Supplemental
Petition posits the issue of whether the  respondent  COMELEC acted with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in granting private
respondent’s motion for execution of its Resolution of August  20, 1996, notwithstanding the pendency of
the present Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> assailing the said COMELEC
Resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Petitioner
maintains that the court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i> was competent to act upon and
grant the motion for execution pending appeal of its February 14, 1996
decision  in Election Case No.
4-95.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On the other
hand, in his Petition before the COMELEC, private respondent argued that the
respondent Regional Trial Court lost jurisdiction to grant the Motion for
Execution Pending Appeal of the protestant (now petitioner) in view of the
perfection by  protestee (now private
respondent) of the appeal  before the
COMELEC. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">According
to  private respondent, a day before
protestant  Halim Asmala filed a  Motion for Execution Pending Appeal, he
(protestee) had perfected his appeal, by  filing a Notice of Appeal and paying the  requisite appeal fees to the  COMELEC,  thereby divesting the
trial court of jurisdiction to act on the said Motion for Execution Pending
Appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">However, both in
his Memorandum before the COMELEC,  and
his Comment on the Petition here, private respondent Mohammad conceded that
petitioner’s Motion for Execution Pending Appeal was seasonably filed within
the five day period for perfecting an appeal.  This development can be gleaned from the Consolidated Comment sent in by
the private respondent,  to wit :<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“...private respondent never
questioned the trial court’s authority and jurisdiction to entertain a motion
for execution pending appeal- for as long as the said Motion was filed within
the five (5) day period for perfecting an appeal<i> <b>as was admittedly done
by petitioner Asmala</b></i>.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is then decisively clear
that  the parties recognize the
jurisdiction of the trial court to order execution pending appeal of its
judgment of February 14, 1996.  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, as
stressed by petitioner, this Court succinctly stated in  Edding  vs. Commission on Elections, 246 SCRA 502, that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"The settled rule is that the
mere filing of a notice of appeal does not divest the trial court of its
jurisdiction over a case and resolve pending incidents. Where the motion for
execution pending appeal was filed within the reglementary period for
perfecting an appeal, as in the case at bench, the filing of a notice of appeal
by the opposing party is of no moment and does not divest the trial court  of its jurisdiction to resolve the
motion  for immediate execution of the
judgment pending appeal because the court must hear and resolve it for it would
become part of the records to be elevated on appeal. Since the court has
jurisdiction to act on the motion at the time it was filed, that jurisdiction
continued until the matter was resolved and was not lost by the subsequent
action of the opposing party. (<u>Eudela vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 211 SCRA 546
and <u>Cebu Contractors Consortium vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 216 SCRA 597,
601)"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The aforecited
case of Edding made reference to the earlier case of Relampagos vs. Cumba, 243
SCRA 690, which enunciated a similar doctrine, and overturned the ruling in
Garcia vs. de Jesus and Tobon Uy  vs.
Comelec, 206 SCRA 779 and Veloria vs Comelec, 211 SCRA 907. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the
Relampagos case, this Court held that “any motion for execution pending appeal
must be filed before the period for the perfection of the appeal.  Pursuant to Section 23 of the Interim Rules
Implemeting B.P. Blg. 129, which is deemed of supplementary effect to the
COMELEC Rules of Procedure, in accordance with section 1, Rule 41 of the
latter, <i>an appeal would be deemed perfected on the last day for any of the
parties to appeal.</i> (emphasis supplied) x x x Upon perfection of the appeal,
the trial court was divested of its jurisdiction over the case. Since the
motion for execution pending appeal was filed x x x after the perfection of the
appeal, the trial court could no longer validly act thereon.”  This ruling was reiterated in the more
recent case of Conrado Lindo vs. Comelec, Judge Napoleon Dilag, etc. and
Rosario Velasco, G.R. No. 127311, June 19, 1997.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">And so, what
remains for determination is the timeliness of filing of the Motion for
Execution Pending Appeal under scrutiny.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It should be
noted that the trial court promulgated on February 26, 1996 its subject
judgment dated February 14, 1996.  Under
Rule 35, Section 22 of the 1993 Comelec Rules of Procedure, the parties have
five (5) days from service of judgment to interpose an appeal before the
Comelec.  Therefore,  the parties had five (5) days from February
26, 1996, to  perfect  an appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Although it is
beyond cavil that the private respondent sent in his Notice of Appeal on
time;  having filed the same on the day
the judgment appealed from was promulgated, the appeal was deemed
perfected,  with respect to him
only.  Such appeal did not deprive
petitioner of the right to avail himself of the entire period of five days
within which to  appeal, if he so
desired.  In the case of Valencia vs.
Court of Appeals, 184 SCRA 561;  this
Court ruled,  that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Under the present procedure, an
appeal is perfected upon the expiration of the last day to appeal by any party.
It is not perfected on the date the notice of appeal was filed. x x x The fact
that plaintiff filed a notice of appeal x x x did not, as already stated,
result in the perfection of the appeal. Despite plaintiff’s having filed his
notice of appeal, defendants, had they been so minded, could still have availed
of the right, up to their last day to appeal x x x to also file their notice of
appeal or to file a motion for new trial or to move for execution as in fact
they did, since plaintiff’s appeal has not yet been perfected. x x x”  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Thus, when
petitioner filed his Motion for Execution pending appeal on February 27,
1996,  the trial court still had
jurisdiction over the case because  as
to him (petitioner), appeal was not yet perfected.  In such a <i>scenario</i> below,  the trial court had  undoubtedly
the jurisdiction and competence to act on petitioner’s Motion for Execution
Pending Appeal, since it had not lost jurisdiction over the case,  at the time of filing of subject motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">All things studiedly
considered and viewed in proper perspective, the ineluctable conclusion is that
the respondent COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to
absence of jurisdiction in setting aside subject March 28, 1996 Order of
execution pending appeal on jurisdictional grounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, the questioned Resolution issued
on August 20, 1996 by respondent Commission on Elections is SET ASIDE and  the order of execution pending appeal,
issued in favor of the herein petitioner in Election Case No. 4-95 by the
Regional Trial Court of the Province of Basilan,  is hereby reinstated and upheld.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">This decision is
