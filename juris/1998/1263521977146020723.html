San Lorenzo Village Association. The lot may not be subdivided.  The lot shall only be used for residential purposes.

lot, although separate servant’s quarter or garage may be built.  The property is subject to an easement of
two meters within the lot and adjacent to the rear and sides thereof not
fronting a street for the purpose of drainage, sewage, water and other public
facilities as may be necessary and desirable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

strong materials.  Building shall not be
higher than 5 meters above the ground directly beneath the point in
question.  All building plans must be
approved by the Association before construction begins.  All buildings including garage, servant’s
quarter (<i>porte cocheres</i>) must be constructed x x x not less than 3
meters from boundary bordering a wall, not including pedestrian paths, and not
less than 2 meters from the other boundaries of this lot.  Sewage disposal must be by means of septic
tank or into a sewage system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Restrictions was annotated on TCT No. 60143/T-577 (the certificate of title
from where TCT No. 47448 originated), is no longer the same compared
today.  At that time, houses located
along Pasay Road (San Lorenzo Village) were used purely for residential
purposes.  Today, what are found along
Pasay Road (San Lorenzo Village) are commercial/industrial buildings such as
the matter of security and garage (sic) collections are taken care of by their
buyers. Accordingly, the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. is no longer

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">ADEC prayed for
the issuance of a temporary restraining order directing the San Lorenzo
Company, Inc. and its agents “to cease and desist from making the petitioner a
member of the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. and prohibiting the
petitioner from constructing a taller building on its lot and the San Lorenzo
Village Association, Inc. from collecting membership fee and monthly dues and
other assessments.” It likewise prayed that the Register of Deeds of Makati be
ordered to cancel Entry No. 59599 in TCT No. 47348 and that respondents pay
actual damages of <s>P</s>30,000.00, attorney’s fees of <s>P</s>30,000.00 plus <s>P</s>500
allowance per attendance in court hearings and the costs of suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Therein private
respondent SLVAI filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds of lack
of cause of action and lack of ADEC’s personality to sue. It alleged that ADEC
was not a registered owner of the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 47348; that
the sale of the property by Ponciano L. Almeda to ADEC could not bind third
parties; that ADEC had no reason to pray for the cancellation of Entry No.
59599 not being the owner of the land nor a member of SLVAI but simply a
stranger that had no demandable right against the SLVAI.</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">ADEC opposed the
motion to dismiss contending that it had a cause of action against SLVAI
because as the (new) owner of the lot involved, it cannot be compelled to
become a member of the SLVAI for to do so would unduly limit its use of the
property. Citing Philippine Suburban Development Corporation v. Auditor
General,</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> it asserted that it had the
capacity and personality to sue because actual notice of the sale was
equivalent to registration.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On March 31,
1992, the lower court issued an Order denying the motion to dismiss, holding as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“This Court agrees with the
plaintiff that it has the capacity and legal personality to file this
case.  Plaintiff has shown its interest
in the subject property, basing its claims on a Deed of Sale dated September
11, 1990.  As successor in interest of
the original registered owner, plaintiff step (sic) into the shoes of the
latter, consequently it can sue and be sued.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">SLVAI filed a
motion for the reconsideration of that Order</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> alleging that third persons were
not bound by the deed of sale of the property entered into between ADEC and
Ponciano Almeda, as said deed of sale was not registered. As such, ADEC had no
cause of action against it. Furthermore, Almeda, not having paid the
association dues and garbage fees, he was sued before the Regional Trial Court
of Pasig, Branch 151, where the same deed of sale was presented to prevent the
scheduled auction sale through a third-party claim.  In quashing the third-party claim, then Judge Eutropio Migriño
ruled that the title to the property being still in the name of defendant
Almeda, whatever transaction he had entered into would not be binding upon the
plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In its
opposition to the motion for reconsideration, ADEC contended that said motion
was <i>pro forma</i> as it merely reiterated the arguments in the motion to
dismiss. Citing Article 709 of the Civil Code which states that “(t)he titles
of ownership, or other rights over immovable property, which are not duly
inscribed or annotated in the Registry of Property shall not prejudice third
persons,” ADEC averred that within the context of that law, the SLVAI was not a
“third person” because it “merely caused the annotation on the title of a
property of certain restraints or impositions on the exercise of ownership by
the registered owner.” It added that SLVAI had no interest in the property in
question “except to compel the owner thereof to be automatically a member of
the San Lorenzo Village Association and to pay the consequential dues or fees
and other expenses therefor.” As such, SLVAI and San Lorenzo Village Company,
Inc., were included in the case “only as parties who had caused the annotation
or inscription of the entry in question which limits or restricts the exercise
of ownership over the aforesaid land, and who may be affected thereby, directly
or indirectly, by its cancellation, in the same manner that the Register of
Deeds of Makati has also been impleaded as the public official who is charged
with the duty of registering or canceling the subject annotation or
inscription.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In its reply to
the opposition, SLVAI countered that the motion for reconsideration was not <i>pro
forma</i> as the lower court failed to consider the provisions of Article 709
of the Civil Code and Section 50 of the Land Registration Act.  It alleged that the term “third persons” in
Article 709 was broad enough to cover “everybody” who did not participate in
the disputed act, contract or deed. It asserted that, while it had a lien over
unpaid association dues and garbage fees, ADEC was not the real party in
interest in the suit for cancellation of restrictions on the title that was
still in the name of Almeda and therefore the case should have been dismissed
outright for lack of cause of action.  Moreover, while ADEC claimed to be the owner of the property, it had not
explained why it had not registered the deed of sale and secured a separate
title to the property.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On October 15,
1992, the lower court issued the Order denying the motion for reconsideration
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Article 709 of the New Civil Code
x x x as the basis of this Motion for Reconsideration finds no application in
this case.  As correctly pointed out by
petitioner the `third persons’ mentioned in Article 709, are those persons who
may have adverse interests in the property itself either in the concept of an
owner, or a vendee or a mortgagee, or otherwise, but definitely not that of one
who has merely caused the annotation on the title of the property of certain
restraints or impositions on the exercise of ownership by the registered
owner.  Moreover, when respondent San
Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. convey (sic) the property to Ponciano Almeda,
the original owner, the latter has all the rights as an owner, including the
right to sell, which he did in favor of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">As successor in
interest, petitioner can validly exercise the right to sue which the original
owner could lawfully do for the protection of the right as an attribute of
ownership.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">SLVAI questioned
the lower court’s Orders before the Court of Appeals through a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order.  It presented before said appellate court the
issue of whether or not the petition filed below by ADEC stated a cause of
action or that ADEC was the real party in interest.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On June 22,
1994, the Court of Appeals promulgated a Decision denying the petition for <i>certiorari</i>.  The Court of Appeals noted that the petition
sought to “discredit the material allegation of ADEC that it is the owner of
the property covered by the subject transfer certificate of title.  It asserts that such allegation is merely a
conclusion or inference of ADEC and does not grant to the latter the
personality to sue the petitioner nor does such become the source of the right
to institute proceedings in the court below.” It held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“We resolve to deny the petition,
reiterating the ruling made by the Supreme Court in <b>Galeon versus Galeon, 49
SCRA 516, 520:<o:p></o:p></b></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">`It is well settled that in a
motion to dismiss a complaint based on lack of cause of action, “the question
submitted to the court for determination is the sufficiency of the allegations
of fact made in the complaint to constitute a cause of action, and not whether
these allegations of fact are true, for said motion must hypothetically admit the
truth of the facts alleged in the complaint; x x x” The test of the sufficiency
of the facts is whether or not, accepting the veracity of the facts alleged,
the court could render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the
prayer of the complaint.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">As such, the allegation of ADEC
that it is the owner of the property on the strength of the deed of sale should
be deemed hypothetically admitted, giving it capacity to file the proceedings
below.  The trial court was correct in
saying that `[p]laintiff has shown its interest in the subject property, . . .
As successor in interest of the registered owner, plaintiff step (sic) into the
shoes of the latter, consequently, it can sue and be sued.’ (Order, March 31,
1992; Rollo, page 36).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">The arguments advanced by
petitioner as to whether or not ADEC validly acquired title to the property is
one which is a matter more by way of defense and which may be properly threshed
out during the trial.  What the Supreme
Court likewise espoused in the <b>Galeon case, page 520</b> is apropos on this
issue:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">`The uniform
ruling of this Court is that the trial court “may not inquire into the truth of
the allegations, and find them to be false before a hearing is had on the
merits of the cause”. If the court finds the allegations to be sufficient but
doubts their veracity, it is incumbent upon said court to deny the motion to
dismiss and require the defendant to answer.  The veracity of the assertions could be asserted at the trial on the merits.’”</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">SLVAI filed a
motion for the reconsideration of that Decision but it was denied on August 26,
1994.  Hence, it is now before this
Court on a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> raising the following
issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“1. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE ALLEGATION
IN THE COMPLAINT OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT THAT IT IS THE `OWNER’ OF THE SUBJECT

CANCELLATION THEREOF BE INITIATED BY `MEMBERS’ WHO ARE THE REGISTERED OWNERS OF
THE LOTS IN THE VILLAGE AND BY THEIR TWO THIRDS VOTE.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">These
contentions boil down to the sole issue of whether or not the petition below
alleges a cause of action against petitioner that the lower court may be deemed
to have correctly denied the motion to dismiss the same petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Rules of

said legal right.  If these elements are
absent, the complaint becomes vulnerable to a motion to dismiss on the ground

the defendant’s recourse is not a motion to dismiss but a bill of particulars.</span><a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A motion to
dismiss on the ground of failure to state a cause of action in the complaint
hypothetically admits the truth of the facts alleged therein. However, the
hypothetical admission is limited to the “relevant and material facts well

or interpretations of law; nor does it cover allegations of fact the falsity of
which is subject to judicial notice.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> As this Court held in De Dios v.
Bristol Laboratories (Phils.), Inc.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">“x x x.  For the purpose, the motion to dismiss must
hypothetically admit the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint.  The admission, however, is limited only to
all material and relevant facts which are well pleaded in the complaint.  Thus, it has been ruled that a demurrer
admits only such matters of fact as are sufficiently pleaded; that the demurrer
does not admit the truth of mere epithets charging fraud; nor allegations of
legal conclusions; nor an erroneous statement of law.  The admission of the truth of material and relevant facts well
pleaded does not extend to render a demurrer an admission of inferences or
conclusions drawn therefrom, even if alleged in the pleading; nor mere
inferences or conclusions from facts not stated; nor conclusions of law; nor
matters of evidence; nor surplusage and irrelevant matter. x x x.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">However, it
should be pointed out at the outset that it is not “lack or absence of cause of
action” that is a ground for dismissal of the complaint, but rather, that “the
complaint states no cause of action”.</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">De Dios did
indeed hold that a movant to dismiss on the ground of failure of the complaint
to state a cause of action is burdened with the implied admission of the truth
of “all material and relevant facts which are well pleaded in the complaint,”
but not of “mere epithets charging fraud,” or legal conclusions, or mere
inferences, or matters of evidence.  Said case gave examples of allegations not within the
hypothetical-admission rule, to wit: “malicious and unjustified” institution of
an action; acting maliciously and for the purpose of political persecution and
vengeance, with intent of circumventing a constitutional provision; usurping
the office of Senator of the Philippines; that the master had breached the
contract, or discharged an employee in a wrongful, illegal, unlawful, unjust
manner, etc.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The above
ruling, however, does not apply to the case at bar.  In the instant case, the complaint asserts that plaintiff
purchased the property in question from the person admittedly holding title
thereto.  It then infers that by this
mode, it became the successor-in-interest of the vendor, if not indeed the
owner of the property.  Hence, the
restrictions in the title should be nullified not only because it is contrary
to law but also because the conditions under which they were imposed had ceased
to exist.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In fact, the
averments in the complaint like the title of ADEC’s vendor, the execution of
the sale by said vendor to ADEC, the latter’s status as the vendor’s
successor-in-interest, and the altered physical environment along Pasay Road,
are allegations well within the hypothetical-admission principle.  These averments satisfy the three (3)
elements of a cause of action.  In other
words, the complaint did state a cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In view of such,
SLVAI cannot successfully invoke the ground that the complaint “fails to state
a cause of action” in its motion to dismiss.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Putting it
differently, what SLVAI  essentially  puts at issue is
whether substantively, ADEC, as plaintiff in the case below, possesses a
tenable right of action.  As discussed,
said issue is not a ground for a motion to dismiss.  As a matter of law, neither are the efficacy of the sale to pass
title to the property, and consequently, ADEC’s acquisition of the status of
successor-in-interest, specific mandatory modes to challenge the restrictions
in question, or the change in the physical environment along Pasay Road,
grounds for a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules of Court.  Instead, the aforementioned issues may be
properly raised in the Answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Regarding the
third issue of whether ADEC is a real party in interest, said issue is likewise
not a proper ground for a motion to dismiss.  Certainly, as successor-in-interest of the original vendor, who is the
unquestioned title holder, ADEC has the prerogative to assert all the latter’s
rights, including the impugnation of the restrictions on the title.  The tenability of the grounds for that
impugnation, while proper under the pleadings, should be threshed out at the trial
on the merits.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The only other
issue raised is that even assuming ADEC became owner of the property, it cannot
seek cancellation because, under SLVAI’s rules, the cancellation process can
only be initiated by “members” of the SLVAI who are the registered owners of
the lots in the village and by their two-thirds vote.  However, those rules were not dealt with in the complaint at
all.  They may thus be raised only by
way of defense in the Answer, but not as ground for a motion to dismiss
available as cause for dismissal of the action at this early stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Finally, even
assuming that the allegation of the facts constituting ADEC’s cause of action
is not as clear and categorical as would otherwise be desired, any uncertainty
thereby arising should be so resolved as to enable a full inquiry into the
merits of the action.  Such a course
would preclude that multiplicity of suits which the law abhors, and conduce to
the definitive determination and termination of the dispute.  On the other hand, the abortion of the
action on account of the alleged fatal flaws of the complaint would obviously
be indecisive; it would not end the controversy, since the institution of
another action upon a revised complaint would not be foreclosed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, the petition should be DISMISSED
and the challenged decision of the Court of Appeals should be AFFIRMED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">SO ORDERED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
