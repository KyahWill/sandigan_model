<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ALVIN NIALDA Y LUGO GUILTY
beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of Murder, as this felony is
defined and penalized by the provisions of Article 248, par. (1) of the Revised
Penal Code and there being no modifying circumstances proven to either
aggravate or mitigate his liability, hereby sentences said accused to suffer a
penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA (Life imprisonment); to pay to the heirs of the
deceased Bayani Digma the following sums of money: P55,000.00 as actual
damages, P50,000.00, by way of indemnity for the latter’s death; P25,000.00, as
moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The background of this case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In an information,<a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> dated May 7, 1993, the Assistant Provincial
Prosecutor alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 7th day of September 1992, at Barangay
Kabulusan, Municipality of Gen. E. Aguinaldo, province of Cavite, Philippines
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused,
with intent to kill, being then armed with a bolo, with treachery and evident
premeditation and taking advantage of his superior strength, did, then and
there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, attack, assault and hack the
person of Bayani R. Digma inflicting upon him mortal wound which caused his
subsequent death, to the damage and prejudice of his legal heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant pleaded not guilty, whereupon trial
commenced.  First to testify as witness
for the prosecution was SPO2 Mario Rolle, of the General Aguinaldo Police in
Cavite.  He testified<a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span>that in the evening of September 7, 1992
following report of a stabbing incident in Barangay Castaños Cerca (actually at
Barangay Kabulusan), he and SPO1 Evangelista and SPO Renato Castillo went to
the place to investigate. They arrived at the scene at around 9:00 p.m. and
found the victim, Bayani Digma, seriously wounded.  They took him aboard a mobile car to the Alfonso Doctors
Hospital.  SPO2 Rolle said he noticed
that Bayani Digma could “speak a little,” but he (Rolle) was nonetheless able
to ask Digma, “<i>Sino ang tumaga sa iyo at ano ang pangalan</i>? (What is the
name of the person who stabbed you?)”  According to SPO2 Rolle, Digma answered, “Alvin Visaya.” (“Alvin Visaya”
is the description of accused-appellant.) Rolle put in writing<a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Digma’s answers to his questions. Digma then signed the statement by affixing
his right thumbmark with the use of his blood.  The statement was introduced in evidence as Exh. A and his thumbmark as
Exh. A-1. Barangay Captain Aligio Malimban and SPO Renato Castillo acted as
witnesses to the execution of the statement. </p>

<p class="BODY">Bayani Digma was later transferred to the De La Salle University
Medical Center (UMC) in Dasmariñas, Cavite because of inadequate facilities at
the Alfonso Doctors Hospital.  Digma was
treated at the UMC by Dr. Renato C. Ocampo, who found Digma to have suffered
seven hacking wounds on the chest, in the neck, and in the right arm as well as
several abrasions.<a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. Ocampo opined that the wounds  had
been caused by a sharp instrument, “probably” a bolo or a knife.  Dr. Ocampo said he found Bayani Digma to be
in very serious condition.<a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, Digma died at 2:30 a.m. Dr. Ocampo executed the death certificate<a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which stated that “the patient died of shock from the blood loss because of the
injury to the heart which was brought about by the hacking wound in the chest.”<a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Next to testify for the prosecution was Rolando Raymundo, a
farmer who was residing in Kabulusan, General Aguinaldo, Cavite.<a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He said he knew the victim because they had been neighbors, while he had known
accused-appellant for one year. Rolando testified that he, his brother Jose,
accused-appellant, and Bayani Digma had a drinking session in the house of a
certain Boy Gloriani in Barangay Kabulusan.  They started their drinking session at 2:00 p.m., although Bayani Digma
did not arrive until around 2:30 p.m.  The drinking session lasted for around three hours.  The four then left Boy Gloriani’s house
together.  On the way, Rolando dropped
by a store to buy bread and sugar. Accused-appellant and Bayani Digma waited
for him outside.  The group then
proceeded towards Rolando’s house. This was at around 7:00 p.m.  Accused-appellant and Bayani Digma walked
side by side, with accused-appellant to the right of Bayani Digma. Rolando
followed 7-8 meters behind the two. Rolando said that all of a sudden he saw
accused-appellant strike Bayani Digma at the back of the neck with a bolo, and
continued hacking even after his victim had already fallen down.  According to Rolando, he saw how the
incident happened because of the light of the moon and the light from the
electric post “not too far away.” In a written statement<a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Rolando gave to the police, dated September 8, 1992, Rolando said that
accused-appellant stopped hacking Bayani Digma only after the latter had been
rendered immobile on the road (“<i>Noong pong gulong na sa ka[l]sada si Bayani
na hindi kumikilos ay kusa siyang tumigil</i>”).  Rolando and Jose were afraid that accused-appellant might turn on
them.  Rolando went to the poblacion to
report the incident to the police.<span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The victim’s mother Charlita Rogel Digma also testified.<a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
She said she was able to talk to her son at the Alfonso Doctors Hospital and
was allegedly told, “Mother, Alvin Nialda hacked me. <i>Malapit na akong
mamatay</i> (I am dying).”  She also
testified that her son complained that his feet were numb and that he was
nervous. Charlita believed that the hacking was due to a quarrel between
accused-appellant and her son back in 1990.  She said accused-appellant had intended to stab Bayani Digma but instead
hit Digma’s brother.  The matter however
was amicably settled at the barangay proceedings, considering that Alvin Nialda
was married to Charlita’s first cousin. According to Charlita, the family spent
a total of <s>P</s>55,000.00 “more or less” for Bayani Digma’s hospital and
funeral expenses.  </p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant was the sole witness in his behalf.<a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
His defense was alibi. He claimed that at the time of the stabbing, he was in
the house of his in-laws in Barangay Castaños Cerca.  He denied being with the Raymundo brothers and the victim in the
drinking session held in Boy Gloriani’s house (which was estimated by accused-appellant
to be 3 kilometers away from his in-laws’ house) on September 7, 1995.
Accused-appellant testified that he usually went to the house of his in-laws
every night with his daughter whenever his wife was working in Manila. On
September 7, 1995, he arrived home from work at around 6 p.m. He left the
house, located in the poblacion of General Aguinaldo, together with his
daughter at “more or less” 7 p.m. to go to his in-laws’ place. That evening, he
was arrested and put in the municipal jail where he spent the night with
Rolando and Jose Raymundo. According to accused-appellant, he talked with
Rolando Raymundo and was told by Rolando, “<i>Makakalabas rin kami maya-maya,
ikaw talaga ang makukulong</i> (We will be able to get out of jail in a little
while. You are really the one who will be imprisoned),” because they had money
to buy their freedom.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 11, 1994, the court rendered its decision, the
dispositive portion of which is quoted in this decision.  Hence, this appeal. Accused-appellant
contends:<a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: -0.9pt;">THAT THE TRIAL COURT
ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT HIS GUILT HAS
NOT BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: -0.9pt;">ASSUMING THAT THE
GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT, THE
TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING TREACHERY AS PURPOSELY EMPLOYED BY THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO COMMIT THE ALLEGED CRIME IN THE INFORMATION.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>First</i>.  The
requisites for a dying declaration under Rule 130, §37, are (a) the statement
or declaration must concern the crime and the surrounding circumstances of the
declarant’s death; (b) at the time it was made, the declarant was under a
consciousness of an impending death; (c) the declarant was competent as a
witness; and (d) the declaration is offered in a criminal case for homicide, murder,
or parricide in which the decedent is the victim.<a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span>These requisites are present in this case.
First, Bayani Digma’s statements concern the circumstances of his death, as he
identified by name his assailant and described the manner in which he had sustained
his wounds. Second, he made his declarations under consciousness of an
impending death as he told his mother, Charlita Rogel Digma, “<i>Malapit na
akong mamatay </i>(I am dying).”  Third, there is no question he was competent to be a witness.  And fourth, his dying declarations were
offered in a criminal prosecution for murder of which he was the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant contends, however, that Bayani Digma “might
have been influence[d] by the passion of anger and vengeance against the
accused-[appellant] arising from their previous quarrel wherein according to
the testimony of the victim’s mother Charlita R. Digma accused-appellant had
unsuccessfully attempted to stab the victim.”</p>

<p class="BODY">That quarrel took place in 1990, two years prior to the stabbing,
and, according to Charlita R. Digma, the same had already been amicably
settled.  As a matter of fact, Bayani
Digma did not file charges against accused-appellant.  Whatever anger the deceased might have borne against
accused-appellant could have been revived only by any aggression
accused-appellant might have committed on September 7, 1992.  </p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, dying declarations are “made in extremity, when the party
is at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone; when every
motive to falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by the most powerful
considerations to speak the truth. A situation so solemn and so awful as to be
considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed
by a positive oath in a court of justice.”<a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant doubts whether the dying declarations were made
at all, claiming that SPO2 Mario Rolle’s account is “not credible and
doubtful.”  As we have so often held,
appellate courts rely on the assessment of the credibility of witnesses by
trial courts, considering their opportunity for observing the demeanor of
witnesses when they testify.<a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the trial court found Rolle’s testimony to be credible, and we
find no reason not to give its determination full faith and credit.  Indeed, if SPO2 Rolle did not immediately
question accused-appellant it was because his chief concern was to get the
victim to the hospital as soon as possible. There is no inconsistency between
this claim and his other claim that he talked to Bayani Digma later at the Alfonso
Doctors Hospital because by then professional medical help was already
available. Rolle testified that he had asked the attending physician if he
could talk to the victim.<a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Charlita Digma’s testimony is similarly worthy of credence for
being the victim’s mother.  No reason
has been shown why she should testify falsely against accused-appellant.  Apparently, she had no other interest than
to have her son’s killer brought to justice.<a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Still it is doubted whether Bayani Digma really gave a statement to
SPO2 Mario Rolle and his mother because according to Dr. Renato Ocampo, Digma
was comatose upon arrival at the University Medical Center.  As already noted, however, Digma made the
declarations earlier at the Alfonso Doctors Hospital, when he could still
talk.  Moreover,  even Dr. Ocampo admitted he could not say
with certainty whether Digma could not have talked to anyone before he expired.
For indeed while seriously wounded, Digma did not lapse into coma immediately.<a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
He died about five and a half hours after he had been stabbed.<a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellant says that the attending physician at
the Alfonso Doctors Hospital should have been presented in court and made to
testify on the condition of the victim when the latter was in that
hospital.  The defense could have asked
the court to order the physician to appear at the trial.  But the defense did not.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Second. </i>It is contended that Rolando’s claim that
accused-appellant and Bayani Digma were standing side by side when
accused-appellant suddenly attacked Digma is contradicted by his later
testimony that he saw the victim parrying the bolo blows of accused-appellant,
thus indicating that the protagonists were facing each other.  </p>

<p class="BODY">There is no inconsistency between the two statements.  Rolando was referring to different moments
of the attack.  Accused-appellant and
Digma were walking side by side when accused-appellant started the assault,
which felled Digma.  As accused-appellant
continued the assault, Digma tried to ward off the blows after falling to the ground.  This was the time they were facing each
other.  </p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant says Rolando Raymundo testified against him
because he was sore that accused-appellant did not find a job for him in
Manila.  But accused-appellant admitted
that any differences which he and Rolando might have had had been resolved when
Rolando himself asked him to be godfather of his (Rolando’s) daughter.<a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellant contends that the real culprits were
the Raymundo brothers (Rolando and Jose) and that he is being merely made a
scapegoat for their crime.  He claimed
that two blood-stained bolos had been recovered from the Raymundos and that the
latter were themselves arrested and jailed for the death of Bayani Digma.  These are mere allegations.  There is no evidence to prove these
allegations, nor showing of any motive for the Raymundos to commit the
crime.  Accused-appellant could have
asked for the production of the records of the police to prove his allegations,
but he did not.  For that matter,
accused-appellant could have asked for a subpoena to Jose Raymundo and Boy
Gloriani so that they could be examined, even as hostile witnesses.  It may be that the Raymundos were arrested
by the police but were later released for lack of evidence to link them to the
killing of Bayani Digma.  </p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Third</i>.  Accused-appellant’s defense is alibi.  For alibi to prosper, accused-appellant must prove not only that he was
not present at the scene of the crime but also that it was physically
impossible for him to have been present there at the time the offense was
committed.<a style="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused-appellant failed to do this.  By
accused-appellant’s own testimony Boy Gloriani’s house, in which the drinking
session was held, is three kilometers from the house of accused-appellant’s
in-laws where he was allegedly at the time of the commission of the crime.<a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It was, thus, not physically impossible for accused-appellant to have committed
the crime. In any case, accused-appellant’s alibi is unavailing against his
positive identification by Rolando Raymundo and by Bayani Digma himself as the
latter’s killer.<a style="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the fact that accused-appellant did not flee proof of his
innocence. As we held in <i>People v. Lamsing</i>,<a style="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
if this contention is correct then all that a criminal has to do to prove his
innocence would be to remain at the scene of the crime and declare, when
arrested, his innocence.  In this case,
the presumption of innocence is negated by the clear and convincing evidence
indicating his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Fourth.  </i>The
Solicitor General, while agreeing that accused-appellant is guilty of the
killing of Bayani Digma, nevertheless contends that the crime is not murder but
homicide. He points out that  Rolando
Raymundo admitted he did not see how the attack on Bayani Digma commenced
because Rolando only saw accused-appellant after the first blow.  Hence, the qualifying circumstance of
treachery cannot be appreciated.  </p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, accused-appellant argues that there was no
treachery because the fact that according to Rolando Raymundo,
accused-appellant and Bayani Digma were together at the drinking session and in
going home afterwards negates the possibility that accused-appellant plotted to
ensure the accomplishment of his objective; and also that the fact that Rolando
said he saw the victim parrying the accused-appellant’s blows indicates that
both of them were facing each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that treachery cannot be appreciated in the absence of
proof of how the attack begun.<a style="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
However, a reading of Rolando Raymundo’s testimony shows that he was confused
whether it was the first blow or the second one which he saw.  During his cross-examination, he said that
there must have been a first blow “because Bayani Digma fell down already.”<a style="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
However, in his direct examination he testified that the first blow he saw (which
he however called the second one) was inflicted at the back of Bayani Digma’s
neck while the latter was still standing and that after Digma fell down,
accused-appellant did not cease attacking him.<a style="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It would therefore appear that the blow,
which Rolando Raymundo saw, if it was not indeed the first, was delivered
shortly after the start of the assault on Bayani Digma.  One came close to the other that no
appreciable time intervened between the two to allow for their differentiation
as first and second.  Consequently, the
first and second blows could be considered the commencement of the attack.  Thus in his testimony, Rolando Raymundo
said:</span><a style="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that Bayani Digma was rendered helpless against
accused-appellant’s attack and in fact said so in his dying declaration to his
mother as recounted by her in her affidavit.<a style="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
According to his mother, Bayani Digma said: “<i>Tinaga ako ni Alvin, inay, wala
akong patalim, hindi ako nakalaban</i> (I was stabbed by Alvin, Mother.  I could not fight back because I did not
have a bladed weapon).” Bayani could not have expected such an assault.  The suddenness of his attack against Bayani
Digma, who was unarmed, shows that accused-appellant deliberately employed a
method of attack which would ensure the execution of his felonious design
without risk to himself arising from any defense which his victim might make.<a style="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
There was thus treachery qualifying the crime as a murder. The fact that Bayani
Digma was later seen parrying the blows being delivered by accused-appellant
does not negate the treachery employed as a result of which Bayani Digma was caught
off guard and all he could do was to try to ward off the bolo attacks of
accused-appellant.  As held in <i>People
v. Miranday</i>,<a style="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
it does not matter that the subsequent blows were delivered frontally.  This fact will not negate treachery as the
victim was killed after having been rendered helpless.  </p>

<p class="BODY">As already noted, the principal penalty imposed by the trial
court on accused-appellant was “<i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i> (life
imprisonment).”  The identification of <i>reclusion
perpetua </i>with life imprisonment is of course erroneous.  The two are distinct penalties with
different natures and durations.<a style="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering the provision of Art. 248, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code,
however, it is understood that the imposable penalty, there being neither any
mitigating nor aggravating circumstance, is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the award of actual damages in the amount of <s>P</s>55,000.00,
we believe that the same must be reduced.  The trial court based its award mainly on the assertion of the victim’s
mother who claimed that  she spent that
amount for the hospitalization and funeral expenses of Bayani Digma. However,
only <s>P</s>2,610.00 was supported by receipts.  Consequently, only this amount should be awarded in line with the
rule that actual damages cannot be allowed unless supported by the evidence in
the record.<a style="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As there is no evidence showing any aggravating circumstance, the
award of exemplary damages pursuant to Art. 2230 of the Civil Code must be
deleted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION
that the award of actual damages is reduced to <s>P</s>2,610.00 while the award
of exemplary damages in the amount of <s>P</s>25,000.00 is deleted.</p>
