<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner
International Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IPI) is a corporation engaged in the
manufacture, production and sale of pharmaceutical products.  In March 1983, it employed private
respondent Virginia Camacho Quintia as Medical Director of its Research and
Development department, replacing one Diana Villaraza.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The government, in that year,
launched a program encouraging the development of herbal medicine and offering
incentives to interested parties.  Petitioner decided to venture into the development of herbal medicine,
although it is now alleged that this was merely experimental, to find out if it
would be feasible to include herbal medicine in its business.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> One of the government requirements
was the hiring of a pharmacologist.  Petitioner avers that it was only for this purpose that private
respondent was hired, hence its contention that private respondent was a
project employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The contract of
employment provided for a term of one year from the date of its execution
on  March 19, 1983, subject to renewal
by mutual consent of the parties at least thirty days before its
expiration.  It provided for a monthly
compensation of <s>P</s>4,000.00.  It
was agreed that Quintia could continue teaching at the Cebu Doctor’s Hospital,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> where she was, at that time, a
full-time member of the faculty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Quintia claimed
that when her contract of employment was about to expire, she was invited by
Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro City to be the chairperson of its
pharmacology department.  However, Pio
Castillo, the president and general manager, prevailed upon her to stay,
assuring her of security of tenure.  Because of this assurance, she declined the offer of Xavier University.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Indeed,  after her contract expired on March 19, 1984, she remained in the
employ of petitioner where she not only performed the work of Medical Director
of its Research and Development department but also that of company
physician.  This continued until her
termination on July 12, 1986.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In her
complaint, private respondent alleges that the reason for her termination “was
her taking up the cudgels for the rank and file employees when she felt they
were given a raw deal by the officers of their own Savings and Loan
Association.”  She claimed that sometime
in June 1986, while Pio Castillo was in China, the Association declared
dividends to its members. Due to complaints of the employees, meetings were
held during which private respondent pointed out the “inequality in the
imposition of interest rate to the low-salaried employees” and led them in the
demand for a full disclosure of the association’s financial status.  Her participation was resented by the
association’s officers, all of whom were appointed by management, so that when
Castillo arrived, private respondent was summoned to Castillo’s office where
she was berated for her acts and humiliated in front of some laborers. When she
sought permission to explain her side, she was arrogantly turned down and told
to leave.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On July 10,
1986, Quintia was replaced as head of the Research and Development department
by Paz Wong.  Two days later, on July
12, 1986, she received an inter-office memorandum officially terminating her
services allegedly because of the expiration of her contract of employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In its position
paper, petitioner claimed that private respondent had been hired on a
“consultancy basis coterminous with the duration of the project” involving the
development of herbal medicine and that her employment was terminated upon the
abandonment of that project.  It
explained that Quintia’s   employment,
which lasted for more than two years after the original contract expired, was
by virtue of an oral agreement with the same terms as the written contract
or,  at the very least, by virtue of
implied extensions of the said contract which lasted until the “company decided
that nothing would come out from said project.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In a decision
rendered on December 18, 1990, the Labor Arbiter found private respondent to
have been illegally dismissed.  He held
that private respondent was a regular employee and not a project employee and
so could not be dismissed without just and/or legal causes as provided in the
Labor Code.  Moreover, he found that
petitioner failed to observe due process in terminating Quintia’s services.  For this reason, the Labor Arbiter ordered
the petitioner to reinstate private respondent and to pay her backwages for
three years,  including 13th month pay
and Service Incentive Leave, moral damages and attorney’s fees amounting to
P177,099.94.  He further ruled that if
reinstatement was no longer feasible, petitioner should pay private respondent <s>P</s>6,000
as separation pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On appeal, the
NLRC affirmed the ruling in a decision dated May 26, 1992.  Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but
its motion was denied for lack of merit.  The NLRC directed the Labor Arbiter to conduct a hearing to determine
whether reinstatement was feasible.  Hence, this petition.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee
has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable
in the usual business or trade of the employer except where the employment has
been fixed for a specific project or undertaking, the completion or termination
of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or

NLRC held that the written contract between petitioner and private respondent
was valid, but, after its expiration on March 18, 1984, as the petitioner had
decided to continue her services, it must respect the security of tenure of the
employee in accordance with Art. 280.  It said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The NLRC cited
the following facts to justify its ruling:  Quintia was continued as Medical Director and  even given the additional function of company physician after the
expiration of the original contract; she undertook various civic activities for
and in behalf of petitioner, such as conducting free clinics and giving out IPI
products; she did work which was necessary and desirable in relation to the

three years.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner’s first
ground is that the ruling of the NLRC is contrary to the <i>Brent School </i>decision.  He contends that Art. 280 should not be so
interpreted as to render  employment
contracts with a fixed term invalid.  But the NLRC precisely  upheld
the  validity of the contract in
accordance with the <i>Brent School </i>case.  Indeed, the validity of the written contract is not in issue in this
case.  What is in issue  is whether private respondent did not become
a regular employee after the expiration of the written contract on March 18,
1984 on the basis of the facts pointed out by the NLRC, simply because there
was in the beginning a contract of employment with a fixed term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner also
invokes the ruling in <i>Singer Sewing Machine v.

12.0pt;font-family:Arial">in which it was stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The definition
that regular employees are those who perform activities which are desirable and
necessary for the business of the employer is not determinative in this
case.  Any agreement may provide that
one party shall render services for and in behalf of another for a
consideration (no matter how necessary for the latter’s business) even without
being hired as an employee.  This is
precisely true in the case of an independent contractorship as well as in an
agency agreement.  The Court agrees with
the petitioner’s argument that Article 280 is not the yardstick for determining
the existence of an employment relationship because it merely distinguishes
between two kinds of employees, <i>i.e., </i>regular employees and casual
employees, <i>  </i>for purposes of
determining the  right of an employee to
certain benefits, to join or form a union, or to security of tenure.  Article 280 does not apply where the
existence of an employment relationship is in dispute.  <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner
argues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Even assuming arguendo
that respondent Quintia was performing tasks which were ‘necessary and
desirable to the main business’ of petitioner, said standard cannot apply since
said Article merely distinguishes between regular and casual employment for the
purpose of determining entitlement to benefits under the Labor Code.  In this case, respondent Quintia’s <i>alleged
status as</i> <i>“regular” employee has precisely been disputed</i> by
petitioner.  And, as this Honorable
Court noted in the foregoing case, an agreement may provide that one party will
render services, no matter how necessary for the other party’s business,
without being hired as a <i>regular</i> employee, and this is precisely the
nature of the contract entered into by the parties in this case.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Clearly,
petitioner misapplies the ruling in <i>Singer</i>. Quintia’s status as an
employee is not disputed in this case.  Therefore, in determining whether she was a project employee or a
regular employee, the question  is
whether her work was “necessary and desirable to the main business of the
employer.”  It is true that,  as held in <i>Singer</i>, parties can enter
into an agreement for the rendering of services by one to the other and that
however necessary such services may be to the latter’s business the contract
will not necessarily give rise to an employer-employee relationship if the
elements of such relationship are not present.  But that is not the question in this case.  Quintia was an employee. The question is whether, given the fact
that she was an employee, she was a regular or a project employee, considering
that she had been continued in the service of petitioner for more than two
years following the expiration of her written contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner’s
second point is that private respondent’s tasks were not really necessary and
desirable in respect of the usual business of petitioner, the work done by
Quintia being on a temporary basis only.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> According to petitioner, Quintia’s
engagement was only for the duration of its herbal medicine development
project.  In addition, petitioner points
out that private respondent was not required to keep fixed office hours and
this arrangement continued even after the expiration of the written contract,
thus indicating the temporary nature of her employment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner’s
allegations are contrary to the factual findings of both the NLRC and the Labor
Arbiter, particularly their findings that she was the head of petitioner’s
Research and Development department; that in addition, she performed the
function of company physician; and that she undertook various civic activities
in behalf of petitioner and that this engagement lasted for more than three
years (1983 - 1986).</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Certainly, as the NLRC observed,

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The primary standard, . . . of
determining a regular employment is the reasonable connection between the
particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business
or trade of the employer.  The test is
whether the former is usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or
trade of the employer.  The connection
can be determined by considering the nature of the work performed and its
relation to the scheme of the particular business or trade in its
entirety.  Also, if the employee has
been performing the job for at least one year, even if the performance is not
continuous or merely intermittent, the law deems the repeated and continuing
need for its performance as sufficient evidence of the necessity if not
indispensability of that activity to the business.  Hence, the employment is also considered regular, but only with
respect to such activity and while such activity exists.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Neither does the
fact that private respondent was teaching full-time at the Cebu Doctors’
College negate her regular status since this fact does not affect the nature of
Quintia’s work.  Whether one’s
employment is regular is not determined by the number of hours one works, but
by the nature of the work and by the length of time one has been in that
particular job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Considering the
foregoing, it is clear that Quintia became a regular employee of petitioner
after her contract expired on March 18, 1984 and her services were continued
for more than two years in the usual trade or business of the employer.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioner goes
on to state his third point that “there is clearly no legal or factual basis to
support respondent NLRC’s reliance on the absence of a new written contract as
indicating that respondent Quintia became a regular employee.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> In support, the petitioner again
cites the <i>Brent School </i>case</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn23" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> where it was recognized that term
contracts can be made orally.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Hence, it is argued that  “the mere fact that there was no subsequent
written contract does not mean that the original agreement was abandoned and/or
that respondent became a regular employee due to the absence thereof and/or
that the parties had executed a new agreement, in the absence of evidence
showing intent to abandon and/or novate the same.”  It posits that, based on the acts of the parties, an implied
renewal was entered into, or, at the very least, petitioner claims, the absence
of a written contract only indicates that the parties impliedly agreed to
extend their written contract.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">There is
absolutely no principle of law to support the proposition urged by
petitioner.  On the other hand the
written contract in this case provided that it was subject to renewal by mutual
consent of the parties at least thirty days before its expiration on March 18,
1984.  There is no evidence to show that
the parties mutually agreed to renew their contract.  On the other hand, to sustain petitioner’s contention that there
was an implied extension after the expiration of the original contract would
make it possible for employers like petitioner to circumvent Art. 280 of the
Labor Code and thus prevent an employee from becoming regular through the
simple expedient of making him sign a contract for a term and then extend to
him a contract term, after term, after term.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Moreover,
assuming that petitioner is correct that there was at least an implied renewal
of the written contract containing the same terms and conditions, then
Quintia’s termination should have been effective in March of 1986 or March of
1987 rather than July of 1986.  It
should be noted that the fixed term stated in the written contract allegedly
renewed is one year.  Considering that
the said contract was executed on March 19, 1983, then if there really were
implied renewals with the same terms and conditions, private respondent’s
employment should not have been terminated in July of 1986.  As discussed earlier, the decision of the
NLRC is based not alone on inference drawn from the expiration of the contract
but  on facts which, in light of Art.
280, show that private respondent’s work was in pursuance of the business of
petitioner.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Second</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">.  Prescinding from the premise that private respondent was a project
employee, petitioner claims that because it had discontinued its herbal medicine
project after it had been shown not to be viable, private respondent’s
employment had to be terminated, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We have already
shown why this claim has no basis and no merit.  Petitioner was unable to prove that it had actually undertaken a
project.  Private respondent’s contract
will be searched in vain for any mention of a project.  What it states is that Quintia’s employment
was one for a definite period, not for a project as petitioner would have it.  A project employment is one where the
employment has been fixed for a specific project/undertaking, the completion or
termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the
employee.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;
color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Quintia’s engagement after the
expiration of the written contract cannot be said to have been pre-determined
because, if petitioner’s other claim is to be believed, it was essentially
contingent upon the feasibility of herbal medicine as part of petitioner’s
business  and for as long as the herbal
medicine development was being pursued by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">It follows from
the conclusion that private respondent Quintia was a regular employee that she
could only be dismissed for just or authorized cause.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The records are bereft of any
evidence showing the existence of any of the specified causes in the Labor
Code.  It may be that an employer is

personnel compared to  rank-and-file

for loss of confidence.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> However, a mere allegation of such

loss of confidence. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The law requires that the employer
must furnish the worker sought to be dismissed with <i>two written notices</i>
before termination of employee can be legally effected:  (1) notice which apprises the employee of
the particular acts or omissions for which his dismissal is sought; and (2) the
subsequent notice which informs the employee of the employer’s decision to
dismiss him (Section 13, BP 130; Sections 2-6, Rule XIV, Book V Rules and
Regulations Implementing the Labor Code as amended).  Failure to comply with the requirements taints the dismissal with
illegality.  This procedure is
mandatory; in the absence of which, any judgment reached by management is void
