Alzate, who came to me one afternoon at about 4:30 P. M. and who alleged (sic)
that they were ordered by Col. Alzate to get the same revolver from me.  I was asking a receipt from said soldiers,
but because they were in a hurry to proceed to Lawaan for another mission, so
they only promised me to give me a receipt upon their return from Lawaan for
they might be nighted (sic).  Due to my
confidence and trust of the other person who was (sic) said to be the relative of
Col. Alzate and because Col. Alzate was my friend, I gave said revolver to

1995, respondent judge Concordio Fabillar, conducted a preliminary
investigation during which Atty. Francisco Mirales, counsel of Bagunas,
manifested that his client has not received a subpoena and copies of the
affidavits of complainant's witnesses.  Respondent judge explained that he was just conducting the "first
phase" of the preliminary investigation, hence Bagunas was not yet
entitled to a subpoena as well as to copies of the affidavits.  According to respondent judge, the first
phase of the investigation is intended to determine whether the complaint is
meritorious and it is only after finding such merit will the court issue a
subpoena.  Although Atty. Mirales informed
the respondent judge that a preliminary investigation has only one stage, he
deferred to judge Fabillar's decision to continue with the so-called
"first phase" of the preliminary investigation.</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Thus, the

case is an Ex-mayor of the municipality of Giporlos, a friend of the presiding
judge and he is a relative.  It is not
easy to endure the rigors of setting the case where one is friend of the
court.  I hope I can share with this

fall under the scope of the prohibition mandated by the Rules of Court.</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The next issue
is whether the respondent judge should have voluntarily inhibited himself.  Whether or not a judge should voluntarily
inhibit himself is addressed to his sound discretion.  The operative word is sound for the soundness of his discretion
can be passed upon by this Court.  Where
the exercise of his discretion is characterized by grave abuse, this Court will
not sit still and let the error remain uncorrected.  In the case at bar, we find the respondent judge gravely abused
his discretion when he decided to proceed with the preliminary investigation of
the complainant knowing fully well that his impartiality was impaired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The records show
that respondent judge's partiality manifested itself when he found the
existence of probable cause in Criminal Case No. 1238 despite paltry evidence
presented by the prosecution.  Acting
Chief of Police Barsania filed the complaint for illegal possession on the basis
of a mere Memorandum Receipt signed by Bagunas on October 7, 1989 and executed
by Pfc. Aquilino Fabillar, then supply officer of Giporlos Police Station.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> It is highly suspicious why the
police would try to recover said firearm after a span of five (5) years.  Indeed, SPO2 Aquilino Fabillar, who wrote
the demand letter, is privy to the issuance of said firearm to Bagunas.  For his part, Bagunas did not deny that he
received the subject firearm.  However,
he asserts that he had returned it and the return was recorded in the police
blotter.</span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> To corroborate Bagunas' assertion,
Juan Albutra and PO3 Victor L. Leona stated in their respective
counter-affidavits that on September 12, 1990, they witnessed then Mayor
Bagunas surrendering the subject firearm to two (2) soldiers who were sent by
Col. Alzate.</span><a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> And we take it against the
prosecuting police officers that they did not present Col. Alzate, who is in
the best position to shed light on the whereabouts of the firearm he issued to
Bagunas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">More telling
against the respondent judge is the series of procedural blunders he committed
to the prejudice of the respondent, viz.:  (1)  in insisting that there are
two stages to a preliminary investigation; (2) in holding that he could not
conclude the preliminary examination and transmit the records to the provincial
prosecutor for appropriate action without acquiring jurisdiction over the
person of Bagunas through his arrest; and (3) in ruling that there was
necessity to issue a warrant of arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In Sangguniang
Bayan of Batac, Ilocos Norte v. Judge Efren Albano,</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> we have explained that under our
new rules of procedure, preliminary investigation has only one stage, viz.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"(u)nder the old rules, the
preliminary investigation conducted by a municipal judge had two stages: (1)
the preliminary examination stage during which the investigating judge
determines whether there is reasonable ground to believe that an offense has
been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof, so that a warrant of
arrest may be issued and the accused held for trial; and (2) the preliminary
investigation proper where the complaint or information is read to the accused
after his arrest and he is informed of the substance of the evidence adduced
against him, after which he is allowed to present evidence in his favor if he
so desires.  Presidential Decree 911,
upon which the present rule is based, removed the preliminary examination stage
and integrated it into the preliminary investigation proper.  Now, the proceedings consist only of one
stage."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Nor should the
respondent judge wait for the arrest of the accused before elevating the
records of the case to the provincial prosecutor.  Section 5, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court is crystal clear on the
matter, viz.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"Sec. 5.  Duty of investigating judge. -- Within ten
(10) days after the conclusion of the preliminary investigation, the
investigating judge shall transmit to the provincial or city fiscal, for
appropriate action, the resolution of the case, stating briefly the findings of
facts and the law supporting his action, together with the entire records of
the case, which shall include:  (a) the
warrant, if the arrest is by virtue of a warrant; (b) the affidavits and other
supporting evidence of the parties; (c) the undertaking or bail of the accused;
(d)  the order of release of the accused
and the cancellation of his bail bond, if the resolution is for the dismissal
of the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">x x x." (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Indeed, under
the same rule, a preliminary investigation is concluded after the following
procedure, viz.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"Sec. 3.  Procedure. - Except as provided for in
Section 7 hereon, no complaint or information for an offense cognizable by the
Regional Trial Court shall be filed without a preliminary investigation having
been first conducted in the following manner:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">(a)  The complaint shall state the known address of the respondent and
be accompanied by affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses as well as
other supporting documents, in such number as copies as there are respondents,
plus two (2) copies for the official file.  The said affidavits shall be sworn to before any fiscal, state
prosecutor or government official authorized to administer oath, in their
absence or unavailability, a notary public, who must certify that he has personally
examined the affiants and that he is satisfied that they voluntarily executed
and understood their affidavits.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">(b)  If the investigating officer finds no ground to continue with the
inquiry, he shall dismiss the complainant.  Otherwise, he shall issue a subpoena to the respondent, attaching
thereto a copy of the complaint, affidavits and other supporting documents and
granting him ten (10) days from receipt within which he may submit
counter-affidavits and other supporting documents.  The respondent shall have the right to examine all other evidence
submitted by the complainants.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">(c)  Such counter-affidavits and other supporting evidence submitted
by the respondent shall also be sworn to and certified as prescribed in
paragraph (a) hereof and copies thereof shall be furnished by him to the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">(d)  If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or if subpoenaed does not
submit counter-affidavits within the ten (10) day period, the investigating
officer shall base his resolution on the evidence presented by the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">(e)  If the investigating officer believes that there are matters to
be clarified, he may set a hearing to propound clarificatory questions to the
parties or their witnesses, during which the parties shall be afforded an
opportunity to be present but without the right to examine or
cross-examine.  If the parties so
desire, they may submit questions to the investigating officer which the latter
may propound to the parties or witnesses concerned."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">(f)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
the investigation shall be deemed concluded, and the investigating officer
shall resolve the case within ten (10) days therefrom.  Upon the evidence thus adduced, the
investigating officer shall determine whether or not there is sufficient ground
to hold the respondent for trial.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Respondent judge
should have resolved the case within ten (10) days after the hearing where he
clarified the evidence of the parties and then, he should have forthwith
transferred the records to the provincial prosecutor for appropriate action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It is also clear
that respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing a warrant of
arrest against Bagunas.  No expediency
warranted the immediate arrest of Bagunas.  "Even if the judge finds probable cause, it is not mandatory for
him to issue a warrant of arrest x x x.  He must further find that there is a necessity of placing the respondent
under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice."</span><a style="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">We agree with
the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), that respondent insisted on
investigating complainant Bagunas due to his close association with the
latter's political rivals.  It appears
that Bagunas filed an election protest before the Regional Trial Court of
Guian, Eastern Samar, against Mayor Rodito Fabillar, a relative of respondent
judge, after the May 1995 local elections.</span><a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> As earlier stated, Bagunas filed a
graft and corruption case against COMELEC officer Angel Dacuno, who is also a
friend and relative of respondent judge.</span><a style="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">As early as

Salanga,</span><a style="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> we drew the guidelines for judges
to follow where their impartiality is challenged by a party, viz.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"A judge may not be legally
prohibited from sitting in a litigation.  But when suggestion is made of record that he might be induced to act in
favor of one party or with bias or prejudice against a litigant arising out of
circumstance reasonably capable of inciting such a state of mind, he should
conduct a careful self-examination.  He
should exercise his discretion in a way that the people's faith in the courts
of justice is not impaired.  A salutary
norm is that he reflect on the probability that a losing party might nurture at
the back of his mind the thought the judge had unmeritoriously tilted the
scales of justice against him.  That
passion on the part of a judge may be generated because of serious charges of
misconduct against him by a suitor or his counsel, is not altogether
remote.  He is a man, subject to the
frailties of other men.  He should,
therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to act or
withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel is involved.  He should in good grace inhibit himself
where the case could be heard by another judge and where no appreciable
prejudice would be occasioned to others involved therein.  On the result of his decisions to sit or not
to sit may depend to a great extent the all-important confidence in the
impartiality of the judiciary.  If after
reflection he should resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where
his motives or fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be
interpreted as giving meaning and substance to the second paragraph of Section
1, Rule 137.  He serves the cause of the
law who forestalls miscarriage of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
