obtaining in the present case bring to life the amended provisions of Section
13, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court. Being of the opinion that the penalty of <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> should have been imposed in Criminal Case No. 994-M(88), the crime
committed being murder and not simply homicide, the Court of Appeals rendered
judgment, but in pursuance of the aforementioned rule, refrained from entering
judgment and instead certified the case to this Court for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Since the
conviction for the crime of murder resulted in the imposition of <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> as the sentence, the Court resolved to order: (a) the bondsmen of
accused-appellants to surrender them, within 10 days from notice, to the court
of origin; and (b) the trial judge to commit accused-appellants to the Bureau
of Corrections within 5 days from the time of surrender (p. 2, <i>Rollo</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Accordingly,
accused-appellants German and Harvey Cañete were committed for detention at the
Davao Penal Colony. Dominic Cañete, due to minority, had been previously
released upon recognizance undertaken by the Department of Social Welfare and
Development. As he could not be re-arrested and remains at large, the Court, on
July 24, 1996, resolved to dismiss his appeal. Said dismissal was later entered
September 2, 1996 (pp. 59, <i>et. seq</i>., <i>Rollo</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In the meantime,
the Court afforded the two other accused-appellants opportunity to file a
supplemental brief, but none was filed. Hence, the Court will not review the
decision of the Court of Appeals only as it concerns accused-appellants German
and Harvey Cañete based on the appeal certified and the record elevated to this
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

judgment convicting the three accused of the crimes of Homicide and Frustrated
Homicide in Criminal Cases No. 994-M(88) and 995-M(88), respectively. Upon
review by the Court of Appeals, their conviction in Criminal Cases No.
994-M(88) was modified as earlier mentioned, by raising the penalty to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> due to the presence and abuse of superior strength, which
circumstance also resulted in the modification of the imposable penalty in
Criminal Cases No. 995-M(88) which was hiked to 6 years of <i>prision

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The antecedents

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">On June 11, 1988, at about 8:30 in the evening, Ramon
Paculanan, his wife Avelina and Arnold Margallo were on the way to their home
located in Sugbongcogon, Misamis Oriental (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989, pp. 2-3). While
they were passing on the road near the house of appellant German Cañete, they
saw appellants German, Harvey and Dominic all surnamed Cañete. Appellant German
was holding a flash light and a bolo. Appellant Dominic was holding an “indian
pana” (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989, pp. 4, 23-25). Appellants accosted the passersby and
asked why they were shouting, to which question Ramon Paculanan and his
companions replied that they were not shouting but singing (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989,
p. 24). Immediately, thereafter, Ramon Paculanan, who was then in front of his
wife, and Arnold Margallo were attacked and hacked several times by appellants
German, Harvey and Dominic Cañete with bolos (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989, pp. 7 and 28)
resulting in the death of Ramon Paculanan. Appellant Dominic then let loose an
arrow hitting the right buttock of Arnold Margallo. The latter was also hacked
at the back by German Cañete (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989, pp. 6 and 25). Arnold
Margallo, however, was able to roll down the edge of the road towards a banana
plantation (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989, pp. 6 and 29). Avelina Paculanan, wife of Ramon
Paculanan embraced the lifeless body of her husband asking their attackers for
mercy. The attackers then left (TSN, Jan. 5, 1989, pp. 8 and 36). Arnold
Margallo returned and tried to carry Ramon Paculanan but he could not do so
because the “indian pana” was embedded in his buttock. Two women later arrived
and they carried Ramon to the chapel. Later they brought him to the clinic of
Dr. Precioso Tacandang at Silay, Misamis Oriental but Paculanan was dead on
arrival.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The arrow was turned over to the Chief of Police who
did not issue any receipt therefor. The bolo used by German Cañete was found at
the place of incident at 8:00 a.m. of June 12, 1988 and was turned over to the
Chief of Police.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As earlier
mentioned, accused-appellants did not avail themselves of the opportunity of
filing a supplemental brief, thus we have only their brief filed with the Court
of Appeals as basis for discussion. Aside from the issue of whether or not the
Court of Appeals correctly raised the sentence of accused-appellants to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i>, from accused-appellants’ assigned errors, the other significant
issues are accused-appellant German’s claim of self-defense, and
accused-appellant Harvey’s alibi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We find no
compelling reasons to discuss the other assigned errors referring to the trial
court’s evaluation on the credibility of witnesses in general, which assay,
after careful review we find to be fundamentally sound. We likewise find the
issue of the alleged lack of motive on the part of accused-appellants too
insignificant and irrelevant to merit an extended discussion considering the
positive identification of the three accused-appellants by prosecution
witnesses. Suffice it to quote <i>People vs. Cabodoc</i> (263 SCRA 187 [1996]),
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Well entrenched is the rule
that the prosecution need not prove motive on the part of  of the accussed when the latter has been
positively identified as the author of the crime.  As this Court previously said, lack of motivefor committing the
crime does not preclude conviction, considering, that, nowadays, it is a matter
of judicial knowledge that persons have been killed or assaulted for no reason
at all. (citing <i>People vs. Mandapat, </i>196 SCRA 157, 165 [1991]; and<i>
People vs. Ilaoa, </i>233 SCRA 231, 236 [1994].)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Accused-appellant
German’s claim of self-defense is underpinned by his tention that the deceased
Ramon Paculanan and his companion, Boy Margallo, a victim, begrudged him for
being responsible in having the goats of the victims impounded bythe municipal
authorities.  He claims that he was
attacked Paculanan and Margallo, with two other companions, at his farmhouse
that same evening of June 11, 1998.  The
trial court summarized German's Version follows.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">German Cañete declared that
last June 11, 1988 at 8:30 p.m. he and his wife Gloria Cagato Cañete were in
their farmhouse at Balongis, Silad, Sucbongcogon. They usually sleep there
because of their animals kept thereat. He was asleep and awakened by loud sound
of an object which fell to the floor of their house. He heard two sounds and
his wife called his attention, hence he stood up yet noticed nothing. And he
went down to urinate. He claims that he was wearing  his t-shirt and brief and urinated near the coconut tree near
their house which is five meters away. Then somebody rushed to him from the
left side of the coconut tree and one person attacked him and he parried with
his left hand to the right hand of the attacker. Another person attacked him
from the right side of the coconut tree who did not hit him and so he retreated
towards their house. He heard a voice saying, “Go ahead, Boy” (Sigue Boy). Then
he saw a woman holding a coconut palm who struck his back so he ran towards
their copra drier but when he reached there, his attackers were already there.
The copra drier is twenty to thirty meters from his house on the eastern side.
He wanted to run from his attackers but there was no way out so he faced them
and he recognized four persons, namely: Ramon Paculanan, Boy whose real name is
Arnold Margallo, Jimmy Namata and Avelina Paculanan.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Ramon rushed towards him but he did not see any
weapon because the night was dark but he believed his attacker had a weapon for
his movement is in the act of stabbing, witness demonstrating.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">German Cañete further declared saying “I parried his
right hand with my left hand. My hand caught his right and thrust towards him.
I turned around and embraced him and held his forehead with my left hand. Ramon
Paculanan fell on my breast then Ramon Paculanan said, “Sigue Boy, Sigue Jim”,
which means “Go ahead, Boy, go ahead, Jim. The two persons advanced towards me.
Boy, from the right and Jim from the left. I retreated by stepping backwards as
I used Ramon Paculanan as my shield and made two steps backwards. Avelina Ramon
Paculanan struck my back with a coconut palm. I felt over my head, back and
hand. Then I pushed Ramon Paculanan forward strongly and he fell in front of
Boy Margallo and Jim Namata. They let Ramon Paculanan stood up and said wait,
we will come back. I walked towards my house and called up my wife, come down
Ling and bring my pants” . . . .<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The foregoing
facts , even assuming them to be true, do not sufficiently establish the
justifying circumstance of self defense. The indispensable elements of complete
self-defense are (1) unlawful aggression against the pleader of self-defense;
(2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful
aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person
defending himself. Upon pleading self-defense, the burden of proof shifts to
the accused to prove by clear and convincing evidence the elements of the plea
before he can avail himself of the benefits of this justifying circumstance (<i>People
vs. Viernes, </i>262 SCRA 641, 651 [1996]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">German failed to
discharge this burden. There is no clear and convincing evidence of unlawful
aggression. From the foregoing narration of facts on this point of the supposed
aggression, one will wonder how German managed to avoid sustaining any injury
from such attack. Aside from his own testimony claiming such aggression, no
other evidence appears on record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Further, from
German’s narration it would appear that he managed to repel the alleged
aggression by using Ramon Paculanan as a human shield against the alleged blows
from his other aggressors until he was finally able to push Ramon towards the
other aggressors. This does not explain how Ramon sustained the injuries that
caused his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The post mortem
examination of the cadaver of the victim Ramon conducted by Dr. Precioso

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">German’s claim
of self-defense is thus utterly unavailing, unsupported as it is by any clear
and convincing evidence. Moreover, the Court has in similar cases examined the
nature and number of wounds inflicted by the assailant upon the victim to
determine the veracity of the plea. The nature and number of wounds are
constantly and unremittingly considered important indicia which disprove a plea
of self-defense (<i>Guevarra vs.CA</i>, 187 SCRA 484 [1987] citing <i>People
vs, Ganut, </i>118 SCRA 35, 43 [1982]; <i>People vs. Masankay</i>, 157 SCRA 320
[1988]; <i>People vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 166 SCRA 436 [1988]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The above
described stab wounds inflicted on Ramon and the injuries of Arnold Margallo, a
hack wound at the back and the “indian pana” embedded on his buttocks, disprove
the plea of self-defense of German Cañete, there being no explanation
whatsoever by him how these numerous and gruesome wounds were sustained by the
victims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In <i>People vs.
Maceda</i> (197 SCRA 499 [1991]), the Court ruled that self-defense on the part
of therein appellant was negated by the physical evidence in the case.
Specifically, the number of wounds twelve (12) in all, indicated that Maceda’s
act was no longer an act of self-defense but a determined effort to kill his
victim. The same may be said of accused-appellants in this case. The nature and
number of wounds inflicted upon Ramon and Arnold clearly indicate the
assailants’ determined effort to kill their victims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As for
accused-appellant Harvey Cañete, he puts up alibi as defense, claiming that he
slept in their residence in the Poblacion of Sugbongcogon on June 11, 1988.
This is explained in accused-appellants’ brief thusly:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Harvey Cañete testified that he had been sick of
pulmonary tuberculosis since June 1987. In fact, he was confined from June 2-6,
1987 at the Maria Reyna Hospital in Cagayan de Oro attended by Dr. Luis Borja.
(Exh. “6” &amp; “6-A”) His X-rays showed that he had pulmonary tuberculosis.
Dr. Borja prescribed rest and recuperation for two (2) years and in faithful
compliance with that prescription, he had been under regular treatment and
given regular injections by the nurse at the municipal health center under the
supervision of Dr. Leon Llanto. He always stayed at their house in the
poblacion as it is near the health center. Now and then, he asked to be brought
to their farmhouse, which was near the sea, for exercise and to breath the
invigorating air of the sea. But always, he would be back home in the
poblacion, to sleep early as was the case on that night of June 11, 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Bernardino Luquinario, a tailor who has been renting
a part of the house of the Cañete in the poblacion which he used for his
tailoring shop, testified that indeed Harvey was home early that night of June
11, 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">(p. 82,
C.A. <i>Rollo.</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">However, on
cross-examination, Luquinario admitted that he could not see what was inside
the Cañete house, so he had no means of knowing the presence of Harvey therein
(TSN, p. 22, October 8, 1991). Moreover, Harvey’s co-accused and half-brother,
Dominic admitted that the distance between the poblacion and Sitio Balongis is
only one kilometer or a walk of not more than 30 minutes (TSN, p. 22, October
8, 1991).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We are thus not
surprised that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals gave no credit to
Harvey’s alibi, for we need hardly repeat that alibi is “a defense that places
the defendant at the relevant time of the crime in a different place than the
scene involved and so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to
be the guilty party” (<i>People vs. Villaruel, </i>261 SCRA 386, 396 [1996]; <i>People
vs. Acob, </i>246 SCRA 715, 723 [1995]); and that it is the weakest defense (<i>People
vs. Montealto</i>, G.R. No. 121765, March 14, 1997). It has been held time and
again that for alibi to prosper as defense, the accused must show that he was
so far away that he could not have been physically present at the place of the
crime, or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission (<i>People
vs.Tasarra</i>, 192 SCRA 266 [1990]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Extant in our
jurisprudence are cases where the distance between the scene of the crime and
the alleged whereabouts of the accused is only two (2) kilometers (<i>People
vs. Lumantas</i>, 28 SCRA 764 [1969]), or three (3) kilometers (<i>People vs.
Binsol</i>, 100 Phil 713 [1957]) or even five (5) kilometers (<i>People vs.
Manabat</i>, 100 Phil 603 [1957]), and yet it was held that these distances
were not too far as to preclude the possibility of the accused’s presence at
the <i>locus criminis</i>, even if the sole means of traveling between the two
places at that time was only by walking (<i>People vs. Aparato</i>, 80 Phil.
199 [1948]). With more reason, therefore, do we find the defense of alibi in
the present case implausible, the distance being merely one kilometer, which may
be negotiated by foot within 25 to 30 minutes. The established circumstances in
this case cannot conclusively preclude the possibility of accused-appellant
Harvey Cañete’s presence at the scene of the crime at 8:30 on the evening of
June 11, 1988 when the crimes were committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">More
importantly, it is equally settled in this jurisdiction that the defense of
alibi, being inherently weak, cannot prevail over the clear and positive
identification of the accused as the perpetrators of the crime (<i>People vs.
Ferrer</i>, 255 SCRA 19 [1996]; <i>People vs. Panlilio</i>, 255 SCRA 503
[1996]). Thus, plainly prevailing over the infirmed alibi of Harvey is the
clear and positive identification made by Avelina Paculanan and Arnold Margallo
of Harvey as one of the perpetrators of the crimes in these cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Now, to the last
issue left which necessitated the certification of this case. The Court of
Appeals would hold that the crime committed by accused-appellants in Criminal
Case No. 994-M(88) is murder, not homicide, because supposedly, the qualifying
circumstance of abuse of superior strength attended the commission of the
crime. This conclusion is justified in this manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">In the instant case, it is clear that not only was
numerical superiority enjoyed by the appellants over the deceased Paculanan and
the seriously injured Margallo but that the three appellants were all armed
with deadly weapons (Pls. See <i>People vs. Tandoc</i>, 40 Phils. 954) making
it clear that while it could be said that they were not aided by armed men, the
evidence shows beyond doubt that German Cañete was carrying a flashlight and a
bolo (TSN, p. 4, January 5, 1989), Dominic Cañete was armed with an “Indian
Pana” (TSN, p. 6, January 5, 1989) while Harvey Cañete used a bolo in
assaulting Paculanan and Margallo (TSN, p. 8, January 5, 1989). It cannot,
therefore, be ignored that they themselves were so armed and helped each other
insure the commission of the offense as against two men and one woman, then
completely defenseless and unarmed . . . <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Because of the
inebriated condition of Margallo and Ramon, and as they were admittedly
singing, their manner of belting out their songs, could have been taken as
shouting which the Cañetes resented at such a late hour. Under these
conditions, it appears to us that the encounter was unplanned and
unpremeditated. There could have been no conscious effort, on the part of the
accused-appellants, to take advantage of any unimagined superior strength. The
victims were simply at the spot by accident, not by any design of accused-appellants.
There could have been no time for accused-appellants to consciously plot taking
advantage of the numerical strength.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The prosecution,
moreover, failed to show the physical conditions of both Arnold Margallo and
Ramon Paculanan compared to those of the Cañetes, one of whom is ravaged by
tuberculosis and undergoing medication. Too, the mere fact that the number of
assailants is superior to that of those attacked is not sufficient to
constitute abuse of superior strength (<i>People vs. Diokno, et al</i>., 63 Phil.
601 [1936]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In <i>People vs.
Bigcas</i> (211 SCRA 631; 634 [1992]), the Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">For this
qualifying circumstance to be considered, it is not sufficient that there be
superiority in number or strength; it is necessary that the accused must have
been cooperated and <u>intended to use or secure advantage from such superior
strength</u>. As we also emphasized in <i>People vs. Cabiling, </i>abuse of
superior strength may be considered not only when there is an inequality of
forces between the victim and the aggressor but <u>there must be a situation of
superiority of strength notoriously selected or taken advantage of by him in
the commission of the crime.</u> (Emphasis Supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The prosecution
thus failed to prove that accused-appellants deliberately intended and planned
to take advantage of their superiority in their assault on the victims. This
circumstance must be proved as conclusively as the crime itself and not drawn
from mere assumptions and conjectures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">It is to be
noted also that when Ramon was attacked and repeatedly hacked, Avelina was
still able to embrace him and to pull him up, shouting for help at the same
time. Yet, accused-appellants simply turned away (TSN, Jan. 5, 1998, p.8 ).
Surely, if accused-appellants indeed took advantage of their imagined superior
strength, they would have finished off Margallo and probably even Avelina.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The circumstance
of abuse of superior strength not having been duly proven by the prosecution,
the judgment of the trial court finding accused-appellants guilty only of
Homicide in Criminal Case No. 994-M(88) and of the crime of Frustrated Homicide
in Criminal Case No. 995-M(88) is in order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
