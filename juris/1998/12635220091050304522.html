<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:418.5pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">On 31 March 1987, at around 10:00 o’clock in the morning,
Emily was watering her plants near a well in Brgy. Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan,
when Samuel suddenly appeared. He was armed with a 2-foot long bolo hanging in
its scabbard around his waist with a long-sleeved work shirt slung over his
shoulder. He asked Emily where her husband was. She replied that Roberto was
already in the <i>kaingin</i> so she advised him to follow her husband there.
But Samuel opted to remain and rest on an anthill some two and a half (2 ½)
meters from the well. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">After Emily
finished watering her plants and before she could start washing clothes, Samuel
grabbed her wrists and locked them with one hand behind her back with the other
drawing his bolo and pointing it at her neck. She struggled to free herself
from his hold but was so intimidated with the bolo that she could not shout for
help; she lost her strength eventually. After she weakened, he dragged her some
forty (40) meters away to the bushes and tall grasses. He forced her to lie
down; then he mounted her. He laid his bolo beside him, pinned her arms with
one hand, and with the other, loosened the buttons of her dress. Emily could
only struggle in vain until he ripped off her dress and panties. He opened the
zipper of his pants and then inserted his penis to her vagina. He copulated
with her for about fifteen (15) minutes. She did everything to disengage
herself from the sexual imbroglio but her efforts proved no match to his
strength. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">At this moment,
Emily heard her husband’s voice calling for her. Roberto was now somewhere
within the <i>vicino</i>. He saw Emily’s slippers near the well so he
frantically hollered, “Baby!” She answered back. When Roberto’s voice was heard
by Samuel, he dashed off and fled to the thickets. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Roberto followed
the direction of Emily’s voice until he saw her emerge from the thick bushes.
She was in a state of shock. He asked her what happened and she told him that
she was sexually abused by Samuel Ulzoron. Emily pointed Roberto to the place
where she was dragged and raped. Together when they went there and found
Ulzoron’s bolo and work shirt and took them home. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The following
afternoon, Emily went to Dr. Feliciano M. Velasco Jr. for physical examination.
The doctor noted the discharge mixed with semen in her private part. He opined
that it could have been caused by sexual intercourse within twenty-four (24)
hours prior to his examination. He found her cervix to be parous with
superficial erosions. Her hymen was obliterated with caruncles.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">6</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The next day Emily lodged a
complaint for rape against Samuel Ulzoron as she turned over his belongings to
the police authorities as her evidence in support thereof. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">7</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Ulzoron had his
own story to tell. He said that on the day of the incident he saw Emily at the
well. She told him that work in the <i>kaingin </i>would be in the afternoon
yet so she advised him to come back. Since he was returning in the afternoon,
he decided to leave his bolo and work shirt near the well. However, at around
10:00 o’clock that morning, as he was about to retrieve his bolo and shirt, he
saw the Gabo spouses having sexual intercourse in a hut with a wall only on one
side. As he was ashamed to be seen by them he proceeded instead to the house of
a relative. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On the strength
of the testimony of Emily Gabo, the trial court convicted the accused. It found
her testimony straightforward and credible. It rationalized that she would not
have filed her complaint for rape if her accusations were not true, for to do
so would only expose herself to public shame or ridicule. No improper motive on
her part to file the case had been shown. The findings of the examining
physician also lent credence to her claim. On the other hand, the trial court
found the defense of the accused too weak, anemic, for if Ulzoron really felt
embarrassed to be seen by the Gabo spouses, he could have taken a detour or
passed another way to get back his bolo and work shirt. Besides, it was never
established that the Gabos had so much yearning for each other that they had to
indulge in sexual congress in a hut that was open to public view and at such an
unlikely hour. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">9</span></span></a><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Appellant
concedes, even as he assails his conviction, that his defense is inherently
weak. Nevertheless, he faults the trial court for convicting him on the basis
of his defense. He argues that the undisputed facts and circumstances made it
more likely that Emily was involved in an adulterous relationship with him.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">10</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> He claims, for instance, that there
was absolutely nothing to support the victim’s claim of struggle, and that
while he allegedly dragged her forty (40) meters away before assaulting her
sexually, the examining physician could not conclude that physical force was
actually inflicted since she did not sustain any physical injuries.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">11</span></span></a><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Another point raised by the defense in her testimony that while he was
on top of her his bolo was beside him. The plain import of such testimony,
according to the accused, is that the bolo was not a necessary instrument in
the commission of the crime.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">12</span></span></a><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> He also invites attention to the circumstance that
the judge who wrote the decision did not personally try the case and therefore
lacked the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the parties and their
witnesses.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;

<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The arguments of
appellants are unpersuasive ; they fail to convince us. Contrary to his claim
that he was convicted because of his weak defense, his conviction was actually
founded on the overwhelming evidence of the prosecution. With regard to his
claim that he had an adulterous relationship with the victim, the Office of the
Solicitor General observed that such claim was a radical departure from the
defense of denial he raised at the trial. The OSG observed further that the
“sweetheart defense” was being raised for the first time in this appeal hence
should be disallowed conformably with established jurisprudence.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">14</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Here, the Court does not necessarily
agree. Appellant could only be emphasizing the point that the facts and
circumstances established could lead to a conclusion of the existence of
adulterous relationship between him and Emily and not of rape. In other words,
appellant could be utilizing the “sweetheart theory” not necessarily as a
defense but as a focal point in disputing the appreciation by the trial court
of the evidence for the prosecution. Thus, this course taken by the defense may
not be totally disregarded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The term
“dragged” should not indeed be taken in the meaning understood by appellant as
“dragged along on the ground.” When asked on cross-examination by the defense
counsel to “describe how she and appellant travelled at (sic) forty (40) meters
distance,”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;
color:red">15</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
she said, “He was holding my hands and at the same time he is (sic) <u>pushing
me forward</u>.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">16</span></span></a><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> This testimony adequately explains the absence of
injuries in her body. At any rate, it is not necessary for the commission of
rape that there be marks of physical violence on the victim’s body.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn17" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">17</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> While Emily repeatedly mentioned
her struggles to be released from his grasp, such efforts need not always
result in physical injuries.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn18" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">18</span></span></a><span style="font-size:

when she was being dragged by the accused, but to the circumstances when he
initially grabbed her hands,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">19</span></span></a><span style="font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Intimidation may
be of the moral kind, <i>e.g.</i>, the fear caused by threatening a woman with
a knife.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn23" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;
color:red">23</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
There was sufficient intimidation when appellant pointed his 2-foot long bolo
at Emily’s neck while they were near the well until they reached the spot where
she was finally abused. This intimidation continued even after he positioned
himself on top of her and placed the bolo beside him since he was at liberty to
point it anew at her neck or any part of her body. Anyway, the significant
consideration is that, as aforementioned, the intimidation was continuous as to
sufficiently engender fear in her mind.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">24</span></span></a><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The circumstance
that the judge who wrote the decision had not heard the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses does not taint or disturb his decision. After all, he had
the records of the case before him including the transcript of stenographic
notes. The validity of a decision is not necessarily impaired by the fact that
its writer only took over from a colleague who had earlier presided at the
trial unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion in the
appreciation of the facts,</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">25</span></span></a><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> and none exists in the present case. The records
amply support the factual findings of the trial court and its assessment of the
credibility of the witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
circumstances of force and intimidation attending the instant case were
manifested clearly not only in the victim’s testimony but also in the physical
evidence presented during the trial consisting of her torn dress and underwear
as well as the medico-legal report. Such pieces of evidence indeed are more
eloquent than a hundred witnesses.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">26</span></span></a><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> The fact of carnal knowledge is not disputed. It was
positively established through the offended party’s own testimony and
corroborated by that of her examining physician.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Moreover, the
conduct of the complaining witness immediately following the assault clearly
established the truth of her charge that she was raped by accused-appellant.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">27</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Consequently, we agree with the
observation of the OSG that Emily’s actuations following her misfortune,
namely, her revelation to her husband of her violation by the accused and
subjecting her private parts immediately to medical examination, as well as the
filing of her complaint for rape immediately thereafter are consistent with her
straightforward, logical, truthful and credible testimony thus rebutting any
insinuation of voluntariness on her part to the sexual confrontation; rather,
they only display a moral certainty of his culpability for the crime charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
