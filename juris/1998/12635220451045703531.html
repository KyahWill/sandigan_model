				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The United
Church of Christ in the Philippines - Surigao District Conference
("UCCP-SUDISCON"), a non-stock and non-profit religious corporation,
represented by its Moderator, Reverend Temestocles C. Onde, has charged Judge
Jose M. Garcia of the Municipal Trial Court of Tandag, Surigao del Sur, with
inefficiency and gross ignorance of the law relative to the latter's actuations
in resolving Civil Case No. 478, an unlawful detainer case, instituted by the
corporation against Juan Murillo, et al.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">According to
herein complainant, Civil Case No. 478 was filed on 11 March 1994.  More than a year later, or on 31 July 1995,
respondent Judge dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, the issue of
ownership over the property subject matter of the action having meanwhile been
seriously raised by the defendants.  Complainant moved for the reconsideration of the dismissal, citing
Section 33, paragraph 2, of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> ("BP 129").  On 07 September 1995, respondent Judge
denied the motion for being a prohibited pleading under the Rules on Summary
Procedure.  On 26 September 1995, complainant
filed a notice of appeal.  In his order
of 18 October 1995, respondent Judge denied due course to the appeal for the
failure of plaintiff to perfect the appeal within the 15-day reglementary
period prescribed therefor by Section 2, Rule 40, of the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Complainant
forthwith filed an administrative action against respondent Judge before this
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the Court's
resolution of 24 July 1996, respondent Judge was required to comment on the
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In his comment,
dated 30 August 1996, respondent Judge attributed the delay in the resolution of
the ejectment suit to both complainant and its counsel who had yet to be issued
subpoenas repeatedly by the court just to have their attendance secured.  Relative to his order denying due course to
the tardy appeal,</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> respondent Judge maintained that
complainant should not have filed its motion for reconsideration for being a
prohibited pleading under the Rules on Summary Procedure.  Finally, respondent Judge averred that the
cases he had cited in his decision</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> were "not contrary to the
existing jurisprudence x x x at the time (the) decision was rendered" and
that Section 2, Rule 40, of the Rules of Court was still then in force.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Office of
the Court Administrator ("OCA"), through Senior Deputy Court
Administrator Reynaldo L. Suarez, to which office the case was referred for
evaluation, report and recommendation, in a memorandum, dated 20 November 1996,
concluded:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"In view of all the foregoing,
it is respectfully recommended that:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">"(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the instant complaint be docketed as an Administrative Matter;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-family: Arial;">"(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>respondent Judge Garcia be fined in the amount of <s>P</s>5,000.00
with the stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the
future will be dealt with more severely; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">"(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Atty. Elmer T. Paniamogan be advised to keep
himself abreast of all Court Circulars, Orders, Rules and Decisions to avoid
future errors in procedure."</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The case was sent back to OCA for re-evaluation.  In its memorandum of 29 July 1997, the OCA
reiterated its above recommendations.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the Court's
resolution of 15 October 1997, the parties were required to manifest whether
they were willing to submit the case for decision on the basis of the pleadings
filed.  Respondent Judge and complainant
submitted their manifestations, respectively dated 12 November 1997 and 16
November 1997, expressing their willingness to have the administrative matter
resolved on the basis of the pleadings theretofore submitted.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Admittedly,
Civil Case No. 478 was filed on 11 March 1994.  Respondent Judge set the pre-trial conference for 25 August 1994.  Since no new notice of hearing would appear
to have been sent, the OCA concluded that the pre-trial conference must have
taken place as so scheduled.  Conformably with the Rules on Summary Procedure, the OCA summarized the
actions that should have been done thereafter, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"1.  five (5) days thereafter, or on August 30, 1994, Judge Garcia
should have issued an order stating the matters taken up therein;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"2.  within ten (10) days from receipt of this order, or on September
19, 1994, the parties shall submit the affidavits of their witnesses and other
evidence on the factual issues defined in the order;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"3.  within thirty (30) days after receipt of the last affidavits or
position papers, or on October 29, 1994, `the court shall render judgment;'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"4.  assuming that Judge Garcia wanted to clarify certain material
facts, he could issue an order specifying the matters to be clarified during
the said period.  Assuming that said
order was issued on October 29, 1994, the same would have been received by the
parties on November 8, 1994;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"5.  since the parties had ten (10) days to submit affidavits or other
evidence on said matters, the court would have received said clarificatory
affidavits and evidence by November 28, 1994;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">"6.  the court then had fifteen (15) days within
which to render judgment, or on December 13, 1994."</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Judging from the
records, it would indeed seem that respondent Judge has been quite remiss in
the due observance of the summary procedure required in the disposition of the
ejectment suit.  The OCA is correct in
pointing out that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">"<i>Dela Cruz vs. Court of
Appeals</i> involved an ejectment case filed in 1977, <i>Alvir vs. Vera</i>
involved one filed in 1972, <i>Chua Peng Hian vs. Court of Appeals</i> was not
an unlawful detainer case but one for specific performance but with the
ultimate result that the lessee had to vacate the premises, <i>Miraflor vs.
Court of Appeals</i> involved a 1966 ejectment case, but which was really an <i>accion
publiciana</i>, and <i>Velez vs. Avelino</i> involved a case where the people
being ejected from the land in question were really squatters.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">"Not only is
Judge Garcia out of step with the latest laws applicable to unlawful detainer
cases but his research is haphazard and erroneous.  Picking out the <i>syllabi</i> of the editors annotating the
cases decided by the Court and using the same to support court decisions is
detrimental to one's stature as a judge who is supposed to know the law and
latest jurisprudence, to say the least."</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Court
accepts the recommendation of OCA in the imposition of a fine on respondent
Judge, now already retired, in the reduced amount of <s>P</s>2,000.00
deductible from the retirement and other benefits still due him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Atty. Elmer T.
Paniamogan, being neither a party to this administrative case nor a court
personnel, cannot be so admonished as suggested by OCA.  The recourse against him lies elsewhere and
only after due observance of the established process designed therefor by the
Rules.  It would be unduly precipitate
for the Court to react here and now on the matter.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, finding respondent Judge guilty of
undue delay in the disposition of the aforenumbered ejectment case, the Court
resolves, as it is hereby RESOLVED, to order Judge Jose M. Garcia to pay a FINE
of <s>P</s>2,000.00 to be deducted from his retirement and other benefits.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
