instructed the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to conduct an
investigation relative to the actuations of Court of Appeals employee Myrna
Alvarez who allegedly misled petitioners and caused the late filing of their
motion to admit payment of docket fee in CA-G.R. CV UDK No. 3346 and which led
to the dismissal of their appeal in the said court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The factual
background which spawned the investigation is adequately summarized in the
Memorandum submitted by the Court Administrator to the Chairman, First Division
on September 30, 1997, and which is quoted hereunder:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“An adverse decision of RTC, Branch
135, Makati City in Civil Case No. 88-1558 entitled ‘Juan Perez, Jr. and Alicia
Perez <i>vs.</i> Alfredo Mesias and Candido Silao’ for Loss and Damages was
appealed by defendants-appellants to the Court of Appeals but was dismissed per
Resolution dated January 15, 1996 for failure to pay the required docket
fees.  Said resolution was received by
defendants-appellants on January 22, 1996.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">On January 25, 1996 a motion for
reconsideration of said resolution and cash payment of <s>P</s>400.00 for
docket fees were brought by Ms. Jaralyn Cesar, a staff of Atty. Semproniano
Ochoco (counsel for defendants-appellants), to the Court of Appeals for filing
where one Ms. Myrna Alvarez, an employee of the Court of Appeals, Docket
Section allegedly refused to accept the payment as well as the motion and
instead instructed Ms. Jaralyn Cesar to pay the docket fees by money order
payable to the Court of Appeals.  That
same day Ms. Cesar, as alleged in her ‘Sinumpaang Salaysay,’ proceeded to the
Caloocan City Post Office, to purchase the needed postal money orders and
mailed these to the Court of Appeals.  Thereafter she returned to the Court of Appeals to file the motion for
reconsideration but Ms. Alvarez still allegedly refused to accept the pleading
in question.  Once again she directed
Ms. Cesar to have the pleading changed to a ‘Motion to Admit Payment of Docket
Fee.’<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The following day, January 26, 1996
Ms. Cesar filed the motion to admit payment of docket fee but Ms. Alvarez again
rejected it on ground that the postal money order checks must first be received
by the Court of Appeals and that they still have to wait for fifteen (15) days
more.  Ms. Alvarez further told Ms.
Cesar to just wait for her call.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Three (3) days later, (January 29,
1996) Ms. Cesar again filed the aforementioned motion but was again rejected
for the same reason that the Court of Appeals had not yet received the postal
money order.  It was only on February
14, 1996 that the aforesaid motion was finally admitted but was eventually
denied by the Court of Appeals for having been filed beyond the reglementary
period.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Consequently, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
was filed by defendants-appellants Alfredo Mesias and Candido Silao with the
Supreme Court assailing the denial of the motion and imputing the delay in the
filing of the motion for reconsideration to Ms. Alvarez’ misleading
instructions.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The Court
Administrator directed Ms. Alvarez to comment on the allegations of
defendants-appellants Mesias and Silao.  Ms. Alvarez submitted her comment, which, in gist, states that there is
no truth to the allegation that she refused to accept the motion for
reconsideration and the postal money order slip; and that the advice given to
Ms. Cesar was to effect payment by postal money order considering that the case
on appeal was already dismissed by the court;  and, to attach the payment of the docket fee to the motion for
reconsideration.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">A legal team was
sent by the Court Administrator to the Court of Appeals who interviewed Mr.
Buenaventura Miguel, Acting Chief, Judicial Records Section; and Atty. Elisa
Longalong, Assistant Clerk of Court, Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The talk with
Mr. Buenaventura Miguel elicited the fact that Ms. Alvarez is a Utility Worker
assigned in the Docket Section and whose specific job is to index newly
appealed cases and arrange <i>Rollo</i>s.  According to Miguel, while Ms. Alvarez is not a “frontliner” in the
office, and, thus,  not in a position to
give instructions or advice to party-litigants, however, due to lack of
personnel, the Docket Section had to utilize anybody thereat to give advice to
party-litigants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On the other
hand, Atty. Elisa Longalong gave the legal team an overview of the standard
operating procedure of the Court of Appeals relative to the filing of
pleadings, similar to that of the motion for reconsideration filed by Ms. Cesar.  Atty. Longalong said that the recourse
available to party-litigants in dismissed cases for failure to pay docket fee
is to first file a motion for reconsideration.  And, once the motion for reconsideration is granted, then that is the
time for the movant to pay the docket fee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The two, Atty.
Longalong and Buenaventura Miguel, were of the opinion that probably the advice
given by Ms. Alvarez, as admitted in her comment, was well-meaning, she
presumably being of the belief that it would shorten the process, i.e., should
the motion for reconsideration be granted, then the intended payment for docket
fees sent by postal money order would have already been received by the
court.  However, Miguel and Atty.
Longalong were of the view that respondent probably was not in a position to
clearly explain to the complainant the necessity to first file with the
Receiving Section the motion for reconsideration of the resolution dismissing
the appeal for failure to pay docket fees.  Atty. Longalong gave the opinion that Ms. Alvarez should have referred
Ms. Cesar to the Receiving Section which has the ministerial duty of accepting
pleadings filed with the Court of Appeals irrespective of whether the same is
timely filed or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We have read the
record of the case, and we are in complete agreement with the finding of the
Court Administrator in his Memorandum, that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">“x x x.  While there is no evidence presented to
indicate bad faith or malice on the part of Ms. Alvarez, we nevertheless look
with disfavor on the practice in the Judicial Records Division of the Court of
Appeals of allowing a Utility Worker without any legal background or experience
to give advice to party-litigants involving policy or procedure with respect to
legal matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On the other
hand we wish to invite attention to the fact that it is incumbent upon counsel
for the appellants, who has the duty to protect the interests of their clients,
to see to it that their staff, charged with filing pleadings in court, are
knowledgeable or properly instructed on the matter.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We further add
the following observations –<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As admitted in
her Comment, Ms. Alvarez knew, as she ought to know, that she was not
authorized to receive motions and that the proper office therefor was the
Receiving Section of the Court of Appeals.  Instead of simply directing Cesar to the aforesaid office, she took it
upon herself to give improper advice knowing fully well that she had neither
the competence nor authority to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">While the acts
of Alvarez may not have been motivated by bad faith or malice, ordinary reason
and prudence should have prompted her to desist from giving suggestions or
advice, however well meant.  It is well
worth noting that messengers/agents of party-litigants tasked with the filing
of pleadings will ordinarily take as gospel truth and give due regard to
whatever advice is received from any court employee with some sort of apparent
authority.  Alvarez should have been
aware of this ostensible predisposition which could have guided her into being
more circumspect in her utterances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The conduct and
behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of
justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be
circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Every employee or officer involved

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Mr. Buenaventura
Miguel, as Acting Chief of the Judicial Records Division, is responsible for the
acts of the personnel therein relative to the discharge of their duties.  Being head of the department, Miguel should
have exercised his control and supervision over subordinate employees as well
as his prerogative to implement work policies in such a manner as would avert
any appearance of impropriety and promote the speedy and efficient
administration of justice.  He has not
been meticulous and zealous as he should have been in organizing and
supervising the work of his subordinates as required by Canon 3, Rule 3.09 of
the Code of Judicial Conduct.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">By his own
admission, he laid open the anomalous practice of allowing practically anybody
in their office to give advice to party-litigants.  His acquiescence and tolerance of such an arrangement has the propensity
to create confusion in the filing of pleadings in the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On the other
hand, the Court takes note of the apparent ineptitude of Ms. Cesar as shown by
her failed attempt to file the motion for reconsideration.  Party-litigants, counsels and their staff
are, therefore, cautioned to be more scrupulous and cognizant of the proper
procedure in the filing of pleadings.  The Court understands the frustration that litigants and lawyers alike,
would at times encounter in procedural bureaucracy, but imperative  justice  requires  proper observance of
indisputable technicalities precisely designed to ensure its proper
dispensation.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
