<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Accused Teddy

guilty to the  crime charged.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Thus, trial on the merits ensued
with the prosecution presenting two witnesses, namely, SPO3 Romeo S. Turqueza
of the Cabanatuan City Police Station who led the hot pursuit operation, and
Romeo Sarengo, brother of the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">However, while
trial was going on and before the prosecution had rested its case,  accused Jessie Ferras changed his plea to
that of guilty on January 12, 1994.</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Judgment was thereby rendered

imprisonment with the court appreciating the mitigating circumstance of plea of
guilty in his favor.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Meanwhile, trial of the case
proceeded with respect to appellant and his co-accused, Louie Limueco.  The facts gathered therein are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the morning of March 9, 1993,
16-year-old Edwin Sarengo drove the motorized tricycle of his elder brother,
Romeo.  The tricycle had a red Suzuki
motorbike with Chassis No. SP-Bi2ON 206858 and Motor No. B100 487189, and a
blue-colored sidecar with the number 56 written on its front</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">and with the name of  barangay
Cruz Roja also indicated thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">At around 3:00 o’clock in the
afternoon, SPO3 Romeo S. Turqueza, chief of the investigation section of the
Cabanatuan City Police, received a call from a concerned citizen informing him
of the carnapping of a motorized tricycle and the killing of its driver at Sta.
Arcadia, Cabanatuan City.  His superior
forthwith dispatched a team of seven (7) policemen, including  SPO3 Turqueza and  SPO2 Felipe Castro, in two mobile cars.  Upon their arrival at Sta. Arcadia, they saw the lifeless body of
a person who was later identified as Edwin Sarengo, lying on the road.  The police learned that while Edwin Sarengo
was driving a tricycle, unidentified persons forcibly took the tricycle from
him and drove it  southward.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Immediately after,  the police conducted  hot pursuit of the takers of the
tricycle.  When they reached Sto. Tomas,
Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, they saw the motorized tricycle that had been described to
them as bearing the number 56 and the name of barangay Cruz Rojo.  It was parked in a vulcanizing shop along
the highway.  As the mobile car stopped,
four (4) persons scampered away from the shop.  They ran towards the <i>looban</i> where there were many houses.  Inspector Hipolito Bernardo and SPO4
Gonzales first apprehended Louie Limueco, who was wearing an orange-colored
T-shirt, which fitted the description of one of the carnappers earlier obtained
by the policemen.  He was about two
hundred (200) meters away from the vulcanizing shop when the police caught up
with him.  Upon interrogation, Limueco
readily identified who his companions were.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Not long after, the police caught
the Ferras brothers in an uninhabited house around three hundred fifty (350)
meters away from the vulcanizing shop.  They found on Jessie Ferras’ person a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson <i>paltik,</i>
three (3) empty shells and one live ammunition.  The two Ferras brothers and Limueco were then brought to the
police station where they were interrogated further.  Jessie Ferras admitted the commission of the crime.  The police also learned that the tricycle
belonged to Romeo Sarengo. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Aside from SPO3 Turqueza, the
prosecution presented Romeo Sarengo, who was the brother of the slain tricycle
driver and registered owner of the tricycle.  He identified the tricycle through its photograph, presented documentary
evidence on its value and testified that it was his brother Edwin who was
driving it when it was forcibly taken from him.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Appellant and Limueco denied
participation in the crime.  Appellant,
who was 20 years old, testified that he was a carnival helper, employed by a
certain Lope Verances.  At around noon
of  March  9, 1993, he was at the jeepney terminal in Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija
with Limueco looking for a jeepney that they could hire to transport the
carnival equipment.  Since they and the
jeepney owner could not agree on the amount of  rental, appellant and Limueco went to a nearby place to have soft
drinks.  Just as they finished drinking,
a tricycle driven by Teddy Macanas with appellant’s brother, Jessie riding in
the side car stopped in front of them.  Macanas and Jessie invited appellant and Limueco to go with them to La
Torre, Nueva Ecija to see a friend.  Appellant and Limueco acceded and boarded the tricycle.  Before they could reach their destination, the
tricycle had a flat tire.  Macanas drove
it slowly while looking for a vulcanizing shop.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">When they found one along the
highway, a patrol car of  Cabanatuan
City suddenly arrived.  Upon seeing the
police, Jessie and Macanas ran away while appellant and Limueco who were just
behind the tricycle remained where they were.  The police asked appellant and Limueco if they were companions of the
two who were identified as carnappers.  They denied being so.  Neither
were they aware that the tricycle had been carnapped.  The police then told them to leave lest they be involved in the
carnapping.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Appellant and Limueco then boarded
a jeep from Sta. Rosa that would take them back to Cabiao.  On second thought, the police overtook the
jeep, boarded it, and told appellant and Limueco that they would be questioned.  The police asked them to alight from the
jeep and join them in the patrol car.  On board the patrol car, appellant and Limueco’s faces were
covered.  Appellant was hit on the head
with a gun.  They were brought to the
police investigation room in Cabanatuan City.  After around thirty minutes, Jessie arrived.  When appellant talked with Jessie, the latter admitted carnapping
the tricycle and killing the driver.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Limueco corroborated appellant’s
narration of facts.  He added that they
went to Sta. Rosa to hire a vehicle for the purpose of hauling carnival
equipment from Cabiao  to San Jose
City.  Lope Verances, the husband of his
cousin, owned the carnival or <i>perya</i> equipment.  Limueco and appellant failed to hire a jeepney because they and
the jeepney owner could not agree on the amount of rental.  As they were waiting for a ride at the
nearby Petron gas station, a tricycle stopped in front of them.  Macanas was driving  the tricycle while Jessie Ferras was riding
in the sidecar.  Macanas and Jessie
asked Limueco and appellant where they were going.  When the two replied that they failed to hire a jeep to transport
the carnival equipment, Macanas and Jessie invited them to ride with them as
they were going to a friend in La Torre, Talavera,  Nueva Ecija.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">As they were on the way, between
l:30 and 2:00 p.m., the tricycle had a flat tire.  They were having the tire vulcanized when a police patrol car
stopped in front  of them.  At that same instance, Macanas and Jessie
ran away.  The policemen  asked them if the “fugitives” were their
companions.  After answering in the
negative, Limueco and appellant boarded a jeep.  The policemen  then  told  them to get off the jeep as they would be questioned and to board the
patrol car.  They were made to cover
their heads with their own shirts.  Someone hit Limueco at the back of his head and, when he regained
consciousness, he was already at the police station.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lope Verances, a  <i>perya</i> operator, confirmed the claim
of appellant and Limueco that they were in  Sta. Rosa to look for a jeepney to hire so that they could transport the
<i>perya</i> from Cabiao to San Jose City.  Verances did not tell them who to negotiate with in hiring a jeepney as
it was the two who knew the person to contact.  He instructed them to return at 2:00 p.m. but the two failed to do
so.  Verances later learned from
appellant’s mother that appellant and Limueco had been taken to jail.  He learned that they were accused of
carnapping a tricycle.</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">As stated
earlier, appellant and Limueco were found guilty of the crime charged.  However, only appellant filed a notice of
appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Before this
Court, appellant asserts innocence of the crime charged.  He alleges that the lower court erred
in:  (a) not taking into account the
fact that he should have been implicated in the case for homicide against
Jessie if indeed he was a “co-carnapper” of the tricycle; (b)  considering as incredible appellant’s story
that he was in Sta. Rosa looking for a jeepney for hire, and (c) convicting him
notwithstanding the absence of a witness on his complicity in the carnapping of
the tricycle.</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The first
assigned error adverts to the fact that two other criminal cases had been filed
against Jessie Ferras.  Aside from the
case for carnapping under Section 14 of Republic Act No. 6539, Jessie Ferras
was named defendant in two other cases:  Criminal Case No. 3591 for homicide for the death of Edwin Sarengo and
Criminal Case No. 4155 for homicide with the use of an unlicensed firearm under
Section 1, P.D. No. 1866, as amended.</span><a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Appellant’s
contention that he could not be held responsible for carnapping because he was
not implicated in the homicide case arising from the same incident is
untenable.  That matter was the concern
of peace officers and the government prosecutors.</span><a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> As correctly explained by the
Solicitor General, no reasonable inference of his innocence may be drawn from
the fact of  his exclusion in the case
for homicide inasmuch as different crimes require different proofs.</span><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">What deserves
the Court’s full attention is the basic issue of whether or not appellant’s
liability for the crime charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt by the
prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The prosecution
proved the crime of carnapping principally by the testimony of a responding
police officer.  Because he testified to
facts <i>after</i> the commission of the crime, he could only provide
circumstantial evidence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Section  4,  Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides that circumstantial evidence is
sufficient for conviction if:  (1) there
is more than one circumstance; (2)  the
facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; (3) the combination of
all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond a reasonable
doubt.  No greater degree of certainty
is required when the evidence is circumstantial than when it is direct.</span><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> In either case, what is required is
that there be proof beyond reasonable doubt that the crime was committed and
that the accused committed the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Solicitor
General points out nine (9) circumstances which allegedly “proved by
testimonial and documentary evidence” that appellant was one of the persons who
committed the offense of carnapping, namely:  “(l) the dead body of a person lying along the road obviously the victim
of a homicide; (2) bystanders who reported the killing and the carnapping describing
the offenders and the carnapped vehicle; (3) the finding of the vehicle and
persons described by the bystanders along the route pointed out and shortly
after the crime was committed; (4) appellant and his co-accused were caught by
the police officers in possession of the carnapped motor vehicle; (5) appellant
and his co-accused scampered and ran away at the sight of the police officers
indicating guilt; (6) appellant and the other accused are not only
well-acquainted with each other but even relatives; thus, Jessie Ferras y
Verances is appellant’s brother and Louie Limueco and Teddy Macanas are his
neighbors (while) Limueco’s employer, Louie (sic) Verances, is a brother of the
Ferrases’s mother; (7) none of the appellant and his co-accused owned a tricycle
and yet on March 9, 1993, Teddy Macanas was driving one; (8) appellant and his
co-accused, on board the carnapped vehicle, travelled towards Sta. Rosa, Nueva
Ecija then on to Aliaga, Nueva Ecija then from there, using the Cagayan Valley
Road, to Talavera, a circuitous route more or less three (3) times the normal
distance to Talavera from Cabanatuan City if they had travelled  directly, which shows that they purposely
used that route in order to loss (sic) their pursuers”</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Of these
circumstances based on the testimony of SPO3 Turqueza, the following appear to
be damaging to appellant:  (1) he and
Limueco were found by the police near the tricycle in the vulcanizing
shop;  (2)  they allegedly scampered  when they saw the police, and (3)  they traveled in a circuitous route as if to delude pursuers.  We find, however, that these circumstances
are not enough to constitute proof  beyond reasonable doubt that appellant and Limueco were indeed in
connivance with Jessie Ferras and Macanas in taking the tricycle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The trial court
merely gave credence to the testimony of SPO3 Turqueza because he “testified on
(sic) a very natural and straightforward manner as a professional police
officer.”  And, as a police officer, he
likewise enjoys the presumption of regularity of performance of duties, there
being no evidence to the contrary.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Considering, however, that he was
the only witness who testified on the principal aspects of the case, his
testimony must be thoroughly examined since appellant’s fate depended so much
on him.  His testimony on circumstantial
matters must be air-tight, free from any loopholes so as to erase any lingering
doubt that indeed appellant committed the crime charged.  It is worth emphasizing, too, that no other
witness corroborated his testimony.  The owner of the tricycle, Romeo Sarengo, could not be of any help in
this matter as he admitted that he acquired knowledge of his brother’s death
and the identity of his alleged killers only from the policemen of  Cabanatuan City.</span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> The prosecution case, therefore,
depended solely on the testimony of SPO3 Turquero who was not an eyewitness to
the crime and who provided only circumstantial evidence to support  the charges  filed  against  appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It appears that
there were witnesses to the carnapping incident.  If so, why did not the prosecution present at least one of  the eyewitnesses, instead of relying on the
circumstantial evidence which was the basis of the conviction of
appellant.  While no prejudicial
inference can arise against a party who fails to call a witness where the only
object of  presenting him would be to
produce corroborative or cumulative evidence,</span><a style="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> in the case at bar, SPO3 Turqueza’s
testimony from which the trial court mainly drew circumstantial evidence
against appellant is inadequate and insufficient to prove guilt beyond
reasonable doubt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The same may be
said of the circumstance of appellant and Limueco having “scampered” when the
police arrived at the vulcanizing shop.  It would have been easy for the prosecution to present other witnesses
to support SPO3 Turqueza’s testimony on account of its claim that there were
many bystanders in the crime scene that fateful afternoon.  They could have been summoned to testify if
other responding policemen could not appear in court as witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It should be
remembered that the doctrine of long standing that the testimony of a lone
witness, if credible and  positive, is
sufficient to convict an accused</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> applies only to eyewitnesses.  On the other hand, an uncorroborated
circumstantial evidence is certainly not sufficient for conviction when the
evidence itself is in serious doubt.</span><a style="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> While the two-witness rule applies
only in cases specified by law, its application should be resorted to if the
testimony of the sole witness on circumstantial matters leaves much to be
desired.  In the instant case, the
testimony of a principal prosecution witness  discloses a weakness in the case for the prosecution and cast crucial
doubt on the guilt of appellant.</span><a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Although it is
not for this Court or the defense to decide whom to present as witness for the
prosecution, for that matter is within the purview of the latter’s
prerogatives,</span><a style="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> this lapse of the prosecution in
failing to support the testimony of its sole witness on circumstantial matters
has proven to be a costly one in the instant case.  We find the prosecution’s case to be weak.  It does not measure up to the quantum of
proof required for conviction in criminal cases - proof  beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">SPO3 Turqueza
testified that appellant and Limueco were with the  carnappers when the police chanced upon them.  But the fact that they were together  does not necessarily imply that they were
engaged in the conspiracy to take possession of the tricycle illegally.  SPO3 Turqueza did not mention any positive acts
of cooperation exhibited by the accused with Jessie Ferras and Macanas.  If mere presence in the crime scene may not
necessarily be considered indicative of criminal conspiracy in the absence of
any other proof of concerted criminal purpose,</span><a style="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> with more reason, being with the
culprits in a place other than the crime scene may not imply that the accused
persons are co-conspirators.  Notably,
SPO3 Turqueza did not testify as to the <i>number</i> of persons allegedly seen
taking the tricycle.  This fact would
have served as a measure for the inference that appellant could have been one
of the carnappers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">If indeed
appellant “scampered” from the vulcanizing shop upon seeing the policemen, such
a reaction was but natural considering the hurried flight of his brother and
Macanas.  Appellant’s story that he
stayed put in the shop and even answered the query of the police appears to be
even more credible considering that, unlike the uncorroborated testimony of  SPO3 Turqueza, Limueco corroborated it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Neither may
appellant’s admission of relationship with the principal perpetrator of the
crimes of carnapping and homicide mean that he was in cahoots with the
carnappers.  Similarly, Limueco’s
acquaintance with both Jessie Ferras, who was also working in the <i>perya</i>
and Macanas may not necessarily imply criminal conspiracy.  Relationship alone does not imply
conspiracy.  An assumed intimacy between
two persons does not have any legal significance as far as conspiracy is
concerned.  Conspiracy transcends
companionship.</span><a style="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Furthermore, conspiracy as a basis
for conviction should be proved in the same manner as the criminal act
itself.  While conspiracy need not be
established by direct evidence, for it may be inferred from the conduct of the
accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime, all taken
together, however, the evidence must reasonably be strong enough to show a
community of criminal design.</span><a style="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Hence, absent any proof that
appellant and Limueco were in conspiracy with the carnappers or even that they
knew that the vehicle they were riding on was carnapped, their having taken
that ride <i>after</i> it was forcibly taken from its possessor may not
necessarily mean unity of  criminal
purpose with the culprits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Neither may the
circuitous route taken by the tricycle imply that all the riders thereon had a
community of criminal purpose.  Jessie
Ferras and Macanas  might have taken
that particular route to avoid detection and apprehension by the authorities.  However, that presumption may not extend to
appellant and Limueco who, for lack of proof to the contrary, merely hitched a
ride with them.  Hitchhiking is not
uncommon in rural areas where modes of transportation are minimal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">We are not in
any way ruling out the <i>possibility</i> that appellant and Limueco were
participants in the crime.  It is
simply that the prosecution failed to discharge properly the <i>onus</i>
required by law.  It miserably failed to
prove beyond peradventure of doubt the connecting link showing community of
design between appellant and the principals of the crime, specifically Jessie
Ferras.  As the well-entrenched doctrine
states, where the circumstances obtaining in a case are capable of two
inferences, one of which is consistent with the presumption of innocence while
the others may be compatible with the finding of guilt, the court must acquit
the accused because the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty
and therefore is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction.</span><a style="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The judgment of
acquittal should benefit not only appellant but Limueco as well considering the
similarity in their situation.</span><a style="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> This is in consonance with the
