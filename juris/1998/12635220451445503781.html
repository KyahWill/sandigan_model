administrative complaint against Edilberto Ho, Clerk II detailed at the Regional
Trial Court (RTC), Branch 16, Naval, Biliran, for absenteeism, insubordination,

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On August 16,
1996, Sergio Eamiguel, Officer-in-charge of RTC, Branch 16, Naval, Biliran,

for the whole month of December 1995, except December 1 where he was present in
the morning. Complainant alleged that in the afternoon of December 1, 1995,
respondent superimposed his initial/signature on that of Court Interpreter
Antonio P. Superable in the office logbook. But complainant did not state
whether or not respondent was present at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The complaint
also alleged that on January 11, 1996, complainant sent a letter to respondent
requesting him to report to the office immediately because of the voluminous
work to be done. Respondent, however, ignored the request and instead uttered
invectives against complainant. On January 12, 1996, complainant issued a memorandum
to respondent requiring him to explain in writing within 72 hours why no
administrative sanction should be imposed on him for his failure to report to
the office. Respondent again ignored the memorandum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Respondent
denied all the allegations in the complaint in his Answer dated October 2,
1996. He asserted that all his leaves were approved and that he never left the
office after signing his name in the logbook. He also claimed that complainant
was motivated by ill will, hatred and malice in filing the instant complaint
against him. Complainant allegedly suspected him of informing some members of
the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Biliran Chapter that complainant
falsified his monthly report of the pending cases at RTC Branch 16.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We referred the
complaint to judge Briccio T. Aguilos, Jr., Acting Presiding Judge of the RTC
Branch 16, Naval, Biliran, for investigation, report and recommendation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On April 17,
1997, Judge Aguilos submitted his report finding complainant guilty of the
charges and recommending that he be suspended from office for minimum period of
six months to a maximum of one year. Judge Aguilos observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">… More than sufficient evidence
(both documentary and testimonial) were shown, presented, established and formally
offered by Complainant thru counsel, to establish and prove the administrative
offense of “irregular attendance and absences” from both the performance of
work and from Office of respondent – Edilberto C. Ho. Respondent’s own evidence
as presented and formally offered thru counsel constituting likewise
documentary and testimonial evidence could not, and failed to offset and/or
contradict complainant’s evidence … There is absolutely no basis for dispute
whatsoever, that complainant has substantially proven and established by clear,
convincing, and positive if not preponderant evidence as to respondent’s actual
commission of “frequent unauthorized absences from duty during  regular office hours” … </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The Office of
the Court Administrator affirmed the factual findings of the Judge Aguilos but
disagreed with the recommended penalty. It noted the resolution of the Court En
Banc dated February 11, 1997 in A.M. No. 97-1-15-RTC (Re: Absence without
official leave [AWOL] of Edilberto C. Ho) which ordered that respondent be
dropped from the service effective November 2, 1995 without prejudice to the
final outcome of the pending case filed against him in the sala of Judge
Briccio Aguilos Jr. The Office of the Court Administrator recommended the
dismissal of petitioner from the service, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">Respondent Ho  was dropped from the service because of his
absences without leave (AWOL) and such penalty does not include forfeiture of
all the benefits due him upon his seperation from service. However, after due investigation
it established that respondent Ho committed other acts inimical to the service
which deserves a stiffer penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">It has been constantly held that
officers and employees of judiciary should observe the highest standards of
public service. Although a  mere Clerk
II, respondent is duty bound to serve with the highest degree of
responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency. In this regard, respondent
failed. He offered no reason for having incurred his frequent absences but
merely manifested his desire to return to his  original station due to his differences with herein complainant.
Repondent’s behavior fell short of the performance of his duties. His absences
without leave for prolonged period and his loafing and frequent unauthorized
absences from duty during regular office hours constitutes not only
inefficiency in his work but a dereliction of duty. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We agree with
the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator. Respondent’s
frequent absences without authorization prejudiced public service. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Moreover, respondent is guilty not
only of habitual absenteeism but also dishonesty. Respondent would like to make
it appear on record that he was present during those times when he was in fact
absent by signing his name in the logbook and then leaving the office
thereafter. The Court will not tolerate such dishonesty committed by a court
employee because every official and employee of the judiciary, from the
presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be example of integrity,
uprightness and honesty. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Respondent’s offense, therefore,
warrants his dismissal from the service with forfeiture of benefits. </span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
