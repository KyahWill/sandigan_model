				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In an Affidavit/Complaint dated March 19, 1997, spouses Avelino 
and Asteria accused respondent Judge Prostasio G. Asadon of the 6th 
Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Llorente-Hernani, Eastern Samar, of 
evident bias and partiality, abuse of authority and violation of Supreme
 Court circulars on punctuality and observance of office hours. They 
alleged:
<blockquote>
  <p>"x x x </p>
  <p>"That at around noon yesterday, March 18, 1997, we were charged 
with the trumped up charge of Slight Physical Injuries before the 6th 
Municipal Trial Court of Llorente-Hernani, presided by Judge Prostasio 
G. Asadon; </p>
  <p>"That at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, we were arrested by policemen and brought to the municipal jail; </p>
  <p>"That Judge Asadon did not accord us the right to present 
controverting evidence to the fabricated charges by means of 
counter-affidavits but instead issued a warrant for our arrest with 
undue haste; </p>
  <p>"That after issuing the warrant of arrest, Judge Asadon immediately left his station and went home to Gen. MacArthur town; </p>
  <p>"After our arrest, we sought assistance from Atty. Rufilo L. Tan 
who filed an Omnibus Motion which was filed at 3:10 o'clock in the 
afternoon but there was no one to act on it because Judge Asadon had 
gone home already; A [sic] relative offered to put up a cash bond of 
P1,000.00 for our provisional liberty but we did not proceed with it 
because there was no one to issue an Order of Release; </p>
  <p>"The municipal employees told us that Judge Asadon often arrive 
[sic] late and always go home at noon and that he had never been known 
to hold office in the afternoon x x x; </p>
  <p>"The daughter-in-law of Feleciano Bade who is the complainant 
against us is a relative of the wife of Judge Asadon, hence, his bias 
and partiality against us."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his Comment dated August 16, 1997, respondent judge foisted the following defenses:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"xxx </p>
  <p>"The accused Avelino Daiz and Asteria Daiz, has [sic] been 
nourishing hatred and rancor in their hearts arising from respondent's 
[sic] issuance of a Warrant of Arrest due to the fact that they were 
about to escape, as in fact, they have escaped after they were released 
on Bail on Recognizance since March 20, 1997, and up to now their 
whereabouts is [sic] unknown. x x x </p>
  <p>"In regard to the imputation against respondent for evident bias 
and partially and abuse of authority, the series of orders x x x will 
show that respondent have [sic] been lenient in dealing with the 
accused. </p>
  <p>"x x x </p>
  <p>"It is not true and the same is vehemently denied that respondent 
went home to Gen. MacArthur in the afternoon on March 18, 1997, because 
on that date respondent was in the Municipality of Hernani, E. Samar, to
 attend an equally urgent Crim. Case No. 3975, entitled: PEOPLE VS. 
FEDERICO AMANO, For, CONSENTED ADBUCTION, in compliance with an EN BANC 
RESOLUTION of the Honorable Supreme Court, dated June 9, 1994. x x x </p>
  <p>"Respondent had absolutely no knowledge of any relationship to his 
wife with the wife of the Offended Party in fact, respondent's wife 
[sic] given name, middle name and surname when still single is ROSITA 
ANES CALZITA, hence complainant's version to this effect is unfounded 
and an outright lies [sic]. </p>
  <p>"As to the charge of violation of Supreme Court Circular on 
Punctuality and Strict Complaince of [sic] Office Hours, same is also 
denied. If respondent has been plying from his Official Station of 
Llorente to other Municipal Circuit Trial Courts, like the MCTC 
Salcedo-Gen. MacArthur; MCTC Guiuan-Mercedes; MCTC 
Maydolong-Balangkayan; MTC Borongan, and MCTC San Julian-Sulat, it was 
in obedience to the Orders and designations of his superior Officer. x x

<p>On January 1, 1998, while this case was still pending, respondent judge died of pneumonia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>In a Memorandum dated February 27, 1998, the Court Administrator 
exonerated the late respondent judge of all the charges except for abuse
 of authority based on the following findings:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"x x x </p>
  <p>"The records show that on March 18, 1997, x x x respondent issued 
on Order directing the issuance of a warrant of arrest against the 
complainants. The following day, March 19, 1997 x x x another Order was 
again issued by respondent ordering the parties to file their respective
 affidavits and counter-affidavits. </p>
  <p>"It is evident that respondent judge had been remiss in the correct
 application of the law when he immediately ordered the arrest of the 
complainants without requiring them to first submit their 
counter-affidavits and the affidavits of their witnesses as well as any 
evidence in their own behalf. Suffice it to say, such actuation on the 
part of respondent is contrary to the provisions of Section 12, (b) and 
Section 16, of the said Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, which states
 [sic]: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'Section 12 (b). If commenced by information.-- When the case is 
commenced by information, or is not dismissed pursuant to the next 
preceding paragraph, the court shall issue an order which, together with
 copies of the affidavits and other evidence submitted by the 
prosecution, shall require the accused to submit his counter-affidavit 
and the affidavits of his witnesses as well as any evidence in his 
behalf, serving copies thereof on the complainant or prosecutor not 
later than ten (10) days from receipt of said order. x x x
    </p>
    <p>'Section 16. Arrest of Accused - The court shall not order the 
arrest of the accused except for failure to appear whenever required.' x
 x x
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"x x x </p>
  <p>"By ordering the arrest of the accused immediately after the filing
 of the charges against them, respondent Judge exhibited abuse of 
authority, thus, giving rise to herein complainant's perception that he 
is partial to the private complainant. </p>
  <p>"Anent the charge that the daughter-in-law of the private 
complainant in Criminal Case No. 3977 is a relative of the wife of 
respondent, no substantial evidence has been presented by the 
complainants to substantiate their allegation that his (respondent's) 
actuation in the instant case had been x x x influenced by the alleged 
relationship of the latter's (respondent's) wife with the daughter 
-in-law of the private complainant. </p>
  <p>"As regards the charge of violation of Supreme Court Circular on 
punctuality and strict observance of office hours, respondent Judge 
satisfactorily refuted the charge. x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, the Court Administrator recommended that a fine in the 
amount of ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) be deducted from whatever 
retirement benefits the late respondent judge may be entitled to 
receive.
</p><p>We express our concurrence with the findings and recommendation of the Court Administrator.
</p><p>First. The respondent judge committed grave abuse of authority 
when he hastily issued a warrant of arrest against the complainants. His
 premature issuance of a warrant of arrest on the same day, March 18, 
1998, that the information for slight physical injuries was filed 
against complainant spouses was in gross violation of the summary 
procedure rule that the accused should first be notified of the charges 
against them and given the opportunity to file their counter-affidavits 
and other countervailing evidence. It cannot be justified on the ground 
that respondent judge has information that the spouses would escape. 
Nothing in the records validates the content, source, and extent of that
 information. There is no gainsaying the fact that the premature 
issuance of the warrant of arrest against complainant spouses caused 
them great prejudice as they were deprived of their precious liberty. We
 reiterate the rule that although a judge may not always be subjected to
 disciplinary action for every erroneous order or decision he renders, 
that relative immunity is not a license to be negligent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> or abusive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 and arbitrary in prerogatives. If judges wantonly misuse the powers 
vested in them by law, there will not only confusion in the 
administration of justice but even also oppressive disregard of the 
basic requirements of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>We find the charges of evident bias and partiality and violation 
of our circulars on punctuality and observance of office hours to be 
without basis. Complainants alleged that "the daughter-in-law of 
Feleciano Bade who is the complainant against us is a relative of the 
wife of Judge Asadon." The respondent judge categorically belied the 
existence of any kinship between his wife and his accusers' victim. 
Complainants alleged that "the daughter -in-law of Feleciano Bade who is
 the complainant against us is a relative of the wife of Judge Asadon." 
The respondent judge categorically belied the existence of any kinship 
between his wife and his accuser's victim. Complainants did not offer an
 iota of evidence to prove otherwise.
</p><p>Similarly unsubstantiated is the charge that the respondent judge
 did not observe office hours. To be sure, the charge is mere hearsay. 
Complainants admit that the charge is what "the municipal employees told
 us that Judge Asadon often arrive [sic] late and always go [sic] home 
at noon and that he had never been known to hold office in the 
afternoon". To repudiate the charge, the respondent judge attached to 
his Comment the following documents to explain his afternoon trips out 
of Llorente, Eastern Samar: (1) Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>dated
 June 17, 1994 issued by the Supreme Court En Banc directing him, 
assisted by two of his office personnel, to hold court sessions at the 
Municipality of Hernani Eastern Samar; (2) Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 of Police Inspector Paulito Candido stating that in the afternoon of 
March 18, 1997, the day he issued the warrant of arrest against 
complainant spouses, he was at the municipal building of Hernani, 
Eastern Samar conducting a hearing in connection with Criminal Case No. 
3975, entitled, "People v. Federico Amano" for Abduction with Consent; 
and (3) various Memoranda and Special Designations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 dated July 20, 1990, November 7, 1990, November 9, 1990, June 18, 1991,
 July 8, 1991, July 30, 1991, November 28, 1991, March 11, 1992, April 
20, 1993, July 30, 1993, October 13, 1993, November 11, 1993, May 23, 
1995, June 1, 1995, November 10, 1995, January 26, 1996, May 29, 1996, 
July 2, 1996, and August 21, 1996, all directing him to travel to other 
municipal trial court salas in different parts of Eastern Samar to try, 
hear and decide specified cases which had been the subject of petitions 
for inhibition that were granted by Judge Paterno T. Alvarez, who is the
 Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Borongan, Eastern Samar.
 All these abundantly prove that the respondent judge observed the 
required work hours in the disperation of his judicial functions.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the late respondent Judge Protasio G.
 Asadon is cleared of all the charges filed against him by complainant 
spouses Avelino and Asteria Daiz, except with respect to the charge of 
abuse of authority the penalty for which is a fine in the sum of TEN 
THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00). The fine shall be deducted from the 
retirement benefits of the respondent judge and the balance shall 
immediately released to his heirs.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
</strong>
</p><p><em>Regalado, (Chairman), Mendoza,</em> and <em>Martinez, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p><em>Melo, J.</em>, on leave.
