23

Hotel Nikko
Manila Garden (Nikko for brevity), a corporation duly organized and

under Philippine laws and primarily engaged in the hotel and restaurant
business, employed petitioner Antonio Habana as Rooms Division Director.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then General Manager 
Masakazu

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the course of his 
employment,
however, petitioner encountered several difficulties, among which  was 
his failure to unite and control his
managerial staff.  In particular, petitioner
had several conflicts with his Senior Rooms Manager, Dolores Samson.  On
 9 January 1990, he issued a memorandum
admonishing her for her failure to comply with the standard operating 
procedure
of informing petitioner, being her immediate supervisor, of matters 
pertaining
to their division’s operations.  Petitioner reminded Samson that it was 
her  responsibility to advise and inform him of all memoranda,
reports, problems and other matters relative to their operations  which 
come to her attention.</span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Similarly, in a special meeting called on 24

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thereafter, on  22 March 
1990, then Assistant General
Manager Masao Yokoo issued a memorandum expressing concern over the 
dispute
between petitioner and his managerial staff in the Rooms Division.  Mr. 
Yokoo stressed the importance of good
teamwork and urged petitioner to take responsibility for the “unhealthy
situation” and to immediately carry out corrective measures.  Otherwise,
 management may be compelled to
intervene and take action.  The
memorandum reads in full:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>I would like you to realize that management is very much 
concerned
with the conflicts involving yourself and your managerial staff within 
Rooms

we are calling your attention through this manner, but management has 
been
aware for quite some time of the disunity and disharmony that has 
remained
unresolved inspite of the several  attempts management has initiated for
 you to have person-to-person
dialogues with your managers, inasmuch as management wants you, as 
Director for
Rooms Division, to take responsibility for the existence of such an 
unhealthy
situation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We strongly believe that <u>good teamwork</u> coupled with 
high
respect for each other’s potentiality and creativity within your area of
responsibility is essential to motivate efficiency and improve 
self-esteem of
your staff,  as we consider it of vital
importance for operations and should be given the highest priority at 
this
instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a result, management has decided to give you due process 
to carry
out management’s perception through instant corrective measures, or 
management
would be compelled to act or intervene directly and irrevocably.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Instead of complying, 
petitioner
issued a reply belying the existence of any conflict within the Rooms 
Division.
He explained that the misunderstanding was only between himself and his
assistant Dolores Samson which arose when he reprimanded her for 
violating the
hotel’s SOPs.  Petitioner stated that
the aforequoted memorandum should have been addressed to Ms.  Samson.  
He suggested that  “better result
will be attained if you (Yokoo) call the attention of those 
uncooperative with
their supervisor whose intention is to achieve a systematic and orderly
operation of his division such as mine . . . .”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> He further stated that he had tried to solve 
the
conflict following the applicable disciplinary actions but “the only way
 to
make it effective to Ms. Samson is when management make(s) her realize 
that her
improper behavior is to the detriment of the operation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aside from the 
afore-discussed
conflict, the Labor Arbiter found that petitioner was engaged in real 
estate
business, was frequently absent and tardy and  that there were rampant 
violations of hotel rules due to petitioner’s
failure to effectively manage his division.  For instance, an employee 
with an approved room discounts for only one
night (August 13, 1989) was allowed to change the reservation to August 
17 and
extend their stay availing of the discounted rate up to August 21 1989. 
 There were also complaints  regarding wrong key issuances and double
check-in of guests in one room.  In addition,
the rooms in the hotel were often found dirty and unkempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As a result thereof on 24
 April
1990, Mr. Tamiyasu Okawa who was appointed on 26 March 1990, as 
Executive
Assistant for Sales, Marketing and Rooms and replaced Mr. Yokoo as 
petitioner’s
immediate superior, issued a memorandum instructing petitioner, Ms. 
Vicky
Raquepo (Roomskeeping Manager) and Mr. Danilo Cabaluna (Housekeeping 
Manager)
to conduct a daily inspection of the guestrooms and the public areas, 
due to
the several complaints received by management.  The full text of the

effectively stripping him of his powers and responsibilities without
justification.  He declared that the
above order was a form of harassment to “ease him out of his position.” 
 In the said memorandum, petitioner
illustrated in detail the other forms of alleged harassment perpetuated
supposedly  by Mr. Okawa, like the
transfer of petitioner to a smaller office;  the removal of petitioner’s
 name as one of the approving officers in the

functions

Reservations, Telephone Departments as well as attending to matters

like to make it of record that I have no plans to resign because I have 
not
done anything which warrants me to do so.  I will try to do my job to 
the best of my ability despite that fact that
you have been persistently making my working conditions unbearable in

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Consequently, on 17 May 
1990,
petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and damages against 
Hotel
Nikko and its officers Masakasu Tsuruoka, Masao Yokoo and Tamiyasu 
Okawa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On 23 September 1994, 
Labor
Arbiter Manuel R. Caday dismissed the complaint.  He ruled that when 
petitioner sensed that the hotel’s top
management has lost its confidence in his ability to effectively manage 
the Rooms
Division, he offered to voluntarily resign  in exchange for a large 
amount of separation pay.  Labor Arbiter Caday further declared that
the alleged acts of harassment were non-existent, being merely the
“self-serving imaginations conceptualized by complainant who for 
boasting too
much of his alleged twenty (20) years know-how in hotel operations, 
could not
swallow his pride and accept his being constantly reminded, reproached 
and
reprimanded by his disciplinarian new superior officer, respondent 
Okawa, for
his failing ability to effectively manage and control his own Division.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On appeal to the NLRC, 
the latter
rendered a decision on 31 January 1995 affirming the findings of  Labor 
Arbiter Caday.  The NLRC ruled that the “alleged
harassments”  were  “nothing more than resentment to (the) high
and strict standards of work and personal grudge or animosity towards a
superior.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Likewise, the NLRC maintained that petitioner
voluntarily resigned as manifested by his act of negotiating for a huge 
amount
of separation pay.  Hence, the
dispositive portion of the NLRC decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated 23

raised in
this case are factual in nature and firm is the principle that “factual
findings of the NLRC, particularly when they coincide with those of the 
Labor

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner accuses the 
hotel’s top
brass of deliberately  committing acts
of harassment which were intended to and eventually succeeded in forcing
 him to
resign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner laments that 
he was
completely stripped of his  powers and
functions as Director of the Rooms Division when Mr. Okawa, Executive 
Assistant
for Sales, Marketing and Rooms and petitioner’s immediate superior,  
tasked him with inspecting the hotel’s guest
rooms and public areas.  Conducting
these daily inspections, he adds, took up all of his working hours 
leaving him
no time to attend to his other important duties.  Hence,  “the very 
essence
and substance of his directorship” was taken away from him.  He was, in 
effect, demoted to a mere room
inspector “with a rank a notch higher than a bellboy.”  Moreover, 
petitioner could no longer endure
the humiliation and indignity of going from room to room, inspecting  
the toilets and garbage areas, “clad in his
standard formal suit  and tie”  and  concludes that this  was part of
a malicious scheme to “harass”  him out
of his position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are not convinced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The instructions for 
petitioner,
along with the Executive Housekeeper (Danilo Cabaluna) and the Executive
Roomskeeper (Victoria Raquepo) to conduct daily inspection of the guest 
rooms
and public areas of the hotel could hardly be characterized  as  
harassment.  The orders were not
borne out of mere whim and caprice.  As
explicitly stated in the Memorandum dated 24 April 1990, the management 
was
getting several complaints regarding the hotel’s guestrooms and public 
areas</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and petitioner did not dispute this.  In

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If petitioner was 
well-aware that
conducting room inspections was a major part of his responsibilities, 
then, he
certainly had no reason to complain, much less be embarrassed about.  
Moreover,  inspections conducted by division heads are not without 
precedent.  Ms. Pearl Aragon, Hotel Nikko’s Director
for Administration (who holds the same level position as petitioner) 
testified
that she herself  had to inspect  garbage areas and the hotel sewers and
 she
did not feel the least bit embarassed about it because it was part of 
her
work.  Even the General Manager, she
added, would go around and inspect various areas of the hotel.  She 
expounded thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </span>That is something that we

being asked to inspect wet and dry garbage areas.  Even the GM, itself, 
would go around and inspect each
places.  So I don’t think that anyone
to be  exempt to do those things.  All of us have our own duties to 
perform

don’t think that it is unusual for asking Mr. Habana to go and inspect

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner’s complaint 
that he was
made to conduct  inspections the whole
day while his two subordinates were assigned only a few hours each is
unmeritorious.  Petitioner was the
head of his division.  Precisely, it
was his duty to take command responsibility.  Sadly, petitioner has lost
 sight of the fact that being a leader is not
all  prestige and glamour but includes,
in great measure, hard work.  Being
charged to take action is not harassment but a challenge to petitioner’s
leadership capability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner puts too much
emphasis  on the  merit for cleanliness given to Hotel Nikko
in 1989 by the Department of Tourism.  He stated that the same was 
awarded at the time he took over the helm of
the hotel’s Rooms Division.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This pronouncement 
deserves scant
consideration.  Firstly, in his
testimony during the 11 March 1992 hearing, petitioner explicitly stated
 that
he was not aware that Hotel Nikko was awarded such recognition,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Secondly,  the
Hotel must be able to maintain, if not surpass, the same standard of
cleanliness which merited them the award in the first place.  Hence, the
 need for the daily inspections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Equating the “daily 
inspection
measure” to harassment is but the result of petitioner’s misplaced 
perception.  On the contrary, it was a valid solution
conceived by top management to counter guest complaints on the state of 
hotel’s
guestrooms and public areas.  It cannot
be denied that cleanliness is top priority in the hotel business.  
Petitioner was the Rooms Division Director
and  this was his responsibility.  He was not singled out.  He was 
simply called to task.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another act of 
harassment,
petitioner contends, was his unceremonious  ouster from his old office 
and his transfer to a “pitiable passageway.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner exaggerates.  
As found by the Labor Arbiter  and the NLRC, said move was brought about
 by
operational necessity.  Mr. Okawa needed
a room which could be divided into an office and a meeting area.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>Again, this is not an uncommon practice.  
From her own experience, Ms. Aragon

have to do to  give way to some
operational requirements.  Its’ not the

personnel requisition forms  were
concoctions aimed to force him to resign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On  the first claim,  
aside
from petitioner’s self-serving allegation, there is nothing in the 
record to
support the same.  On the second
accusation, we agree with the findings of the Labor Arbiter.  Said 
rearrangement was not intended to ease
petitioner out, rather it was to enable Mr. Okawa, petitioner’s 
immediate
supervisor “to have stricter control inasmuch as in the past, there were
 many
occasions that the hiring, recruitment and transfer of employees were

Abott Laboratories <i>vs</i>. NLRC, 154 SCRA 713, We ruled:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“x x x Even as the law is solicitous of the welfare of the
employees, it must also protect the right of an employer to exercise

free will of management to conduct its own business affairs to achieve

purpose cannot be denied.”</p>

<blockquote>So long as a company’s management prerogatives are exercised
 in
good faith for the advancement of the employer’s interest and not for 
the
purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under 
special

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
harassment
 issue raised by petitioner was but a smokescreen to conceal  his own 
shortcomings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The next issue to be 
resolved is
whether or not petitioner voluntarily resigned.  Petitioner asserts that
 private respondents coerced and
intimidated him into resigning through their collective acts of 
harassment
which caused him tremendous psychological and emotional stress.  He 
further alleges that the  <s>P</s>120,000.00 separation pay was the
pay-off offered by Hotel Nikko in exchange for his resignation.  
Petitioner stresses that he had no
intention of resigning as manifested in his memorandum  dated 27 April 
1990, the pertinent portion
of which states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="XXX"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>When I issued a memorandum to a
subordinate who had repeatedly failed to follow the hotel’s SOP’s, you
reprimanded me and instructed me not to send out memos anymore.  When I 
tried to explain, you shouted at me
and ordered me to resign.  I would like
to make it of record that I have no plans to resign because I have not 
done
anything which warrants me to do so.  I
will try to do my job to the best of my ability despite that fact that 
you have
been persistently making my working conditions unbearable in order to 
force me
to resign;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Contrariwise, private 
respondents
contend that it was petitioner who approached (around the first week of 
April
1990)  Ms.  Aragon indicating his desire to resign due to his 
“difficulty in
coping with his responsibilities as Rooms Division Director”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and his differences with his immediate boss, 
Mr.
Okawa.  Petitioner wanted a severance
pay of  P250,000.00 and he solicited Ms.
Aragon’s assistance in this regard.  Negotiations  ensued until both
parties (petitioner and Hotel Nikko through Ms. Aragon) agreed on  
P120,000.00  as separation pay.  Thereafter,
on 2 May 1990, petitioner went to the office of the Comptroller, Mr. 
Rosales to
get his check.  Upon  Mr. Rosales’ request, pursuant to hotel
policy, petitioner prepared his letter of resignation (typed by Mr. 
Rosales’
secretary) and submitted it to  the
former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We agree with  private 
respondents that petitioner
voluntarily resigned.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Voluntary resignation is 
defined
as the voluntary act of  an employee who
“finds himself in a situation where he believes that personal reasons 
cannot be
sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service and he has no other 
choice
but to dissassociate himself from his employement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> In this case, as indicated in the various 
memoranda
he received from his superiors, petitioner was clearly  having trouble 
performing his job, one which
undeniably carries immense responsibilities.  Notable too was 
petitioner’s failure to see eye to eye with
his  immediate bosses, first, Mr. Yokoo
and then Mr. Okawa.  Because of these
difficulties, it was quite reasonable for petitioner to think of, and
eventually, relinquishing his position voluntarily (and get a fat sum as
severance pay in the bargain) instead of waiting to be fired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner could not have
been  intimidated  by  private  respondents to
quit.  In his 27 April 1990 memorandum,
petitioner emphatically vowed not to resign despite private respondents’
alleged acts of harassment.  Surprisingly, however, after only a few 
days he did quit alleging that
he was forced and harassed to do so.  If petitioner was adamant in his 
intention not to be coerced into
leaving,  how could  he suddenly be forced to resign.  Petitioner 
glaringly contradicted
himself.  His excuse is, thus,
unbelievable and unjustifiable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">  <i>Guatson Int’l. 
Travel &amp; Tours vs. NLRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">does
 not
apply in this case.  The factual milieu
is different and more importantly the <i>Guatson</i> case  involved a  
mere messenger who, understandably, could easily be cowed and forced by
his employer to quit, while the case at bar involves a well-educated
professional and  a managerial employee
at that.  The ruling in <i>Samaniego v.
NLRC</i></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"></span></span></a><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">is
instructive:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It must be emphasized as well that the petitioners are not 
ordinary
laborers or rank-and-file personnel who may not be able to completely
comprehend and realize the consequences of their acts.  The petitioners 
are managerial employees
holding responsible positions.  They are
educated individuals.  For his part,
petitioner Samaniego immediately assumed a ranking position in a 
competing
company after his  resignation from
Sandvik Philippines, Inc.  Under these
circumstances, it can hardly be said that they were coerced into 
resigning from
the company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Solicitor General maintains that receipt of separation 
pay is
not a bar to contesting the legality of dismissal from employment.  The 
observation is beside the point.  As stated earlier, there is no illegal
dismissal in the case at bar.  </blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it clearly appears that the petitioners
voluntarily resigned from the company for a valuable consideration.  The
 quitclaim they executed in favor of the
company amounts to a valid and binding compromise agreement.  To allow  
the petitioners to repudiate the same will be to countenance unjust
enrichment on their part.  The Court
will not permit such a situation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner tries to belie
 private
respondents’ contention that they negotiated for the former’s separation
 pay by
pointing out that the negotiations allegedly began in the first week of 
April
1990 but petitioner categorically stated on 27 April 1990 that he would 
not
resign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner’s claim is not
convincing.  As testified by  Ms.  Aragon, in early April 1990, 
petitioner told her  he was thinking of resigning.  At that time 
petitioner had not yet made up
his mind.  Apparently, he made his
decision to voluntarily quit after 27 April 1990 and after finally 
agreeing on
the P120,000.00 separation pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furthermore, the fact 
that Mr.
Rosales, the hotel’s Comptroller required petitioner to submit a 
resignation
letter before his separation pay was  released did not militate against 
the voluntariness of his
resignation.  Petitioner readily
acceded and was the one who dictated the contents of the said letter to 
Mr.
Rosales’ secretary who typed the same and he showed neither resistance 
nor
protest when he submitted his letter of resignation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span><a style="" href="%20Signed%20Resolutions#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Finally, the timing of
petitioner’s letter of protest, which he sent to private respondents 
just after
he received the check for his severance pay  on 3 May 1990,   arouses 
suspicion
of bad faith.  He wanted to exact
something more from  private  respondents despite his voluntary
resignation and acceptance of a huge amount of separation pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In  view of the foregoing
 findings,  petitioner’s claim  for  damages must,  likewise, fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is hereby <b>DISMISSED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Narvasa CJ.
