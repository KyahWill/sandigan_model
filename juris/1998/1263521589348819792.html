				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The parents of Cochise and Beebom must have lifted their sorrowful faces heavenward and blurted out an anguished cry: “Oh God! Why must it be they, so young, so loving, so beautiful and so promising, to be brutally snatched from our embrace and never to be seen again?”<br><br>Conchise, whose full name was Ernesto Bernabe II, was 26 years old on the fateful day of April 26, 1990 and Ana Lourdes Castaños, or Beebom to her family and friends, was 22. Cochise had just graduated from the University of the Philippines with a degree of Bachelor of Laws and was reviewing for the bar examinations, while Beebom was a graduating student at the College of Mass Communications from the same university. Both excelled in academic and extra-curricular activities.<br><br>The senseless and gruesome killing of the young man and woman, both full of promise, horrifies us. But what makes this crime more despicable in our eyes is the involvement of people sworn to uphold the law.<br><br>For the crimes for which they were charged and sentenced, appellants now come to this Court asking us to give their case a second look, insisting on their innocence.<br><br>Sometime in March, 1990, Rodolfo Manalili, a businessman asked Felimon Garcia, his townmate, if he knew somebody who could allegedly effect the arrest of one Robert Herrera, the suspect in the killing of his brother, Delfin Manalili.<br><br>Felimon Garcia said he knew one and arranged a meeting with him.<br><br>On April 21, 1990, Felimon Garcia called up Manalili and informed him that he already contacted a policeman to help him and said that the policeman wanted to talk to him. So an appointment was set at 12:00 p.m. of April 22, 1990 at Dau Exit, North Expressway, Mabalacat, Pampanga.<br><br>On said date Manalili, together with his son Richard, arrived at the Dau Exit at about 12:30 p.m. of April 22, 1990. Felimon Garcia was already there waiting for Manalili.<br><br>They proceeded to the Golden Palace Chinese Restaurant where they would meet Roberto Lising. They, however, had to change venue because Roberto Lising’s live-in partner, Ligaya Faustino and other companions were in the restaurant. So they went instead to a nearby carinderia and instructed Felimon Garcia to follow them there.<br><br>Shortly, Felimon Garcia arrived and introduced Roberto Lising, Enrico Dizon and another man armed with a service pistol to Manalili. During the meeting, Manalili gave them P2,000.00 and instructed them to go and see Vic Nabua,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> his employee who will point to them the person to be arrested.<br><br>On April 23-24, Lising’s group went to Quezon City and met Vic Lisboa. They conducted a surveillance on the Castaños residence in the hope of seeing Herrera. Failing to do so, the group was asked to come back the next day.<br><br>On April 25, the same group arrived at the vicinity of the Castaños residence at around 5:00 p.m. to resume their surveillance. Two hours later, Lisboa alerted the group after allegedly spotting Herrera entering the Castaños residence.<br><br>Later, the group saw a man and a woman who happened to be Cochise and Beebom leave the Castaños residence in a green box type Lancer car. The group followed the Lancer car with Lising, Dizon and Manga riding in a black car and Lisboa and Garcia in a motorcycle.<br><br>The Lancer car went to Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House on Timog Circle, Quezon City where the couple intended to have dinner. Alighting from the car, they were accosted by Dizon and Manga who were both carrying firearms. Amidst protestations, Dizon poked his gun at Cochise, handcuffed him, and shoved him into the car. Beebom protested loudly at the arrest and was also shoved into the back of the car.<br><br>The young couple’s failure to go home that night and the next day alarmed their parents, so a search was then initiated by close friends and relatives - inquiring from hospitals, restaurants, friends’ houses and possible places where the couple would go.<br><br>One group chanced upon Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House where they were told that a couple who fitted their descriptions were taken by three (3) men believed to be from the military in the evening of April 25, 1990.<br><br>The abduction of Cochise and Beebom hit the front pages. Appeals by the parents to locate them reached the authorities where all possible angles of their disappearance were explored but there were no significant leads. After about two (2) months of futile search for their whereabouts, a break came on June 21, 1990 when two (2) security guards working in a Shellane Warehouse in San Fernando, Pampanga went to see Ms. Rosie Bernabe at her Pasay City Hall office and had information concerning her son, Cochise. Mrs. Bernabe referred the two guards to the CAPCOM who interviewed them.<br><br>The two guards told the CAPCOM that their friends Raul Morales and Jun Medrano, both employees of Roberto Lising, informed them that Lising killed a mestisuhin man and a woman in their warehouse.<br><br>On June 23, 1990, Raul Morales was picked up and told his story. In a sworn statement executed on even date, he stated that he was a pahinante residing in the warehouse where LPG cylinders are stored, located near Valle Verde Drive-In Lodge in San Fernando, Pampanga, owned by Ligaya Fausto, common-law wife of Roberto Lising alias “Rambo.” In the main, he said:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">21. </td> <td valign="top" width="10%">T: - </td> <td width="80%"> <div align="justify">Sa ikaliliwanag ng pagsisiyasat na ito, maaari bang isalaysay mo ang sinasabi mong hindi pangkaraniwang pangyayari?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">S: - </td> <td><div align="justify">Nangyari yan alas 2:00 ng madaling araw ng 26 April 1990 natutulog ako, nang mayron kumatok sa pinto ng bodega at nagising ako. Tinawag ko si Aida Morales para buksan ang gate tapos sabi ni Aida “Ikaw na lang ang magbukas” pagkatapos kinuha ko yung susi sa kanya para buksan ang yong gate. Noong binubuksan ko yong gate sabi sa akin ni Roberto Llising “Bakit ang tagal mo” tapos pakabukas ko ng gate pumasok yong dalawang kotse una yung itim pagkatapos yung green na kotse na Lancer, tapos unang bumaba sa kotse na itim si Rambo, pangalawa si Felimon bumaba sa kotse na Lancer may dala na pala.

Noong dinala na ni Rambo, umiiyak na lang yong babae. Mga kalahating oras bago bumalik si Rambo sa bodega na hindi na kasama yong lalaki. Nakahubad siya at pinapawisan, bukod pa yan, naghugas pa ng kamay siya. Pagkatapos nag-usap-usap silang tatlo, si Rambo, si Felimon at yong kasama ni Rambo. Pagkatapos nagsabi si Rambo sa akin na buksan na ang gate at aalis na sila. Binuksan ko ang gate at nagsakayan sila sa kotse, si Rambo sa itim at saka yong babae, sa Lancer naman ang nakasakay yong kasama niya at si Felimon, at pagkatapos lumabas na sila, tuloy-tuloy na umalis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>On June 25, 1990, the body of Cochise was exhumed. An autopsy was conducted where the finding was: Cause of Death: “Multiple Stab Wounds”<br><br>The next day, Beebom’s body, which was in an advanced decomposing stage was exhumed from a shallow grave, two (2) kilometers from where Cochise’s body was found.<br><br>After evading arrest the previous days, Roberto Lising was finally apprehended on June 30, 1990. In a Sworn Statement on the same day at Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, he implicated Felimon Garcia and Roberto Manalili. According to him, this is what happened:<br><blockquote>x x x at about 11:00 o’clock in the evening of April 25, 1990, he received a telephone call from FELIMON GARCIA informing that he and his companions were at Valle Verde Lodge at San Fernando, Pampanga and that they have a problem. He immediately went to that place and saw FELIMON GARCIA who introduced to him RUDY MANALILI who was then accompanied by six (6) other men; that he saw a yellow Mercedes Benz, a black Torana and a green Lancer; that on board the Lancer were a man and a woman who were blindfolded and were introduced to him by RUDY MANALILI as ROBERTO HERRERA and JOY MANALILI; that they proceeded to one of the rooms of the motel where MANALILI told him that the two persons should die because they killed his brother DELFIN MANALILI; that afterwards RUDY MANALILI paid the chit and they proceeded to the warehouse at Villa Victoria, San Fernando, Pampanga, owned by LIGAYA FAUSTO where he bound COCHISE and led him back of the warehouse; that MANALILI stabbed COCHISE and he acted only as a look-out; that FELIMON GARCIA and another person brought the blindfolded woman to Brgy. San Agustin where she was killed that before he, FILIMON GARCIA and RUDY MANALILI parted ways, MANALILI told him to take care of the Lancer, change its color and later he will get it and after that he was given P40,000.00 in check which he encashed at the UCPB Diliman Branch, Quezon City on April 26, 1990; that he gave P15,000.00 to FELIMON GARCIA and kept the rest; that he had the Lancer repainted and used it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Thereafter, the manhunt for Felimon Garcia and Rodolfo Manalili began. One by one, the men responsible for the killing of Cochise and Beebom fell into the hands of the authorities.<br><br>On January 4, 1991, Garcia surrendered and was brought to the NBI. He named Pat. Enrico Dizon as the companion of Lising when Cochise and Beebom were kidnapped and brought to Valle Verde Lodge. He refused to make a statement or give further information until Rodolfo Manalili was arrested.<br><br>On January 16, 1991, Enrico Dizon was turned over by his superiors to the NBI. He named a certain CIC Robin Manga as one of their companions and owner of the car they used when Cochise and Beebom were kidnapped. Thus, Manga was also picked up.<br><br>Meanwhile, Rodolfo Manalili, who was in Australia at that time was fetched by then NBI Director Alfredo Lim and Atty. Diego Gutierrez after proper representations were made with the Australian police.<br><br>On January 17, 1991 Felimon Garcia, with the assistance of his counsel, Atty. Redemberto Villanueva, executed a statement revealing that:<br><blockquote>x x x he met RODOLFO MANALILI sometime in April 1987 in his office at No. 71 Mapang-akit Street corner V. Luna, Quezon City while soliciting contribution for Barangay fiesta of San Isidro, Minalin. The relationship continued until he was requested by MANALILI to look for persons who could help in arresting ROBERTO HERRERA, the suspect in the killing of his brother DELFIN MANALILI. He contacted ROBERTO LISING alias RAMBO, a policemen assigned with Pampanga PC Intelligence Unit, thru LIGAYA FAUSTO, his relative and live-in partner of LISING, to help in the arrest of HERRERA, and on April 21, 1990, while in the residence of LISING, he placed a long-distance call to MANALILI to inform him that LISING is willing to help. They talked over the phone and agreed to meet the following day in Dao.<br><br>He met MANALILI at the Dao-Mabalacat exit and accompanied the latter to LISING, ENRICO DIZON AND ANOTHER MAN ARMED WITH SERVICE PISTOL (.45 CALIBER AND Armalite. MANALILI, during the meeting, said that VIC NABUA, his employee, will act as pointer of the persons to be arrested and LISING agreed and asked from MANALILI P50,000.00 for the job to which MANALILI agreed. Initially MANALILI gave P2,000.00 to LISING as expenses.<br><br>He together with LISING, ENRICO DIZON and the driver of a Tamaraw went to Quezon City on April 23 and 24, 1990, but VIC NABUA failed to spot HERRERA. On April 25, 1990, LISING and DIZON returned on board a black car, Colt Galant (sic) driven by ROBIN MANGA and NABUA finally told then that HERRERA was at a house near the Camelot. After a few minutes of surveillance NABUA approached them and told them to follow the car driven by a man with a woman companion. Said car proceeded to Timog Circle and parked in front of Dayrit Hamburger House, followed by the Colt Galant which they likewise followed on board a motor and handcuffed the man and the woman. Then LISING instructed him to contact MANALILI and VIC NABUA proceeded to Pampanga PC where they were instructed by the military on duty to proceed to Valle Verde Lodge, San Fernando, Pampanga. There they saw LISING and ERNESTO COCHISE BERNABE and BEEBOM CASTAÑOS. MANALILI identified them and instructed him and LISING to release COCHISE and BEEBOM and assured that whatever MANALILI promised to LISING WILL BE PAID. Lising AGREED. However, after MANALILI left, LISING told him to bring COCHISE and BEEBOM to a warehouse owned by LIGAYA FAUSTO where COCHISE was killed by LISING. Thereafter BEEBOM was forced by ENRICO DIZON and ROBIN MANGA top board the Galant car which left the warehouse towards Barangay San Agustin.<br><br>He and LISING were left in the warehouse and proceeded to the house of LIGAYA FAUSTO at MALIGAYA Village in San Fernando. At about 9:00 a.m. he and LISING went to the warehouse of MANALILI at Xavierville Subdivision, Quezon City and there a check for P40,000.00 was given to LISING who encashed it with Fareast Bank and went to Pampanga. He alighted at Sto. Domingo, Minalin, Pampanga after LISING gave him P500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Rodolfo Manalili, on the other hand, with the assistance of Atty. Rodolfo Jimenez manifested on January 18, 1991:<br><blockquote>that he met LISING through FELIMON GARCIA whom he requested to look for some police officers who could help in the arrest of ROBERTO HERRERA, the accused in the killing of his brother DELFIN MANALILI.<br><br>He met LISING together with a certain Pat ENRICO DIZON of the Guagua police and another police officer in Dau, Pampanga on April 22, 1990, and gave them a sketch of HERRERA. On April 24, 1990, he told GARCIA to postpone their plan against HERRERA due to his forthcoming travel to Germany on April 25. However, at about 10:00 p.m. of April 25, GARCIA came to his office at No. 71 Mapangakit, Diliman, Quezon City and informed that they have already arrested HERRERA with a lady companion and that he was instructed to go to Pampanga, which he did. He was accompanied in his car by GARCIA and VICTOR LISBOA.<br><br>They proceeded to Valle Verde Hotel in San Fernando, Pampanga, and brought him to Room 213 where he saw a man slumped on the floor with his eyes and mouth covered with tape. The lady companion sitting on the bed had her eyes also taped. He told LISING that the man is not HERRERA. He was forced to peek (sic) inside the room anew, and this time recognized the woman to be BEEBOM CASTAÑOS. He pleaded to LISING and companions to release them and would give them whatever amount he promised them.<br><br>After he was told that BEEBOM and COCHISE would be released he instructed GARCIA to stay behind and see to it that his instructions were complied with. Then, he returned with VICTOR LISBOA. The following day, at about 8:00 a.m., LISING and GARCIA came to his house and told him that the man and BEEBOM were already released and in turn gave them a Far East Bank check in the amount of P40,000.00.<br><br>On April 26, he left for Germany and returned on May 28, 1990. While still in Germany his wife and househelps have been receiving threatening telephone calls and on the first week of June he received a call from GARCIA who gave the telephone to LISING who asked for P60,000.00, otherwise he will kill him or implicate him in the crime.<br><br>On June 21, 1990 he left for Hong Kong then to Melbourne for fear of his life and that of his family.<br><br>He claimed that the police officers he saw in Valle Verde Hotel were Pampanga policeman and not Quezon City policeman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Consequently, two (2) Amended Informations were filed in court against Roberto “Rambo” Lising, Rodolfo Manalili, Felimon Garcia, Enrico Dizon, Robin Manga, and Ligaya Fausto.<br><blockquote>Criminal Case No. Q-90-15239<br>For Carnapping (Violation of Republic Act No. 6539)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>That on or about the 25thday of April 1990, in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, P/Pfc.

He was assigned at the Rotonda Wine Station, the establishment beside Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House along Timog Circle, Quezon City. His tour of duty on April 25, 1990 was from 12:00 noon to 12:00 midnight.<br><br>At about 7:00 to 7:30 in the evening, Olimpia was at his post in front of the Wine Station. There was a green box type Lancer car which parked in front of the Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House carrying a man and a woman. Then a black car with no license plate parked behind the green car and two men alighted from it carrying guns. They announced that they were policemen, one was carrying a .45 caliber firearm in his holster and other was carrying a long firearm. These men went towards the green box type Lancer and handcuffed its driver. He only heard the man being handcuffed retort “Bakit?” When asked about the female companion, he said that his attention was more focused on the handcuffing incident and just later noticed that the woman was already seated at the back of the car. He did not even see the other man driving the black car.<br><br>Olimpia further explained that the security guard of Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House, Anastacio dela Cruz, was not really able to witness the whole incident since he was busy buying a cigarette stick from a nearby vendor. Just when the latter was returning to his post, the cars were already backing up ready to leave.<br><br>He did not tell anyone about the incident nor bothered to report to the authorities since he was aware that the perpetrators were policemen. He came to know about the identities of the man and woman and their disappearance when two persons were making inquiries about them on April 27, 1990. The next time, another group of people asked him about what he witnessed until he was picked up by the NBI for further questioning about the whole incident.<br><br>Raul Morales was presented in court on April 17, 1991. He stated that since March 1988, he had been working for Ligaya Fausto and Roberto Lising as a pahinante or truck helper of Crown Gas Commercial, a dealer of LPG, located in Valle Victoria Village, San Fernando, Pampanga. He knew Roberto Lising to be a policeman and is known by the name “Rambo” Lising. He works as a policeman in the morning and when he returns home after work, helps in delivering gas. During his testimony, Morales was given a clean sheet of paper and pen where he was asked to make a sketch of his place of work.<br><br>At about 2:00 in the morning of April 26, 1990, he was awakened by a knock at the gate of the warehouse. When he opened the gate, two cars came in: a green box-type Lancer car driven by Lising, with Felimon Garcia seated in front, a man and a woman at the back seat of the car; and a black car with Dizon and Manga. After the two cars entered the premises, he saw Lising go behind their sleeping quarters and get a wire. Lising and Dizon then brought Cochise to an area in the middle of the warehouse while Manga led Beebom to another end. After alighting from the car, Felimon Garcia got a spade from the back compartment of the car and went out of the warehouse. Lising and Dizon then removed the handcuffs of Cochise, tied his hands with the wire and blindfolded him with a tape and torn cloth.<br><br>Morales further testified that it was Lising who closed the gate but left it ajar. In a little while, he noticed another man enter the gate and walked towards Beebom. He heard the woman plead: “Uncle, maawa po kayo sa amin,” while Manga was tying Beebom’s hands with the wire. Garcia, after going inside the warehouse, was handed a knife by Lising which he used to stab Cochise on the chest. Lising then retrieved his knife from Garcia and continued to stab Cochise. When Cochise was already dead, the four men, namely, Lising, Garcia, Dizon and Manga carried Cochise out of the warehouse. They were away for about half an hour and when they came back, the four men directly went to the well and washed their hands. The four walked towards Manalili and talked with each other. He could not hear the conversation but saw that they grouped themselves together.<br><br>Before leaving, Lising called on Morales and told him to close the gate and keep the shoes of Cochise. Lising boarded the green box-type Lancer car with Garcia and the woman. He noticed Rudy Manalili walk out of the gate.<br><br>On April 26, 1991, the court conducted an ocular inspection of the scene of the crime. Witness Morales pointed to the court how events transpired from where he was seated.<br><br>On the basis of the testimonies of the above witnesses, plus the confessions made in the extrajudicial statements executed by Roberto Lising, Felimon Garcia, and Rodolfo Manalili, the prosecution presented their version of the incident as quoted from the trial court’s decision, to wit:<br><ol type="1"><li>The conspiracy to abduct and subsequently kill Ernesto “Cochise” Bernabe II and Ana Lourdes “Beebom” Castaños was hatched sometime in March 1990 when accused Rodolfo Manalili secured the services of accused Felimon Garcia to look for men who would be willing to commit the dastardly deed for a fee. (Exhibits “HH” and “MM”).<br><br></li><li>Accused Garcia then set about on his task and contacted accused Roberto Lising and Enrico Dizon for the “job.” (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>At a meeting arranged by Garcia on 22 April 1990, accused Manalili talked with Lising and Dizon at Mabalacat, Pampanga about the details of the conspiracy.

(Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>Accused Lising and Dizon then recruited accused Robin Manga to help implement the orders of Manalili. (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>On 25 April 1990, at around 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon, accused Lising, Dizon, Garcia and Manga, on board Manga’s black car, went to the vicinity of the Camelot Hotel at Quezon City. They positioned themselves about 60 meters away from the Castaños residence and waited for the victims. (Exhibit “MM”)<br><br></li><li>At around 6:30 o’clock in the evening of the same day, Cochise and Beebom went out of the Castaños residence, boarded Cochise’s green colored 1985 Lancer car with plate No. PER 942. (Ibid.) This Lancer car is owned by, and registered under the name of Cochise’s father, Fiscal Ernesto Bernabe. (Exhibit “DD”)<br><br></li><li>Cochise and Beebom then proceeded toward Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House at Timog Avenue, Quezon City. (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>Accused Lising, Dizon, Garcia and Manga immediately boarded Manga’s black car and tailed the green Lancer. (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>Upon reaching Dayrit’s hamburger House, Cochise parked the green Lancer in front of the restaurant. (TSN, 7 May 1991, p.6)<br><br></li><li>Immediately thereafter, Manga’s black car was parked immediately behind. (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>Accused Dizon, armed with a .45 caliber pistol, and accused Manga, carrying a long firearm, alighted from the black car, proceeded towards the green Lancer and announced that they are policemen.

(Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>Accused Dizon and Manga then boarded the front of the green Lancer, backed the car out of the parking area of Dayrit’s Ham &amp; Burger House and drove away towards EDSA. (Id.at 11)<br><br></li><li>Accused Lising and Garcia, on board Manga’s black car, immediately followed. (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>After the forcible abduction of Cochise and Beebom, Garcia informed Manalili of the success of the operation. Garcia further told Manalili to go to a designated place in San Fernando, Pampanga, where Cochise and Beebom will be taken. (Exhibit “MM”)<br><br></li><li>Manalili then proceeded to San Fernando, Pampanga on board his gray Mercedes Benz. (Ibid.)<br><br></li><li>At around 2:00 o’clock in the morning of 26 April 1990, accused Lising, Dizon, Garcia and Manga brought Cochise and Beebom to a bodega in San Fernando, Pampanga owned by accused Ligaya Fausto.

Garcia walked towards the back of the bodega and there, dug a shallow grave.

It was determined during an autopsy that Cochise died to multiple stab wounds in his chest and upper stomach.

Cochise had just finished his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of the Philippines and was then reviewing for his bar examinations when he was abducted on 25 April 1990. Beebom, on the other hand, was a graduating Mass Communication student of the University of the Philippines when she was abducted on 25 April 1990. Both Cochise and Beebom excelled in academic and extra-curricular activities, their written works having been published in periodicals and other publications.

(b) the credibility of prosecution witnesses Froilan Olimpia and Raul Morales and the (c) finding of conspiracy among the appellants.<br><br>Extrajudicial statements are as a rule, admissible as against their respective declarants, pursuant to the rule that the act, declaration or omission of a party as to a relevant fact may be given in evidence against him. This is based upon the presumption that no man would declare anything against himself, unless such declarations were true. A man’s act, conduct and declarations wherever made, provided they be voluntary, are admissible against him, for the reason that it is fair to presume that they correspond with the truth and it is his fault if they are not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>There is no question that their respective extrajudicial statement of Manalili and Garcia were executed voluntarily. They were assisted by their counsel and properly sworn to before a duly authorized officer. They merely relied on their extra-judicial statements and did not take the witness stand during the trial.<br><br>Lising, on the other hand, claims that he was coerced and tortured into executing the extrajudicial statement but nothing appears on record that such extrajudicial statement was made under compulsion, duress or violence on his person. Lising did not present himself for physical examination, nor did he file administrative charges against his alleged tormentors which would necessarily buttress the claim of torture in the absence of such evidence. There are in fact indicia of voluntariness in the execution of his extra-judicial statements, to wit: (a) it contains many details and facts which the investigating officer could not have known and could have supplied, without the knowledge and information given by Lising himself; (b) it bears corrections duly initialed by him; (c) it tends to explain or justify his conduct and shift the blame to his co-accused Manalili. Moreover, the claim that Lising was not assisted by counsel is belied by the fact that the signature of his counsel Atty. Yabut appears in all the pages of his extrajudicial statements.<br><br>The rule that an extrajudicial statement is evidence only against the person making it, also recognizes various exceptions. One such exception worth noting is the rule that where several extrajudicial statements had been made by several persons charged with an offense and there could have been no collusion with reference to said several confessions, the facts that the statements are in all material respects identical, is confirmatory of the confession of the co-defendants and is admissible against other persons implicated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They are also admissible as circumstantial evidence against the person implicated therein to show the probability of the latter’s actual participation in the commission of the crime and may likewise serve as corroborative evidence if it is clear from other facts and circumstances that other persons had participated in the perpetration of the crime charged and proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> These are known as “interlocking confessions.”<br><br>No doubt that the statements were independently executed and rather identical with each other in their material details. There are also distinct similarities in the narration of events leading to the killings of Cochise and Beebom.<br><br>Manalili and Garcia’s statements reveal that Manalili wanted to effect the arrest of Robert Herrera; that he asked help from Garcia if the latter knew of policemen who could do the job for the promised consideration of P50,000.00; that a downpayment of P2,000.00 was made; that Manalili was informed that Robert Herrera and Joy Ortega were arrested; that Manalili together with Garcia and Nabua proceeded to Valle Verde Motel; that they were met by Dizon and Manga at the motel and were told that Herrera was inside the room; that upon discovery that Lising’s group had taken the wrong person and recognized Beebom’s voice, Manalili pleaded to the group that the victim be released, assuring Lising that the balance P40,000.00 would still be paid; that Lising and his group refused but relented upon Manalili’s persistence; that Manalili left for Manila but instructed Garcia to stay behind and ensure the release of the victims; and that the next day Lising went to his office and claimed the balance to which Manalili issued the corresponding check.<br><br>Garcia added that after Manalili had left, Lising told him to bring Cochise and Beebom to the warehouse owned by Ligaya where Cochise was killed. Thereafter, they forcibly took Beebom into the car and proceeded to Brgy. San Agustin.<br><br>Likewise, we find Lising’s statement as corroborative evidence against the others. Except as to that portion where he exculpates himself from any liability stating that it was Manalili and Garcia who actually stabbed Cochise in the warehouse and that he was merely a lookout, Lising’s statement is identical as to the other material facts, namely, that Cochise and Beebom were brought to the Valle Verde Motel, blindfolded where he met Manalili and Garcia; that they were brought to the warehouse on board a green box type Lancer car, where Cochise was killed; that Beebom was brought to Brgy. San Agustin where she was eventually killed; that he should take care of the green box type Lancer car and was given P40,000.00 in check.<br><br>Nonetheless, the trial court’s decision, in convicting all the accused was based not on the aforesaid extrajudicial statements of the accused alone but mainly on the eyewitness account of the two witnesses, Froilan Olimpia and Raul Morales, which the trial court gave weight and credence as bearing the “chime of truth and honesty.” Well-established is the rule that the trial court’s evaluation of the credit-worthiness of the testimony given before it by witnesses should be accorded great respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Froilan Olimpia, a security guard of the Rotonda Wine Station, an establishment adjacent to the Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House who witnessed the abduction of Cochise and Beebom in front of the said restaurant.<br><br>He testified that he saw three men in a black car without a license plate drive to Dayrit’s Ham and Burger House and park behind the green Lancer car. When the two men alighted from the car, they introduced themselves as policemen to the by-standers, one carrying a .45 caliber firearm in his holster and the other carrying a long firearm. The two men approached the green Lancer car and handcuffed its driver. Olimpia only heard the man say: “Bakit?” He later noticed that the woman was already seated at the back of the car. These two men drove the green Lancer car which was followed by the black car. When asked to identify the three men, Olimpia unhesitatingly identified Dizon and Manga.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q. </td> <td

trial court beyond reasonable doubt, as being consistent and credible, sufficient to convict all the accused for the crime of murder. He testified positively, that on that fateful morning, two cars entered the warehouse after he opened the gate. Lising and Garcia alighted from the green Lancer car and brought out from the backseat Cochise and Beebom. The other black car carried Dizon and Manga. Soon after, Manalili entered the gate which was left open by Lising, and stood beside Beebom. Cochise, whose hands were tied with a wire was brought to an area far from Beebom’s view. He was stabbed by Garcia, and then by Lising. After killing Cochise, the four men carried him out of the warehouse while Manalili stayed with Beebom.<br><br>The trial court was even more convinced about the witnesses’ credibility after conducting an ocular inspection of the scene of the crime.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

To them, he was a rehearsed witness, since he was taken from the NBI to the residence of Governor Remulla’s son, a good friend of Cochise, as sanctuary during the trial of this case.<br><br>Some of the inconsistencies pointed out are as follows: (1) in the sworn statement, Morales claimed that the black car driven by Lising entered the compound ahead followed by the green car driven by Garcia while he stated in his testimony in court that the green Lancer car was first to enter, driven by Lising with Garcia in the passenger seat followed by the black car with Manga and Dizon on board; (2) in his statement, Morales indicated that he did not see the actual killing of Cochise since the victim was brought out, while he testified in court that Garcia and Lising stabbed the victim inside the compound; (3) Morales made mention of a total of five persons, including the two victims, in the early morning of April 26, while in court, he identified the five accused seen with the two victims.<br><br>In has been held that inconsistencies and discrepancies in the testimony referring to minor details and not upon the basic aspect of the crime do not impair the witness’ credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> These inconsistencies even tend to strengthen, rather than weaken, the credibility of witnesses as they negate any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The defense finds it also improbable for Morales to have witnessed the events at such a vantage point from the steps of the hut, since the perpetrators of a crime would not unnecessarily expose themselves in the committing the act to prevent possible identification.<br><br>Obviously, it never occurred to Lising at the time that Morale, who was under his control and who was afraid of him, would ever testify against him.<br><br>Manalili makes capital of the fact that Morales did not mention him at all in his prior sworn statement as being present at the scene of the crime. For Manalili, the omission of his name was a significant development as it appeared improbable that a vital witness will miss out an alleged perpetrator if indeed he was present at the scene of the crime.<br><br>Raul Morales himself admitted later on that there were omissions in his sworn statement made before the CAPCOM because he was afraid of his employer Lising and his companions. Understandably, he was reluctant to volunteer all the information about the killing for fear that he would suffer the same fate of Cochise and Beebom. The initial reluctance of witness to volunteer information about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in the criminal investigation is of common knowledge and has been judicially declared as insufficient to affect credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Besides, at that time, Raul Morales was merely concerned with bringing out his story without really paying particular attention to the details. He related that his employer Lising and companions brought a man and a woman to their warehouse and killed them both. He saw Cochise’s face on the papers and recognized him to be the man whom Lising’ s group killed. Morales only mentioned Lising and Garcia’s names in his sworn statement because they were the only ones known to him. Such omission and discrepancies should not be taken against him. It bears emphasis that a sworn statement or an affidavit does not purport to be a complete compendium of the details of the event narrated by the affiant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It is a matter of judicial experience that a sworn statement being taken ex parte is almost always incomplete and often and often inaccurate. Thus, discrepancies between the statements of the affiant in his sworn statement and those made on the witness stand do not necessarily discredit him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> There is no rule of evidence to the effect that omission of certain particulars in an affidavit or sworn statement would estop an affiant in making an elaboration thereof during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Whenever there is an inconsistency between the affidavit and testimony of the witness, the latter commands greater weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Roberto Lising discredits Raul Morales as having a motive in implicating him to the crime since “he quelled a rally staged by Morales who was the most arrogant and stubborn of Fausto’s employees, seeking an increase in pay.” As pahinante in their LPG business, Morales, according to Lising, was oftentimes reprimanded for not doing his job well and held responsible for lost gas tanks.<br><br>The motive imputed to Morales, a mere pahinante, if he were arrogant and stubborn, would be tolerated by Lising, the live-in partner of Fausto.<br><br>By and large, the defenses raised by the accused do not persuade us. When it comes to the issue of credibility of the witness, appellate courts give much weight and respect to the findings of the trial court since the trial court is in the better position to examine real evidence as well as observe the demeanor of the witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> With the eyewitnesses’ account of Froilan Olimpia and Raul Morales, the culpability of the accused for the crimes charged have been established.<br><br>This brings us to the third issue of whether or not there was conspiracy.<br><br>Conspiracy is a unity of purpose and intention in the commission of a crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Where two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it then conspiracy exists. While direct evidence is not necessary, conspiracy may be inferred from and proven by acts of the accused themselves when during and after said acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Undoubtedly, the trial court did not err in finding the existence of conspiracy in this case. With the interlocking confessions of Manalili, Garcia and Lising, the group came to an agreement to effect the arrest of Robert Herrera for a considerable sum of P50,000.00. The stake-out at the Castaños residence, the tailing of the car, the abduction at Dayrit’s Ham and Burger Restaurant and the detention in the Valle Verde Motel and the subsequent killing of the two victims all show that all the accused acted in unison and cooperated with each other towards the accomplishment of a common criminal design. Where conspiracy is established, the act of one is the act of all.<br><br>Garcia, for his part, prays that his liability be mitigated on grounds of lack of intent or motive, acts made under the compulsion of an irresistible force, and voluntary surrender, which if considered would make him merely an accomplice to the crime. Unfortunately, these defenses and unavailing.<br><br>To be exempt from criminal liability, a person invoking irresistible force or uncontrollable fear must show that the force exerted was such that it reduced him to a mere instrument who acted not only without will but against his will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> That compulsion must be of some character as to leave the accused no opportunity for self-defense in equal combat of for escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Garcia’s participation and presence from the time the abduction was hatched, up to the killing of the victims is undisputed. He was very well aware of Manalili’s plans. He was instrumental in introducing Lising to Manalili. Likewise, Lising’s intentions to silence both Cochise and Beebom at the end upon realizing an alleged mistake was known to him. He did not do anything to deter the commission or to report the crimes immediately thereafter. In fact, he stated that he and Lising saw each other after the incident but never mentioned anything about it, which only goes to show their intention of concealing the crime. Only after several months of being hunted, did he send feelers for this surrender.<br><br>Where conspiracy is established, the precise modality or extent of participation of each individual conspirator becomes secondary since the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The degree of actual participation in the commission of crime is immaterial. In People v. Degoma, the Court explained:<br><blockquote>x x x. One who joins a criminal conspiracy in effect adopts as his own the criminal designs of his co-conspirators; he merges his will into the common felonious intent. <i>A person who embraces a criminal conspiracy is properly held to have casts his lot with his fellow conspirators and to have taken his chances that things may go awry and that the offended party may resists or third persons may get killed in the course of implementing the basic criminal design. </i>To free himself from such criminal liability, the law requires <i>some overt act on the part of the conspirator, to seek to prevent commission of the second or related felony or to abandon or dissociate himself from the conspiracy to commit the initial felony.</i> (People v. Salvador, 163 SCRA 574, 580-582 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1988]</span>; People v. Bazar, 162 SCRA 609, 617 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1988]</span>; People v.

Pelagio, 20 SCRA 153, 159-160 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1967]” </span>(Italics supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>For the same reasons. Manalili can not likewise be exonerated from the crime. We have examined carefully the arguments of the Solicitor General in urging Manalili’s acquittal, but the facts and circumstances surrounding the case do not support his stand.<br><br>We find it difficult to accept Manalili’s contention that he had contracted the services of policemen to effect the “legal arrest” of Robert Herrera, the main suspect in the killing of his brother, Delfin Manalili. Equally preposterous is his assertion that upon arriving at the Valle Verde Hotel in San Fernando, Pampanga, he realized there was a mistake in the identities of the persons arrested, so he insisted that they be released. Neither is there factual basis to his claim that he had every reason to protect the life of Beebom, in particular, since the latter is a principal witness against Robert Herrera, the suspect in the shooting of his brother.<br><br>In the first place, why did he take it upon himself to employ persons unknown to him to effect the “arrest” of Herrera? The warrant of arrest of Herrera, if one was really issued, was never presented in evidence. In the second place, the surreptitious meeting of Manalili with Lising arranged by Garcia, the surveillance or stake out of the Castaños’ residence, the manner of abduction where the victims were blindfolded, handcuffed and gagged at Valle Verde Motel, cannot certainly be considered as acts in the regular performance of their duties as policemen. Thirdly, if it was true that Manalili just wanted the arrest of Robert Herrera, why did he have to seek the assistance of Pampanga policemen? It would have been more logical and expedient to have utilized the NBI or Quezon City Police especially when the alleged warrant of arrest was issued by a Quezon City court. After all, is was not difficult to locate Robert Herrera as he was reportedly frequenting the Castaños residence in Quezon City. Fourthly, it does not stand to reason why the victims were taken to Pampanga after allegedly being arrested in Quezon City. It would have been more cogent for the appellants to have delivered the victims to the nearest station of the Quezon City Police Department considering that the warrant of arrest was allegedly issued by a Quezon city court. If arrest was really in the minds of the accused, why did they hole-up with the victims in a motel when they arrived in Pampanga? Finally, if they were bent on legally arresting one Roberto Herrera, it was not necessary for them to also take the woman companion of the person they mistook as Herrera.<br><br>All these only shows that Manalili had premeditated in his mind a more sinister plot than merely effecting a “legal arrest.”<br><br>It is an unmitigated absurdity for Manalili to pretend that upon his realization of the mistake in their “arrest,” he insisted upon the release of the victims since he had every reason to keep Beebom alive. If he had just a bit of concern for Beebom’s safety, why did Manalili leave for Manila without bringing her and Cochise with him to make sure that no harm would befall them, knowingly full well of Lising’s resolve just revealed to him to silence both victims? What should be nearer the truth in that Beebom and Cochise became aware of Manalili’s presence at the motel together with the other accused and this was the added reason why the two had to be eliminated, to do away with having to explain why he was at the scene. His pretension that he wanted to keep Beebom from harm’s way because she was to have testified in the prosecution of his brother brings hollow. It cannot be assumed that had she lived she would have testified in court and pointed to Robert Herrera as the killer of Manalili’s brother.<br><br>In any case, assuming the remote possibility, the mistake in the identity of the victims does not exonerate Manalili pursuant to the rule that one who performs a criminal act should be held liable for the act and for all its consequences although the victim was not the person whom the fellow intended to injure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>We are reminded of the rule that the conviction must not rest on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence. In the instant case, apart from its interlocking sworn statements of appellants, Raul Morales’ positive testimony that he saw Manalili enter the bodega, and stand beside Beebom, while Cochise was being killed, convinces us with moral certainty that Manalili is equally guilty of the crime charged. His presence in the warehouse clearly belies his claim that from the motel, he left for Manila already. As against the positive testimony and identification, mere denials of the accused cannot prevail to overcome conviction by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The inaction of Manalili where he could have prevented the killings only reveal his complicity to the crime. Manalili is certainly part of a complete whole without whom there would be no Cochise-Beebom double murder case.<br><br>Furthermore, the decision of the trial court exonerating Manalili and Garcia for the crime of Kidnapping and finding the rest of the accused guilty for the crime of Slight Illegal Detention only does not escape us. There being conspiracy, all the accused should be equally guilty for the crimes as charged. Unfortunately, we can no longer convict Manalili and Garcia for Kidnapping in consonance with the constitutional right against double jeopardy. Nonetheless, they stand to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua for the double murder. The crime of Slight Illegal Detention should be qualified to Serious Illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code considering that a female victim was involved.<br><ol type="1">WHEREFORE, this Court hereby renders judgment as follows:<br><br><li>The decision of the lower court finding accused Rodolfo Manalili, Roberto “Rambo” Lising, Felimon Garcia, Robin Q.
