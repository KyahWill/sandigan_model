				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. OSCAR ESCALA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Wilma Escala, the complainant in the instant case, has accused her own father, herein appellant Oscar Escala, of the crime of rape. Wilma, only fourteen years of age at the time, is the eldest of two sisters and six brothers.<br><br>Wilma narrated that the family lived under the same roof in a barong-barong (shanty) located at the squatters area along Sampaguita Street, Tacloban City. The entire family slept in a 4 x 5-meter room sharing a single mat, one mosquito net and a blanket. She recalled being only twelve (12) years old and a Grade VI pupil when she underwent the first ordeal perpetrated on her virtue by her own father. That incident was followed at intervals of three to four times a week, usually taking place at night just before her father would go to bed. There were times when the rape would occur during daytime while her mother was not around. Each time that her father would force himself upon her, she would be threatened by him with either a knife or a nightstick.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Wilma suffered her great cross in silence until the first night she slept with her common-law husband, Enrique Batis, to whom she confided previous sexual encounters she was forced to undergo when Enrique discovered that she had by then already lost her virginity. She divulged to him the repeated assaults by her father on her honor. Enrique encouraged Wilma to have her father brought to justice. But what finally made her decide to file a case against her father was when she learned that her thirteen-year old sister, Alma, was also then being ravished by their father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It was, so to speak, to be the last straw.<br><br>Oscar Escala was indicated for rape in an information (amended) filed before the Regional Trial Court of Tacloban City, Branch 7, thus:<br><blockquote>“That on or about July 1994, in the City of Tacloban, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with WILMA ESCALA, his 14 year old daughter, against her consent.<br><br>“CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon his arraignment, the accused pleaded “not guilty” to the charge.<br><br>The defense interposed denial. Accused Oscar Escala stated that on 31 July 1994, the date, according to Wilma, that she was raped by her father and for which he was formerly indicted, he watched, together with Wilma and the other children, a television show in their neighbor’s house which lasted up to 10:30 in the evening. He denied having slept that night beside her daughter. The accused insisted that the charge against him was orchestrated by Wilma’s common-law husband, Enrique Batis, whom he had threatened to charge with the crime of kidnapping with rape. The rape charge against him, he asserted, was just a leverage to get him to forego his threats against Enrique.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The court a quo, Hon. Judge Pedro Espina presiding, rendered its judgment on 22 February 1995 following the trial. Evidently not convinced of the defense put up by the accused, the court pronounced him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged. The decision concluded:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, this Court without any reservation sentences the accused OSCAR ESCALA to the penalty of DEATH, without pronouncement on moral damages no claim having been presented on the matter. <br><br>“Let the accused be transferred to the National Penitentiary at Muntinlupa, Rizal.<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>The death penalty having been imposed on Oscar Escala, his conviction is now up for automatic review by the Court.<br><br>In his brief, accused-appellant came up with the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court a quo erred in giving evidentiary weight to the testimony of the complainant, which is highly incredible and unreliable, and in disregarding the evidence adduced by the accused-appellant.<br><br>“2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court a quo gravely erred in convicting accused-appellant Oscar Escala of the crime of rape despite failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>It does appear that the main issue raised by appellant is the credibility of Wilma Escala. Appellant claims that between the accusation made against him and his protestation of innocence, it is the latter, not the former, that deserves credence.<br><br>The Court realizes that, like in all rape cases, the testimony of the complainant must be examined with extreme care for, whether the case results in conviction or in acquittal, the final outcome would almost invariably be dependent on what the victim declares and on how she has stood and comported herself at the witness stand during questioning. While much is left to the trial court in making the proper assessment on the manner which a witness testifies, the declaration made at the trial, nevertheless, are preserved in transcripts of stenographic notes that in good measure can make meaningful and help render accurate the review process. The Court finds it necessary to go through the following account of the complainant’s testimony, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="19%"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></th><td width="81%"><div align="left">Do you remember having filed a complaint for Rape against Oscar Escala, your father?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, ma’am.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">“I am showing to you a complaint for Rape dated October 6, 1994, will you please identify whether this is the complaint you said you filed against your father? <br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">Yes, this is the one.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">Q&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">Over typewritten name Wilma Escala is a signature in the lower right hand portion of this complaint, will you please identify whose signature is this?<br></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></th><td><div align="left">This is my signature.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left">“FISCAL REYES:</div></th><td><div align="left"><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="left"></div></th><td><div align="left">For purpose of identification your Honor we request that this complaint be marked as Exh.

Although this matter was not raised by defense counsel, the authority is, ‘it is not necessary that there should be a medical examination of the victim in rape cases because the same is not an indispensable requisite of rape. (People vs. Diaz, 22 SCRA 147.)<br><br>“2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it was only the testimony of the daughter that whenever she was rape by her father she gave no consent, the fact that no physical evidence corroborates such offer of resistance, such absence of proof of violence or offer of resistance would not be significant because of the overpowering and overbearing moral influence of their father over his daughter, which takes the place of violence and offer of resistance required in rape cases committed by an accused having no blood relationship with the victim. (People vs. Matrimonio, 215 SCRA 613; People vs. Mabungan, 215 SCRA 694.)<br><br>“3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the denial of the father of raping his daughter, it is unbelievable that a daughter would falsely accuse her very own father of a very serious crime and herself undergo the ordeal and embarassment of a public trial simply to side with her common-law husband. There is yet no daughter with such a conscience who will permit herself to be the instrument of punishment on a false indictment against her own flesh and blood, and bring down her own family in shame and disrepute. This is extremely remote in a Filipino family.<br><br>“4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the amendment of the Information from ‘That on or about July 1994 x x x’ to ‘That on or about July 31, 1994 x x x’ which stated more specifically when the rape was committed in the month of July 1994 is not a substantial amendment as it does not alter the offense charged. (People vs. Borromeo, 123 SCRA 253.) And the precise date when complainant was sexually abused is not an essential element of the offense. (People vs. Ocampo, 206 SCRA 223). This Court is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that accused Oscar Escala raped his daughter Wilma on July 31, 1994.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Issues that touch on the credibility of witnesses are matters best addressed to the sound judgment of the trial court. Its assessments deserve to be received with respect, if not conclusiveness on appeal, absent a clear showing of arbitrariness on its part<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that certainly is not the case here.<br><br>Then too, there is no evidence whatsoever that Wilma has been induced by any improper motive in accusing her father of rape. Too often has it been rightly said that the testimony of a rape victim is particularly credible where she has no strong ulterior motive to testify against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In impugning the victim’s accusation of rape against him, appellant out that it is highly incredible for him to rape his daughter three to four times a week as so claimed by the latter considering the “environmental circumstances,” i.e., the two of them not being alone in the sala of the house with, in fact, no less than eight people – the complainant, her six brothers, her sister and her own mother – sleeping in the same room. The crime of rape, unfortunately for appellant, has been known to be possible for commission even when the rapist and the victim are not alone considering that, given the concomitant anxiety, the act can take only a short time to consummate. The Court has thus held that a conviction for rape could still be proper to despite the fact that it is alleged to have been perpetrated in the same room with the rapist’s spouse or where other family members also sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Somehow, copulation does not seem to be a problem even when living in cramp quarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Lust, it has been said before, is apparently no respecter of time and place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellant assails the delay in complainant’s disclosure of the sexual molestations against her. Procrastination by the victim in rape cases is not known, verily, the failure of the victim to immediately report the rape is never taken to be an indication of a fabricated charge. You girls usually do conceal for some time the fact of their ordeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> particularly when they are threatened against revealing the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Wilma has testified that everytime her father would molest her, he would point a knife against her and threaten her with death if she were to tell on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Moreover, in a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the former’s moral ascendancy and influence can well substitute for violence and intimidation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> enough to cow the victim into submission. It is absurd to think that a daughter, without resistance being somehow subdued, would simply give in to a beastly desire.<br><br>It was only after she had learned that her 13-year old sister Alma also underwent similar abuse by their father, that Wilma ultimately disclosed to the authorities the heinous crime committed by her father.<br><br>Finally, the defense contention that Wilma has indicted appellant merely to pre-empt him in the filing of a kidnapping with rape charge against her common-law husband is much too strained to be believed. No young woman would accuse her own father,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> or anybody else for that matter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of so grave a crime as rape unless she truly has been aggrieved.<br><br>The Court sees no other way than to agree with the trial court that appellant is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime with which he has been charged. This offense is defined and made punishable by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The law, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> reads:<br><br>“ART. 335. When and how rape is committed. – Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br>“1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using force or intimidation.<br><br>“2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>“3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><blockquote>“The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.<br><br>“Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of deadly weapon or by two or more persons , the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.<br><br>“When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>“When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.<br><br>“When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.<br></blockquote><br>“The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br><br>“2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.<br><br>“3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the rape is committed in full view of the husband parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.<br><br>“4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.<br><br>“5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.<br><br>“6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.<br><br>“7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When by reason or on the occasion of rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation.”<br><br>The crime of rape, having been committed by appellant against his own daughter of fourteen years of age, is covered by the above mandatory death penalty provision. The Court, at its deliberations, has sustained the trial court in the imposition of the death penalty on appellant Oscar Escala, a Member of the Court, however, has expressed otherwise, in these terms; viz:<br><blockquote>“During the deliberation of this case, I have been asked by my colleagues who constitute the overwhelming majority of this Court to refrain from voting against the imposition of the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> After all, they say, I have already expressed my 32-page Separate Opinion (copy attached) in People vs. Echegaray,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and a reiteration of my views and the repetitive casting of my negative vote are now unnecessary, redundant, and even improper. Therefore, they chorus, I should now, in obeisance to the majority’s will, cast a vote in favor of imposing the death penalty and thereby open the way to a unanimous vote.<br><br>“With all due respect and after much soul-searching, reflection and prayer, I regret that I still cannot accede. While I bow to the majority’s decision and will abide by it, I stand on my right, as a member of this Court, to cast my negative vote on every decision and action that seeks to impose the death penalty pursuant to a law which I firmly believe to be unconstitutional and therefore nonexistent. Every review of a criminal case by this Court, particularly one involving the capital penalty, is a review de novo, a meticulous review of the whole case -- of every fact, evidence, issue and argument possible -- whether raised by the parties or not. This is basic and historically axiomatic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In every such review, I plainly see the constitutionality of RA 7659, insofar as it prescribes death as a glaringly indispensable issue to which I cannot close my eyes. My duty to this Court, to this country, to my conscience and to my God requires me to speak out courageously and resolutely.<br><br>“That the overwhelmingly majority of the present members of this Court believes otherwise does not distract me or discourage me from casting my vote as my conscience and my duty impel me. To agree with this law is their privilege. I leave that to their individual consciences and perceptions of duty. But as for me, I fervently believe that this law is totally abhorrent to our fundamental law and to my fundamental faith, and I will steadfastly vote in accordance with such belief every time a case involving the said law is brought before me.<br><br>"Today, I may belong to the small minority which believes in the total nullity of the death penalty law. That does not faze me. Neither does it necessarily prove me wrong. Nor the majority, right. It has been reported<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that there are now about 600 death cases (and increasing at the rate of 30 more monthly) decided by trial courts and awaiting automatic review by the Supreme Court. And even if only fifty percent of these cases are affirmed by this Court, my negative vote notwithstanding one convict may have to be put to death every working day in the near future. That would be massacre more gruesome that the AIDS epidemic and the Cambodian killing fields and more detestable than the very crimes which this execrable law purportedly seeks to prevent or vindicate. The Philippines and this court would have the dubious distinction of being the worst judicial killers in this world where ironically, the death penalty is being phased out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>"In life, there are certain basic principles and values I hold sacred and inviolable. And no power on earth, no law in this country or elsewhere, can deny me my faith in such principles and values, and in acting consistently with them. Some may think this is improvident or foolhardy. That is the risk I am willing to take to uphold my conviction. Hence, with all due respect, I will continue to vote against every death penalty imposed against any man or woman and to uphold my belief in the transcendent value of life and in the absolute nullity of this law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Although he and three other Members of the court maintain their adherence to the separate opinions expressed in People vs. Echegaray (G.R.
