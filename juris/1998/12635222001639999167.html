				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 8, 1993, a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 for rape was filed by Chelly Caliso against Rolando Banguis, Romel 
Francisco, Renny Jumalon, Allan Jumalon, Gilbert Arañas and Carlos 
Interone with the Regional Trial Court of Iligan City. The complaint was
 later amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> on June 8, 1994 impleading Jerry Alfante and Alfredo Flores. The amended complaint reads:
<blockquote>
  <p>“That on or about November 3, 1993, in the City of Iligan, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
said accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping
 each other, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there took
 turns in having carnal knowledge and sexual intercourse with Chelly S. 
Caliso against her will. </p>
  <p>“Contrary to and in violation of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On November 26, 1993, prior to the amendment, accused Rolando Banguis
 and Romel Francisco were arraigned and separately entered pleas of not 
guilty. Accused Allan Jumalon and Alfredo Flores were later arraigned on
 August 18, 1994; both likewise entered pleas of not guilty. The other 
accused remained at-large.
</p><p>Thereafter, trial ensued.
</p><p>To buttress her complaint, Chelly Caliso, then only thirteen (13)
 years of age, testified that at about six o’clock in the evening of 
November 3, 1993, she went to fetch water at the public faucet located 
at the back of the church in Purok 2, Maria Cristina, Iligan City. As 
she was loading water into her container, accused Rolando Banguis 
approached Chelly and introduced himself. He asked Chelly’s name which 
the latter gave. After the introductions, Rolando signaled his friends 
to join them. Accused Romel Francisco approached her and, in turn, 
summoned the rest of his companions, namely, the other accused Renny 
Jumalon, Allan Jumalon, Gilbert Arañas, and Carlos Interone, who emerged
 from the church. Thereafter, Rolando told the group that he will go 
ahead to the copra drier. After Rolando left, Romel went to Chelly, drew
 a knife and pointed it at Chelly’s neck, threatening her, “Do not 
shout, if you will not go with me, I will kill you.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 Chelly was then brought to the copra drier which was about 100 meters 
from the public faucet. On their way, they met Jerry Alfante and Alfredo
 Flores. When they arrived at the copra drier, Carlos asked, and Romel 
gave him, the knife. Romel went outside the copra drier. Thereafter, 
Carlos ordered Chelly to lie down on a bamboo bed placed against the 
wall. Chelly refused but Carlos pushed her down, pointed the knife at 
her neck and threatened to kill her. Then, Rolando undressed himself, 
forcibly took off Chelly’s pants, went on top of her and inserted his 
organ into her vagina. After satisfying his lust, Rolando punched 
Chelly's chest three times rendering Chelly unconscious. When she 
regained consciousness, Chelly found herself still lying on the bamboo 
bed. Jerry Alfante and Alfredo Flores told her to dress up and run away 
because their companions will surely kill her. Despite the pain, Chelly 
did what she was told and fled the copra drier. Rolando and his 
companions, who stood about ten meters away from the copra drier, chased
 her. Chelly managed to outdistance her pursuers and sought refuge at 
her Ate Emma Cainila’s house. Rolando and the others gave up the chase. 
Chelly narrated to Emma her harrowing experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>On November 5, 1993, Chelly and her cousin Emma went to the Iligan Police Station to report the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 Thereafter, they proceeded to the Gregorio Lluch Memorial Hospital 
where she was physically examined by Dr. Imelda Garcia. The examination 
showed that the vaginal canal admits two (2) fingers with slight 
tenderness and slight pain. The two hymenal lacerations were noted at 
5:00 o’clock and 9:00 o’clock positions. There was also a linear 
abrasion, approximately 2 x 2 cm. at Chelly’s right knee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>All the accused denied having committed the crime. Their only defense is alibi, <em>i.e.</em>, when Chelly Caliso was allegedly brought to the copra drier, none of them was at the public faucet, but in different places. 
</p><p>Accused Rolando Banguis claimed that he was at the Iligan-Balo-i 
terminal in Iligan City. The jeepney, where he was the conductor, after 
it was loaded with passengers, proceeded to Balo-i and they arrived 
thereat at around 7:30 in the evening. Thereafter, they loaded firewood 
and went to the jeepney owner's house to remit the day’s collection. 
Then the jeepney proceeded to Linamon where accused Rolando alighted at 
Maria Cristina at around 9:00 o’clock in the evening and proceeded to 
the house of Ambrocio Jumalon to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>For his part, accused Romel Francisco averred that he was in his 
house at Maria Cristina the whole day of November 3, 1993 taking care of
 his younger sisters and brother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><p>Accused Alan Jumalon, on the other hand, professed that he was 
working as a jeepney conductor from 5:00 o'clock in the morning till 
7:00 o’clock in the evening of November 3, 1993. Thereafter, he went to 
his brother's house at Purok 4, Maria Cristina where he stayed until 
8:30 in the evening. He then went home, slept and woke up at 4:30 the 
following morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>The accused’s testimonies were corroborated by Josephine Suan, 
Paulina Oliveros, Elena Tiu and Irenea Aranas, who all denied having 
seen Chelly Caliso at the public faucet and the accused at the copra 
drier.
</p><p>After trial, the court on June 22, 1995, rendered a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“WHEREFORE, finding Rolando Banguis and Romel Francisco guilty of 
the crime of rape beyond reasonable doubt, the Court hereby sentences 
them to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, with the accessory 
penalties of the law. They are further ordered to pay Chelly Caliso the 
amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages, jointly 
and solidarily. </p>
  <p>“On the other hand, accused Allan Jumalon and Alfredo Flores are 
hereby acquitted for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt 
beyond reasonable doubt. The City Warden or any person in custody of 
Jumalon and Flores are hereby ordered to release them immediately from 
receipt of this Decision unless held for any other case. </p>
  <p>“In the meanwhile, let an Alias Warrant of Arrest be issued against
 the other accused, namely: Renny Jumalon, Gilbert Arañas, Carlos 
Interone, and Jerry Alfante for their immediate apprehension. Pending 
their arrest, let the case as far as the other accused are concerned be 
archived. </p>
  <p>“SO ORDERED.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only accused Rolando Banguis interposed this appeal. He contends: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“(T)hat the trial court erred in convicting him of the crime of 
rape despite insufficiency of evidence to prove his guilt beyond 
reasonable doubt.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant simply dwells on the alleged inconsistencies in the 
testimonies of private complainant Chelly Caliso and her cousin Emma 
Cainila which allegedly “cast serious doubts as to its veracity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>Appellant makes capital of the fact that in the affidavit 
executed by Chelly at the Iligan City Police Station, she stated that it
 was Carlos Interone who pulled a knife and led her to the copra drier; 
while in her testimony in court she declared that it was Romel Francisco
 who pulled a knife and led her to the copra drier. Accused-appellant 
submits that the said inconsistency undisputably shows that no rape was 
ever committed.
</p><p>The contention is totally without merit.
</p><p>We have consistently ruled in a plethora of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 that discrepancies between the statement of the affiant in his 
affidavit and those made by him on the witness stand do not necessarily 
discredit him since ex-parte affidavits are generally incomplete. 
Affidavits are generally subordinate in importance to open court 
declarations because they are oftentimes not in such a state as to 
afford him a fair opportunity of narrating in full the incident which 
has transpired in his affidavit and those made by him. This is so 
because affidavits are frequently prepared by the administering officer 
and cast in the latter's language or the latter's understanding of what 
the affiant had said, while the affiant frequently simply signs the 
affidavit after the same has been read to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
</p><p>Moreover, the discrepancy in the affidavit and the testimony was sufficiently explained on the witness stand by Chelly:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q You stated in your direct examination that it was Rommel(sic) 
Francisco who went near your, pulled his knife and pointed at your neck 
and told you that he will kill you if you will not go with him? </p>
  <p>A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q But in the statement of yours made before Police Officer Edgardo 
Mandalunes of the Iligan City Police Station, you stated that it was 
Carlos Interone who pulled his hunting knife and ordered you to follow 
them silently to the copra drier and who threatened to kill you if you 
will not follow?
  </p>
  <p><strong>A My answer was interchanged. It was Rommel(sic) Francisco 
who pointed the knife at me when we were at the faucet but in the copra 
drier it was Carlos Interone who pointed the knife.”</strong> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accused-appellant likewise faults Emma Cainila's failure to 
immediately report the incident to the police arguing that she is not 
the concerned relative she was pictured to be and that she concocted the
 rape in order to get back at accused Allan Jumalon.
</p><p>We are not persuaded.
</p><p>Emma Cainila’s failure to report the incident at once does not 
destroy the prosecution’s case which is firmly built on Chelly’s 
credible and convincing testimony. As aptly observed by the Solicitor 
General, Emma is not the person sexually abused, thus, any character 
flaw that Emma may have exhibited cannot, in the least, diminish 
Chelly’s disclosure that she was raped by accused-appellant. 
Furthermore, Emma clarified that she did not report the crime earlier 
because Chelly was afraid to go out. She said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q You did not attempt to report the matter to the police on November 4, 1993, at day time? </p>
  <p>A No, Sir, because the child or Chelly was afraid to go out. She was afraid she would be killed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After going over the records of the case and testimonies of the 
witnesses, we find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court.
 For, the only issue here is credibility of the testimonies of the 
witnesses. The court a quo made the observation that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“(Chelly Caliso’s) testimony appears credible as it was given in a 
natural, spontaneous and straightforward manner. Her gesture and 
demeanor on the witness stand especially on the cross-examination 
through which she was exposed, further strengthened her credibility. x x
 x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the trial court branded the testimonies of the 
appellant and the defense witnesses as “incredible, fabricated, contrary
 to human experience and rehearsed.”
</p><p>This Court accords the highest respect for the findings of the 
trial court on the issue of credibility of witnesses because the trial 
court is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the 
witnesses testify and observed their demeanor and deportment while 
testifying, absent any showing that the trial court overlooked, 
misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and 
substance which would have affected the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>The prosecution has sufficiently established that Chelly Caliso 
was raped by accused-appellant. The defense did not adduce any proof to 
show any improper motive imputable to Chelly Caliso to falsely implicate
 accused-appellant in such a grave crime. Chelly Caliso was new in Maria
 Cristina, Iligan City. She arrived only seven days before the incident.
 She does not know the accused-appellant or his companions. Thus, there 
was no reason for her to falsely accuse the accused-appellant. 
</p><p>We have consistently held that where there is no evidence to show
 any dubious reason or improper motive why a prosecution witness should 
testify falsely against the accused or falsely implicate him in a 
heinous crime, the said testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 Moreover, no woman, especially one of tender age, such as Chelly 
Caliso, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of 
her private parts and expose herself to humiliation as a result of a 
public trial if she is not motivated solely by a desire to vindicate her
 honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>In contrast, the defense of alibi raised by the accused-appellant is not only weak but also unsubstantiated.
</p><p>Alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be resorted to by 
an accused not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but 
also because it is easily fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 For alibi to serve as basis for acquittal, it must be established with 
clear and convincing evidence. The requisites of time and place must be 
strictly met. The accused must convincingly demonstrate that it was 
physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at 
the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><p>Appellant failed to convince this Court that it was physically 
impossible for him to be at Maria Cristina, Iligan City on November 3, 
1993. Appellant on cross-examination, testified that it takes only 15 
minutes to travel from Balo-i terminal to Maria Cristina:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q Do you know what time was the last trip of the vehicle going to Balo-i that date when it left the terminal of Balo-i? </p>
  <p>A Six o’clock. </p>
  <p>Q Was it not five o’clock? </p>
  <p>Q And this jeepney that had the route, plying the route Baloi-Iligan vice versa, passed Maria Cristina?
  </p>
  <p>A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q<strong> As a matter of fact, Maria Cristina and Baloi Terminal, it would take the jeepney fifteen minutes to negotiate? </strong></p>
  <p>A <strong>Yes, sir</strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, it was possible for the accused-appellant to be at Maria Cristina at the time the crime was committed. 
</p><p>In addition, we have noted numerous flaws in the testimony of appellant. As correctly observed by the trial court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“x x x First, it is very unusual to wash the passenger jeepney when
 the same is parked at the terminal waiting for passengers. Second, he 
alighted and proceeded to the house of Ambrocio Jumalon, took his supper
 and slept there, despite the propinquity of their house which is only 
200 meters away. Third, his claim that he is related to the Jumalons was
 belied by no less than his co-accused, Allan Jumalon, when the latter 
said that Banguis is not even their friend, as he is a mere 
acquaintance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not even the testimonies of the defense witnesses saved the day for 
accused-appellant. Their testimonies were equally incredible, 
fabricated, contrary to human experience and rehearsed. Thus the trial 
court said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"First, Josephine Suan’s story given on December 21, 1994, is too 
dubious to inspire belief. To remember the names of the persons in the 
public faucet in the evening of November 3, 1993, is quite unbelievable.
 Added to this is her naming of all the persons who rendered overtime 
works in all the copra driers. In fact, when she was asked of the 
distances as well as the number of houses in their locality, she replied
 immediately after the question is propounded which made the Court to 
comment that she is a very intelligent witness with a photographic 
memory. To the mind of the Court, however, this particular witness is 
rehearsed. </p>
  <p>“On the part of Elena Tiu, her version is also highly preposterous.
 To visit her pig every 10:00 o’clock in the evening for more than ten 
(10) years is quite a story. Even a grade school pupil would not buy the
 idea. On top of this, she completely contradicted the story of Suan 
when she stated that nobody was working overtime at the copra drier on 
that evening of November 3, 1993. </p>
  <p align="center">xxx xxx xxx 
  </p>
  <p>“With respect to witness Irenea Arañas, the Court viewed this with 
no probative value. Assuming that she fetched water on November 3, 1993,
 she did it at 5:30 o’clock (sic) in the afternoon and stayed there only
 for about two (2) minutes, while Chelly Caliso averred that she was at 
the faucet at 6:00 o’clock in the evening. What is doubtful is the claim
 that she fetched water at the upper faucet near the road because there 
was no water in the lower faucet due to low pressure. Being the mother 
of one of the accused, her testimony is considered by the Court as bias 
and self-serving.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fine, there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that 
accused-appellant is guilty of the crime charged. However, since 
accused-appellant was only seventeen years old, as evidenced by his 
birth certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> at the 
time of the commission of the crime, the privileged mitigating 
circumstance of minority should be considered in the imposition of the 
appropriate penalty. 
</p><p>Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code provides that if the 
offender is over fifteen but under eighteen years of age, the penalty 
imposable is the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law, but 
always in the proper period. The penalty prescribed by law for rape 
"committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons is 
reclusion perpetua to death.” Considering the minority of 
accused-appellant, the proper penalty should be reclusion temporal, 
which is the next lower penalty prescribed. There being no other 
modifying circumstances, the same should be imposed in its medium 
period, the duration of which is from 14 years, 8 months and 20 days to 
17 years and 4 months. Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum
 of the penalty is <em>prision mayor</em>, the penalty next lower in degree to <em>reclusion temporal</em>,
 the duration of which is from 6 years and 1 day to 12 years. Therefore,
 the proper penalty should be 9 years, 4 months and 1 day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, modified as indicated above, the decision of the Regional Trial Court is hereby AFFIRMED. 
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
</p><p><em>Regalado (Chairman), Melo, Puno</em>, and <em>Mendoza, JJ.</em>, concur.
