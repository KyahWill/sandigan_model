for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court,
petitioners assail the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 23 March 1995 in
CA-G.R. SP No. 26269 which reversed and set aside the Order of the  Securities and Exchange Commission <i>en
banc</i>  dated 13 August 1991 in SEC-AC
No. 301. Similarly assailed in the Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 15
May 1995, denying, for lack of merit, petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Respondent Wack
Wack golf and Country Club ins a non-profit corporation which offers sports,
recreational and social activities to its members. Petitioner  Antonio Litonjua is an Associate Member of
said corporation and his son,  co-petitioner Arnolds Litonjua, is a Junior Member thereof. The
individual respondents are the menbers of the Board of Directors  and Membership Committee of Wack Wack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
misunderstanding between the petitioners and respondent corporation stemmed
from the following facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 10 January 1985,
pursuant to its by-laws, respondent club posted the monthly list of delinquent
members on its premises. Included therein was petitioner Antonio Litonjua.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 13 January
1985, after Antonio Litonjua discovered that his name was on the January 1985
deliquent list, he proceeded to the Cashier’s Office of the  club and was informed therein that the
reason behind his deliquency was his failure to pay his November 1984 dues
(which should have been paid before the end of December 1984 as provided in the
corporate by-laws). Antonio Litonjua  alleged that he was not able  to
pay his  monthly bill on time because he
has not received his statement of account for November 1984. As proof, he
presented a sealed enveloped which he allegedly presumed to be the November
1984 bill (but was actually the December 1984 statement of account) and
explained that he received it only on 12 January 1985.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">A check with the
accounting office , however, revealed that the November 1984 statement of
account had already been delivered to Antonio Litonjua’s office and was
received by his employees allegedly named “Aquino.” Petitioner  asserted that he did not receive said
account and had no employee by the name of “Aquino.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Based on the
foregoing, Antonio Litonjua was able to convince the auxiliary clerks in the
Cashier's  Office to delete his name
from the list of delinquent members.  Consequently, Antonio Litonjua continued to avail of the club
facilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 10 February
1985, as Anttonio Litonjua was about to tee off at the club’s golf course, he
was informed by Mr. Ador Rallos, an employee of Wack Wack, that his name was
included in the February 1985 deliquent list. Thereupon, he paid his account by
presenting Mr. Rallos a blank check and requesting the latter to fill  in the amount of his outstanding balance
which came up to P4,784.30.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On 13 February
1985, Antonio Litonjua was advised of another outstanding balance in the amount
of P9,414.00. Again, he issued a check in payment thereof. As a result, his
name was deleted from the February 1985 list of deliquent members.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">However, on the
same day Antonio Litonjua received a letter dated 9 February 1985 from the
General Manager of Wack Wack, Atty. Vicente F. Felix, informing him of the
Membership Committee’s  decision to
suspend him for a period of sixty (60) days, effective 3 February 1985. He
allegedly  violated  Sec. 34(d) of the club’s by-laws when he
availed of club privileges while listed as a  deliquent  member. The contents
of the suspension letter is hereunder reproduced:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was too rigid and blindly technical, That the auxiliary clerks in the Cashier’s
office of Wack Wack actually crossed out Antonio Litonjua’s name from the
delinquent list is not dispute. However, the SEC should have considered and
delved deeper into the reasons and the circumstances behind the deletion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">As correctly
determined by the Court of Appeal, it was through misrepresentation that
Antonio Litonjua was able to have his name deleted from the list of delinquent
members. He insisted that he did not receive his statement of account for
November 1984 on 12 December 1984. As previously discussed, however, this claim
turned out to be unsubstantiated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Another
indication of Anotnio Litonjua’s duplicity is the sealed envelope he presented
at the Cashier’s office on the 13 January 1985, the same  day he found out he was on the January 1985
and, therefore, since the bill was delivered late he should not be included in
the posted list of deliquent members. With this explanation coupled with sealed
envelope Antonio Litonjua turned in, he managed to persuade the clerk to cross
out his name from the delinquent list. Later, however, when he sealed envelope
was opened, it was discovered that it contained not the statement of account
for November 1984 but  the bill for
December 1984. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We view with
skepticism Antonio Litonjua’s claim that he was unaware that the sealed
envelope  contained his December 1984
bill and he simply presumed it to contain his account for November 1984. It
must be recalled that at the accounting office of Wack Wack, he was informed
that his November 1984 bill was delivered to his office in Mandaluyong. If he
thought that the sealed envelope contained his November 1984 bill, he could
have simply opened said envelope at the presence of the auxiliary clerk to

not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hence, since it
was under false pretenses that Antonio Litonjua managed to have his name
deleted from the list of delinquent members the same has no force and effect.
Consequently, being a delinquent member in the posted list and having used club
facilities while posted as such, the imposition of suspension by respondent on
Antonio Litonjua (and his son Arnold Litonjua) pursuant to Sec. 34 (d) of the
club by-laws, was valid and legal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discuss whether or not the auxiliary clerks have authority to delete Antonio
Litonjua’s name from the list of delinquent members. As testified to Mr. Jessie
Casiguran, one of the auxiliary clerks of Wack Wack, it is their standard
operating procedure that when a member  pays his overdue account in full, they delete the member’s name from the
delinquent list even without the prior authorization of the Membership
Committee and the Board of Directors which is the required procedure in
the  procedure in the club’s by-laws.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">5.1 The only restriction on the
right and privileges of a Junior Member is that contained in Section 6 (g) of
the Revised By-Laws, which states that: “... when parents cease to be members,
the junior membership of their children is likewise terminated.” No similar
provision exists with regard to suspension. It cannot be claimed that the
provision applies to suspension of the parent-members because the reasonable
interpretation of any ambiguity should always be for the least restriction of
right. Clearly, petitioner Arnold Litonjua was unlawfully and arbitrarily
suspended.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On this
particular matter, the SEC <i>en banc</i> in its 13 August 1991 Order, ruled as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">The third issue is whether or not
the suspension of an associate member automatically results in the suspension
of a junior member. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">This particular issue may be
resolved through an examination of the By-laws of Wack Wack Golf and Country
Club. Under the By-laws, a junior member is the son or daughter of a
proprietary member or an associate member in good standing whose age is between
10 to 22, single and elected as such by the Board. Moreover, junior membership
ceases upon the termination of membership of parents. It is clear that one of
the requisites for junior membership is that the parent’s membership is in good
standing. This requirement seems to be a condition imposed upon junior
membership such that when an associate or proprietary member suspended, the
junior membership attached thereto is likewise suspended because the parent
membership cannot be deemed in good standing. to subject the By-laws to another
interpretation would open the door to possible circumvention of the suspension
meted upon the proprietary or associate member.  If a junior member is allowed to avail of his club privileges
when either of his parents is suspended, then the latter may avail of club
privileges through the former thereby rendering the suspension nugatory.
Nevertheless, the fact that the suspension of Antonio Litonjua is hereby
declared illegal renders the suspension of Arnold Litonjua moot and academic.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

however that when parents cease to be members the Junior membership of their
children is likewise terminated. Junior members may play on the East or West
Course depending on the Board regulations. A Junior member shall not pay an
entrance fee but he shall pay monthly dues in advance as may be prescribed by
the Board of Directors, and his account shall be guaranteed in writing by his
parent or guardian. (As amended on July 29, 1984). (Exh. “K”, Original
