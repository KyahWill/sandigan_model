				<H3>ESTRELLITA J. TAMANO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. RODOLFO A. ORTIZ, PRESIDING JUDGE, RTC-BR. 89, QUEZON CITY, HAJA PUTRI ZORAYDA A. TAMANO, ADIB A. TAMANO AND THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This <em>Petition for Review on Certiorari</em> seeks to reverse 
and set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals of 30 September 1996 
in CA-G.R. SP. No. 39656 which affirmed the decision of the Regional 
Trial Court-Br. 89, Quezon City, denying the motion to dismiss as well 
as the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner Estrellita J. 
Tamano.      
  <p>On 31 May 1958 Senator Mamintal Abdul Jabar Tamano (Tamano) married
 private respondent Haja Putri Zorayda A. Tamano (Zorayda) in civil 
rites. Their marriage supposedly remained valid and subsisting until his
 death on 18 May 1994. Prior to his death, particularly on 2 June 1993, 
Tamano also married petitioner Estrellita J. Tamano (Estrellita) in 
civil rites in Malabang, Lanao del Sur.      </p>
  <p>On 23 November 1994 private respondent Zorayda joined by her son Adib A. Tamano (Adib) filed a <em>Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage</em>
 of Tamano and Estrellita on the ground that it was bigamous. They 
contended that Tamano and Estrellita misrepresented themselves as 
divorced and single, respectively, thus making the entries in the 
marriage contract false and fraudulent.      </p>
  <p>Private respondents alleged that Tamano never divorced Zorayda and that Estrellita was not <em>single</em>
 when she married Tamano as the decision annulling her previous marriage
 with Romeo C. Llave never became final and executory for non-compliance
 with publication requirements.      </p>
  <p>Estrellita filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the Regional 
Trial Court of Quezon City was without jurisdiction over the subject and
 nature of the action. She alleged that "only a party to the marriage" 
could file an action for <em>annulment of marriage</em> against the other spouse,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 hence, it was only Tamano who could file an action for annulment of 
their marriage. Petitioner likewise contended that since Tamano and 
Zorayda were both Muslims and married in Muslim rites the jurisdiction 
to hear and try the instant case was vested in the <em>shari’a</em> courts pursuant to Art. 155 of the <em>Code of Muslim Personal Laws</em>.      </p>
  <p>The lower court denied the motion to dismiss and ruled that the 
instant case was properly cognizable by the Regional Trial Court of 
Quezon City since Estrellita and Tamano were married in accordance with 
the Civil Code and not exclusively in accordance with PD No. 1083<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or the <em>Code of Muslim Personal laws</em>.
 The motion for reconsideration was likewise denied; hence, petitioner 
filed the instant petition with this Court seeking to set aside the 18 
July 1995 order of respondent presiding judge of the RTC-Br. 89, Quezon 
City, denying petitioner’s motion to dismiss and the 22 August 1995 
order denying reconsideration thereof.      </p>
  <p>In a Resolution dated 13 December 1995 we referred the case to the 
Court of Appeals for consolidation with G.R. No. 118371. Zorayda and 
Adib A. Tamano however filed a motion, which the Court of Appeals 
granted, to resolve the <em>Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage</em> ahead of the other consolidated cases.      </p>
  <p>The Court of Appeals ruled that the instant case would fall under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of shari’a courts only when filed in places 
where there are shari’a courts. But in places where there are no <em>shari’a</em> courts, like Quezon City, the instant case could properly be filed before the Regional Trial Court.      </p>
  <p>Petitioner is now before us reiterating her earlier argument that it is the <em>shari’a</em> court and not the Regional Trial Court which has jurisdiction over the subject and nature of the action.      </p>
  <p>Under <em>The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Regional Trial Courts have jurisdiction over all actions involving the contract of marriage and marital relations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Personal actions, such as the instant complaint for declaration of nullity of marriage, may be commenced and tried where the <em>plaintiff</em> or any of the principal <em>plaintiffs</em> resides, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants resides, at the election of the <em>plaintiff</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 There should be no question by now that what determines the nature of 
an action and correspondingly the court which has jurisdiction over it 
are the allegations made by the <em>plaintiff</em> in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 In the complaint for declaration of nullity of marriage filed by 
private respondents herein, it was alleged that Estrellita and Tamano 
were married in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code. Never 
was it mentioned that Estrellita and Tamano were married under Muslim 
laws or PD No. 1083. Interestingly, Estrellita never stated in her <em>Motion to Dismiss</em>
 that she and Tamano were married under Muslim laws. That she was in 
fact married to Tamano under Muslim laws was first mentioned only in her
 <em>Motion for Reconsideration</em>.      </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the Regional Trial Court was not divested of 
jurisdiction to hear and try the instant case despite the allegation in 
the <em>Motion for Reconsideration</em> that Estrellita and Tamano were 
likewise married in Muslim rites. This is because a court’s jurisdiction
 cannot be made to depend upon defenses set up in the answer, in a 
motion to dismiss, or in a motion for reconsideration, but only upon the
 allegations of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 Jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is determined from the 
allegations of the complaint as the latter comprises a concise statement
 of the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiff’s causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
  <p>Petitioner argues that the <em>shari’a</em> courts have jurisdiction over the instant suit pursuant to Art. 13, Title II, PD No. 1083,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which provides -        </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Art. 13. <em>Application</em>. - (1) The provisions of this Title
 shall apply to marriage and divorce wherein both parties are Muslims, 
or wherein only the male party is a Muslim and the marriage is 
solemnized in accordance with Muslim law or this Code in any part of the
 Philippines.        </p>
    <p>(2) In case of a marriage between a Muslim and a non-Muslim, 
solemnized not in accordance with Muslim law or this Code, the Civil 
Code of the Philippines shall apply.        </p>
    <p>(3) Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, the 
essential requisites and legal impediments to marriage, divorce, 
paternity and filiation, guardianship and custody of minors, support and
 maintenance, claims for customary dower (mahr), betrothal, breach of 
contract to marry, solemnization and registration of marriage and 
divorce, rights and obligations between husband and wife, parental 
authority, and the property relations between husband and wife shall be 
governed by this Code and other applicable Muslim laws.        </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As alleged in the complaint, petitioner and Tamano were married in 
accordance with the Civil Code. Hence, contrary to the position of 
petitioner, the Civil Code is applicable in the instant case. Assuming 
that indeed petitioner and Tamano were likewise married under Muslim 
laws, the same would still fall under the general original jurisdiction 
of the Regional Trial Courts.        </p>
  <p>Article 13 of PD No. 1083 does not provide for a situation where 
the parties were married both in civil and Muslim rites. Consequently, 
the <em>shari’a</em> courts are not vested with original and <u><em>exclusive</em></u> jurisdiction when it comes to marriages celebrated under <u><em>both</em></u>
 civil and Muslim laws. Consequently, the Regional Trial Courts are not 
divested of their general original jurisdiction under Sec. 19, par. (6) 
of BP Blg. 129 which provides -          </p>
  <p>Sec. 19. <em>Jurisdiction in Civil Cases</em>. - Regional Trial 
Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction: x x x (6) In all 
cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, 
person or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions x x x x  
          </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the instant petition is DENIED. The 
decision of the Court of Appeals sustaining the 18 July 1995 and 22 
August 1995 orders of the Regional Trial Court - Br. 89, Quezon City, 
denying the motion to dismiss and reconsideration thereof, is AFFIRMED. 
Let the records of this case be immediately remanded to the court of 
origin for further proceedings until terminated.              </p>
  <p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.                </p>
