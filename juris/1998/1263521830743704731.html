<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Petitioners and private
respondent Peregrino Lacorte are the heirs of Maria Inocencio Lacorte who was
the original owner of a parcel of land located at Sta. Cruz, Lezo, Aklan with
an area of 14,556 square meters, more or less.  The subject property was foreclosed by the Rural Bank of Malinao, Aklan,
Inc. which, after consolidating its ownership thereover, subsequently sold the
same to herein private respondent Jose Icaca.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On October 17,
1983, respondent Jose Icaca and petitioner Simon Lacorte, in behalf of the
heirs of Maria Lacorte, entered into an Agreement whereby the former was
authorized to purchase the subject property from the bank provided that the
heirs of Maria Lacorte shall be given the right to repurchase the same in the
amount of <s>P</s>33,090.00 within a period of one year from that date.  The one-year redemption period was later
extended to March, 1987 pursuant to another Agreement dated October 16,
1984.  Both agreements were signed by petitioner
Simon Lacorte for himself and in representation of the heirs of Maria
Lacorte.  On November 4, 1984,
respondent Peregrino Lacorte’s wife, Adela, paid to respondent Icaca the amount
of <s>P</s>26,000.00 as deposit for the repurchase of the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">It appears,
however, that without the knowledge and consent of herein petitioners, and
before the expiration of the grace period, private respondents Peregrino
Lacorte and his wife were able to purchase the land in their names by virtue of
a Deed of Reconveyance executed by respondent Icaca dated February 3, 1987.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">That prompted
herein petitioners to commence this action on December 9, 1988 for annulment of
the contract on the ground that the same was entered into in evident bad faith
and in violation of the previous agreements between the parties, thereby
resulting in prejudice to the property rights of herein petitioners.  In their Answer, respondents Peregrino and
Adela Lacorte denied that there was an agreement to sell the property
collectively to the heirs of Maria Lacorte, and argued that since the land was
legally sold by the bank to respondent Icaca, then the sale thereof by the
latter to the former is likewise valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Respondent Jose
Icaca filed a separate Answer wherein he alleged, <i>inter alia</i>, that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“2.  x  x  x  (W)hile it is true that he sold the property to the spouses Peregrino Lacorte
and Adela Lacorte, he did so (i)n the honest belief and understanding that the
spouses bought the same for  the
common good of all pursuant to the understanding/agreement he had with the said
spouses and the plaintiffs and that he will allow them to buy back the property
collectively from him  x  x  x.  (T)he said spouses assured
him that they were buying the property not for themselves alone but for the
benefit as well of the plaintiffs and this was also the understanding of the
herein answering defendant when he signed the Deed of Reconveyance  x  x  x.  (H)ad he known it otherwise and were it not for the assurance of
the spouses Peregrino and Adela Lacorte to the effect that the purchase of the
property is for the collective use of all of them  x  x  x  the herein defendant would not have sold the property to them  x  x  x.  (T)he undersigned hav(e) no objection to the rescission and/or
annulment of the Deed of Reconveyance  x  x  x  because in truth and in
fact his intention was really to reconvey the questioned property to the
plaintiffs and his co-defendants  x  x  x.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In a decision
dated November 29, 1991, the trial court ordered (a) the rescission of the deed
of reconveyance executed in favor of respondent spouses Peregrino and Adela
Lacorte, as well as the tax declarations issued in their names, and (b) Jose
Icaca to sell the land in question to all the petitioners herein and private
respondent spouses.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> In so
ruling, it declared that by reason of the aforesaid agreements, marked as
Exhibits B and C, respectively, executed between respondent Jose Icaca and
petitioner Simon Lacorte who acted in representation of the heirs of Maria
Lacorte, which actually constitute a promise to buy and sell, there was bad
faith on the part of respondent spouses in purchasing the land solely in their
favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">It also noted
that the deed of reconveyance was executed within the period granted under
Exhibits B and C for the heirs to collectively repurchase the land from
Icaca.  Moreover, it observed that if
respondent spouses were truly buying the land in good faith for themselves and
not for the other heirs, it was not necessary for respondent Adela Lacorte to
ask petitioners to look for <s>P</s>7,090.00 which represents the balance and
was apparently to be used as part of the purchase price.  Finally, it concluded that petitioners had a
cause of action against respondents by reason of the promise to buy and sell
executed between the Lacortes and Icaca, which is reciprocally demandable
pursuant to Article 1479 of the Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In reversing the
court <i>a quo</i> and ordering the dismissal of the complaint, respondent
Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners have no cause of action against private
respondents since the former were not parties either to the Deed of
Reconveyance sought to be annulled or to the Deed of Absolute Sale executed
between the bank and Jose Icaca.  It
applied the general rule under  Article
1397 of the Civil Code to the effect that an action for annulment of contract
may be instituted only by those who are  principally or subsidiarily obliged thereby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">While it
recognized the exception that one who is not principally or subsidiarily bound
may ask for annulment if his rights are prejudiced by one of the contracting
parties, respondent court nonetheless merely held that “prejudice on the part
of the plaintiffs has not been established.  If at all they are now asking for the annulment of the Deed of
Reconveyance, it is probably because they are supposedly heirs of Maria.  It has not been proven either to what extent
the Deed of Reconveyance should be nullified, even on the assumption that
plaintiffs’ rights have been prejudiced.”</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hence this
petition, wherein the primary issue posed for resolution is whether or not
herein petitioners are entitled to bring an action for annulment and/or
rescission of the Deed of Reconveyance entered into by respondent spouses
Peregrino and Adela Lacorte with Jose Icaca.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">On this score,
it becomes inevitable to initially determine the nature of the agreements
entered into by petitioners with Icaca which are the bases of petitioners’
claim to the property.  Because of its

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Further, prior
to the expiration of that Agreement of  October 17, 1983, another one was entered into between the same parties
extending the period of redemption up to and until  March, 1987.  Thus, in
the second Agreement dated October 16, 1984, it was stipulated that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial">“Although the period granted to the
heirs of Maria Lacorte to buy back the land from me is due to expire tomorrow
in accordance with the agreement dated October 17, 1983, I, Jose I. Icaca, do

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">That the
contract is an equitable mortgage is likewise evident from the words used in
the Agreement itself, that is, that the heirs of Maria Lacorte shall pay as
part of the purchase price the amount of “TWELVE THOUSAND NINETY (<s>P</s>12,090.00)
PESOS of their recent <i>mortgage debt</i>.”  Apparently, the parties decided to put in writing an earlier mortgage
made by Maria Lacorte in favor of Jose Icaca.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

existence of such mortgage even provides a logical explanation for the course of
action taken by Simon Lacorte in making special arrangements with Icaca so that
the latter could buy the foreclosed property from the bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">More
importantly, the document executed between Adela Lacorte and Jose Icaca is
entitled “Deed of Reconveyance” wherein the latter bound himself to “transfer,
deliver and reconvey” the parcel of land described therein.  The term “reconvey” means to convey back or
to former place; to transfer back to former owner, as an estate, and
“reconveyance” being a transfer of realty back to the original or former
grantor.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

contract of reconveyance, therefore, presupposes the existence of a prior
agreement wherein a party to whom property was conveyed undertakes to reconvey
the same to the other party under certain terms and conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Such agreements
may be in the nature of a contract of sale with a right of repurchase or an
equitable mortgage.  In fine, a contract
of reconveyance is but a necessary consequence of the exercise of a party’s
right to repurchase the property subject of a contract of sale with a right of
repurchase or of an equitable mortgage.  This particular attribute of the Deed of Reconveyance executed by
respondent Icaca gives further weight to our finding that the Agreement of
October 17, 1983 is indeed a contract of equitable mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Considering that
Simon Lacorte executed the Agreement with Jose Icaca for and in behalf of all
the heirs of Maria Lacorte, it stands to reason that any payment made by one or
some of the heirs will logically and definitely have to likewise inure to the
benefit of all the heirs.  This
notwithstanding, respondent spouses insist that they are the exclusive owners
of the subject property because they were the ones who paid for it and that it was
never intended that they will buy it for and in behalf of the other heirs.  They further deny any knowledge of and
participation in the Agreement dated October 17, 1983.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">The argument is,
unfortunately, specious.  The records
abound with facts and circumstances which reveal otherwise, as we shall
demonstrate <i>seriatim</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="font-family:Arial">1.  The  initial  payment  of  <s>P</s>26,000.00  was  made  on November 4, 1984,
immediately after the Agreement of  October 16, 1984 extending the redemption period was executed.  The balance of <s>P</s>7,090.00 was paid
only in February, 1987 when the Deed of Reconveyance was executed, which was
well within the extended period granted to herein petitioners.  If respondent spouses really knew nothing
about the previous agreements with Icaca, it is an incredible accident that the
dates of payment of the purchase price coincided quite closely with the periods
stipulated by the parties.  And, if ever
there was any other agreement entered into exclusively between respondent
spouses and Jose Icaca, the records are completely bereft thereof and
respondent spouses conveniently failed to give any explanation therefor.  Indeed, it is highly improbable that, <i>sine
stipulatio</i>, Icaca would still have accepted payment of the balance despite
the lapse of a long period of time, contrary to the ordinary and normal course
of things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="font-family:Arial">2.  Respondent  Adela  Lacorte  claimed  that  she  informed herein petitioners about the sum of <s>P</s>26,000.00 she had
paid to  Jose Icaca.  According to her, she did that on purpose
because she wanted petitioners to help her raise the amount necessary to pay
the balance of the purchase price.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> If what she alleges is
true, then it is perplexing why she would still ask for money from petitioners
and thereby involve them in the contract with Icaca although that was supposed to
be for respondent spouses exclusively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="font-family:Arial">3.  Adela  Lacorte  likewise  admitted that her mother-in-law and two of herein petitioners remain and
continue to be in possession of the property even after the sale thereof to
Icaca.  The only plausible and explicative
reason for this is that petitioners were merely enforcing the rights vested in
them under those aforementioned agreements with Icaca.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="font-family:Arial">4.  Also,  by  her  own  admission,  Adela Lacorte knew that petitioners were
very interested in redeeming the property from Icaca.  On the witness stand, she stated that when she met with Icaca to
negotiate for the repurchase of the property, she was accompanied by both her
husband and petitioner Rosario Lacorte.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> It will be recalled that
Rosario Lacorte is one of the petitioners who has been continuously occupying
the subject land from the time it was still owned by Maria Lacorte up to the
present.  Logically, it is Rosario
Lacorte who, among the heirs, is most interested in regaining ownership of the
property.  Thus,  Adela Lacorte cannot make it appear that
Rosario’s presence in that meeting was inconsequential; on the contrary,
Adela’s close contact with petitioners during the negotiations is clear proof
that she was privy to the agreements between petitioners and Icaca.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="font-family:Arial">5.  Petitioner Simon Lacorte testified that they were the ones who
negotiated with the bank for the reduction of the redemption price from <s>P</s>45,000.00
to <s>P</s>21,000.00.  After the bank
had agreed to their proposal, Simon Lacorte immediately consulted with Icaca,
to whom the land had also been mortgaged for <s>P</s>12,500.00, on the
possibility of the latter paying the redemption price while petitioners still
did not have the money to buy back their property.  Icaca acceded and, consequently, an agreement was executed
between the parties</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

not persuaded by respondent spouses’ pretension that they were oblivious of the
existing agreements between petitioners and Icaca when they paid for the land
in question.  Besides, it would be
downright unfair for petitioners not to gain anything after all their efforts
and the trouble that they had gone through precisely to preserve and retain
ownership of the property within the family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">One more
thing.  The case records irresistibly
reveal that the real intention of Icaca was to reconvey the land to all the
heirs of Maria Lacorte.  This fact is
supported by both the documentary evidence on record and the uncontroverted
testimony of Icaca himself, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Such intention
of Icaca is more in accord with the basic characteristic of a contract of
reconveyance which, as earlier stated, involves a transfer of realty back to
its original owner.  Petitioners’
mother, Maria Lacorte, is admittedly the original owner of the subject lot;
Adela Lacorte does not claim otherwise.  This only goes to show that the reconveyance was really intended for all
the heirs of Maria Lacorte.  Besides, it
was Adela Lacorte who prepared the Deed of Reconveyance, hence any ambiguity
therein must be resolved against her and in favor of Jose Icaca who merely
signed it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">In the mind of
this Court, what probably motivated respondent spouses to appropriate the
property for themselves is because petitioners could not raise the money needed
to pay  Jose Icaca.  This hypothesis finds substance in the
testimony of Adela Lacorte which is very revealing:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the foregoing disquisition, the inevitable conclusion is that it was really the
intention of the parties that the subject parcel of land shall be reconveyed to
all the heirs of  Maria Lacorte, hence
the payment made by Adela Lacorte should be deemed to inure to the benefit of
all the aforementioned heirs.  Consequently, herein petitioners necessarily stand to be prejudiced by
the Deed of Reconveyance executed solely in favor of Adela Lacorte since they
should have been included as parties thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Article 1359 of
the Civil Code provides that when, there having been a meeting of the minds of
the parties to a contract, their true intention is not expressed in the
instrument purporting to embody the agreement by reason of mistake, fraud,
inequitable conduct or accident, one of the parties may ask for the reformation
of the instrument to the end that such true intention may be expressed.  If such mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct,
or accident has prevented a meeting of the minds of the parties, the proper
remedy is not reformation of the instrument but annulment of the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">There is no
doubt that petitioners are entitled to bring an action to annul the contract
because they stand to be prejudiced by the enforcement of the Deed of
Reconveyance.  As to whether or not they
also have the right to ask for reformation of the instrument, we hold in the
affirmative.  This is because petitioner
should really have been made parties to the Deed of Reconveyance were it not
for the fact that Adela Lacorte had fraudulently excluded their names
therefrom.  From the start of the
negotiations with the bank and, later, with Jose Icaca, petitioners have
actively participated.  They remained in
possession of the land, gathered fruits therefrom, and never for a moment
relinquished their rights thereover.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Adela Lacorte
explicitly recognized such right when she sought the help of petitioners in
raising money to pay for the land.  It
was clear that, from the very start, petitioners were already recognized as
actual parties to the prospective reconveyance.  What deluded Jose Icaca, and prevented him from doubting the
veracity of the Deed of Reconveyance brought to him by Adela Lacorte for
signature, was the latter’s misrepresentation that she was purportedly acting
for and in behalf of all the heirs of Maria Lacorte.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Since
petitioners should in truth and in fact be parties to the Deed of Reconveyance,
they are entitled to the reformation of the contract in order to reflect the
true intention of the parties.  In fact,
Jose Icaca, who is the real injured party in this case because of the fraud
committed on him, has acquiesced to the cancellation of the contract.  There is nothing to prevent the reformation
