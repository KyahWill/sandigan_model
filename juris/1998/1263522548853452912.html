On June 24, 1991, Provincial Prosecutor Romeo S. Fernandez filed before the Regional Trial Court of Mambusao, Capiz the Information, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"That in or about the evening of March 17 and early morning of March 18, 1991 in Brgy. Maninang, Sapian, Capiz, Philippines, in the jurisdiction of this Court, the above named accused conspiring, confederating and helping one another, with intent to gain, willfully and [feloniously] [stole] and [carried] away one male carabao valued at [t]en [t]housand [p]esos (P10,000.00) belonging to and without the knowledge and consent of Rodrigo Belorio<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the amount aforementioned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>The petitioner, together with Waquez and Lozada, entered a plea of not guilty when arraigned<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on August 6, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered its April 25, 1994 Decision which disposed:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing and finding the evidence of the prosecution to have sufficiently established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the court hereby imposes upon the accused Joebert Santiago, Nonilon Waquez and Roger Lozada an indeterminate sentence of TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor in its maximum as the minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, TEN (10) MONTHS and TWENTY-ONE (21) DAYS of reclusion temporal in its medium as the maximum, and to pay the private offended party Rodrigo Beloria the sum of P10,000.00 by way of moral damages and P5,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs of the proceedings, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<br><br>"The case of accused John Dogohoy is hereby ordered archived and can be revived only upon proper motion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>On appeal, Respondent Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> affirmed the Decision of the lower court thus:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed decision of the trial court in Criminal Case No. 1862 is hereby AFFIRMED by this Court, with costs against accused-appellants."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>In its March 11, 1997 Resolution, the appellate court denied, for lack of merit, the separate Motions for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> filed by the petitioner and his co-accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, Joebert Santiago filed this petition before us.<br><br>Through Counsel Luis C.

Efren Felizardo, Pfc. McArthur dela Cruz and Patrolman Victoriano were on foot patrol inside the town proper of Sapian, Capiz, because of the rampant cattle rustling in the area when they tried to flag down a suspected passenger jeepney with Plate No. UVH-PFH-406, owned b[y] Elizane Waquez, but instead of st[o]pping, the driver stepped on the gas pedal where Pfc. McArthur dela Cruz was almost hit by the accelerating jeepney; that they radioed the Ivisan Police Station where the latter intercepted the passenger jeepney and apprehended inside the driver Roger Lozada, one of the herein accused, who, when investigated, told the police that his companions were Nonilon Waquez, John Dagohoy and Joebert Santiago; Waquez and Santiago admitted that they were with their co-accused when they were flagged down by the Sapian PNP[;] and when their jeepney was intercepted by the Ivisan PNP, they e[s]caped.<br><br>"The prosecution further solidif[ied] its position when it presented Rodrigo Veloria who reported to the Sapian Police Station in the morning of March 18, 1991, that his male carabao was stolen and [that] when they proceeded to the Ivisan Police Station, he identified his male carabao and showed his Creden[t]ial No. 836465-A, Exhibit ‘B’ signed by Sapian Mayor Rodel Obordo, Exhibit ‘B-1’."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>According to the Defense</u></b></center><br>Consistent with his avowal of innocence, Petitioner Santiago in his Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> offered a different story:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><blockquote>"In the early morning of March 18, 1991 at [about] 2:30 o’clock in the morning some members of the Sapian, Capiz Police Force were on foot patrol inside the poblacion of the said town because of the rampant cattle rustling in the area. While patrolling the said area the police officers composed of Pfc. Efren Felizardo, Pfc. McArthur dela Cruz and Patrolman Victoriano tried to flag down or stop a passenger jeepney, suspected of transporting stolen carabaos, with Plate No. UVH-PFH-406 owned by a certain Lizanie Waquez. But instead of stopping, the driver of the said jeepney accelerated going to the direction of Ivisan, Capiz. (pp. 4-5, 9, t.s.n., September 23, 1991).<br><br>"Thereafter, the police officers immediately informed the Ivisan Police Force thru two way radio about the incident with the request to intercept the said jeepney. At around 3:30 [a].m. of the said morning, the Ivisan Police Force radioed back the Sapian Police Force informing them that they ha[d] intercepted the subject jeepney and apprehended its driver, one of the herein accused-appellant, Roger Lozada. During that time, the jeepney was transporting one (1) male carabao which was found out later to be stolen. (p. 12, t.s.n., Ibid.).<br><br>"During that same morning of [March] 18, 1991, Pfc. Efren Felizardo of the Sapian Police Department, together with Rodrigo Veloria, the owner of the stolen carabao, proceeded to the Ivisan Police Station. Rodrigo Veloria after identifying the carabao, showed his proof of ownership of the same. Roger Lozada, the jeepney and the carabao were thereafter brought to the Sapian Police Station. Later, on the same morning, the other occupants of the jeepney, herein other co-accused, Nonilon Waquez and John Dagohoy surrendered to the Sapian Police Force. (p. 5, t.s.n., Ibid; pp. 6-7, t.s.n., September 24, 1991).<br><br>"During their investigation, accused-appellants Roger Lozada and Nonilon Waquez both claimed that on the early morning of March 18, 1991, while on board the subject jeepney going to Bilao, Sapian, Capiz, they were stopped by petitioner Joebert Santiago who together with a certain Ledonio offered P1,500.00 for them to transport a carabao to Roxas City. (pp. 3-5, t.s.n., May 20, 1991).<br><br>"Petitioner Joebert Santiago testified that at around 8:00 o’clock in the morning of March 17, 1991 while he was at Poblacion, Sapian, Capiz, Rolando Ledonio approached him and asked him, if he was going to Roxas City. After he answered in the affirmative, Ledonio requested him to tell Roger Lozada that he (Ledonio) [would] load something in the latter’s jeepney. He further testified that at about 10:00 o’clock of the same morning, he saw Roger Lozada and Nonilon Waquez in Roxas City and therefore told them of the request of Ledonio. (pp. 3-4, t.s.n., July 23, 1992). Thereafter, he and his employer went home to Sapian from Roxas City[;] after washing the car of his employer they had an accounting because he had earlier told his employer that he was going to Mindanao to work as a driver for a certain Roblito Cenica. (p. 4, t.s.n., Ibid). After their accounting at about 3:00 o’clock p.m., petitioner proceeded to his house at Barangay Dapdapan, Sapian, Capiz. From the time he arrived at this house up to 3:30 p.m. he packed his clothes and other things to be brought to Mindanao. (p. 5, t.s.n., Ibid). At about 6:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., he played domino in his house with Santiago Andaya, Romarico Dalmacio and Ramon Bonales. (p. 5, t.s.n., Ibid). After playing domino, petitioner went to sleep. However, the above-mentioned co-players of the petitioner continued playing domino. The wife of petitioner woke him up at about 4:00 a.m. the following morning of March 18, 1991. Thereafter, at about 4:30 p.m., petitioner and his cousin were able to ride a vehicle going to Sitio Talaba, Sapian, Capiz, and eventually were able to ride a bus from Talaba to Iloilo City. They arrived [in] Iloilo City at about 7:30 a.m. of March 18, 1991 [from where] they proceeded to Marbel, (Koronodal) South Cotabato (pp. 3-6, t.s.n., Ibid.).<br><br>"Romarico Dalmacio, a co-player of petitioner in the game of domino, attested that at about 10:00 p.m. of March 17, 1991, he saw petitioner Santiago [go] upstairs to the second floor of their house (his father-in-law’s) to sleep and did not leave the said house until 4:00 a.m. of March 18, 1991 whe[n] appellant and his cousin left the house and rode a bus to the direction of Talaba, Sapian (pp. 3-4 and 9-10, t.s.n., September 17, 1992). In fact, he further stated that before petitioner left, he served them coffee while they continued playing domino. (p. 4, t.s.n., Ibid.)."</blockquote><center><b><u>The Rulings of the Trial<br>and the Appellate Courts</u></b></center><br>Giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the trial court convicted petitioner, together with his co-accused, of cattle rustling. It disbelieved his defense of alibi, as (1) he was "positively identified," and (2) he failed to prove that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene while the offense was being committed. The trial court concluded:<br><blockquote>"Accused Joebert Santiago was one of the persons inside the jeepney with the carabao and his other co-accused when the jeep they were riding [in] was flagged down by the Sapian PNP[;] they continued at high speed proceeding to the Municipality of Ivisan, Capiz, where they were intercepted by the Ivisan PNP in the early morning of March 18, 1991."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Further, in ruling that petitioner acted in concert with Lozada and Waquez, the RTC held:<br><blockquote>"‘Conspiracy need not be established by direct proof as it can be inferred from the acts of the appellants. It is enough that at the time the offense was committed participants had the same purpose and were united in its execution as maybe [sic] inferred from the attendant circumstances.’ (People vs. Montealegre, G.R. 67948, 31 May 1988)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>In affirming the trial court, the Court of Appeals held that: first, Santiago failed to prove with convincing evidence his defense of alibi; second, he was positively identified by his cohorts; and last, he fled after the incident took place.<br><br><center><b><u>Assignment of Errors</u></b></center><blockquote>In his Memorandum, Santiago sets forth the following issues:<br><br>"I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals as well as the trial court erred in declaring that Petitioner Joebert Santiago conspired with the other accused in committing the crime charged.<br><br>"II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals as well as the trial court erred in outrightly disregarding Petitioner Joebert Santiago’s defense of alibi and denial.<br><br>"III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals as well as the trial court erred in considering Petitioner Joebert Santiago’s departure [for] Mindanao an indication of petitioner’s guilt.<br><br>"IV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the prosecution’s evidence against Petitioner Joebert Santiago failed to stand the crucible test of reasonable doubt to overthrow the constitutionally guaranteed presumption of innocence petitioner has in his favor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>Briefly stated, the issue in this case is whether there is sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b><u>This Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br><center><b><u>Main Issue:<br>Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</u></b></center><br>Presidential Decree 533 penalizes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>cattle rustling, which it defines as "the taking away by any means, method or scheme, without the consent of the owner/raiser, of any of the abovementioned animals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> whether or not for profit or gain, or whether committed with or without violence against or intimidation of any person or force upon things. It includes the killing of large cattle, or taking its meat or hide without the consent of the owner/raiser."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Section 7 of the said law creates a <i>prima facie</i> presumption of cattle rustling upon failure to exhibit documents of ownership, viz.:<br><blockquote>"Every person having in his possession, control or custody of large cattle shall, upon demand by competent authorities, exhibit the documents prescribed in the preceding sections. Failure to exhibit the required documents shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the large cattle in his possession, control and custody are the fruits of the crime of cattle rustling."</blockquote>Petitioner Santiago was not caught stealing the carabao. He was not seen by the Sapian PNP inside the jeep used in transporting the carabao subject of the offense. He was not even seen having possession, custody or control of the carabao. He was not in the company of Lozada when the latter was caught by the members of the Ivisan PNP. However, he was identified and indicted by virtue of the declarations of Lozada and Waquez during the investigation. On the basis of the evidence adduced, can Santiago be held guilty of cattle rustling?<br><br>We have consistently ruled that the prosecution has the obligation of proving beyond reasonable doubt the identity of the malefactor and his participation in the commission of the crime or offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In its discharge of such duty, the prosecution presented the policemen as witnesses. Relying on the testimonies of the policemen as well as those of petitioner’s co-accused, the trial court convicted Santiago.<br><br><b><u>Testimonies of the Policemen</u></b><br><br>It is elementary that a witness may testify only on facts of which he has personal knowledge; that is, those derived from his perception, except in certain circumstances allowed by the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Otherwise, such testimony is considered hearsay and, hence, inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="24%"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td width="76%"><div align="LEFT">In this connection, Pfc.

Felizardo and Police Sergeant Urdelas, linking Santiago to the crime, are inadmissible in evidence for being unabashedly hearsay. Neither one of them saw Santiago having possession, custody or control of the carabao. They had no personal knowledge that Santiago participated in the commission of the crime. Petitioner was implicated solely and purely on the policemen’s recollection of statements given by Lozada and Waquez while under interrogation.<br><br>We also agree with petitioner that the entries in the police blotter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> should not be given significance or probative value, as they do not constitute conclusive proof of the truth thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> These entries are usually incomplete and inaccurate, as "[s]ometimes they are taken from either partial suggestion or inaccurate reporting and are hearsay, untested in the crucible of a trial on the merits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b><u>Testimonies of Co-Accused</u></b><br><br>During their custodial investigation, Lozada and Waquez both implicated Santiago as the person who allegedly rented the jeep. They said he was with them when they transported the carabao. However, such declarations, being extrajudicial, are inadmissible in evidence against Santiago. The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another, except as may be allowed by the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Verily, the admission of such declarations will violate the right of the petitioner to due process, specifically his right to confront and cross-examine his co-accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>A different rule applies with respect to testimonies given during the trial. In a number of instances, we have held that the testimonies of <i>particeps criminis</i> may be admissible against the person incriminated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> But such rule is not without qualification. We always advise caution in according probative value to the testimony of an alleged co-conspirator, as the latter is deemed a polluted source. His or her declaration must be scrutinized with care and subjected to grave suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> True, such testimony, even if uncorroborated, may be sufficient to convict a co-accused, provided it is shown to be sincere, unhesitating, straightforward and detailed that it could not have been the result of deliberate afterthought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Otherwise, his testimony would require corroborative evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which, if strong and convincing, may be given its due weight and force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>After a careful and meticulous review of the records, we find the testimonies of Lozada and Waquez insufficient to convict Santiago of cattle rustling.<br><br><i>First,</i> the trial court did not find the testimonies of said witnesses "frank, candid and straightforward," or their testimonies worthy of any credit. And our own reading of the transcripts does not lead us to conclude otherwise. In fact, the solicitor general himself submits that "the testimonies of co-accused Lozada and Waquez are insufficient to justify petitioner’s conviction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><i>Second,</i> both Lozada and Waquez deny any participation in cattle rustling. In fact, they claim to have no knowledge that the carabao was indeed stolen. Being of human nature, culprits are likely to pin the blame on others rather than on themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> There is therefore no guarantee that petitioner’s co-accused had testified truthfully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><i>Third,</i> the identification of the petitioner as the malefactor was not sufficiently established. Lozada did not identify the petitioner in open court, but merely mentioned his name. True, Waquez pointed to Santiago, but the probative weight of his identification of the latter as the culprit is attenuated by his admission that, on the night of the incident, he "could not really determine that he is Joebert" and that he "did not recognize him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the testimonies of Waquez and Lozada were not corroborated. There are no other pieces of evidence that support their testimonies and that tend to show or establish the guilt of the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Of the four original accused, only Waquez was positively identified by Prosecution Witness Felizardo as the one who was "hanging at the back of the jeep." Urdelas, who apprehended Lozada, did not see anybody except the latter. Only Lozada and Waquez testified that Santiago rented the jeep they were plying and was with them while they were transporting the carabao.<br><br>We agree with the solicitor general’s recommendation to acquit Santiago:<br><blockquote>"x x x the facts obtaining in the case engender reasonable doubt on petitioner’s complicity which, should, therefore, tilt the scale of justice in his favor. x x x ‘where the people’s evidence fails to meet the quantum required to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence, the accused is entitled to acquittal regardless of the weakness of his defense of denial and uncorroborated alibi.’"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>For insufficiency of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, this Court is constrained to acquit the petitioner. It is axiomatic that the accused is entitled to acquittal, unless his guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The prosecution evidence must stand or fall on its own merit; it cannot draw strength from the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>To summarize, the prosecution’s evidence is insufficient to convict Santiago. First, the testimonies of the policemen, being hearsay, are inadmissible in evidence. Second, the declarations of Lozada and Waquez during the investigation are inadmissible under Section 28, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court and for being violative of petitioner’s right to due process. Third, the testimonies of Lozada and Waquez, as borne out by the stenographic notes, are not worthy of credence. Lastly, there is no other clear, convincing and corroborative evidence that shows the complicity of the petitioner in the commission of the offense.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b> Petitioner Joebert Santiago is <b>ACQUITTED</b> on reasonable doubt.
