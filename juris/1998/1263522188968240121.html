				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A rape case presents a “he said, she said” scenario. In this 
appeal, the Court is tasked to decide whom to believe -- the appellant 
or the private complainant? This is not an easy undertaking. On the one 
hand, the Court has to keep in mind that a rape victim is a victim many 
times over. She is physically, psychologically, emotionally and socially
 scarred. Oftentimes she suffers in silence, and this may last a 
lifetime. Justice must be rendered to her. On the other hand, the Court 
must also remember that an accusation of rape can be made with facility,
 and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even harder for 
the accused, though innocent, to disprove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The charge of rape must be proven with moral certainty, lest there be a miscarriage of justice.
<p align="center"><u><strong>The Case</strong></u><strong></strong>
</p><p>Domingo Sta. Ana was charged with rape committed on three 
different occasions against Judilyn Obera. Before the Regional Trial 
Court of Kalookan City, Branch 120, three Criminal Complaints, treated 
as Informations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> were filed
 against him on August 10, 1992, setting forth identical allegations 
save for the dates of the commission of the offenses:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“That on or about the 22nd day of April 1992 (in Criminal Case No. 40645)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>,
 in Kalookan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design and by means 
of threats and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
 feloniously lie and have sexual intercourse with JUDILYN OBERA Y 
PROVIDO a minor of 12 years of age (11 years of age in Criminal Case No.
 40647) against her will and without her consent.
  </p>
  <p>CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On arraignment, the appellant, with the assistance of Counsel <em>de Oficio</em> Ernesto Gaboy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. The three criminal 
cases were jointly tried and, thereafter, the trial court rendered a 
Decision dated April 22, 1994, finding him guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of three counts of rape. The dispositive portion of the assailed 
Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“WHEREFORE, finding that the prosecution evidence established the 
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in the three (3) crimes of 
rape, the Court hereby imposes [the] penalty of [r]eclusion [p]erpetua 
for each rape committed by the accused as provided under Article 335 of 
the Revised Penal Code and to indemnify the offended party the sum of 
P50,000.00. </p>

    <br>
    <em>The Version of the Prosecution</em></u></strong>
</p><p>The prosecution presented five witnesses: Judilyn Obera,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the complainant; Margarita Obera,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> mother of the complainant who testified to the victim’s age; SPO1 Leonardo Balinang,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> one of the four policemen who apprehended the appellant and brought him to the police station; SPO3 Bienvenido Santianes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 the investigating officer who received the complaint, took down 
complainant’s sworn statement and sent the team which arrested the 
appellant; and Dr. Juan B. Zaldariaga, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the NBI medico-legal officer who examined the victim.
</p><p>The solicitor general summarized the People’s version of the facts as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“On November 28, 1991, at around 6:30 in the evening, private 
complainant Judilyn Obera, who was born on February 11, 1980, was 
walking along Lawaan Alley, Macaneneng Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan 
City towards her house at 69 Miralle Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan 
City when appellant Domingo Sta. Ana saw her and pulled her towards 
appellant’s house which is located at 233 Lawaan Alley, Bagong Barrio of
 the same city. Appellant then poked a knife at Judilyn’s neck, covered 
her mouth with a handkerchief and, thereafter, raped her. Judilyn cried 
because of the severe pain she felt. After raping Judilyn, appellant 
threatened her not to tell anybody about the incident, or else, he would
 kill her as well as her parents, brothers and sisters (Exh. “B”, p. 
159, Records; tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, pp. 3-5 and 13). </p>
  <p>On February 17, 1992, at around 7:00 in the evening, Judilyn was at
 her house when Didel Sta. Ana, appellant’s daughter and friend of 
Judilyn, called and told Judilyn to help her in preparing barbecue. 
However, when Judilyn went to Didel’s house (she lives with appellant), 
the latter was not in the house as she had left already. Appellant, who 
was in the house, called Judilyn and suddenly poked a knife at her neck.
 Appellant then embraced Judilyn, kissed her lips and ears and pulled 
down her panties. He then took off his pants and had sexual intercourse 
with her for about five minutes. Thereafter, appellant told Judilyn to 
wait on one of the chairs inside the house for another five minutes and 
then told her to go home. Appellant also threatened to kill Judilyn 
(tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, pp. 4-7). </p>
  <p>On April 22, 1992, Didel Sta. Ana invited Judilyn to see a movie. 
Didel told private complainant that the former’s father, appellant, was 
not going with them. However, when Judilyn met with Didel, the latter 
was with appellant. When told by Didel that appellant would not sit 
beside her, Judilyn finally agreed to see a movie with Didel and 
appellant. Thereafter, at around 7:00 in the evening and after watching a
 movie, Judilyn went with Didel and appellant to the latter’s house. 
Appellant then sent her [sic] daughter Didel to the market for an 
errand. After Didel left, appellant poked a knife at Judilyn’s neck and 
threatened to kill her if she would tell anybody about the incident. He 
then pulled down her panties and took off his pants and his briefs. 
Appellant had Judilyn sit on a chair and then had sexual intercourse 
with her. Appellant then told Judilyn to go home (tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, 
p.4, 7-9; tsn., Jan. 14, 1993, pp. 9 and 15). </p>
  <p>Judilyn kept the three rape incidents to herself because she was 
afraid of the threats made by the appellant (tsn., Jan. 14, 1993, pp. 
10-11).
  </p>
  <p>However, on July 23, 1992, something happened which forced Judilyn 
to tell her parents about the rape incidents. Judilyn’s parents were 
wondering why the former’s stomach was getting large, thus prompting the
 latter to bring their daughter to an “albularyo” to determine whether 
private complainant was pregnant or not. When informed by the 
“albularyo” that she was pregnant, Judilyn thereupon told her parents 
that she was raped by the appellant (tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, p. 9; tsn., 
Jan. 14, 1993, p. 12). </p>
  <p>Thereafter, three (3) separate complaints for rape were filed 
against appellant (Exhs. “I”, “J” and “K”; tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, pp. 
10-11). On December 14, 1992, Judilyn gave birth (tsn., Nov. 9, 1992, p.
 9).”

<p align="center"><em><strong><u>The Version of the Defense</u></strong></em>
</p><p>Appellant Sta. Ana contends that he could not have committed the 
purported rapes against Private Complainant Obera because she was the 
friend of his daughter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and, on the dates of the alleged rapes, he was at his barbecue stall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 He adds that he was forced by the police to admit the accusation 
against him and that, while he was in the custody of the lawmen, he was 
not allowed to secure his own counsel.
</p><p>During the trial, the defense presented three witnesses: the 
appellant himself, who denied the charges; Beatriz Doktor, a balut 
vendor who testified that, on the dates of the alleged rapes, appellant 
was vending beside her in Macaneneng Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan 
City; and Didel Sta. Ana, appellant’s daughter who was also the 
complainant’s best friend.
</p><p>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> appellant submitted the following Statement of Facts:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“1.               Accused-Appellant is a widower, 47 years old, 
with three grown children, whose main source of livelihood was vending 
meat barbecue in the neighborhood of Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City (TSN 
of the direct examination of Accused-Appellant dated 01 February 1994, 
at p. 2). </p>
  <p>2.  On 06 August 1996, while walking along Makaneneng Street, 
Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City, Accused-Appellant was accosted by four 
policemen from Bagong Barrio Police Station. The policemen, after having
 ascertained his identity, informed him that someone filed a complaint 
of rape against him (TSN of testimony of SPO1 Leonardo Balinang, 06 
October 1992, at p. 4).
  </p>
  <p>3.  Immediately, Accused-Appellant was handcuffed, forced to board 
the police service vehicle and brought by the apprehending policemen to 
the police station (TSN, 01 February 1994, at p. 4).
  </p>
  <p>4.  Upon arrival at the police station, the Accused-Appellant was 
interrogated by said policemen, who forced him to admit to the 
accusations of Ms. Judilyn Obera. Accused-Appellant insisted on his 
innocence. He was punched on the stomach and at the back (TSN, supra, p.
 4); thereafter, he was brought inside a cell and was not allowed to 
leave, except only to appear before the inquest prosecutor the following
 day, 07 August 1993, for inquest proceedings (TSN of cross-examination 
of SPO3 Bienvenido Santianes, Jr, 07 October 1992, at p. 9).
  </p>
  <p>5.  All the while that he was under the custody of the police, 
Accused-Appellant was not allowed to secure his own counsel; neither was
 he given the assistance of one. (TSN, 06 October 1992, at p. 7).
  </p>
  <p>6.  Subsequently, three separate Informations for rape were filed 
against him in the court a quo docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 40645, 
40646 and 40647.
  </p>
  <p>7.  During the trial, the prosecution presented the following 
witnesses: Margarita Obera, the mother of the complainant, who testified
 as to the victim’s age; SPO1 Leonardo Balinang, one of the four 
policemen who apprehended Accused-Appellant and brought him to the 
police station; SPO3 Bienvenido Santianes, the investigating officer who
 received the complaint, took down the sworn statement of the 
complainant and sent the team which arrested the Accused-Appellant; the 
complainant, Judilyn Obera; and Dr. Juan Zaldariaga, the NBI 
medico-legal officer who examined the complainant and who testified as 
to the physical condition of the victim as of 03 August 1992, the date 
of medical examination. </p>
  <p>8.  On the other hand, the defense presented Accused-Appellant 
himself who denied the charges; Beatriz Doktor, a balut vendor who 
testified that on the dates of the alleged rapes, Accused-Appellant was 
vending beside her in Macaneneng Street, Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City; 
and Didel Sta. Ana, Accused-Appellant’s daughter who was also the 
complainant’s best friend. </p>
  <p>9.  After trial, Accused-Appellant was convicted by the trial court and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trial court, on the other hand, presented the following summary of the evidence of the defense:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence for the defense, as per testimony of the accused, Domingo
 Sta. Ana, shows that he is a vendor residing at 233 Lawaan Alley, 
Bagong Barrio, Kalookan City. As a vendor, he woke up everyday at 5;00 
o’ clock in the morning to go to the market at Balintawak to buy meat 
for barbecue. He went home at 6:30 in the morning to prepare the 
barbecue and finished at 3:00 in the afternoon. At 4:30 in the 
afternoon, he started selling in Bagong Barrio and went home at 11:00 o’
 clock in the evening. </p>
  <p>On August 7, 1992, he was caught by the police and brought to the 
precinct. They were forcing him to admit the crime and when he refused, 
they maltreated him. There was no investigation that took place and 
there was no lawyer who assisted him.
  </p>
  <p>He further testified that on November 28, 1991, February 17, 1992 
and April 22, 1992, a balut vendor was beside him when he was vending.
  </p>
  <p>Beatriz Doktor, a balut vendor, testified that on November 28, 
1991, February 17, 1992 and April 22, 1992, she and the accused were 
vending from 6:30 in the evening to 12 midnight.
  </p>
  <p>Didel Sta. Ana, daughter of the accused, testified that everyday, 
she helped her father in preparing barbecue and in selling them at Peta 
Street. Her father started vending from 5:00 o’ clock in the afternoon 
and went home at 12:00 midnight. In 1991, every night, the victim and 
her brother bought barbecue in their store. Sometime in January, 1992, 
the victim told her that her (victim) birthday was lonely because her 
brother did something wrong to her. She told the victim to tell her 
parents what happened to her but she did not tell her parents. </p>
  <p>She further testified that in 1992, the victim stop[ped] going [to]
 their store. She came to know that the victim was pregnant when she was
 informed by the victim’s brother. One time, she saw the victim [pass 
by] their store and noticed that the latter like[d] to eat sour foods. 
She heard from the brother of the victim that their mother noticed that 
the victim’s neck became darker and her stomach [was] getting bigger. 
She was brought by her mother to a quack doctor (nagtatawas). </p>
  <p>She declared that the victim Judilyn Obera Y Provido was her 
childhood friend and that on April 22, 1992, she and her father were in 
their house “nagtutuhog ng barbecue” (t.s.n., p. 11, February 23, 
1994).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><u><strong>The Ruling of the Trial Court</strong></u><strong></strong>
</p><p>The lower court gave full credence and probative weight to the 
evidence of the prosecution, especially to that of the victim, Judilyn 
Obera. Pertinent portions of the Decision are reproduced below:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“On the first rape, the private complainant has described in a 
clear, straightforward manner the details how the accused forced her 
inside the house, then poked a knife at her neck, removed her panty and 
inserted his penis into her vagina. She said that she cried because of 
the pain which was the natural reaction for a virgin like the private 
complainant for she was only less than 12 years old at that time. </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                                xxx                                        xxx
  </p>
  <p>The second alleged rape was committed when she was called by Didel 
to go to the house but when the private complainant arrived in the 
house, Didel was not in the house Then and there, the accused embraced 
her on the lips and ears and then pulled her party and insert[ed] his 
penis into the vagina for about five (5) minutes. He threatened her that
 he would kill her and her family if she would tell her parents about 
the incident and the third time was on April 22, 1992 at 7:00 o’ clock 
in the evening, again inside the house. The accused forced the private 
complainant as he pulled down her panty, took off his pants and brief 
and insert[ed] his penis and he ordered her to sit down on the chair and
 the accused inserted his penis into her vagina four (4) times. </p>
  <p>There is no doubt in the court’s mind that physical force and fear 
had overcome without much difficulty the 12 year old victim’s 
resistance. Details of the sexual intercourse as she was forced to sit 
down on the chair could only come from one who was indeed ravished in 
the manner so described. </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                                xxx                                        xxx
  </p>
  <p>One is hard put to believe that a[s] young and inexperience[d] as 
the complainant was, [she] would willingly and voluntarily accept the 
bestial advances of the accused unless she was at that time forced or 
intimidated by the accused.
  </p>
  <p>The defense of the accused is alibi which is unavailing in view of 
the positive identification of the accused and the fact that the store 
from where he was selling his goods to the house where the rape was 
committed, was only about 2 to 3 minutes walk.
  </p>
  <p>Well settled is the rule that for alibi to be accorded credence, it
 does not suffice for an accused to merely prove that he was at some 
other place, but that the distance was such render it physically 
impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime shortly before, 
during or after it was committed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong><u>Assignment of Errors</u></strong>
</p><p>The appellant submits that the Decision of the trial court 
“should be reversed and set aside because the following circumstances 
will show that the guilt of the accused has not been proven beyond 
reasonable doubt”:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“A.               The conduct of the complainant before and after 
the alleged sexual assaults belied that she was raped by 
accused-appellant, based on human experience. </p>
  <p>B.  The alleged dates of the rape did not coincide with the age of the fetus.
  </p>
  <p>C. The complainant had the motive to cry rape to salvage her sullied reputation brought about by a pregnancy at a tender age.
  </p>
  <p>D. The complainant’s credibility is lacking, especially in her identification of the accused.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the core of this case is the credibility of the private 
complainant, Judilyn Obera, upon whose testimony the appellant was 
convicted.
</p><p align="center"><strong><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></strong>
</p><p>The appeal is bereft of merit.
</p><p align="center"><strong><u>First Issue:
    <br>
    <em>Complainant’s Conduct and Her Credibility</em></u></strong>
</p><p>The general rule is that the findings of the trial court on the 
credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest respect and will 
not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any clear showing that the 
trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or 
circumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the 
result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This 
is so because the trial court is in a better position to decide the 
question of credibility, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves 
and observed their behavior and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><p>It must be noted too that, in the review of rape cases such as 
this one, jurisprudence has laid down the following guiding principles:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“(a)             an accusation of rape can be made with facility 
and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more 
difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove the 
charge; </p>
  <p>(b)               considering that, in the nature of things, only 
two (2) persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony
 of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and
  </p>
  <p>(c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own 
merit, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the 
evidence for the defense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As earlier stated, the trial court gave credence to testimony of the 
complainant that she was raped by the appellant thrice and that, on each
 occasion, he poked a knife at her as he threatened that she and her 
family would be harmed, should she tell anyone of the incident. We 
sustain the assessment by the trial court of the complainant’s 
testimony, which we find to be clear, credible and straightforward. The 
complainant testified as follows :
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q    xxx now you stated that sometime on November 28, 1991, you 
were raped by Domingo Sta. Ana at his house[. W]here is that place

  <p>Q     Can you tell also the Honorable Court what happened when Idel
 called you to go to their house on that date February 17, 1992 at about
 7:00 o’ clock in the evening? </p>
  <p>A      When I arrived there, I found out that Idel was no longer there and she left already, sir.
  </p>

  <p>A      Mang Ingo, sir.

  <p>A      Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     After he called you, can you tell us what happened?
  </p>
  <p>A      He suddenly poked a knife on my neck, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What happened next?
  </p>
  <p>A      Then after that she [sic] embraced me, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Is that what he did?
  </p>
  <p>A      There were others, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What are those?
  </p>
  <p>A      He kissed me on my lips and on my ears, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What else, if any?
  </p>
  <p>A      Until he pulled down my panty, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Tell us what happened after he pulled down you[r] panty?
  </p>
  <p>A      He took off his pants, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What happened next?
  </p>
  <p>A      He inserted his large penis into my vagina, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     For how long did he insert his penis into your vagina?
  </p>
  <p>A      About five (5) minutes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     After that, what did he do, if any?
  </p>
  <p>A      I felt pain when he did that to me, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Now, kindly tell this Honorable Court, what did you do after he finished inserting his penis into your vagina?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What did you do?
  </p>
  <p>A      He told me to wait on one of the chair[s], sir.

  <p>Q     Did you do that?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What were you doing while waiting in that chair and for how long?
  </p>
  <p>A      About 5 minutes and after he told me that he will kill me, sir.

  </p>
  <p>Q     How about you, where were you then?
  </p>
  <p>A      I was in their house and I was left by [his] daughter, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     When you were left at their house by the daughter of the accused, Domingo Sta. Ana, what happened there, if any?
  </p>
  <p>A      He poked a knife on my neck, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     After that, what happened?
  </p>
  <p>A      He threatened me that he will kill me, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     For what?
  </p>
  <p>A      If I will tell the incident in our place and to anybody, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Why, what happened at that evening?
  </p>
  <p>A      After that, he pulled down my panty, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What happened after he has pulled down your panty?
  </p>
  <p>A      Then after[wards] he took off his pants and his brief, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What happened after his brief was already pulled out?
  </p>
  <p>A      He inserted his penis into my vagina, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What was his position and your position?
  </p>
  <p>A      He told me to sit down on one of their chairs, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     When he said that, was the knife still poked on your neck?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir.

  <p>A      Yes, sir.

<p>The rule is that “an affirmative testimony is far stronger than a 
negative testimony, especially so when it comes from the mouth of a 
credible witness.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
Appellant has not given us a sufficient justification to modify or 
reverse the findings of the trial court, and we find none in the 
records.
</p><p>Appellant argues that it is “simply contrary to human nature and 
experience for the complainant to return not just once but twice to the 
house of the accused-appellant where she was allegedly raped the first 
time, assuming that she was indeed raped earlier, on 28 November 1991. 
At her tender age and suffering from intense pain as claimed by her, she
 should have been traumatized by the initial experience. Yet, 
complainant went to the same house barely three months later.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 The appellant also questions private complainant’s watching a movie 
with him and returning to his house on April 22, 1992, the date of the 
alleged third rape. He cites <em>People vs. Castillon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 which held that the conduct of the victim immediately following the 
alleged sexual assault is of utmost importance to establish the truth or
 falsity of the charge of rape, and that the “normal human reaction 
would be for the victim to take flight at the first opportunity to avoid
 her tormentors.” Appellant also emphasizes the fact that Judilyn did 
not tell anyone -- her parents, in particular -- of the alleged 
instances of rape. This, appellant argues, casts doubt on the veracity 
of her story.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
</p><p>This argument does not persuade. In <em>People vs. Montefalcon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 the Court said: “We have had occasion to state and reiterate that 
different people react differently to a given situation or type of 
situation, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response 
where one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful 
experience.” In that case, the appellant was convicted of four counts of
 rape committed against a ten-year-old girl. He argued, just as 
Appellant Sta. Ana now argues, that the trial court erred in giving 
credence to the victim’s testimony, which he described as conflicting 
and improbable, and that the actions of the victim after the alleged 
rapes were not “the normal behavior of a girl whose virtue has been 
damaged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The Court, 
however, held that the victim’s failure to tell her parents more 
promptly of the sexual assaults upon her did not, by itself, diminish 
her credibility, and that “it is not uncommon for young girls to conceal
 for sometime the assaults on their virtues because of the rapist’s 
threat on their lives.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
</p><p>In <em>People vs. Remoto</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 the Court ruled: “Suffice to stress, it is not proper to judge the 
actions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences by the 
norms of behavior expected under the circumstances from mature persons. 
The range of emotion shown by rape victims is yet to be captured even by
 the calculus. It is thus unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from 
rape victims.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
</p><p>Verily, the private complainant adequately explained her conduct in going twice to the scene of the crime after the first rape:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q    Can you tell also why you were there at that time about 7:00 of February 17, 1992? </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Why were you there?
  </p>
  <p>A      I was called up by his daughter, Idel, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     For what purpose?
  </p>
  <p>A      She told me to help her in preparing the barbecue, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q     What is your relationship with the daughter named Idel?
  </p>
  <p>A      She is my friends [sic], sir.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On cross-examination, she further testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Q    After the rape on November 28, 1991 and after the rape on 
February 17, 1992, despite the threats that you testified [to] before 
this Court by the accused, why did you agree to go with the accused and 
his daughter to the theater on April 22, 1992? </p>
  <p>A      <em>Because his daughter Aileen told me that only the two of us will watch the movie</em>.
  </p>
  <p>Q     But before you entered the movie house you met the accused[. I]s that correct?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, your Honor.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Considering that you testified that the accused threaten[ed] 
you during the two alleged rapes, why did you agree to go inside the 
theater with the accused after you ha[d] seen him?
  </p>
  <p>A      I <em>do</em> [sic] <em>not really want to go inside the 
movie house at that time, your Honor, but his daughter told me that his 
father [would] not sit beside me, your Honor</em>”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from the foregoing that Judilyn went back to the scene of the crime twice because of Didel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the daughter of the appellant who was her childhood friend, a fact which even the latter admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
</p><p>That Judilyn did not immediately inform anyone, especially her 
parents, about any of the incidents of rape can be attributed to the 
appellant’s threats which, to her mind, were very real:

  <p>“Q    Judilyn, will you kindly tell us the reason, if any, why you

  <p>A      11 years old, sir.

were again raped by the accused in this case, will you tell the 
Honorable Court if you told your parents regarding the incidents?

  <p>A      No, sir.

  <p>A      Yes, sir.

  <p>Q     What was the threat, if any, that the accused again told you?

  <p>Q     And again, did you believe him when he said those words?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir.

<p>It is important to note that delay in reporting rape does not by

    <br>
    <em>Rape and Pregnancy</em></strong></u>
</p><p>Appellant cites Dr. Juan Zaldariaga, Jr., the NBI medico-legal 
officer who testified that the age of the fetus at the time of Judilyn’s
 examination was eighteen (18) weeks and two (2) days, a finding that 
was confirmed by ultrasound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> He averred:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“From the foregoing medical findings and testimony, it is clear 
that the complainant’s pregnancy was eighteen (18) weeks and two days 
(2) days in term when she was examined on 03 August 1992. It follows 
that she could not have been impregnated [i]n the alleged rape on 28 
November 1991, or on 22 April 1992, because, if that were so, she would 
have been at least thirty-five weeks pregnant counted from 28 November 
1991, or only fourteen (14) weeks counted from the date of the second 
rape on 22 April 1992. Similarly, it cannot be claimed that the 
complainant was impregnated when she was allegedly raped on 17 February 
1992, because she would have been pregnant for about twenty-four (24) 
weeks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>In <em>People vs. Adora</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 the appellant argued that the medical finding showed that the 
complainant was already pregnant long before she was allegedly abused. 
Addressing this contention, the Court turned to the dissertations of 
experts in the field and held that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
 “[A]uthorities in forensic medicine agree that the determination of the
 exact date of fertilization is problematic. The exact date thereof is 
unknown; thus, the difficulty in determining the actual normal duration 
of pregnancy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Citing a 
Filipino authority, the Court further elucidated: “The average duration 
of pregnancy is 270 to 280 days from the onset of the last menstruation.
 <em>There is, however, no means of determining it with certainty</em>. 
Evidence derived from pregnancy following a single coitus is 
trustworthy, but inasmuch as some authorities consider more than two 
weeks as the life span of the spermatozoa in the vaginal canal, it is 
hard to ascertain the exact date of fertilization. <em>There is no synchrony between coitus and fertilization</em>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
  </p>
<p>Even Dr. Zaldariaga, on redirect examination, implied that his finding on the age of the fetus was not conclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
</p><p>Be that as it may, it must be stressed that pregnancy is not an 
element of the crime of rape and is, therefore, totally immaterial to 
the resolution of this case. Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code 
defines rape as “having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the 
following circumstances:
</p><blockquote>
<ol><li>by using force or intimidation; </li><li>when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious </li><li>when the woman is under twelve years of age even though neither of
 the circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall 
be present.”
  </li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In rape cases, the essential element that the prosecution must prove 
is the absence of the victim’s consent to the sexual congress. The 
People must establish that the sexual assault was <em>committed using force or intimidation, or that it was committed against a woman deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious</em>. On the other hand, in statutory rape, all that needs to be proven is that the accused had sexual intercourse with a woman <em>under twelve years of age</em> -- her consent and other circumstances relating to the sexual intercourse being immaterial.
</p><p>It bears emphasis that this is a criminal prosecution for rape, 
not a civil action involving paternity and filiation. That the alleged 
age of the fetus did not coincide with the dates when the victim was 
raped, as appellant insists, is insignificant. Of greater import and 
relevance is the fact that appellant had carnal knowledge of the victim 
on three occasions without her consent. In fact, lack of consent is not 
even an element in Criminal Case No. 40647 because Judilyn was 11 years 
of age only on the date she was assaulted.
</p><p align="center"><u><strong>Third Issue:
    <br>
    <em>Alleged Improper Motive</em></strong></u>
</p><p>Citing <em>Castillon</em> once more, appellant submits that 
Judilyn “must have reasoned that it is better to cry ‘rape’ and bring 
suit thereon to salvage her honor in part than to have her reputation 
sullied by being bruited around and stigmatized as a woman with loose 
morals.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>
</p><p>Appellant’s argument is devoid of merit, for it is utterly 
oblivious to the disgrace that is forever etched in the rape victim’s 
being. The cultural obstacles that rape victims have to overcome in 
their pursuit of justice have long been recognized by the Court, which 
held that “rape stigmatizes the victim worse than the perpetrator, as 
our culture puts premium into purity and virginity as virtues.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 Thus, it further declared that “no young Filipina of decent repute 
would publicly admit that she was criminally abused unless it is the 
truth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Indeed, it is 
callously insensitive for the appellant to argue that the complainant 
fabricated the charge of rape “to salvage her honor.” 
</p><p>Moreover, it cannot be said that Judilyn had an evil motive in 
imputing the revolting charges to appellant, who conceded this fact in 
his testimony:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">“xxx                                                
                                                xxx                     
        xxx </p>
  <p>Q     Is it not a fact that Judilyn Obera was always in your house and your store, [that] she treats you as a father? 
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, I also treat her as my daughter because she is a friend of my daughter.
  </p>
  <p>Q     November 28, 1991, April 22, 1991 and February 17, 1992, Judilyn Obera has no grudge against you , is that correct?
  </p>
  <p>A      Yes, sir, she has no grudge against me.
  </p>
  <p>Q     Nothing at all?
  </p>
  <p>A      Nothing at all against me.
  </p>
  <p align="center">xxx xxx xxx”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Judilyn had no grudge against him, why would she concoct such 
repugnant charges against him? And if, as appellant submits, she only 
cried rape to save her reputation, why would she pinpoint him, whom she 
treated like a father, as the culprit of not just one count, but three 
counts of rape? The Court is inclined to believe that, absent any 
circumstance indicating the contrary, Judilyn brought the charges 
against the appellant for one simple reason: She wanted justice.
</p><p align="center"><u><strong>Fourth Issue:
    <br>
    <em>Alleged Inconsistencies</em></strong></u>
</p><p>Appellant likewise claims that Judilyn’s testimony shows serious 
inconsistencies, which cast doubt on her credibility as a whole. He 
specifically points to the fact that, in the latter’s <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em>
 and on direct examination, she did not mention that her mouth was 
covered by a handkerchief which prevented her from shouting. Only on 
cross-examination did she mention this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>
</p><p>The argument is not persuasive. Even if there are discrepancies 
in Judilyn’s testimony, the same are insignificant. Minor lapses are to 
be expected when a person is recounting details of a traumatic 
experience too painful to recall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>
 What is important is that Judilyn was emphatic in describing each rape 
and in identifying the appellant as the one who raped her. Jurisprudence
 holds that “when a woman says she has been raped, she says in effect 
all that is necessary to show that the rape has been committed and that 
if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be 
convicted on the basis thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
</p><p align="center"><u><strong><em>Defense of Alibi Weak</em></strong></u><strong><em></em>
</strong>
</p><p>Appellant’s defense of alibi must be rejected. “Where the accused
 was positively identified by the victim herself who harbored no ill 
motive against the accused, the defense of alibi must fail.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>
 Alibi is an inherently weak defense. To establish such, the accused 
must show that he was in some other place for such a period of time, and
 that it was impossible for him to have been at the locus criminis or 
its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>
 In this case, appellant, while asserting that he could not have 
committed the rape, reveals that the place where he was supposed to be 
at the time the rape was thrice committed was a walking distance of only
 a few minutes from the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It was therefore not impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed at those particular instances.
</p><p align="center"><u><strong><em>Damages</em></strong></u><strong><em></em>
</strong>
</p><p>The Court agrees with the solicitor general that a modification 
of the assailed Decision as regards the civil indemnity is in order. In 
light of prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>
 appellant should be ordered to pay civil indemnity of P50,000 for each 
count of rape, and not just a single indemnity for all three cases.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is hereby DENIED, and the 
questioned Decision of the trial court, finding Appellant Domingo Sta. 
Ana guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of rape and 
sentencing him to three terms of reclusion perpetua, one for each act of
 rape, is hereby AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the indemnity in 
favor of Complainant Judilyn Obera is INCREASED to one hundred fifty 
thousand pesos (P150,000).      Costs against appellant.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
