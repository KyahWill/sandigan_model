MANAGEMENT PHILS, INC., (SINGA), and Royal Cruise Line (ROYAL), petitioners,
seek to reverse by way of <i>certiorari</i> the Order of the National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC) directing them to pay private respondent Mario
Sangil jointly and severally the sum of US $500.00 covering his salaries for
the unexpired portion of his employment contract plus 10% thereof as attorney's
fees.</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 22 May 1990
respondent Mario Sangil signed an employment contract with petitioner SINGA in
behalf of its foreign principal ROYAL of Piraeus, Greece.  He was hired to work on board the passenger
cruise vessel <i>Crown Odyssey</i> for twelve (12) months as utility
man/assistant steward with a basic monthly salary of US $50.00, plus tips.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 2 June 1990
he left the country to board the <i>Crown Odyssey</i> in pursuance of his
contract of employment.  When Mario
Sangil boarded the vessel he was unaware that there was an existing animosity
on board between the Filipino crew and the Greek crew.  Thus, on 20 July 1990, at around 9:00 o'clock
in the morning, while the passengers of the luxury liner were disembarking in
Stockholm, Sweden, a heated argument occurred between private respondent Sangil
and Greek deck steward Athanasius "Thanasi" Zakkas which resulted in
a scuffle between the two.  Zakkas
pushed respondent Sangil who fell hitting his head against the steel molding of
the door .  He suffered a cut in the
head which had to be stitched by the ship doctor.  He was then given three (3) days off from work during which he
went to the Philippine Embassy in Stockholm and reported the incident to Consul
Eduardo V. Aro.  On the same day, Sangil
was accompanied back to his ship by Consul Aro.  Sangil informed Ship Captain Yannis Katraz that he was leaving
the ship because of his head injury and of his fear that further trouble may
erupt between him and the Greeks on board.  Since he was still dizzy, he was brought to the Sabbatsberg Hospital in
Stockholm where he was confined from 20 to 21 July 1990 for observation.  That same afternoon of 20 July 1990 <i>Crown
Odyssey</i> left for Copenhagen, Denmark, without him.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The following
day, upon his discharge from the hospital, respondent Sangil went back to the
Philippine Embassy in Stockholm and executed an affidavit before Consul Aro
narrating how Zakkas and the other Greeks continuously ridiculed him, calling
him names, such as <i>malaca,</i> which means son of a prostitute.</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">”  The night before the incident,  Zakkas even threatened to pour hot coffee on his head.  The following morning, while he was busy washing
the alleyway of the crew deck, Zakkas started cursing him again resulting in
the altercation where he sustained a cut on the scalp.  On 24 July 1990 he was repatriated to the
Philippines.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 6 March 1991
respondent Sangil filed before the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA)
a complaint for illegal dismissal and payment of wages covering the unexpired
portion of his contract, overtime pay plus attorney's fees.  On 20 March 1992 the POEA dismissed the
complaint for lack of merit on the ground that respondent Sangil
"voluntarily signed off from the vessel."</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 14 December
1994 the NLRC on appeal reversed the POEA Decision and ordered petitioners  "to pay Mario Sangil jointly and
severally his salary for ten (10) months at US $50.00 a month or the sum of US
$500.00 covering his salary for the unexpired  portion of his employment contract x x x as well as attorney'  fees of 10% thereof."</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> His claim for overtime pay and tips
was dismissed for  "lack of
basis."</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On 20 January
1995 petitioners moved for a reconsideration of the NLRC Order, but the motion
was denied on 6 February 1995 for lack of merit.  Hence the instant petition.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Petitioners
argue that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion and seriously erred "in
stretching, at various points, what the evidence simply presented and
disclosed,"</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> in effect disregarding the rules of
evidence pertaining to legal presumptions and the doctrine of <i>res ipsa
loquitur.</i>  They contend that there
can be no illegal dismissal because the incident was respondent Sangil's own
doing, and his refusal to go back to the vessel was voluntary as evidenced by
his affidavit drawn before the Consul of the Philippine Embassy in
Stockholm.  They aver that respondent
Sangil was responsible for the whole incident as it was he who went into a rage
and leaped at the Greek who had to push him away in self-defense.  And because there was water on the floor, he
slipped and hit his head on the steel molding of the door. Petitioners maintain
that they had nothing to do with the incident, and that it was in fact
respondent Sangil who voluntarily left the ship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">We are not
impressed.  On the contrary, we find the
conclusion of the NLRC supported by the evidence.  Thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">x x x  this entry in the Logbook Abstract explains how the complainant
got injured in the head.  The
above-quoted entry says that complainant was "pushed and fell down and
suffered scalp trauma."  So someone
pushed complainant.  Complainant did
not therefore slip and hit his head against the tight door molding as alleged
by respondents which was relied upon by the POEA Administrator in this appealed
Decision.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">So no
less than the ship's Logbook Abstract tend to support complainant's allegation
that he is not the aggressor but a mere victim.  This in turn explains why Athanasius "Thanasi" Zakkas
was fetched from the ship by the police in Stockholm for questioning.</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">It is thus clear
that based on the ship's Logbook Abstract, respondent Sangil did not slip but
was actually pushed by the Greek deck steward causing the former to fall and
sustain an injury.  And while it may be
argued that the incident may have been a personal matter between respondent
Sangil and the Greek deck steward, it could have simply been avoided had the
ship captain been more vigilant in the supervision of his crew.  For, in his affidavit drawn before the
Philippine Consul, respondent Sangil narrated that he had earlier complained to
the captain of the abuses of the Greeks, but the captain did not only ignore
him but blamed him instead for joining the ship.  The captain, as the general agent of the shipowner, could thus be
held responsible for failing to make the workplace safe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Corollarily, the
contention of petitioners that respondent Sangil voluntarily quit and was not
illegally dismissed is without merit.  We defer to the findings of the NLRC - <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since
complainant is not the aggressor, and since he figured a head injury, he is
then afraid to go back to the ship and to mix with his aggressor.  This apprehension or fear is normal to an
ordinary prudent individual and is tantamount to self-preservation.  Therefore, his decision to leave the ship <i>"Crown
Odyssey"</i> is not voluntary.  He
did not leave  the  ship  out  of  his own free will but his departure was precipitated by
fear.  Without that incident on 20 July
1990 he would have no reason not to go back to the ship but with that incident,
he fears for his life and limb.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In People's
Security, Inc. v. NLRC we said that "constructive dismissal exists when
there is a quitting because continued employment  is  rendered  impossible,  unreasonable  or  unlikely  x  x x  x"</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">” Then in Philippine Advertising
Counselors, Inc. v. NLRC we held that "[c]onstructive dismissal, however,
does not always involve such kinds of diminution; an act of clear
discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer may become so
unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by
him except to forego his continued employment."</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In the instant
case, respondent Sangil quit because he feared for his life and his fear was
well founded.  He already figured in an
incident with the much taller, bigger and heavier Zakkas who had been
intimidating him.  He already suffered
a cut in his head.   Earlier, Zakkas
threatened to pour hot coffee on his head.</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Indeed, the intense undercurrent
between the Filipinos and the Greeks that could erupt into violence at the
slightest provocation was apparent as manifested by the writings in blood on
the wall of the word <i>"magkaisa,"</i> as witnessed by another Greek
steward on the day of the incident.  And, Sangil could not get any protection from the Greek ship captain,
not even the slightest assurance of safety from him.  In fine, the decision  of  respondent  Sangil  to  leave  the ship was not voluntary at all but was
impelled by a legitimate desire for self-preservation.  He did not leave the ship out of his own
free will, whim or caprice but was moved by fear for his life.  Without that incident on 20 July 1990
where he was pushed by the Greek Zakkas, respondent Sangil would not have had
any reason not to return to his ship.</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> After all, he must have worked so
hard to get on board </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">"Crown Odyssey."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Consequently, we
find no reason to reverse the findings of the NLRC as the well-settled rule
confines the original and exclusive jurisdiction of this Court in the review of
decisions of the NLRC to the issue of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction.  As
we have repeatedly said, grave abuse of discretion is committed only when the
judgment is rendered in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner,
which is not true in the present case.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Certainly, an
abuse of discretion does not necessarily arise just because NLRC reversed the
decision of POEA.  Neither does  variance in the evidentiary assessment of
NLRC and that of POEA warrants, as a matter of course, another full review of
the facts.  The decision or order of the
NLRC so long as it is not bereft of support from the records deserves respect
from this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, the petition is DENIED.  The appealed decision of the NLRC directing
