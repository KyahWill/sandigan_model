He did not deny Ebon's claim that they were acquainted for he used to work as driver of Roman Mercado. However, when his driver's license expired on January 20, 1993, he went home to Bukidnon.&nbsp; On April 20, 1993, he went back to Cagayan de Oro City and stayed at the residence of his sister, Carmen Tan, who lives in Macasandig, Cagayan de Oro City.&nbsp; At 4:00 p.m. of the same day, Carmen asked him to buy snacks at a nearby store. While buying the snacks, he heard a shot and when he looked around, he saw a man lying on the ground.&nbsp; Two men in civilian clothes poked their guns at him. One of them asked him whether he was a companion of the man lying on the ground.&nbsp; He said no.&nbsp; The two men brought him to the police&nbsp; station. The man lying on the ground was brought to the hospital.&nbsp; At the police station, the two men asked him to confess whether he was a companion of the person who was shot.&nbsp; He said no.&nbsp; They asked him whether he was one of those who robbed Ismael Ebon.&nbsp; Again, he said no.&nbsp; He was questioned for about an hour during which he was hit "at the right ands left breast, at the right and left ribs, and at the left side of [his] face." Afterwards, he was locked up in jail. In the morning of the following day, he was investigated and mauled for two hours.&nbsp; Again, he was asked whether Orlando Labtan was his companion.&nbsp; He insisted that he was not Labtan's companion for he does not even know him.&nbsp; After the investigation, a policeman approached him and brought a piece of paper for him to sign.&nbsp; He asked whether it was possible for him to read the contents.&nbsp; The policeman answered, "No need, just sign so that we can finish it."&nbsp; They then started to maul him.&nbsp; He was forced to sign the paper.&nbsp; At around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of April 22, 1993, he was brought to the office of Atty. Pepito Chavez.&nbsp; He was told to sit down while Atty. Chavez signed the papers.&nbsp; He did not know what was happening.&nbsp; Atty Chavez did not even talk to him before signing the document. He was then brought back to jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Finding the sworn statement executed by Feliciano credible, the trial court convicted him and imposed the following penalties:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, this court hereby finds accused Henry Feliciano guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal by direct participation in the crime of robbery with homicide and hereby sentences the accused to reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the offended party the sum of P50,000.00 and to pay the offended party the sum of P35,000.00 representing funeral expenses and to pay the cost.<br><br>This court hereby finds also the accused Henry Feliciano guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of highway robbery committed on March 28, 1993 and sentences the accused to an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years of prision mayor as the minimum term to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months of reclusion temporal in its minimum period as the maximum term and to indemnify Roman S.

If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.&nbsp; These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.</b><br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; No torture, force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used against him.&nbsp; Secret detention places, solitary, incommunicado, or other similar forms of detention are prohibited.<br><br><b>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this or the preceding section shall be inadmissible against him."</b></blockquote>In People v. Macam<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>, the rational for the guarantee, was explained in this wise,<br><blockquote>"Historically, the counsel guarantee was intended to assure the assistance of counsel at the trial, inasmuch as the accused `was confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor.'&nbsp; However, as the result of the changes in the patterns of police investigation, today's accused confronts both expert adversaries and the judicial system well before his trial begins (U.S. <i>v</i>. Ash, 413 U.S. 300, 37 L Ed 2d 619, 93 S Ct 2568 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1973]</sup>).&nbsp; <b>It is therefore appropriate to extend the counsel guarantee to critical stages of prosecution even before the trial.&nbsp; The law enforcement machinery at present involves critical confrontations of the accused by the prosecution at pre-trial proceedings `where the result might well settle the accused's fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality.'"</b></blockquote>Thus, in <b>People <i>v</i>.

Deniega<b>,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><b> </b>expounding on the constitutional requirement that the lawyer provided be <b>"competent and independent,"</b> we stated that:<br><blockquote>"It is noteworthy that the modifiers <i>competent and independent</i> were terms absent in all organic laws previous to the 1987 Constitution.&nbsp; Their addition in the fundamental law of 1987 was meant to stress the primacy accorded to the voluntariness of the choice, under the uniquely stressful conditions of a custodial investigation, by according the accused, deprived of normal conditions guaranteeing individual autonomy, an informed judgment based on the choices given to him by a competent and independent lawyer.<br><br>"Thus, the lawyer called to be present during such investigation should be as far as possible, the choice of the individual undergoing questioning.&nbsp; <b>If the lawyer were one furnished in the accused's behalf, it is important that he should be competent and independent, i.e., that he is willing to fully safeguard the constitutional rights of the accused, as distinguished from one&nbsp; who would merely be giving a routine, peremptory and meaningless recital of the individual's constitutional rights.&nbsp; In People <i>v</i>. Basay, this Court stressed that an accused's right to be informed of the right to remain silent and to counsel `contemplates the transmission of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.'</b><br><br><b>"Ideally, therefore, a lawyer engaged for an individual facing custodial investigation (if the latter could not afford one) `should be engaged by the accused (himself), or by the latter's relative or person authorized by him to engage an attorney or by the court, upon proper petition of the accused or person authorized by the accused to file such petition.&nbsp; Lawyers engaged by the police, whatever testimonials are given as proof of their probity and supposed independence, are generally suspect, as in many areas, the relationship between lawyers and law enforcement authorities can be symbiotic.'"</b></blockquote>In People v. Sahagun<b>,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we stated that the constitutional requirement that a lawyer should be <b>independent</b> was not complied with when a lawyer who just happened to be following-up a case at the NBI was asked to counsel the accused:<br><blockquote>"[T]he counselling given by Atty. Dizon to Villareal was not sufficiently protective of Villareal's rights as an accused as contemplated by the Constitution.&nbsp; To start with, Atty. Dizon is not really known to Villareal. He was requested to act as counsel because he happened to be at the NBI following-up a client's case.&nbsp; Given that circumstance, it cannot be expected that Atty. Dizon would give an advice to Villareal that would offend the agent conducting the investigation.&nbsp; Thus, it appears that Atty. Dizon did no more than recite to Villareal his constitutional rights.&nbsp; He made no independent effort to determine whether Villareal's confessions were free and voluntary.&nbsp; x x x . He did not inquire from Villareal how he was treated in the last 24-hours.&nbsp; He did not seek any of Villareal's relatives or friends to find out if he has any defense which Villareal was not free to disclose due to his confinement.<br><br>"Atty. Dizon's lack of vigilance as a counsel is likewise underscored by the fact that he himself testified that Villareal gave his confession under the impression that he was only a witness and not an accused in the case.&nbsp; This revelation should have jolted Atty. Dizon and should have driven him to exert extra efforts to find out whether Villareal was tricked in making his confession.&nbsp; Again, he did not take an extra effort."</blockquote>In People v. Januario,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the main evidence relied upon for the conviction of appellants was their own extrajudicial confessions which admittedly were extracted and signed in the presence and with the assistance of <b>a lawyer who was applying for work in the NBI</b>. We held that<br><blockquote>"(s)uch counsel cannot in any wise be considered <b>"independent"</b> because he cannot be expected to work against the interest of a police agency he was hoping to join, as a few months later he in fact was admitted into its work force. For this violation of their constitutional right to independent counsel, appellants deserve acquittal.&nbsp; After the exclusion of their tainted confessions, no sufficient and credible evidence remains in the Court's records to overturn another constitutional right:&nbsp; the right to be presumed innocent of any crime until the contrary is proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>"Perfunctorily informing a confessant of his constitutional rights, asking him if he wants to avail of the services of counsel and telling him that he could ask for counsel if he so desires or that one could be provided him at his request, are simply not in compliance with the constitutional mandate.&nbsp; In this case, appellant Canape was merely told of his constitutional rights and posthaste, asked whether he was willing to confess.&nbsp; His affirmative answer may not, by any means, be interpreted as waiver of his right to counsel of his own choice."</blockquote>We also find that Atty. Chavez notarized the sworn statement seriously compromised his independence.&nbsp; By doing so, he vouched for the regularity of the circumstances surrounding the taking of the sworn statement by the police.&nbsp; He cannot serve as counsel of the accused and the police at the same time. There was a serious conflict of interest on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In People v. de Jesus<b>,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> we stated that an <b>independent counsel</b> cannot be a special counsel, public or private prosecutor, <b>counsel of the police</b>, or a municipal attorney whose interest is admittedly adverse to the accused.<br><br>We have examined the three-page sworn statement allegedly executed by Feliciano and we failed to see any badge of spontaneity and credibility to it. It shows signs of what we call <b>stereotype advice</b> to which we have already called the attention of police officers.&nbsp; In <b>People <i>v</i>. Jarra</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>"[T]he <b>stereotyped `advice'</b> appearing in practically all extrajudicial confessions which are later repudiated has assumed the nature of `legal form' or mode.&nbsp; Police investigators either automatically type it together with the curt `Opo' as the answer or ask the accused to sign it or even copy it in their handwriting.&nbsp; Its tired, punctilious, fixed and artificially stately style does not create an impression of voluntariness or even understanding on the part of the accused. The showing of a spontaneous, free and unconstrained giving up of a right is missing."</blockquote>Since April 27, 1992 when Republic Act No. 7438<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> was enacted, the constitutional rights of persons under custodial investigation have been further operationalized:<br><blockquote>"Section 2.&nbsp; Rights of Persons Arrested, Detained, or Under Custodial Investigation; Duties of Public Officers.<br><br>(a) Any person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall at all times be assisted by counsel.<br><br>(b) Any public officer or employee, or anyone acting under his order or in his place, who arrests, detains or investigates any person for the commission of an offense shall inform the latter, in a language known to and understood by him, of his rights to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel, preferably of his own choice, who shall at all times be allowed to confer privately with the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation.&nbsp; If such person cannot afford the services of his own counsel, he must be provided with a competent and independent counsel by the investigating officer.<br><br>(c) The custodial investigation report shall be reduced to writing by the investigating officer, provided that before such report is signed, or thumbmarked if the person arrested does not know how to read and write, it shall be read and adequately explained to him by his counsel or by the assisting counsel provided by the investigating officer in the language or dialect known to such arrested or detained person, otherwise, such investigation report shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever.<br><br>(d) Any extrajudicial confession made by a person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall be in writing and signed by such person in the presence of his counsel or in the latter's absence, upon a valid waiver, and in the presence of any of the parents, older brothers and sisters, his spouses, the municipal mayor, the municipal judge, district school supervisor, or priest or minister of the gospel as chosen by him; otherwise, such extrajudicial confession shall be inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding.<br><br>(e) Any waiver by a person arrested or detained under the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, or under custodial investigation, shall be in writing and signed by the person in the presence of his counsel; otherwise such waiver shall be null and void and of no effect.<br><br>(f) Any person arrested or detained or under custodial investigation shall be allowed visits by or conferences with any member of his immediate family, or any medical doctor or priest or religious minister chosen by him or by any member of his immediate family or by his counsel, or by any national non-governmental organization duly accredited by the Commission on Human Rights or by any international non-governmental organization duly accredited by the Office of the President.&nbsp; The person's immediate family shall include his or her spouse, fiance or fiancee, parent or child, brother or sister, grandparent or grandchild, uncle or aunt, nephew or niece, and guardian or ward."</blockquote>Consequently, it is disappointing to see how up to now some police officers still sidestep the constitutional mandate, the consequence of which is all too familiar - the inadmissibility of the statement, confession, or admission taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In <b>People v. dela Cruz,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> we stated that "a confession made in an atmosphere characterized by deficiencies in informing the accused of all rights to which he is entitled would be rendered valueless and inadmissible, perforated, as it is, by non-compliance with the procedural and substantive safeguards to which an accused is entitled under the Bill of Rights and as now further implemented and ramified by statutory law."<br><br>On the charge of <b>robbery with homicide</b>, the only evidence presented by the prosecution was the sworn statement which we have found inadmissible. Thus, we are forced to absolve accused-appellant of this charge.&nbsp; With respect to the charge of <b>highway robbery</b>, the prosecution presented the testimony of Ismael Ebon.&nbsp; However, Ebon failed to identify Feliciano as the perpetrator when he reported to the police immediately after the incident:<br><blockquote>"CASE NO. 2143 dated 0030 H 29 March 93.&nbsp; Ismael Ibon y Petalcorin, 27 m(sic), of Reyes Bugo, CDO, driver of PUJ Bugo Liner bearing Plate No. KBJ-748, and Christopher Impoc y Amba, 16, s(sic), of Zone 4, Tablon, this City, jointly came to this OKK-CIS and reported that they were allegedly victimized by two <b>unidentified</b> robbers who was (sic) armed with a (sic) knives and taken from the possession of the above driver his cash money P700.00 and took our stereo Pioneer Brand with Booster and twitter.&nbsp; The incident was (sic) occurred at Agusan, this City, and the suspect was desembarked (sic) at Camaman-an, this City at 10:30 p.m., this date."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>Ismael Ebon and accused-appellant Feliciano are acquainted.&nbsp; There is no reason for Ebon to withhold the identity of the perpetrator except for the fact that he was not certain of it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Consequently, there is no evidence pointing to Feliciano as one of those who held-up Ebon.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the decision of the trial court is <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Henry Feliciano is <span style="font-weight: bold;">ACQUITTED</span> on both charges of robbery with homicide and highway robbery due to lack of evidence to sustain a conviction.
