				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 103,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in Criminal Case No. Q-96-67171, convicted accused-appellant of the crime of Rape and sentenced him to death by lethal injection. The case is now before us on automatic review.<br><br>Accused-appellant is a 30 year old Libyan national, a student of Oriental Institute in its electronic technician's course, a resident of Lagro Subdivision, Quezon City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and married to a Filipina nurse working in Libya<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> with whom he has a one-and-a-half year old son.<br><br>Complainant is Gina Rozon y Freo, aged 17, having been born on May 30, 1979<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in Sta. Barbara, Bulusan, Sorsogon. At the time of the alleged offense she was newly graduated from high school. Her complaint told of a harrowing tale of abduction, starting from the Lagro Post Office and ending in her alleged detention for ten days at appellant's house where he forced her to take drugged drinks, while he repeatedly abused her.<br><br>The facts of the case as found by the trial court and on record are as follows:<br><br>Prior to the incident, complainant was on vacation and staying with her aunt, Francia. Her aunt's family occupied the second floor of an apartment unit in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Appellant and his son occupied the ground floor. Being neighbors, Gina and appellant became acquainted with each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> However, on July 14, 1996, appellant transferred to another house in Lagro Subdivision, Quezon City.<br><br>In the morning of July 17, 1996, complainant asked permission from her aunt to mail a letter at the Lagro Post Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> By chance, she saw appellant walking behind her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Suddenly, appellant grabbed her hand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> placed his right arm on her back and pushed her inside a waiting tricycle that was parked some meters away from the "paradahan" of tricycles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> While holding complainant with one arm, he barricaded the tricycle door with his other hand. The tricycle sped off.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Complainant was overcome by nervousness and was unable to shout for help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The tricycle driver stopped in front of a house in Lagro Subdivision. Appellant asked complainant to step down and pushed open the gate of the house and asked her to get inside. He pushed her towards a chair, then padlocked the room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Appellant got a glass of softdrink and forced Gina to drink it. Thereafter, Gina became drowsy and fell asleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She woke up the next morning and stood up. To her utter shock, she saw herself completely naked in bed, feeling weak and her vagina in pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> She saw plenty of blood on the bedsheet. Because she was still feeling weak, she fell down on the bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Appellant later entered the room and asked if she was all right. She pleaded with him to let her go home. Appellant did not respond, but stood up and changed the bedsheets. He then left and locked the door. After about an hour, appellant came back and brought with him macaroni and orange juice. Complainant noticed some white sediments floating on the orange juice, but appellant told her they were vitamins and forced her to drink the juice. This caused her to fall asleep again for a long time. When she woke up afterwards, she was naked again and her vagina was in pain. Appellant was inside the room sitting on a chair. Complainant got the bedsheet to cover her body, and appellant went out of the room. Complainant opened the window jalousies in the hope of calling the attention of the neighbors but appellant, who was outside fetching water, saw her and went back to the room with a kitchen knife. Appellant pushed a cabinet to cover the window and threatened to kill her if the neighbors saw her. Drained, she sat on the bed. Appellant went out and came back with some juice and forced her to drink again, causing her to fall asleep once more. When she woke up, she tried to open the bedroom door, but it was locked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> She went back to the bed and again fell asleep. Thereafter, appellant came into the room and fed her Jollibee chicken chili wings with rice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Appellant changed his clothes and went out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> She then attempted to go out of the room but appellant was outside, in the sala. Appellant pulled her back to the room, then poked a knife at her, threatening to kill her if she went out of the room again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Appellant then asked her to drink two types of medicine, one was Propan and the other a white tablet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> She did not want to drink the white tablet but appellant pushed it inside her mouth for her to swallow it. Then she fell asleep and when she woke up, her private part was in renewed pain ("Mahapding-mahapdi at nanghihina").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> During her incarceration in the house of appellant, he asked her to take a bath around three times and dressed her in his clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> She became so weak ("hinang-hina") that she could hardly shout for help. Nor could she go to the comfort room without being carried by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> When she urinated, her private part was painful and when she checked it, she saw a big wound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>At one point, appellant went inside the room and told complainant that her aunt was outside, but threatened her not to shout, otherwise, he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> She was then shaking with fear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Appellant changed his clothes and went out. When he came back, he told her that if her aunt came back, he would also kill her aunt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>When complainant failed to return home on July 17, 1996, her aunt (Francia) became worried. She called up their relatives asking for her, but no one knew her whereabouts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Francia told her husband, Joseph, about her suspicion that appellant might have something to do with complainant's disappearance because the aunt had seen him suspiciously looking at their house prior thereto. Joseph and a brother of complainant immediately went to appellant's house in Lagro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They saw that the doors and windows of appellant's house were padlocked,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> so they knocked on the main door. Appellant peeped through the windows and told them to enter through the side door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They informed him about complainant's disappearance, but he denied any knowledge regarding her whereabouts. They nonetheless noticed that the house was in disarray. One of the rooms was padlocked. Suspecting that complainant was inside the padlocked room, they insisted on getting inside, but appellant warned them against intruding into his privacy. Fearing that they would be accused of trespassing, they immediately left, but reported complainant's disappearance to the nearby Lagro police station. They also reported their suspicion about appellant's possible involvement in her disappearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The police were alerted and together with complainant's relatives, they went to appellant's house, but no one opened the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On the tenth day of her abduction (July 26, 1996), appellant informed her that there were policemen outside. For reasons known only to appellant, he immediately got some love letters from his cabinet. He ordered her to copy them on several pieces of paper and affix her signature in every letter to make it appear that the same were her love letters to him. She complied, literally at knife-point. Only then did appellant release her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Appellant waited until there were no people outside the house, then he hailed a cab and brought complainant somewhere in Blumentritt, Manila, where he hailed another taxi. He boarded her in the taxi, paid the fare, and instructed the driver to bring her to Lagro. He told her that he would be going to the embassy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Though still very weak, complainant went to her brother, Arnold, who worked in a barber shop in Lagro and told him what happened. He then went to fetch their uncle for help. Together, they went home to the aunt's house in San Jose del Monte, where they arrived at around 8:00 in the evening. The aunt asked complainant what happened and where she had been, but she merely cried and cried and cried. When asked during the trial to describe complainant's appearance at that time, the aunt said that she looked dazed and very tired. ("Pagod na pagod, mga mata ay maga at parang wala sa sarili.") Complainant still felt very weak but she narrated to her relatives her ordeal. The following morning, accompanied with her aunt and uncle, complainant reported the incident to the Lagro police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Then, they went to the NBI for her medical examination.<br><br>On August 2, 1996, complainant filed charges against appellant for the crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned complainant accuses SHAREFF ALI EL AKHTAR of the crime of FORCIBLE ABDUCTION WITH RAPE, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 17th day of July 1996, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, an Arab National, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously with lewd design forcibly abduct one GINA ROZON Y FREO, a minor, 17 years of age, a student, by forcing her to board a tricycle along Assession Road, Post Office, Barangay Pasong Putik, Quezon City, and brought her to his apartment also at Lagro, Quezon City, where accused locked her, then made her drink Coke, a softdrink, that made her feel dizzy and thereafter accused sexually abused her repeatedly up to the time she was released on July 26, 1996, all against her will and without her consent, to the damage and prejudice of said GINA ROZON Y FREO.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>Quezon City, Philippines, July 30, 1996."<br><br>Appellant entered a plea of "not guilty" on arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>During trial, the prosecution presented the following witnesses: complainant herself, her aunt Francia Rozon, her uncle Joseph Rozon, and Dr. Erlinda R. Marfil, the Chief Psychiatrist of the National Bureau of Investigation.<br><br>The defense presented the appellant and his counsel, Atty. Manuel de Jesus. Appellant's version of the incident, as set out in his Brief, is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><blockquote>"[O]n July 17, 1996 - the date of the supposed forcible abduction with rape - he was in the Libyan Embassy where he repaired the Embassy's television set (t.v.) (tsn, pp. 8-12, April 10, 1997). It was a certain Mr. Aghila Gheldan, head of the Consular section, who requested him to do such work. He left his residence at the Lagro Subdivision at around 8:00 o'clock in the morning, and finished the repair at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening. (tsn, pp. 4-9, April 17, 1997). Appellant also submitted a Certification dated August 19, 1996, signed by aforementioned Mr. Gheldan, that the accused "has visited the Bureau (referring to the Libyan People's Bureau, or the Libyan Embassy) twice (d), dated July 12 and July 17, 1996 respectively") Exh. 36, p. 86, records).<br><br>Appellant also testified that before he transferred residence to Lagro Subdivision, Quezon City on July 14, 1996, he lived in the ground floor of an apartment in Pecsonville Subdivision, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. The complainant lived with her aunt Francia Rozon in the second floor of the same apartment and it was in that apartment that appellant came to know complainant since September 3, 1995 (TSN, pp. 10-11, April 10, 1997; pp. 30-32, April 24, 1997). Appellant likewise claimed that the complainant is his girlfriend and that as a consequence of that relationship, he had had several sexual contacts with her prior to his transfer to the Lagro Subdivision. As evidence of that relationship, he submitted several love letters which were signed by the complainant (TSN, pp. 10-16, 22, April 10, 1997; Exhibits "3" to "35," inclusive, pp. 196-A to 231, folder of exhibits). Asked why Gina filed the case against him, he answered that "Auntie and Uncle discovered our relations and Gina was compelled to file this case," and "they were asking P500,000 from me in order to drop the case" (TSN, pp. 21-22, April 10, 1997)."</blockquote>On July 24, 1997, after due trial, the trial court rendered judgment, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the court renders judgment finding accused SHAREFF ALI AKHTAR GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of rape charged in this case and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH by lethal injection.<br><br>On the civil aspect, the accused is ordered to pay GINA ROZON y FREO the sum of P50,000.00 as compensatory damages and P100,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>In his bid for acquittal, appellant now makes the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT NOTWITHSTANDING ITS IMPROBABILITIES AND INCONSISTENCIES WITH ORDINARY HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EXPERIENCE, THEREBY IMPAIRING HER OWN CREDIBILITY AS WELL.<br><br></li><li> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN MANIFESTING BIAS AGAINST THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AND THEREBY TOTALLY DISREGARDING HIS DEFENSES.<br><br></li><li> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE AND IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF DEATH, INSTEAD OF ACQUITTING HIM.</li></ol></blockquote>Appellant assails the credibility of the complainant considering her conduct during the alleged abduction wherein she did not even resist nor shout for help from the tricycle driver or the other people around the highly-populated area of Lagro during her alleged captivity inside his house. He stresses that she made no strong efforts to thwart him from making her drink the supposedly drugged softdrinks or juice. He contends that they already had prior sexual relations since they were "sweethearts".<br><br>It is well settled doctrine that in a prosecution for rape, the complainant's credibility becomes the single most important issue. Thus, if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Assessing the credibility of the witnesses is a function that is best discharged by trial courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Factual findings of trial courts are accorded the highest respect unless it is shown that certain facts of value have been plainly overlooked which if considered could affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> After a thorough review of the records of the case, we see no reason to depart from this rule.<br><br>Complainant's failure to ask for help when she was abducted, or to escape from appellant's house during her detention, should not be construed as a manifestation of consent to the acts done by appellant. For her life was on the line. Against the armed threats and physical abuses of appellant, she had no defense. Moreover, at a time of grave peril, to shout could literally be to court disaster. Her silence was born out of fear for her safety, to say the least, not a sign of approval.<br><br>Behavioral psychology, moreover, teaches us that people react to similar situations dissimilarly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> There is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident. The workings of the human mind when placed under emotional stress are unpredictable. This Court indeed has not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave immediately after she has been abused. This experience is relative and may be dealt with in any way by the victim depending on the circumstances, but her credibility should not be tainted by any modicum of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, physical resistance is not the sole test to determine whether or not a woman involuntary succumbed to the lust of an accused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> particularly where accused employed drugs in order to render the woman unconscious during coitus.<br><br>In <i>People v. Santiago</i>, 197 SCRA 556, 566-567 (1991), we ruled that-<br><blockquote>"The appellant's submission that the victim failed to raise an outcry or offer serious resistance when she was abducted and later raped has no merit. The suggestion of the victim that she was drugged after drinking the lemon juice given by the appellant explains why the victim was unable to resist the accused effectively or make an outcry. While no chemical test was undertaken to concretely prove that the juice she drank actually contained drugs, the fact remains uncontroverted as appellant did not even take the witness stand in order to deny that after the victim drank the lemon juice already prepared for her, she began to feel weak and dizzy. x x x. It is clear that the acts of appellant were deliberately done to deprive the victim of reason and the will to resist his sexual assault. The effect is thus similar to that of violence in overcoming resistance with which she could very well have successfully thwarted the lustful act. Appellant undoubtedly had clearly committed the crime charged by depriving complainant of reason to be able to have carnal knowledge of her without the latter having in least shown any sign of consent. (People v. Bautista, No. L-49778, January 27, 1981, 102 SCRA 483). In a rape of a woman deprived of reason or who is unconscious, the victim has no will. In that case, it is not necessary that she should offer real opposition or constant resistance to the sexual intercourse."</blockquote>Moreover, the physical examination of her person supports the testimony of the victim that she has been raped. The medico-legal report dated July 26, 1996, by Dr. Floreto D. Arzala, Jr. of National Bureau of Investigation reveals that, while there were no extra-genital physical injuries on complainant, recent genital trauma was present (Exhibit "C"). After the examination, the medico-legal officer told complainant that her private part had lacerations ("Maraming gasgas at mga sugat.") whereupon she again burst into tears.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Physical injuries such as bruises or bleeding tend to confirm the fact that a violent assault did take place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Further, after the medico-legal department of the NBI had referred complainant to the Psychiatric Section of the NBI for a neuro-psychiatric examination on December 6, 1996, witness Dra. Erlinda Marfil testified that as a result of said examination, she concluded that complainant was suffering from post-traumatic stress reaction as a result of what happened to her person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Appellant claims that on the day of the abduction, July 17, 1996, he was at the Libyan embassy fixing a television set. He even presented a certification that he indeed visited the embassy on said date. However, this proferred defense of alibi could not overcome the overwhelming evidence against him. Alibi is inherently a weak defense whose value loses a lot when time and distance do not make the imputed offense impossible of commission. In this case, more than a certification of an embassy visit is needed to overthrow the positive evidence on hand.<br><br>Appellant makes much of the love letters allegedly sent by complainant to him with her protestations of love and devotion. Complainant's testimony negated this contrived posture known as the "sweetheart defense". Even assuming that appellant and complainant were lovers, however, this fact alone would not negate the commission of rape, especially where coitus occurred when the woman was drugged. We have repeatedly declared that "a love affair does not justify rape, for the beloved cannot be sexually violated against her will."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> A man does not have an unbridled license to subject his beloved to his carnal desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> By asserting the existence of such a relationship, appellant seeks to prove that the victim willingly participated in the sexual act. But she did not. Complainant was just a former neighbor, not a lover of the appellant. The evidence in this case clearly shows that she could not resist the sexual assault upon her person because she was made to drink liquids which rendered her unconscious and a defenseless prey to the repeated sexual assault of appellant. The situation in this case does not speak of consensual love but of criminal lust which could not be disguised by the so-called "sweetheart defense".<br><br>While appellant was charged with the crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape, he was convicted by the trial court of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of R.A. No. 7659 which provides:<br><blockquote>"Art. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed. </i>Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>(1) By using force or intimidation;<br><br>(2) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>(3) when the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented. x x x"</blockquote>As to the crime committed by the appellant, we have held that "forcible abduction is absorbed in the crime of rape if the main objective of the appellant is to rape the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As can be gleaned from the testimony of complainant, she was raped by appellant no less than three times. The first rape occurred as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">FISCAL RAMOS: After that what else did he do?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">COMPLAINANT: He forced me to drink the coke.

No. 7659, wherein the penalty for simple rape is<i> reclusion perpetua.</i> Appellant used the knife not to consummate the crime of rape but to threaten Gina not to leave the bedroom where she was locked up. Hence, we find appellant herein guilty of three (3) counts of simple rape.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment of the court <i>a quo</i> finding accused-appellant Shareff Ali El Akhtar guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATIONS</b> that the death sentence imposed by the court <i>a quo</i> is hereby reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>for each of the three counts of rape, and that appellant is hereby ordered to pay complainant the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity and P100,000.00 as moral damages for each count of rape.<br><br>Costs against appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Purisima, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes,</i> and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Puno,</i> and <i>Panganiban, JJ.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Judge Jaime N.
