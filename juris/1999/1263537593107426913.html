				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For sheer carelessness of the prosecutors in this case in ensuring that the information contains all the essential allegations, a man who deserves no less than the supreme penalty of death for violating his own flesh and blood gets off with a sentence of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Complainant Janeth Nuñez was born on August 30, 1981 to Demetrio Nuñez and Nelia Ebay. When her mother took on a job as domestic helper in Guam, Janeth stayed on with her father and younger brother in Lower Cabantian, Buhangin, Davao City.<br><br>On January 17, 1996, at around 10:00 p.m., complainant was roused from her sleep and discovered that her shorts and panties had been taken off. Her father, whom she found beside her, touched her nipple and inserted his finger into her vagina. He also sucked her nipple. Complainant pushed her father away, whereupon he returned to bed and complainant put on her shorts and panties and went back to sleep. She woke up again later and saw her father on top of her. He inserted his penis into her vagina. She pushed him aside and felt sticky fluid spill on her thigh and vagina. When her father left, complainant just sat down and could no longer sleep.<br><br>The following day, complainant confided the incident to her classmate and her teacher, Mrs. Meliana Geradona, who reported the matter to the police. Complainant thereafter submitted herself to an examination by the Medico-Legal Officer of the Davao City Health Office, Dr. Danilo Ledesma, who found a superficial laceration on her hymen at 6:00 o'clock position.<br><br>The incident made complainant very angry at her father, so she voluntarily instituted a case which led to the filing of the following Information with the Regional Trial Court of Davao City:<br><br><center>INFORMATION</center><blockquote>The undersigned accuses the above-named persons (sic) of the felony of Rape, under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act 7659, at the instance of Janeth Ebay Nuñez, whose affidavit is hereto attached to form part of this information, committed as follows:<br><br>that on or about January 17, 1996, in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, by means of force, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of his daughter Janeth E.

This was clearly misleading because (1) a plea of guilty may only be considered as mitigating when seasonably interjected, that is, before the prosecution presents its evidence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and (2) the penalty of death is indivisible and is not affected by either aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Clearly, too, the accused was not categorically advised that his plea of guilt would not under any circumstance affect or reduce his sentence, making his re-arraignment flawed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>However, even if the plea of guilt of the accused was improvidently made, it does not work to effectively vacate the finding of guilt made by the trial court. We note that at the onset, the accused had entered a plea of not guilty but had merely changed this plea to one of guilt midway during the presentation of evidence for the prosecution. It is a settled rule that a decision based on an irregular plea may nevertheless be upheld where the judgment is supported by other adequate evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> And such other evidence supports the finding of guilt in the instant case.<br><br>First, We have the direct and straightforward testimony of Janeth recounting the violation of body and spirit she suffered from her very own father.

He did not even testify in his own behalf and merely submitted his case on the basis of the prosecution's evidence. The studied silence of the accused on the evidence for the rape amounts to an admission of the sexual congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In light of the foregoing as well as the clear, convincing and competent physical and testimonial evidence, this Court is convinced that accused has been proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br>Although the matter of the proper imposition of the penalty is not assigned as an error by the accused, nevertheless, it is a well-established rule in criminal procedure that an appeal in a criminal proceeding throws the whole case open for review and it becomes the duty of the appellate court to correct an error as may be found in the appealed judgment, whether it is made the subject of assignment of errors or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659, the death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent or victim.<br><br></li><li> When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.<br><br></li><li> When rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.<br><br></li><li> When the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.<br><br></li><li> When the offender knows that he is afflicted with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.<br><br></li><li> When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.<br><br></li><li> When by reason or on occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation.</li></ol></blockquote>Applying the aforesaid law, the trial court imposed the penalty of death upon the accused, taking into account the minority of Janeth as she was only fourteen (14) years old at the time of the incident, as well as the relationship of father and daughter between the accused and the complainant.<br><br>The penalty of death cannot be automatically imposed on the accused merely because of the trial court's appreciation of both the fact of minority and relationship, no matter how clearly established. Jurisprudence dictates that these twin facts be alleged in the Information or Complaint before the death penalty can properly be imposed.<br><br>Indeed, this Court has consistently held that the seven attendant circumstances under Section 11 of RA 7659 are in the nature of qualifying circumstances which, unlike generic aggravating circumstances that may be proved even if not alleged, cannot be proved as such unless alleged in the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Although it was established that Janeth was a minor at the time of rape, fourteen (14) years old and a grade six student, to be exact, this qualifying circumstance was not alleged in the Information.<br><br>In the recent case of <i>People v. Calayca</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the accused was also found to have raped his 15-year old daughter. As in the instant case, only the fact of relationship between the parties was alleged in the Information, namely that the victim was the daughter of the accused. The fact of minority of the victim was not. Finding the crime charged as simple rape, this Court ruled as follows -<br><blockquote>"A reading of the Information for rape filed against appellant in the present case reveals that he is merely charged with the crime of <b>simple</b> rape which warrants the imposition of the penalty of reclusion perpetua. This is so because the fact of the <b>minority of the victim</b> is not stated in the Information. What was alleged therein was only the <b>relationship of the offender</b> as the parent of the victim. Again, as we have emphasized in <b>People v. Ramos</b>, the elements of minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender <b>must concur</b>. As such, the charge of rape in the Information is not in its <b>qualified</b> form so as to fall under the special qualifying circumstances stated in Section 11 of R.A. 7659. x x x."<br><br>(emphasis copied)</blockquote>Thus, there being no allegation of minority in the Information under which accused was arraigned and tried in the case at bench, he cannot be convicted of qualified rape.<br><br>Strict application of the rule requiring the allegation of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Section 11 of R.A. 7659 was further enunciated in <i>People v. Dimapilis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> While the Information there alleged that the victim was the stepdaughter of the accused, it was not accepted as a proper allegation of the qualifying circumstance that the accused was the "common-law spouse of the parent of the victim" and the death penalty imposed by the trial court was once again reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Taking into account the growing number of cases where qualified rape under Section 11 of R.A. 7659, although proven during trial, could still not be properly penalized because of defects in the Information, We urge the prosecuting fiscals who are charged with the responsibility of preparing Informations to state with particularity the attendant circumstances provided for under Section 11 of R.A. 7659. More specifically, in qualified rape, both the fact of minority of the victim and the actual relationship between the parties, as worded in R.A. 7659, must be alleged in the Information. Otherwise, We shall continue to fail both the law and the victims whom the law have sought to protect.<br><br>We note that the affidavit of complainant Janeth Ebay Nuñez was attached to and made part of the Information in this case. In this connection, we are constrained to lay down the rule that documentary evidence, such as the affidavits of the witnesses, should not be attached to and made integral parts of an information. As we have previously held, a criminal indictment should never be formulated in a melange of accusatory allegations and evidentiary details resulting in unusual prolixity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the light of the flaw in the Information in the case at bench, the penalty of death imposed by the trial court in Criminal Case No. 36, 378-96 is reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><i>Reclusion perpetua</i> is a single indivisible penalty which, under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, must be applied regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the crime. Thus, while relationship is aggravating in crimes against chastity such as rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this circumstance will not affect the imposable penalty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> since <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is a single indivisible penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Conversely, neither may the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilt affect such single indivisible penalty.<br><br>Finally, We note that while the trial court awarded P30,000.00 to Janeth in the form of moral damages, it failed to impose any civil indemnity for the rape committed. Such civil indemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape and is distinct from and should not be denominated as moral damages which are based on different jural foundations and assessed by the court in the exercise of its sound discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> While the amount for civil indemnity has been raised in <i>People v. Victor</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><i> </i>from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00 if the rape is committed or is qualified by any of the circumstances which under the law would justify the imposition of the death penalty, We are constrained to set the civil indemnity award to P50,000.00 since in this case, the rape charged and proved is not qualified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Moral damages may, nevertheless, still be awarded in favor of Janeth since it has also been resolved that in crimes of rape, such form of damages may be additionally awarded to the victim without need for pleading or proof of the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It is assumed that the offended party has suffered moral injuries entitling her to the award of such damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Exemplary damages may also be adjudicated against the accused when a crime is attended by an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Here, such aggravating circumstance justifying an award of exemplary damages is the relationship between the accused and his victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> We follow the award of P25,000.00 for exemplary damages set by this Court in <i>People v.
