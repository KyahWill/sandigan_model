				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">It is an elementary rule in criminal law that where two indivisible penalties are prescribed for an offense and there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the crime, the lesser penalty shall be applied. Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, prescribes the penalty range of "<i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death" for murder. There being no generic aggravating circumstance present in the case at bar, the trial court erroneously imposed the death penalty upon the appellant.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>Before us for automatic review is the February 8, 1996 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch I<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of Borongan, Eastern Samar, finding Hilario Rebamontan alias "Ayong" guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt, for which it sentenced him to death.<br><br>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 25, 1994, signed by Second Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Rosendo C. Tejero Jr., charged accused-appellant as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on April 22, 1994, at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening, at Barangay No. 3, Poblacion San Julian, Eastern Samar, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and with evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab and wound PEDRO CAGRADO, JR., with the use of [a] sharp bladed weapon (Depang), which the accused provided himself for the purpose, thereby inflicting injuries upon the latter, which injuries caused the death of Pedro Cagrado, Jr., to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim."</blockquote>Upon his arraignment on July 18, 1994, accused-appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the above charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> After trial in due course, the court <i>a quo</i> found him guilty and sentenced him thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, Accused HILARIO REBAMONTAN is hereby found guilty of the crime of murder defined and penalized by Section 6, of R.A.

Accordingly, Accused HILARIO REBAMONTAN is hereby sentenced to suffer the maximum penalty of [d]eath and to indemnify the heirs of PEDRO CAGRADO, JR. the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS, for his death and to pay the cost.</blockquote><center>xxx xxx xxx"<br><br>xxx xxx xxx"</center><br><center><b><u>The Facts<br><br><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></u></b></center><br>The solicitor general presents the antecedent facts as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote>"Around 6:00 in the evening of April 22, 1994, Lucas Calinaya and his neighbors, Maria Nena Aguilar, Raul Mendova and Julia Balbaboco were conversing at the corner of Jacinto and Mabini Street[s], Poblacion, San Julian, Eastern Samar (tsn, November 29, 1994, p. 3; tsn, January 18, 1995, p. 4). About thirty (30) meters away was a basketball court (tsn, November 29, 1994, p. 5). While his attention was towards the direction of the basketball court, Lucas suddenly saw appellant stabbing Pedro Cagrado, Jr. with a small sharp bolo, locally known as 'depang' (tsn, November 29, 1994, p. 3). Appellant was initially positioned behind Pedro, but when the former was about to thrust the bolo, the latter turned around and was hit in the right chest just below his right nipple (ibid., p. 4; tsn, January 18, 1995, pp. 21-22). Pedro was not able to parry the thrust because he was not aware that appellant intended to injure him (tsn, January 18, 1995, pp. 22-23). Appellant used his left hand in stabbing Pedro (tsn, November 29, 1994, p. 4; tsn, August 8, 1995, p. 4).<br><br>"Oozing with blood, Pedro ran towards the direction of Lucas and company (tsn, November 29, 1994, pp. 4-5; tsn, January 18, 1995, p. 17; tsn, August 8, 1995, pp. 4-5). Appellant gave chase (tsn, August 8, 1995, p. 4). As Pedro reached the house fence of Lucas, he fell and died (tsn, January 18, 1995, p. 8; tsn, August 8, 1995, p.5). Thereupon, appellant stopped and headed towards the direction of Barangay 3, Campalao, San Julian, Eastern Samar (tsn, January 18, 1995, p. 17). Lucas then frightfully went inside his house (ibid.).<br><br>"Meanwhile, Nina Cagrado, Pedro's cousin, informed SPO4 Nandino Doligon, a neighbor, about the incident (tsn, November 27, 1995, p. 37). SPO4 Nandino immediately responded and went to the scene of the incident (ibid., p. 38). He was informed by the people around that appellant was on Lakandula Street, Poblacion, San Julian, Eastern Samar (ibid., pp. 38-39). SPO4 Nandino proceeded there but did not see appellant (ibid., p. 44). Nonetheless, appellant was subsequently arrested on Burgos Street and brought to the municipal police station by SPO4 Nandino (ibid., pp. 40-41).<br><br>"On the following day, post-mortem examination of the cadaver of Pedro Cagrado was conducted by Dr. Andy Gimpaya, a medico-legal expert. His Post-Mortem Examination Report revealed that the cause of death was severe hemorrhage in the thoracic cavity due to stab wound 1-1/2 inches penetrating, mid axillary line between 6 to 7 intercostal space with complete fracture of the 7th rib (tsn, July 20, 1995, pp. 2-3)."</blockquote><center><b><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></b></center><br>On the other hand, accused-appellant narrates the incidents in the following manner:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><blockquote>"xxx [O]n April 22, 1994, [appellant] went to the public market of San Julian, Eastern Samar to sell fish. He left the market at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening and walked towards home. On his way, he met Pedro Cagrado together with Rolando Sabulao. That when Pedro Cagrado, Jr. got near him, the former stabbed him, but he was not hit. Pedro Cagrado, Jr. told him xxx 'Pagpinaca-opay-opay nim, pagpinakasiga-siganim,' in English, 'You are boastful and [a] toughie.' Then, Pedro Cagrado, Jr. stabbed him for the second time which also did not hit him[;] he then drew his 'depang' or sharp weapon used by him in slicing fish at the market, and stabbed Pedro Cagrado, Jr., hitting him. He surrendered to the police authorities after the incident. That Pedro Cagrado, Jr., had [a] grudge against him because one time Pedro Cagrado, Jr., asked permission to drink in his house which he did not grant. (TSN, October 25, 1995, pp. 18-23)."</blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b></center><br>In its Judgment, the court <i>a quo </i>took into account the accused-appellant's admission of "having killed Pedro Cagrado [Jr.] in self-defense." This admission, the trial court stated, shifted to the appellant the burden of proving the justifying circumstance mentioned.<br><br>Evaluating the evidence proffered by the defense, the trial court held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><blockquote>"xxx [A]ccused testified that it was the victim Pedro Cagrado, Jr. who unlawfully attacked him on his way home from the public market. The court is surprised that [the] accused did not even suffer a scratch as a result of the stabbing blows of the victim, assuming accused['s] allegation to be true. The defense has clearly failed to prove by convincing evidence that it was the victim who was the unlawful aggressor.<br><br>"xxx This court believes the prosecution that [the] victim was unarmed and if indeed he was armed, [the] accused should have recovered the weapon used by the victim in stabbing him and presented it as evidence to bolster his theory of self-defense."</blockquote>As to the attendance of the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, the trial court ruled:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>"In this case, the attack delivered by the accused to the victim was sudden and Pedro Cagrado, Jr. did not expect that Hilario Rebamontan would attack him. The deceased did not have the slightest suspicion that he would be assaulted. xxx There is therefore the presence of treachery in the killing of Pedro Cagrado, Jr. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against person[s,] employing means, methods or forms of execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution xxx without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might take. In this case, the attack was sudden and the victim did not expect [that] the accused [would] end his life [o]n that fateful day.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br>"The prosecution alleged evident premeditation as a qualifying circumstance. However, the case is bereft of any indication that accused prepared and planned to kill Pedro Cagrado, Jr. previous to the fatal stabbing. Time and again it has been held by the Supreme Court that evident premeditation cannot be appreciated to qualify a killing to murder in the absence of direct evidence of the planning and preparation to kill when the plan was conceived."</blockquote>The trial judge refused to credit the appellant with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, <i>viz</i>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>"The accused alleged voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance. In order that voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance be appreciated, it is necessary that it be spontaneous and be made in such a manner that it shows that intent of the accused to surrender unconditionally to the authorities, either because he acknowledge[s] his guilt or he wishes to save the trouble and expenses necessarily incurred in his search xxx. In this case Hilario Rebamontan was picked up by<b> </b>Police Officer Four Nandino Doligon after the latter inquired from eyewitnesses on the same day xxx Pedro Cagrado, Jr. was killed by<b> </b>the accused. The fact alone that Hilario Rebamontan did not resist arrest but peacefully went with the police officer does not mean that he voluntarily surrendered."</blockquote>Disbelieving accused-appellant's plea of self-defense and appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the trial court convicted Rebamontan of murder and sentenced him to death.<br><br>Hence, this Court's automatic review of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b></center><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> accused-appellant abandons his self-defense theory and simply assails the trial court's (1) appreciation of treachery, (2) disregard of voluntary surrender, and (3) imposition of the death penalty. Thus, he submits:<br><br><center>"I</center><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING THE EXTREME PENALTY OF DEATH ON ACCUSED-APPELLANT AND IN NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER."</blockquote><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The Court finds no generic aggravating circumstance in the commission of the murder. Therefore, the penalty should be<i> reclusion perpetua</i>, not death.<br><br><center><b><u>First Issue: <i>Treachery</i></u></b></center><br>Citing the prosecution witnesses themselves, appellant contends that there was no treachery, because he and his victim were facing each other when the stabbing took place. Hence, the attack could not have been sudden and unexpected.<br><br>The solicitor general, on the other hand, admits that the stabbing itself was frontal, but counters that the attack <i>commenced</i> from behind the victim, who was unaware of appellant's criminal design. Had the victim not turned around at that particular moment, his back would surely have been stabbed. He had absolutely no opportunity to parry the blow. These circumstances, according to the government counsel, "demonstrate the treacherous nature of the assault."<br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof, which tend directly and specially to ensure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make. The essence of treachery is the swiftness and the unexpectedness of the attack upon the unsuspecting and unarmed victim, who does not give the slightest provocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Two conditions must concur: (1) the malefactor employs such means, method or manner of execution that ensures his or her safety from the defensive or retaliatory act of the victim; and (2) such means, method or form of execution is consciously and deliberately adopted by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> We find both conditions present in the case at bar.<br><br>The following is the graphic testimony of Eyewitness Lucas Calinaya as to what he witnessed on the fateful day Victim Cagrado Jr. was stabbed by accused-appellant:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"Q: </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">You stated in your affidavit executed before the Hon.

Rebamontan inconspicuously walked first in front of him, without any manifestation of his criminal plan. Only when the assailant got behind the unsuspecting victim did he commit his murderous act. Obviously, such a wily scheme of assault was deliberately adopted to ensure its success and to give no chance to the victim to elude it, much less to retaliate. The fact that Cagrado Jr. was facing him at the same moment as the latter's attack did not erase its treacherous nature. Even if the assault were frontal, the fact that it was sudden or totally unexpected, thus giving the victim no opportunity at all to defend himself or to retaliate, definitely points to the presence of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Second Issue: <i>Voluntary Surrender</i></u></b></center><br>For voluntary surrender to be considered a mitigating circumstance, the following requisites must concur: (1) the offender has not actually been arrested; (2) the offender surrenders to a person in authority or to the latter's agent; and (3) the surrender is voluntary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, Police Officer Nandino Doligon relates how the authorities took appellant into<b> </b>custody:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"Q </td><td width="95%">So when you arrived [at] the scene you were only, you only saw the victim, is that correct?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A. </td><td>There were many people there.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q. </td><td>And then after that what did you do?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A. </td><td><div align="justify">I asked the people who stabbed Junior, meaning Pedro Cagrado, even if I was told already by Niña Cagrado.

The mere fact that he did not resist his arrest or deny his criminal act cannot be equated with voluntary surrender. His arrest was already imminent.
