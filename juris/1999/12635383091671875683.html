KHOR, 51 yrs. old married, Malaysian citizen presently residing at room 2305 Manila Diamond Hotel, Roxas Blvd., Malate, Manila for violation of Section(s) 15 and 16 Article 3 of RA 6425 as amended (Illegal Distribution/Transport and Possession of Firearm/Ammunition), committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about 10:15 am 07 June 1996, at the front driveway of the Diamond Hotel located at Roxas Blvd., corner Quintos St., Malate, Manila, herein suspect ALAN K.C. KHOR, although not duly licensed nor authorized to do so, was actually caught en flagrante de lito, (sic) in the act of delivering/distributing/transporting TEN (10) KILOS of SHABU or METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, regulated drug as defined by RA 6425, placed inside a black travelling bag, which he tried to place inside the trunk compartment of the car driven by a police ASSET who pretended to buy the said drugs from him on a delay-payment basis. (p. 8, TSN, July 9, 1996) That when interrogated, suspect Alan Khor was also found in possession of a SIG-SAUER Caliber .380 Automatic Pistol tucked inside the right waistline of his pants but could not present pertinent papers covering the said firearm. (p. 9 &amp; 15, TSN, ibid) When interrogated further, Alan Khor also pointed to an old model Toyota Corolla car without license plate which when opened with a key in his possession, yielded eighty-five (85) more transparent plastic bags all containing suspected Shabu approximately weighing one kilogram each bag, and placed inside five (5) apple carton boxes. (p. 17, TSN, ibid) When submitted to the WPDC Criminal Investigation Laboratory Division for examination, all evidences of suspected Shabu were found POSITIVE for the test of METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE as certified to by Chemist Renee Eric Checa. (p. 21, TSN, ibid) Hence, the arrest.<br><br>On the other hand, accused Alan K.C. Khor admitted that the subject firearm was recovered from him at the time of the incident but contended that said firearm was covered by a license issued by the proper authorities and in support of his contention presented Exh. `J', a Certification dated July 23, 1996 that one Alan K.C. Khor of 1906 San Marcelino Street, Malate, Manila is a licensed/registered holder of subject firearm covered by a computerized license issued on February 15, 1996 with an expiration date of December 1996, and Exh. `2', a copy of the computerized license itself. (p. 14 &amp; 17, TSN, August 12, 1996) The accused however denied the charge that he was in possession of the 95 kilos of shabu. (p. 34, TSN, ibid) He claimed that the black bag which contained the 10 kilos of shabu was possessed or held by a taxi driver called Nick. (p. 9, TSN, ibid). He further claimed that he does not own any Toyota Corolla red car and denied leading the policemen to the said Toyota corolla red car parked in the basement of the Diamond Hotel where the boxes containing the 85 kilos of shabu were allegedly found. (p. 34, TSN, ibid) (T)he accused likewise alleged that in the process of his arrest, while he was placed in the car on their way towards the Manila Hotel, the police officers took/got from him aside from the subject firearm about 1) P5,000.00 to P6,000.00, 2) US$3,000.00, 3) his Khakia watch, and 4) his necklace. (p. 14, TSN, ibid) He added that thereafter in his hotel room, the police took/got from his dunhill bag and suitcase the amount of 1) US $3,000.00 2) HONGKONG $40,000.00, 3) JAPANESE YEN 500,000.00, 4) a diamond ring worth P320,000.00, 5) another diamond ring worth P60,000.00, 6) necklace with diamond worth P250,000.00, 7) two bracelets worth P30,000.00, 8) three dunhill lighters worth more than P60,000.00 9) three dunhill ballpens worth more than P30,000.00 10) one cellular phone, (11) camera worth P80,000.00 and 12) some family souvenirs which was priceless, his coat, pants, underwear, jacket and shoes. He further alleged that he gave the police arresting officers HK$500,000.00 (Hongkong Dollars) or about 1.6 Million Pesos as partial payment of the P3 Million Pesos the police officers were asking from him. (p. 19, TSN, ibid)."</blockquote>The accused raises the defense of denial. The appellant's brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> narrates the version of the defense as follows:<br><blockquote>"Appellant is a Malaysian citizen, engaged mainly in the business of selling jewelry. (TSN, p. 39, Aug. 12, 1996) At the time of his arrest, his business which had been in operation for eleven years had its principal station at Hongkong where all his business dealings were made, including the deliveries of pieces of jewelry and payments thereof. (TSN, p. 5, Aug. 13, 1996) As some of his clients were residents of the Philippines, he usually came to the country to collect payments, especially when he had encountered difficulty in the collection of payments. (TSN, p. 6, Aug. 13, 1996). By then, he had been doing business in the Philippines for almost four (4) years. While in the Philippines, he had stayed in hotels, particularly, at the Manila Diamond Hotel, Roxas Boulevard. (TSN, p. 40, Aug. 12, 1996).<br><br>On June 7, 1996, Friday, at 10:00 in the morning, appellant went out of his room at the Manila Diamond Hotel to look for a friend with whom he had an appointment. Upon reaching the lobby, he went directly to the reception counter to check whether he had any message. (TSN, pp. 8-9, Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>As there had been no message for him, he headed for the main door to see his friend. As he turned around, he saw Nick, a taxi driver with whom he had traveled in his taxi several times in the past. Nick was carrying a black bag. Nick greeted him but he did not respond and instead, preoccupied with the thought of his appointment with his friend, proceeded to the main door. While he was standing beside the paging table, outside the building, waiting for his friend, Nick approached him and asked whether he needed his taxi services. He declined his offer, and said `No, I don't need.' (TSN, pp. 9 and 10 Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>He was still standing beside the paging system when he saw Nick went to a vehicle parked outside of the hotel. Nick opened its compartment and placed the bag which was approximately three feet high and one foot wide. (TSN, pp. 10-11 Aug. 12, 1996) When Nick was about to place his bag into the compartment of the car, appellant saw a man, a Filipino, approached Nick and arrested him. Nick was pushed to the front seat of the car. To his surprise, another man, also a Filipino, approached him also, and with gun pointed to his side held the back part of his pants, pushed him into the car vehicle and seated him at the rear portion of the same car by two men. He resisted them but could not do anything as one of the two men had a gun. (TSN, p. 11-12 Aug. 12, 1996) At this point, a female employee of the Manila Diamond Hotel approached the car and talked with the man at his right side. Appellant, being a foreigner, did not understand their conversation, except when the man told the lady to leave. (TSN, p. 12, Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>When the vehicle they were riding was moving, the two men, one sitting at his right, and the other on his left, took his wallet containing P5,000.00 or P6,000 and US $3,000.00, his Khakia watch, his necklace with diamond and seven pendants. (TSN, p. 14, Aug. 12, 1996) The men spoke to him in Filipino, but while he could not understand the language, he sensed that the two men were asking for his permit to carry the gun which they had also taken from him. (TSN, p. 15 Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>Later, the car was parked at the side of the Manila Hotel, Nick was transferred to another vehicle. On the other hand, appellant remained in the same car. The men threatened him if he would not be able to produce the documents showing his permit to carry the gun. Fearing for his safety, appellant requested that he be taken back to the Manila Diamond Hotel. (TSN, p. 15, Aug. 12, 1996) The men granted his request. Upon reaching the Manila Diamond Hotel, the two men were joined by six other persons and they went up to his room, Room 2305, together with the manager of the hotel. (TSN, p. 16, Aug. 12, 1996) There, the appellant opened his suitcase, got his permit or license of the gun and gave it to the person who took his gun while in the car. (TSN, p. 17, Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>The two men searched his bags, a big Dunhill bag and a big suitcase. Not surprisingly as accused appellant was a businessman, his bags contained valuables which the two men took possession, such as US$8,000, Hongkong $40,000.00, Japanese yen 500,000.00, diamond ring worth P320,000.00, another diamond ring worth P60,000.00, a necklace, another necklace with diamond, worth P250,000.00, two bracelets worth P30,000.00, three (3) Dunhill lighters, the value of which is more than P60,000.00, three Dunhill ballpen worth more than P30,000, one cellular phone, one camera worth more than P80,000.00, gifts from his family, coat, pants, underwear, and jackets. (TSN, pp. 18-19, Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>The man who took his gun demanded something but as he could not understand what he was saying, he requested that he be allowed to wait for the person who could interpret the language. However, his request was turned down. (TSN, pp. 20-21, Aug. 12, 1996) Appellant was detained in his room from Friday to Sunday afternoon (June 7-9, 1996), during which time the three men kept demanding money from him, as indicated by their three fingers, in the amount of three (3) million pesos. The men even threatened him that he would be executed. (TSN, p. 20-21, Aug. 12, 1996) As appellant had no money to meet their demand, he called up his Hongkong manager, Mr. Tan, and informed him that he was kidnapped by the men who turned out to be policemen and he needed one million Hongkong dollars as payment for his freedom. (TSN, p. 22, Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>The amount of Hongkong $500,000.00 was sent to him in the following morning of Saturday. Converted into Philippine pesos, the amount of 1.6 million pesos was given to a tall policeman. Appellant was forced to give money as he was scared and the persons detaining him kept asking money. (TSN, pp. 23-24, Aug. 12, 1996) Familiar with the common occurrence in the country that foreigners were being kidnapped for ransom, appellant thought that he was being kidnapped and he would be released upon handing the sum of money. (TSN, p. 45, Aug. 13, 1996)<br><br>But as he could not produce the additional amount, he was kept until the afternoon of Sunday. He was then transferred to a place which is not known to him and he was locked up in a room. On the following morning of June 10, 1996, some men entered his room, took his fingerprints and handcuffed him. Together, they walked to another place, walked into a room where people with cameras took his pictures. Apparently, the law enforcers had called a press conference and he was presented to the media. On the table in front of him were plastic bags containing white powder, long guns and short guns, including the gun that belonged to him. He was prevented from talking and from making any statement. (TSN, p. 24-27, Aug. 12, 1996)<br><br>Appellant was not aware of the reason why he was being detained. It was only after he engaged the services of a lawyer that he came to know that he was being accused of possession of shabu. (TSN, p. 54, Aug. 13, 1996) In fact he was never interrogated by anybody. As to what happened to Nick, the taxi driver, accused appellant later knew that he was released by the policemen. (TSN, p. 55, Aug. 13, 1996)"</blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 96-150419 for illegal possession of firearm, the trial court ruled that accused, being a foreigner, cannot be validly granted a license to possess or hold a firearm and even if a license was granted to him, said license is void or invalid and is of no effect. It is of the view that any license secured or acquired by an unqualified person, i.e., a foreigner or underage, is null and void and does not grant the holder thereof a lawful authority to possess or hold the corresponding firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 96-150420 for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act, the court <i>a quo</i> ruled with respect to the ten (10) kilos of shabu that even if accused was not the one in actual possession, he can still be considered in constructive possession for being a companion of Nick.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Anent the eighty-five (85) kilos found in the Toyota Corolla red car, the trial court held that the denial of the accused cannot prevail over the positive and detailed testimony of the three police officers who testified as prosecution witnesses.<br><br>Appellant raises the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<br><br><center><b><u>"CRIMINAL CASE NO. 96-150419</u></b></center><br><center>I.</center><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT STILL GUILTY AS CHARGED WHEN THE PROSECUTION ITSELF HAD SHOWN THAT SAID ACCUSED-APPELLANT HAD A LICENSE OR PERMIT TO CARRY A GUN.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE LICENSE TO POSSESS OR HOLD A FIREARM GRANTED TO THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT WHO IS A FOREIGNER IS NULL AND VOID.<br><br><center><b><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 96-150420</u></b></center><br><center>I.</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF VIOLATION OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6425 (DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972) BASED ON THE THEORY OF CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DEPRIVING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF HIS RIGHT TO CONFRONT AND CROSS-EXAMINE THE POLICE ASSET OR INFORMER WHO WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED NOR PRESENTED TO THE WITNESS' STAND.<br><br><center>III.</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING APPELLANT, HIS GUILT NOT HAVING BEEN PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."</blockquote><b>A. Criminal Case No. 96-150419 (for violation of P.D. 1866)</b><br><br>In the criminal case for illegal possession of firearm, appellant contends that it is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the elements of illegal possession of firearm. Appellant alleges that when he was asked for the license for the gun, he requested the law enforcers to allow him to return to his room at the hotel to get the said permit and after having found it, he showed it to them. Appellant argues that it was the prosecution itself that even supported appellant's stand that he had a license to possess firearm.<br><br>The trial court, while stating that appellant had a license to possess the firearm,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> nonetheless, found him liable for illegal possession of firearm stating that the said license was void or invalid for having been issued to a foreigner. Appellant, however, argues that his being a foreigner does not make his license void or invalid.<br><br>Appellee, through the Solicitor General, recommends the dismissal of the criminal case for violation of P.D. 1866 after considering that the prosecution failed to prove an essential element of illegal possession of firearm, i.e., the absence of a license to possess such firearm.<br><br>We agree with appellant's contention and appellee's submission.<br><br>Possession of any firearm becomes unlawful only if the necessary permit and/or license therefor is not first obtained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The absence of license and legal authority constitutes an essential ingredient of the offense of illegal possession of firearm and every ingredient or essential element of an offense must be shown by the prosecution by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Stated otherwise, the negative fact of lack or absence of license constitutes an essential ingredient of the offense which the prosecution has the duty not only to allege but also to prove beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it is not disputed that at the time of the incident, appellant was found in possession of the subject firearm. However, appellant presented a computerized license issued by the proper authorities to him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and a Certification issued by the Firearms and Explosive Division of the PNP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to the effect that appellant is the licensed/registered holder of the subject firearm, a pistol, Sig-Sauer, caliber .380 with serial number S167273.<br><br>In cases involving illegal possession of firearm, the prosecution has the burden of proving the elements thereof, <i>viz</i>.: (a) the existence of the subject firearm; and (b) the fact that the accused who owned or possessed it does not have the corresponding license or permit to possess the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The essential element of lack of a license to possess subject firearm was not proven.<br><br>The prosecution even bolstered appellant's position that he was licensed to possess the subject firearm.

However, the probability that the license of the accused is not valid because he is a foreigner does not necessarily invalidate the license already issued to him by the proper authorities. It is not the burden of the accused to prove in this case that he has duly complied with the requirements for the issuance of a license to possess and/or carry firearms, considering that the agency that is charged with the issuance of the license, i.e., the Firearms and Explosive Division of the PNP, had issued a license to him apparently after undergoing a procedure of recording, verification, authentication and review. It is noted that in the appellant's application for firearm license,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which appellant claims was filled up by the owner of a gun store in Ongpin St. where he bought his gun,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the item on the applicant's citizenship and birthplace was blank indicating that no false entry was made in the application.

Appellant argues that although he was with Nick, the taxi driver, such fact constitutes circumstantial evidence which cannot satisfy the quantum of evidence needed to hold him guilty as the guilt of appellant cannot be inferred from one single circumstance. The fact that appellant was in the company of Nick at the time of the incident could not be the basis of his conviction and the trial court could not draw an inference that if Nick was carrying the bag, appellant would be equally guilty.

What is in issue here is the possession by appellant of the 85 kilos of shabu and not the ownership of the car.<br><br>It is appellant's view that the testimony of the informer/informant is indispensable. This is not so. Well-settled is the rule that the presentation of an informant in an illegal drugs case is not essential for the conviction nor is it indispensable for a successful prosecution because his testimony would merely be corroborative and cumulative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Informants are generally not presented in court because of the need to hide their identity and preserve their invaluable service to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The cases cited by appellant to support his claim that the police informer should have been presented as a witness, are not applicable to the case at bar. Here, the police officers directly testified regarding the entrapment, and the testimony of the police asset would merely have been corroborative.<br><br>As stated earlier, credence was properly accorded to the testimony of prosecution witnesses who are law enforcers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The testimony of the police officers carried with it the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Law enforcers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly in the absence of evidence to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> When police officers have no motive for testifying falsely against the accused, courts are inclined to uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and no evidence whatsoever was presented that would suggest any improper motive on the part of the police enforcers. This Court accords great respect to and treats with finality the findings of the trial court on the matter of credibility of witnesses, absent any palpable error or arbitrariness in their findings.<br><br>Finally, appellant contends that his warrantless arrest was illegal and unconstitutional and the articles seized from him as a result of said arrest were inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>The rule is that an accused may be estopped from assailing the legality of his arrest if he failed to move for the quashing of the Information against him before his arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise the objection is deemed waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The records show that, although appellant filed a Motion for Reinvestigation, the same was "denied as per manifestation of his counsel that he is abandoning the said motion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> No motion to quash the Informations was ever filed by appellant who pleaded not guilty to both Informations upon arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the arrest of appellant was a result of a surveillance conducted by Police Inspector Coronel on the night before the arrest of appellant wherein Coronel himself checked in as guest at the Diamond Hotel where appellant was billeted and the phone calls received by Coronel from a "police informer" on the day before the actual arrest of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><sup> </sup>This was a buy-bust operation, far variant from an ordinary arrest; it is a form of entrapment which has repeatedly been accepted to be a valid means of arresting violators of the Dangerous Drugs Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Appellant claims that the bundles of money allegedly confiscated from him were marked as Exhibit "3-B" but were never presented in court and the prosecution failed to explain their disappearance. It should be noted that appellant was charged in the Information for possession of shabu and not for the sale thereof. Nonetheless, even in the prosecution for the sale of dangerous drugs, the absence of marked money does not create a hiatus in the evidence for the prosecution as long as the sale of the dangerous drugs is adequately proven and the drug subject of the transaction is presented before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In every prosecution for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, what is material and indispensable is the submission of proof that the sale of illicit drug took place between the seller and the poseur-buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the elements are: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> These circumstances of illegal possession are obtaining in the case at bar.<br><br>Pursuant to Section 16, Article III of R.A. 6425 as amended by Section 16 of R.A. 7659, in relation to Section 20 of R.A. 7659, the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos shall be imposed upon any person caught in possession of 200 grams or more of shabu. Thus:<br><blockquote>"<b>SEC. 16</b>. <i>Possession or Use of Regulated Drugs</i>. - The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos shall be imposed upon any person who shall possess or use any regulated drug without the corresponding license or prescription, subject to the provisions of Section 20 hereof.<br><br><center>x x x x x x x x x</center><br><b>SEC. 20</b>.<i> Application of Penalties, Confiscation and Forfeiture of the Proceeds or Instruments of the Crime</i>. - The penalties for offenses under Sections 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II and Sections 14, 14-A, 15 and 16 of Article III of this Act shall be applied if the dangerous drugs involved is in any of the following quantities:<br><br>1. x x x<br><br>2. x x x<br><br>3. 200 grams or more of shabu or methylamphetamine hydrochloride;<br><br>4. x x x<br><br>5. x x x<br><br>6. x x x<br><br>7. x x x<br><br>8. x x x.<br><br>Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing quantities, the penalty shall range from <i>prision correccional</i> to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> depending upon the quantity.</blockquote><center>x x x x x x x x x."</center><br>Ninety-five (95) kilos of shabu were confiscated from appellant.
