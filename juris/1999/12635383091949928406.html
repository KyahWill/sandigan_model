				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These cases are here for automatic review of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 272, Marikina, Metro Manila, finding accused-appellant Reynaldo Acala guilty of three (3) counts of incestuous rape pursuant to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, and sentencing him to death in each case in addition to ordering him to pay the victim, who is his daughter Fe Acala, the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, and the costs of the suit.<br><br>In three (3) separate complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> it was alleged -<br><blockquote><u>In Criminal Case No. 96-789-MK:</u><br><br>That on or about the 19th day of January 1996, in the Municipality of Marikina, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the legitimate father of undersigned complainant, with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with one FE ACALA, against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<br><br><u>In Criminal Case No. 96-862-MK:</u><br><br>That on or about the 12th day of January, 1996 in the Municipality of Marikina, Metro-Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the legitimate father of undersigned complainant, with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with one Fe Acala, against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<br><br><u>In Criminal Case No. 96-863-MK</u><br><br>That on or about the 26th day of December 1995, in the Municipality of Marikina, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the legitimate father of undersigned complainant with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with one FE ACALA, against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.</blockquote>Accused-appellant pleaded "not guilty" to each charge. The three (3) cases were then jointly tried, during which the prosecution presented six (6) witnesses, including the complainant, while the defense presented four (4) witnesses, including accused-appellant. Their testimonies are summarized in the following portion of the decision of the trial court:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote>A close scrutiny of the aforestated narration of facts and the evidence presented in these cases readily show that the victim FE ACALA was first abused by her own father, REYNALDO ACALA, when she was yet six (6) years old and such incestuous lusts of her father on her continued until the same was discovered by her mother Perla Acala, on January 19, 1996, when the last rape has just been committed. Immediately on the next following day, January 20, 1996, Fe and her mother went to report the matter to the police headquarters where she executed a sworn statement charging her father for the crime of multiple rapes. Due to natural fickleness of memory as a result of her tender age, the private complainant was not able to vividly recall and specify the events and circumstances under which the incestuous rapes had been committed by her father against her, except those rapes committed on December 26, 1995 and on January 12, and January 19, 1996.<br><br>During the first rape on the evening of December 26, 1995, a day after Christmas, on that yuletide season, Reynaldo Acala sent his wife and his other daughter to the village gate to buy something for dinner leaving his daughter Fe Acala alone with him in their house. Considering that they have to ride a tricycle to reach the village gate, he set in motion his unchaste amorous intention against his daughter when he asked the latter to lie down, took off her shorts and underwear and likewise did the same and thereafter held her two arms, kissed her neck and then inserted his organ and pumped her. This was illustratively demonstrated by the private complainant while giving her testimony in court. That after she was raped, she went downstairs at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening. On the second rape committed in the early morning of January 12, 1996, the private complainant was awakened by the voice of her sister downstairs calling for her mother. On her way down, her father suddenly appeared besides her and told her to be quiet, which she obeyed because of his threat, then started undressing her. He succeeded in abusing her again until a white substance came out of his organ. These impure lusting advances were never made known by the victim to the mother because of the father's threat to maul and kill them until the former herself discovered the same immediately just after the rape on January 19, 1996, consequently, when confronted, her daughter confirmed the abovementioned incestuous rapes committed by her husband against their daughter.<br><br>As a result of the foregoing, three (3) separate crimes of rape were filed in court and during the trial, the prosecution service presented the private complainant who testified to the effect that she was raped by her father on those particular aforecited dates; the mother of the private complainant who assisted and corroborated the statement of the private complainant together with the family counselor and teacher of the private complainant; the police officer who conducted the investigation of the case; and the medico-legal officer who proved that the child was no longer in a virgin state.<br><br>On the part of the defense the accused blatantly denied the accusation of his daughter and wife. He alleged that he could not then be able to rape his daughter on those days mentioned by the latter as he played mahjong in the house of Nardo Mercado, also at NAWASA Compound in Provident Village from 12:00 o'clock at noontime up to 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon the following day; that on 5:00 o'clock in the morning of January 12, 1996, he was sleeping downstairs of their residence while his wife and two daughters slept upstairs and on January 19, 1996, at 10:30 in the morning, he was in a bus on the way to his sister Nelia del Rosario in Monumento. He left their residence at 9:00 o'clock and reached his sister's house at 11:00 o'clock. He pointed out that the cases filed against him was only fabricated because he is an irresponsible family man having hooked in gambling and for that reason, he mortgaged two rooms of their house to his sister-in-law Sally Ybanez without the knowledge of his wife. He further alleged that his daughter Fe may have lost her virginity as she frequently played soccer with her friends at Ateneo and she is also fond of riding bicycles. To vouch his testimonies, he presented his daughter Liezl Acala; his sister Nelia del Rosario; Perfecto Lovino, Jr., a taxi driver and also a resident of the same place; and his sister-in-law Exaltacion Ybanez.</blockquote>On October 28, 1996, the trial court rendered judgment as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the court finds the accused REYNALDO ACALA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, for three (3) counts, as charged against him and is hereby sentenced to suffer in each of the case, the extreme penalty of DEATH.<br><br>The accused is further ordered to pay the private complainant Fe Acala the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as moral damages and the amount of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND (P25,000.00) PESOS as exemplary damages and the cost of the suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>In view of the penalty imposed, the records were elevated to this Court for automatic review pursuant to Rule 122, §10 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure.<br><br>Accused-appellant seeks the reversal of his conviction on the following grounds:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THREE (3) COUNTS OF RAPE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO PAY PRIVATE COMPLAINANT THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) AS MORAL DAMAGES AND THE AMOUNT OF TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P25,000.00) AS EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF THE SUIT.</blockquote>In support of the assignment of errors, accused-appellant contends:<br><br>(1) The victim did not state in her first sworn statement, dated January 20, 1996, that aside from the rape committed on January 19, 1996, she was also raped by her father, herein accused-appellant, on December 26, 1995 and January 12, 1996, thereby placing in doubt her credibility.<br><br>(2) Dr. Jesusa Nieves Vergara's testimony that she found no fresh lacerations on the hymen and spermatozoa in the vagina of the victim negates the claim of the victim that she had been raped by accused-appellant on January 19, 1996.<br><br>(3) The victim harbored a grudge against accused-appellant for having beaten her mother and for being a gambler and an irresponsible father.<br><br>(4) There were no witnesses to the alleged rapes.<br><br>(5) The awards of P50,000.00 for moral damages and P25,000.00 for exemplary damages made in favor of the victim have no basis because his guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The Court has carefully reviewed the records of this case and has found no reason to reverse the trial court's findings, except to modify its decision as to the penalty and the award of damages.<br><br><center>I.</center><br><i>First</i>. Concerning her failure to mention in her sworn statement, dated January 20, 1996, the two (2) other incidents of rape committed on December 26, 1995 and January 12, 1996, complainant said she was confused and had forgotten the specific dates of the other rapes and only remembered them when asked by the fiscal to try to recall all the incidents of rape to be included in the charge.

It is unfair to judge the action of a child who had undergone traumatic experiences by the norms of behavior expected of mature individuals either under the same or normal circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Moreover, sworn statements which are taken <i>ex parte </i>are often incomplete and inaccurate, because of partial suggestion or want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall all connected circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> As between the sworn statement and the testimony of the victim given in court, the latter is given more weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> At any rate, it is noteworthy that complainant's "Karagdagang Salaysay" (Supplemental Affidavit), executed subsequently on February 7, 1996, clearly narrated the rapes committed on December 26, 1995 and January 12, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>. Accused-appellant contends that the absence of fresh lacerations and spermatozoa in the victim's vagina belies the accusation that he raped her on January 19, 1996.<br><br>This contention has no merit. The healed lacerations confirm, rather than belie, the fact that the victim had been raped not only on January 19, 1996, when the victim's mother, Perla, found the victim without panties and accused-appellant hurriedly zipping his pants, but also on other occasions, particularly on December 26, 1995 and January 12, 1996. In fact, as testified to by the victim herself, accused-appellant started sexually abusing her since she was six years old, although she could no longer recall the details of the same. The fact of repeated sexual abuse of the victim by accused-appellant was confirmed by the testimony of Dr. Jesusa Nieves Vergara, medico-legal officer of the PNP, who told the trial court:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY.

The fact that the lacerations were already healed points to the conclusion that the victim was repeatedly raped before January 19, 1996, consistent with the accusation against accused-appellant. In <i>People v. Espinoza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> it was held that healed lacerations do not negate rape. In fact, lacerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best physical evidence of forcible defloration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The absence of spermatozoa, likewise, does not disprove rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> According to Dr. Vergara, the absence of spermatozoa in the vaginal canal of the victim may be caused by the vertical drainage of the semen from the vagina, or the acidity of the vagina, or the washing of the vagina immediately after the sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is also possible that accused-appellant was not able to ejaculate inside the vagina of the victim during the rape committed on January 19, 1996 considering that he stopped abusing his daughter when he heard his wife coming. Indeed, the presence or absence of spermatozoa is immaterial since it is not ejaculation but penetration which constitutes the crime of rape.<br><br><i>Third.</i> Accused-appellant claims that complainant hates him because "he hurts and mauls her mother" and he is "a gambler" and that his family would in fact be "delighted if he will no longer be with them." He also argues that the fact that no one witnessed the rapes makes the allegations of the victim suspect.<br><br>The victim's credibility is neither diminished nor tainted by such imputation of ill motives. The victim was just reacting normally when asked what kind of a husband and father accused-appellant was. Her testimony on the commission of the rapes is spontaneous, convincing, and highly credible, unshaken by the intense cross-examination by the defense. It is highly unthinkable for the victim to falsely accuse her father solely by reason of ill motives or grudge. As the Court observed in <i>People v. Melivo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> even when consumed with revenge, it takes a certain amount of psychological depravity for a young woman to concoct a story which would put her own father for most of his remaining life in jail, if not put him to his death, and drag herself and the rest of her family to a lifetime of shame.<br><br>The fact that none of the rape incidents was witnessed by anyone does not make the complainant's testimony incredible. By its very nature the crime of rape is committed usually with only the victim and accused present. In these cases, the rapes were committed by accused-appellant inside a room on the second storey of their house when the victim's mother and sister were either out of the house or doing something downstairs. It is settled that in rape cases, the lone testimony of the victim, if credible, is sufficient to sustain a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It is noteworthy that in this appeal, accused-appellant does not insist on his alibi and denial for they are inherently weak defenses. Alibi is a defense easily fabricated. Moreover, accused-appellant failed to establish it by showing that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. He failed to show the impossibility of his being in their house at the time of the commission of the rapes considering that the house of Nardo Mercado, where accused-appellant alleged he was in the evening of December 26, 1995, is only 30 meters from their house; that he was allegedly sleeping in their house in the morning of January 12, 1996; and that in the morning of January 19, 1996, he was on board a bus going to Monumento to visit his sister when, according to complainant and her mother, he left the house on the pretext that he was going to look for a job after, not before, the commission of the rape.<br><br>On the other hand, his denial was unsubstantiated by any credible evidence.

In rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the former's moral ascendancy and influence over the latter take the place of violence or intimidation. That ascendancy or influence flows from the father's parental authority over his children and from the latter's correlative duty of reverence and respect towards the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the same vein, it was observed in <i>People v. Melivo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that, in incestuous rapes, "[t]he rapist perverts whatever moral ascendancy and influence he has over his victim in order to intimidate and force the latter to submit to repeated acts of rape over a period of time."<br><br><center>III.</center><br>We think, however, that the trial court erred in applying in these cases that provision of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by §11 of R.A. No. 7659 which states that the death penalty shall be imposed on the offender in rape cases if "the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent ... of the victim." Summarizing the recent rulings, we held in <i>People v. Maglente,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that, under this provision, the concurrence of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender is a special qualifying circumstance which must be both alleged and proved with certainty, otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed. In these cases, although accused-appellant admits that Fe Acala is his daughter and the evidence shows that the latter was born on August 5, 1981<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and, therefore, she was below 18 years of age on the dates of the commission of the rapes, her age was not alleged in any of the complaints. Consequently, the special qualifying circumstance of minority and relationship cannot be appreciated and the death penalty imposed on accused-appellant. In accordance with the second paragraph of Art. 335, accused-appellant should be sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of rape.<br><br>The trial court awarded the victim the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for all three (3) counts of rape. In accordance with current rulings, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 should be awarded for each count of rape. In addition, the victim should be given indemnity in an amount not less than P50,000.00 for each count of rape. This is separate and distinct from the award of moral damages which is automatically granted in rape cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, the award of exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 should be deleted for lack of legal basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 272, Marikina, Metro Manila, is hereby AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:<br><br>(1) In Criminal Case Nos. 96-789-MK, 96-862-MK, and 96-863-MK, accused-appellant's sentence is reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>;<br><br>(2) In Criminal Case Nos. 96-789-MK, 96-862-MK, and 96-863-MK, accused-appellant is ordered to pay the offended party, Fe Acala, the amount of P50,000.00 in each case, or the total amount of P150,000.00 as indemnity;<br><br>(3) In Criminal Case Nos. 96-789-MK, 96-862-MK, and 96-863-MK, accused-appellant is further ordered to pay the offended party, Fe Acala, the amount of P50,000.00 in each case, or the total amount of P150,000.00 as moral damages;<br><br>(4) In Criminal Case Nos. 96-789-MK, 96-862-MK, and 96-863-MK, the award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages is deleted.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Gonzaga-Reyes,</i> and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Purisima,</i> and <i>Buena, JJ.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Per Judge Reuben P.
