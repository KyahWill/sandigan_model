				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">As a general rule, the assessment of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is best left to the discretion of trial courts. However, where the lower court overlooked relevant, material and pervasive inconsistencies which in their totality create reasonable doubt in an unprejudiced mind, the conviction of the accused cannot be justified. The prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence, not on the weakness of the defense.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>Before us is an appeal from the January 16, 1997 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Malabon (Branch 72),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 16969-MN, which found Noel Diaz guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping a minor and sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>On June 7, 1996, State Prosecutor Jorge G. Catalan Jr. filed an Information charging the accused and two John Does with kidnapping allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 3rd day of June, 1996, in the Municipality of Malabon, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and helping one another, being then a private individual, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnap, carry away and deprive one MAYLIN<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> MARIBUJO y BASILAN, a minor, 5 years old, of her liberty without authority of law and against her will and consent."</blockquote>Upon arraignment, Noel Diaz, with the assistance of Counsel <i>de Parte</i> Oscar B. Maturan, pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The other two John Does were and have remained unidentified and at large. Trial proceeded against Diaz alone. Thereafter, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Noel Diaz y Santiago alyas Boy Topak guilty beyond reasonable doubt of kidnapping. In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, and applying the provision of [the] Indeterminate Sentence Law, and considering the fact that the victim is a minor five (5) years of age, said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the prison term of reclusion perpetua."</blockquote>In view of the penalty imposed, this appeal was filed directly with this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Facts<br><b>Version of the Prosecution</b></u></b></center><br>In the Appellee's Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the following narration of the facts as viewed by the prosecution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><blockquote>"On June 3, 1996, at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening, Marilyn Maribujo was at the house of her sister at Mangosteen Road, Potrero, Malabon, Metro Manila watching TV and at the same time washing the dishes as they had just finished eating dinner, when her five (5)-year old daughter Maylin left the house. A few minutes later, Marilyn went out of the house to look for her daughter at the basketball court at Mangosteen Road but Maylin was not there. Marilyn then searched for her daughter in the nearby places up to the exit or labasan of their place but her daughter was nowhere to be found. Further search for Maylin was unsuccessful (t.s.n., September 11, 1996, pp. 2-4).<br><br>"The next day, June 4, 1996, Marilyn and her sister Tess and brother-in-law Renato continued searching for Maylin and went to BBB in Marulas, Valenzuela, Metro Manila but did not find Maylin thereat. They went to the barangay hall the following day to report the matter and seek assistance from the barangay authorities in looking for Maylin (t.s.n., September 11, 1996, p. 4).<br><br>"Coming home from the barangay hall, Marilyn was approached and told by a young boy, Marvin Bisana, that her daughter was taken by two men[,] one of whom was known to him as Boy Topak. Forthwith, Marilyn went to the barangay captain to convey the information. Later, appellant was found outside his house riding a bicycle and was brought to the barangay hall by the barangay captain for questioning where he denied having taken Maylin (t.s.n., September 11, 1996, pp. 4-6).<br><br>"Thereafter, appellant was brought by the barangay authorities to the police headquarters where he finally admitted that he brought Maylin to Pasay City and dropped her in[to] a canal thereat. When Maylin could not be found in said place, appellant then said he brought Maylin to BBB in Marulas, Valenzuela, Metro Manila. But the police authorities again were unable to find Maylin in the latter place (t.s.n., September 11, 1996, pp. 6-7).<br><br>"On June 6, 1996, Maylin was finally recovered from two women [with] whom appellant had left her. It was at the police headquarters that Marilyn and Maylin saw each other again (t.s.n., September 11, 1996, p. 7).<br><br>"Marvin Bisana, an 11-year old Grade II pupil at the Potrero Elementary School, was playing with Maylin at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening on June 3, 1996 near the basketball court at Mangosteen Road, Potrero, Malabon, Metro Manila when two men, one of whom was appellant whom he identified in court, approached them and took Maylin away. Marvin was warned by the two men not to call for policemen or else he [would] be killed. He was further told not to report the matter or call the parents of Maylin (t.s.n., October 9, 1996, pp. 2-6).<br><br>"The two men then put Maylin on board a passenger jeep going to Monumento and Marvin ran after them but did not find the appellant and his companion as well as Maylin in the Monumento area (t.s.n., October 9, 1996, pp. 6-7).<br><br>"The following Monday [sic], Marvin told Maylin's mother about the taking of her daughter by the two men. Marvin also executed a sworn statement (Exh. "B") in connection with the case (t.s.n., October 9, 1996, pp. 7-9).<br><br>"On June 4, 1996, at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, Dolores Santos, a vendor, was in front of the Pagoda Pubhouse at BBB, Marulas, Valenzuela, Metro Manila, where she had a cigarette stand, when she saw a man holding a child by the hand approaching her. The man who seemed to be proceeding to Gate I of San Miguel Brewery in said place, then released his hold of the child. Thereafter, the man took hold of the child again but the latter was able to free herself from the man's hold and r[u]n away. Dolores told her youngest daughter and a woman to go after and bring the child to her. Dolores then brought the child home (t.s.n., November 6, 1996, pp. 2-5).<br><br>"The following day Dolores took the child to the Dona Ata Detachment of the Valenzuela, Metro Manlia Police Force to report the matter. The police, however, told her to take back or have custody of the child in the meantime (t.s.n., November 6, 1996, pp. 5-6).<br><br>"After three days, policemen from the Malabon, Metro Manila Police Station came to Dolores inquiring about the missing child. She told them that the child was with her Kumareng Susan Reyes and accompanied them to the latter to fetch the child. Thereafter, the policemen took the child and Dolores to the Malabon Police Headquarters where the latter was investigated and [where she] gave her sworn statement (t.s.n., November 6, 1996, pp. 6-8)."</blockquote><center><b><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></b></center><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> appellant denies the charges against him and proffers alibi, stating that he was in his house when the crime was allegedly committed. The defense presents the following narration of facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>"Accused-Appellant was in his house at No. 42 Guyabano Road, Potrero, Malabon on June 3, 1996. He was with his family the whole evening on that day and stayed with them in the same house until he was invited by the Barangay Tanods to go with them to the Barangay Hall for some work on June 5, 1996.<br><br>"There at the Barangay Hall, accused-appellant was arrested as a suspect in the crime of kidnapping of [a] minor.<br><br>"An alleged eyewitness, eleven-year-old, Marvin Bisana, was brought before the accused-appellant for confrontation but [the former] failed to identify him. [The boy] describ[ed] the person who took the alleged victim as tall, fair-complexioned, long hair[ed] and with a scar on his face.<br><br>"Thereafter, the boy was brought inside the Office of the Barangay Captain and when brought back, the boy this time pointed [to] the accused-appellant as the abductor.<br><br>"Immediately, [a]ccused-[a]ppellant was brought to the Malabon Police Station where he was beaten while being blind-folded. Unable to stand the pain, he was forced to concoct a story to stop the torture and to see his mother in Pasay City. He told his captors that he threw the child in[to] a creek in Tramo St., Pasay City, where his mother [was] living nearby.<br><br>"Failing to see a victim in the creek, accused-appellant was again beaten, locked-up and charged.<br><br>"Unknown to the investigators of the case, the same five-year[-]old alleged kidnap victim was found by one Lea Fernando at Seven-Eleven, BBB, Marulas, Valenzuela, Metro Manila at 11:00 p.m. of June 3, 1996 or exactly three (3) hours after the child was allegedly kidnapped.<br><br>"This fact that [the] same child was found on June 3, 1996 at 11:00 p.m. is shown in the police blotter of [the] Dona Ata Police Station in Marulas, Valenzuela, Metro Manila was admitted by the prosecution in Exh. 3, page 3 and 4 TSN, Dec. 18, 1996.<br><br>"Three (3) days after the alleged kidnapping of the five-year-old child, the same child was recovered in Marulas, Valenzuela."</blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b></center><br>The trial court relied on the testimonies of Prosecution Witnesses Marvin Bisana, Marilyn Maribujo and Dolores Santos. Bisana stated that while he was playing near the basketball court, Maylin was taken by appellant and one other man, who both resorted to threats to keep him from reporting what he saw. Noting that Bisana's narration was "unshaken," the trial court also ruled that "Dolores Santos was categorical, clear and convincing in her testimony describing in detail how she first noticed Maylin and [Diaz] who was holding her, with Maylin seemingly trying to free herself from the man's hold, approach the place where she was selling cigarettes and how Maylin eventually freed herself from [his] hold." Because of the positive identification by the two witnesses, the trial court rejected appellant's alibi. It further held that inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses' testimonies regarding the time and date of the events mentioned were not material.<br><br><center><b><u>Assignment of Errors</u></b></center><br>Appellant contends that the trial court committed the following errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center>"I</center><blockquote>The lower court erred in admitting and giving credence to the testimony of witness, Dolores Santos, who was found inconsistent and who failed to appear for the continuation of the cross-examination.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>There was error when the lower court relied heavily on the identification of prosecution witnesses found inconsistent with several contradictory statements."</blockquote>Essentially, appellant questions the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br><center><b><u>Main Issue:<br><i>Credibility</i><i>of Prosecution Witnesses</i></u></b></center><br>It is well-settled that "evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must also be credible in itself, such that common experience and observation of mankind lead to the inference of its probability under the circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> As a general rule, the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is binding on appellate courts, absent any fact or circumstance of weight and substance that may have been overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In the present case, the trial court overlooked the serious inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Furthermore, it gave credence to testimonies that were incongruous with common experience.<br><br>The conviction of the accused hinges on the testimony of the following: Marvin Bisana, who was an alleged eyewitness of the abduction; Marilyn Maribujo, the victim's mother who testified on incidents after the abduction; and Dolores Flores, who allegedly saw the abducted child in the company of the accused, and who eventually recovered the child and turned her over to the police. As earlier noted, serious and fatal inconsistencies beset each of these testimonies.<br><br><b><u><i>Marvin Bisana's Story</i></u></b><br><br>During his direct examination, Marvin Bisana stated that he and Mylene were playing at the basketball court around 8:00 p.m. on June 3, 1996 when <i>two men</i> approached them, took Mylene, and warned him against calling the police. He then saw the two men and Mylene board a jeep. <i>That night</i>, he reported to Mylene's mother, Marilyn, what had happened. <i>The three of them</i>, including Marilyn's brother-in-law Renato, ran after the jeep up to <i>Monumento</i>.

His statement that only <i>two </i>men abducted the victim was contradicted by his subsequent testimony during cross-examination and by his affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that there were <i>three </i>abductors.

Although he had declared that he called the victim's mother first before following the kidnappers, he subsequently stated that he followed the kidnappers <i>first</i> before going to Mylene's house. Furthermore, although he had testified during direct examination that the three of them -- Bisana, the victim's mother and Renato -- ran after the kidnappers up to Monumento, he subsequently averred during cross-examination that he <i>alone</i> had done so. His statements during cross-examination are reproduced below:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"Q</td><td width="95%"> Where did you call the mother of Mylene and a certain Renato?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td>At their house.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p align="center">xxx xxx xxx</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>COURT:</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><i>What came first, your having followed Mylene xxx or your calling for the mother of Mylene and Renato? </i></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><i>My following xxx Mylene and the men.</i></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY.

This narration is contrary to human experience, especially because the kidnapper was also a neighbor of Renato. Paramount in situations such as this is the identification of the kidnapper, particularly when he or she is known to the person who has come to help.<br><br><b><i><u>Marilyn Maribujo's Story</u></i></b><br><br>The testimony of the victim's mother, Marilyn, engenders more doubts about the prosecution's case. It is not only contradictory; it is also incompatible with Bisana's account.<br><br>During direct examination, Marilyn stated that when she realized her daughter was missing, she and her brother-in-law Renato went to look for the child in the vicinity of the basketball area and as far as Monumento, but in vain. The next day she started asking everyone else around. Only on the third day did she report the incident to the barangay officials.

In her affidavit, however, she had stated the full name of the boy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>Second</i>, she testified that she was able to talk to Marvin Bisana only on June 5, 1996, Wednesday, <i>two days</i> after the incident, when the boy went to her house to tell her what had happened. Although the mother knew that her daughter had gone out to play with Bisana, it was incredible that she waited for two days before talking to him.<br><br>Furthermore, her testimony on this point was contrary to her subsequent story on cross-examination, in which she gave <i>two</i> more conflicting dates of her conversation with Bisana.

If on the night of the abduction Bisana indeed told them of the identity of the abductors, the failure of the victim's mother to immediately notify the authorities was inexplicable. Asked to specify whether the incident was reported to the barangay authorities on June 3 or on June 5, she stressed that it was on June 5.

In different instances, Bisana declared that he had followed the abductors as far as Monumento either by himself or with Nato only or with Nato and Maribujo. Maribujo on the other hand declared that she reached Monumento with Tess and Nato on June 3, but that she failed to mention that Bisana was with them.<br><br>Bisana further declared that after he had followed the jeep to the <i>labasan</i>, he "called" the victim's mother <i>that same evening</i> to tell her about the incident. None of Maribujo's conflicting accounts, on the other hand, matched Bisana's story. In separate instances, Maribujo declared that Bisana told them what he knew only on June 5 or on June 4. In another instance, she maintained that she asked Bisana on the night of June 3. On another occasion, Maribujo claimed that while they were looking for Mylene at the basketball court, they saw Bisana, who then told them about the incident. Indeed, even the prosecution's narration appearing in the Appellee's Brief reveals the discrepancy. The OSG states that Bisana approached Marilyn to tell her about the abduction only on June 5, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In the same breath, it claims that Bisana told Marilyn about it "the following Monday."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>Dolores Santos' Story</i></u></b><br><br>The prosecution also presented Dolores Santos, who allegedly saw Mylene with Boy Topak and found the opportunity to take the child away from him and turn her over to the police.<br><br>On June 4, 1996, she saw appellant holding the hand of Mylene. After observing the two, she realized that the girl might not be under the legitimate care of the man, because of her "tendency" to run away. Thereafter, the child managed to free herself and run away from him. Dolores then instructed her daughter and a companion to follow the child and bring her back. The two complied.

Where the discrepancies pervade the testimonies of prosecution witnesses, such that the totality of the prosecution evidence fails to constitute a coherent account, the conviction of an accused cannot be justified. The Court has held that "[t]he test is whether the testimonies agree on the essential facts and whether the respective versions corroborate and substantially coincide with each other to make a consistent and coherent whole."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Thus, in <i>People v.

In <i>People v.

As earlier stressed, discrepancies pervade each prosecution testimony. For instance, the number of kidnappers is not a minor point, and it is inexplicable why Bisana wavered on whether there were two or three. And when all of the prosecution testimonies are considered together, the Court is invariably confronted with incompatible accounts. Not only is the prosecution evidence afflicted with inconsistencies, it is also beset with improbabilities. Indeed, the proof against the accused must overcome not only "the test of reason and logic, but above all, that of experience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The prosecution failed this test. Clearly, reasonable doubts emerge from the narrations of the three prosecution witnesses.<br><br>Verily, the constitutional presumption of innocence requires courts to take "a more than casual consideration" of every circumstance or doubt favoring the innocence of the accused. In the same vein, courts have the imperative duty to "put prosecution evidence under severe testing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the totality of the prosecution evidence, when put "under severe testing," does not amount to proof beyond reasonable doubt. The Court has taken a "more than casual consideration" of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and has concluded that the inconsistencies therein unmistakably create a reasonable doubt.

On June 5, he was asked by the barangay officials to go to the barangay hall for questioning. The accused claims that during their confrontation, Bisana was unable to identify him as the kidnapper. The boy pointed to him as the perpetrator of the crime, only after the former had been taken out of the room and after some time brought in again by the officials. The accused further alleged that the police then took him in for questioning and subsequently tortured him, a claim he supported with a medical certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He alleges that in order to be relieved from torture, he concocted a story that he threw the child into a creek in Pasay.
