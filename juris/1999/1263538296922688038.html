Or that the arrest was made as a result of a whim.<br><br>We find that the deduction arrived at by the appellant is totally baseless. The police apprehended the eyewitness in compliance with two lawful orders of the trial court. And for the accused-appellant to impute otherwise is uncalled for, as is the implication that while under their custody the witness was coached into pointing an accusing finger at Nomer Velasco.<br><br>Quoted below in full are the orders of the court <i>a quo</i> dated October 12, 1994 and November 22, 1994 explicitly stating why there was a need for the apprehension of the said witness, to wit:<br><br><center>"O R D E R</center><blockquote>"Considering the importance of the prosecution's intended witness Leonardo Lucaban, an eyewitness to the incident who refused to obey the subpoena of this Court despite receipt thereof.<br><br>"Order is hereby given to the WPDC thru any police officer to arrest the person of said Leonardo Lucaban of 410 Radial 10 cor.

The conduct therefore of Lucaban should not be deemed suspect if the only person he recognized at the scene of the crime was Nomer Velasco or if he fails to enlist the help of the drivers or passengers of passing vehicles or for going to a remote tricycle spot instead of, for example, knocking on the doors of the houses in the neighborhood.<br><br>We do not deem the deficiencies made by Lucaban in his testimonies so material as to put the trustworthiness of said witness open to serious doubt. Minor inconsistencies do not impair the essential integrity of the prosecution's evidence as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Moreover discrepancies between sworn statements or affidavits and testimonies made at the witness stand do not necessarily discredit the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The rule is well-settled that the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses presented before it for it had occasion to observe the witnesses' deportment on the stand and the manner in which they gave their testimonies. In fact, it has become a consistent and immutable rule, since more often than not, the appeals relate to the credibility of witnesses, that we are bound by the prevailing doctrine, founded on a host of jurisprudential rulings, to the effect that the matter is best determined at the trial court level where testimonies are "first hand given, received, assessed and evaluated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Thus in the absence of a showing that serious and substantial errors were committed by the lower court in the appraisal of the evidence before it, factual findings, particularly, the trial judge's assessment of the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses are accorded great weight and respect<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and treats it with finality.<br><br>We have perused the records of this case and we find, as the lower court did, that the testimony of the lone eyewitness Leonardo Lucaban is clear, straightforward and worthy of belief.<br><br>It is well-settled rule that the defense of alibi, admittedly, the weakest defense, cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Leonardo Lucaban testified that he personally knows Nomer Velasco.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"Q </td><td width="95%">Prior to that incident, you know personally this Nomer Velasco?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td><p>Yes, sir.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">"COURT</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>Why do you know him?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td> Because once I have recruited him as one of my workers.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">"COURT</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>What is your work?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td> Cutting of log, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td><p>You are really sure that it was this Nomer Velasco whom you saw stab the victim?</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td>It seems he was really the one.

His wife corroborates this. However, in this instance, we have to take the word of his wife with a grain of salt for witnesses who are either wives or mothers of the accused, in almost all instances, would freely perjure themselves for the sake of their loved ones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In the light of the positive identification made by an eyewitness who admittedly has no grudge against the accused-appellant the defense of alibi put up by the latter does not hold water.<br><br>It is the burden of the accused not only to prove that he was not at the scene of the crime when it happened but also that it was impossible for him to be there at the time of the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>This test the accused-appellant failed. Rosemarie Velasco, the wife of the accused, testified that the distance of their house from the scene of the crime is a mere twenty meters. The distance between these two locations is not so great that it would have been impossible for the accused-appellant to be present at the scene of the crime.<br><br>Accused-appellant avers that the recall of the witness had no basis and was made with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>We disagree. In the case of <b><i>Arce, et al. vs. Arce, et al.</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> it was held that if, after hearing all the evidence adduced by the parties, the trial Judge is not satisfied, he may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, on his own motion and in furtherance of justice, call additional witnesses or recall some of the same witnesses, for the purpose of questioning them himself, in order to satisfy his mind with reference to particular facts or issues involved in the case.<br><br>Treachery or <i>alevosia</i> qualified the killing of Danilo Valencia to murder committed by the accused. There is <i>alevosia</i> when a person is unexpectedly attacked from behind, depriving him of any opportunity to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>The following circumstances show that the accused-appellant indeed committed the killing by treacherous means: He engaged the victim into a conversation, brief though it may be. From that conversation he gleaned that the victim was not carrying a weapon. Assured that the victim was unarmed the accused-appellant then followed the victim and stabbed him at the back.<br><br>The assailant was known to the victim for he used to be under the latter's employ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Unsuspecting of the assailant's evil plans the latter continued to walk away. The attack was so sudden that it gave the victim no chance to defend himself or to retaliate. Moreover the safety of the assailant from defensive or retaliatory attacks coming from the victim was ensured because the latter was unarmed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision of the court <i>a quo</i> is hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Bellosillo (Chairman), Puno, Mendoza,</i> and <i>Quisumbing, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Orig.
