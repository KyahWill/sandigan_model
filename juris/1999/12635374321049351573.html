				<BR><STRONG>QUISUMBING, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On October 15 to 17, 1997, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) conducted a judicial audit and physical inventory of pending cases in Branch 162, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, in view of the compulsory retirement of its presiding judge, Judge Manuel S. Padolina, on November 5, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The audit team found that as of October 15, 1997, there were 183 pending cases in Branch 162. Only 11 of these cases had been submitted for decision and of the 11, two had already gone beyond the 90-day reglementary period for deciding cases as provided for by the Constitution. The audit team also discovered that - (1) motions and other matters for resolution remained pending in 21 cases; (2) trials were ongoing or hearing dates had been set for 76 cases; (3) no further action had been taken in nine cases after a considerable length of time; and (4) warrants of arrest or summonses had been issued in connection with 45 cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>After the cases actually examined were compared with the cases in the docket books, the audit team discovered that the records of 34 cases were not shown to it, thus, the team members' failure to determine the status thereof.<br><br>Monitoring of Pasig City trial courts was also conducted during the period between October 15 to 17, 1997.<br><br>Six Regional Trial Court branches were found to have very light caseloads as of September 30, 1997. These are Branches 152, 154, 156, 159, 160 and 167, with caseloads ranging from 51 to 100.<br><br>Two Metropolitan Trial Court judges were found holding sessions only in the afternoons, in violation of Administrative Circular No. 13, dated July 1, 1987, which provides:<br><blockquote>"1. <i>Punctuality</i> <i>and strict observance of office hours</i>.-Punctuality in the holding of scheduled hearings is an imperative. Trial judges should strictly observe the requirement of <i>at least eight hours of service a day</i>, five hours of which should be devoted to trial, specifically from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 to 4:30 p.m. as required by par. 5 of the <i>Interim Rules</i> issued by the Supreme Court on January 11, 1983, pursuant to Sec. 16 of BP 129." (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>This is reiterated in Administrative Circular No. 1, dated January 28, 1988, which states:<br><blockquote>"2.1. All Presiding Judges are directed to comply strictly with the guidelines established in Circular No. 13, July 1, 1987, on <i>punctuality and observance of office hours</i> x x x." (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>In addition, according to Executive Judge Ma. Cristina J. Cornejo, many court employees arrive late in the office. Judge Cornejo suggested that the Pasig City MeTC be provided with a bundy clock.<br><br>In its report dated January 30, 1998, the OCA recommended the following:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">(1) </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Impose a fine of P10,000.00 against Judge Manuel S.

He explained that city prosecutors and public attorneys who appear in his sala have conflicting schedules as regards their RTC assignments. He also pointed out that there is only one city prosecutor assigned to all the five branches of the Pasig MeTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Judge Morallos added that he spends his mornings drafting decisions, orders, and resolutions. He said his sala has 1,080 cases and he wants to reduce this number. He needs more time to decide the cases within the prescribed period.<br><br>He also hears election and land registration cases during morning sessions. MeTC Branch 70's two stenographers also transcribe their notes during mornings, according to Judge Morallos. He also said that, as of the date of his letter, his courtroom is undergoing renovation and construction work during mornings cannot be avoided.<br><br>Judge Morallos said his caseload is still manageable; the cases can be "handled well" even if hearings are done only in the afternoons.<br><br>Likewise, in a letter dated August 10, 1998, Judge Eugenio D. Mendinueto explained to the Court that he conducts sessions only in the afternoons for the following reasons: (1) the trial prosecutor and public attorney assigned to his sala have other commitments in the mornings and are, thus, unable to attend morning hearings in his sala; (2) the two stenographers assigned to his sala can hardly cope with their work. It was only on June 25, 1998 that Judge Mendinueto endorsed to the Office of the Court Administrator the application of one applicant for stenographer in his sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Atty. Aileen C. Sabarre-Garma, Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 162, RTC, Pasig City also wrote to the court as regards the status of several cases assigned to Branch 162.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Court referred the matter to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation. In a report dated October 27, 1998, the OCA made the following recommendations:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">(1) </td><td width="95%"><p align="justify">Request Justice Secretary Serafin A.

Daily trials at a minimum of five hours per working day of the week will enable the judge to calendar as many cases as possible and to dispose with regular dispatch the increasing number of litigations pending with the court. All other matters needing the attention of the judge are to be attended to outside of this five-hour schedule of trial."</blockquote>Judges are reminded that circulars prescribing hours of work are not just empty pronouncements. They are there for the purpose of promoting efficiency and speed in the administration of justice, and require prompt and faithful compliance by all concerned.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>in view of the foregoing --<br><br>(1) The Secretary of Justice, Hon.
