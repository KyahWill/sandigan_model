				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petition before the Court is for certiorari&nbsp; to nullify a decision&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; National Labor&nbsp;&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; Commission&nbsp;&nbsp; which modified&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Labor&nbsp;&nbsp; Arbiter&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; petitioner, in addition to reinstating&nbsp; respondents, to pay them backwages not to exceed two (2) years.<br><br>The facts may be related as follows:<br><br>Private respondents were regular employees of petitioner, a company engaged in the business of plywood lamination with narra flitches as the principal raw material.<br><br>On March 7, 1991, private respondents filed with the Office of&nbsp; the Labor Arbiter, National Capital Region, Manila,&nbsp; a complaint against petitioner for unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, harassment, violation of labor standards and underpayment of wages.<br><br>On April 17, 1991, respondent amended the complaint with the addition of more complainants.<br><br>On June 25, 1991, respondent further amended the complaint by limiting the case to illegal dismissal only.<br><br>On July 23, 1991, petitioner filed its answer to the amended complaint stating that respondents were not dismissed or terminated; however, they did not report for work.<br><br>On December 3, 1991, the Labor Arbiter rendered decision&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; to&nbsp; report for work and petitioner to re-accept them to their former or substantially equal position without backwages.<br><br>On December 27, 1991, private respondents appealed the decision to the National Labor Relations Commission.<br><br>On September 30, 1993, the National Labor Relations Commission promulgated a decision modifying that of the Labor Arbiter. In addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; requiring&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; reinstate&nbsp;&nbsp; private&nbsp; respondent,&nbsp; the Commission directed petitioner to pay respondents back wages not to exceed two (2) years.<br><br>Hence, the present recourse.<br><br>We grant the petition.<br><br>As found by the Labor Arbiter, there was no evidence that private respondents were dismissed from employment. Nor were they prevented from returning to their work. It was only complainantsâ€™ unsubstantiated conclusion that they were dismissed. In fact, petitioner expressed willingness to accept back private respondents to their former positions. The payment of back wages will&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; required&nbsp;&nbsp; only&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; an&nbsp;&nbsp; employee&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; unjustly or illegally dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Backwages are granted on grounds of equity to workers for earnings lost due to their illegal dismissal from work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Consequently, we find that the National Labor Relations Commission gravely abused its discretion in ordering backwages to be paid to private respondents.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby&nbsp; SETS ASIDE the decision of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Labor&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; dated September 30, 1993, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; December&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1993,&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; NLRC&nbsp; NCR&nbsp; Case&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 002752-92.
