respondents' Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution of this Court
dated January 4, 1999 temporarily restraining the execution of petitioner and
Supplemental Motion to Urgent Motion for Reconsideration.  It is the submission of public respondents
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1)  The Decision in
this case having become final and executory, its execution enters the exclusive
ambit of authority of the executive authority.  The issuance of the TRO may be construed as trenching on that sphere of
executive authority;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  The  issuance  of  the temporary restraining
order x x x creates dangerous precedent as there will never be an end to
litigation because there is always a possibility that Congress may repeal a
law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)  Congress had earlier
deliberated extensively on the death penalty bill.  To be certain,  whatever
question may now be raised on the Death Penalty Law before the present Congress
within the 6-month period given by this Honorable Court had in all probability
been fully debated upon x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)  Under the time honored
maxim lex futuro, judex praeterito, the law looks forward while the judge looks
at the past, x x x  the Honorable Court
in issuing the TRO has transcended its power of judicial review.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)  At this moment,
certain circumstances/supervening events transpired to the effect that the
repeal or modification of the law imposing death penalty has become nil, to
wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.4in;">a.  The public pronouncement of President
Estrada that he will veto any law imposing the death penalty involving heinous
crimes.</p>

<p class="2Q">b.  The resolution of
Congressman Golez, et al., that they are against the repeal of the law;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.4in;">c.  The fact that Senator Roco's resolution to
repeal the law only bears his signature and that of Senator Pimentel."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In their
Supplemental Motion to Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, public respondents
attached a copy of House Resolution No. 629 introduced by Congressman Golez
entitled "Resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representative
to reject any move to review Republic Act No. 7659 which provided for the re-imposition
of death penalty, notifying the Senate, the Judiciary and the Executive
Department of  the position of the House
of Representatives on this matter, and urging the President to exhaust all
means under the law to immediately implement the death penalty law."  The Resolution was concurred in by one
hundred thirteen (113) congressmen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In their Consolidated Comment,
petitioner contends:  (1)  the stay order x x x  is within the scope of judicial power and
duty and does not trench on executive powers nor on congressional
prerogatives;  (2)  the exercise by this Court of its power to
stay execution was reasonable;  (3)  the Court did not lose jurisdiction to
address  incidental  matters  involved or arising from the petition; (4)  public respondents are estopped from challenging the Court's
jurisdiction; and (5)  there is no
certainty that the law on capital punishment will not be repealed or modified
until Congress convenes and considers all the various resolutions and bills
filed before it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Prefatorily, the Court likes to
emphasize that the instant motions concern matters that are not incidents in
G.R. No. 117472, where the death penalty was imposed on petitioner on automatic
review of his conviction by this Court.  The instant motions were filed in  this  case, G.R. No. 132601,
where the constitutionality of R.A. No.  8177  (Lethal Injection Law)  and  its implementing rules and regulations was assailed by petitioner.  For this reason, the Court in its Resolution
of January 4, 1999 merely noted the Motion to Set Aside of Rodessa
"Baby" R. Echegaray dated January 7, 1999 and Entry of Appearance of
her counsel dated January 5, 1999. Clearly, she has no legal standing to
intervene in the case at bar, let alone the fact that the interest of the State
is properly represented by the Solicitor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We shall now resolve the basic
issues raised by the public respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.  We do not
agree with the sweeping submission of the public respondents that this Court
lost its jurisdiction over the case at bar and hence can no longer restrain the
execution of the petitioner.  Obviously, public respondents are invoking the rule that final judgments
can no longer be altered in accord with the principle that "it is just as
important that there should be a place to end as there should be a place to
begin litigation."</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> To  start  with, the Court is not changing even  a comma  of its  final Decision.  It is appropriate to examine with precision the metes and bounds
of the Decision of this Court that became final.  These metes and bounds are clearly spelled out in the <b>Entry
of Judgment</b> in this case, <i>viz</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ENTRY OF JUDGMENT</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is to certify that on <u>October 12, 1998</u> a decision
rendered in the above-entitled case was filed in this Office, the dispositive
part of which reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">`WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED insofar as petitioner seeks to
declare the assailed statute (Republic Act No. 8177) as unconstitutional; but
GRANTED insofar as Sections 17 and 19 of the Rules and Regulations to Implement
Republic Act No. 8177 are concerned, which are hereby declared INVALID because
(a) Section 17 contravenes Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by
Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659; and (b)  Section 19 fails to provide for review and approval of the Lethal Injection
Manual by the Secretary of Justice, and unjustifiably makes the manual
confidential, hence unavailable to interested parties including the
accused/convict and counsel.  Respondents are hereby enjoined from enforcing and implementing Republic
Act No. 8177 until the aforesaid Sections 17 and 19 of the Rules and

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
records will show  that before the Entry
of Judgment, the Secretary of Justice, the Honorable Serafin Cuevas, filed with
this Court on October 21, 1998 a <b>Compliance</b> where he submitted the
Amended Rules and Regulations implementing R.A. No. 8177 in compliance with
our  Decision.  On October 28, 1998, Secretary Cuevas submitted a Manifestation
informing the Court that he has caused the publication of the said Amended
Rules and Regulations as required by the Administrative Code.  <b>It is  crystalline that the Decision of this Court that became final and unalterable
mandated</b>:  (1)  that R.A. No. 8177 is not unconstitutional;
(2)  that sections 17 and 19 of the
Rules and Regulations to Implement R.A. No. 8177 are invalid, and (3)  R.A. No.  8177 cannot be enforced and implemented until sections 17 and 19 of the
Rules and Regulations to Implement R.A. No. 8177 are amended.  It is also daylight clear that this Decision
was <b>not altered </b>a whit by this Court.  <b>Contrary to the submission of the Solicitor General, the rule on
finality of judgment cannot divest this Court of its jurisdiction to execute
and enforce the same judgment.</b>  Retired Justice Camilo Quiason synthesized the  well established jurisprudence on this issue as follows:</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><b>"the finality of a judgment does

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In truth, the argument of the
Solicitor General has long been rejected by this Court.  As aptly pointed out  by the petitioner,  as early as 1915, this Court has unequivocably ruled in the  case of  <b>Director of Prisons v.

<blockquote>"This Supreme Court has repeatedly declared in various
decisions, which constitute jurisprudence on the subject, that in criminal
cases, after the sentence has been pronounced and the period for reopening the
same has elapsed, the court cannot change or alter its judgment, as its
jurisdiction has terminated . . .  When
in cases of appeal or review the cause has been returned thereto for execution,
in the event that the judgment has been affirmed, it performs a ministerial
duty in issuing the proper order.  But <b>it
does not follow from this cessation of functions on the part of the court with
reference to the ending of the cause that the judicial authority terminates by
having then passed completely to the Executive.</b>  The particulars of the execution itself, which are certainly not
always included in the judgment and writ of execution, in any event are absolutely
under the control of the judicial authority, while the executive has no power
over the person of the convict except to provide for carrying out of the
penalty and to pardon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Getting down to the solution of the question in the case at bar,
which is that of execution of a capital sentence, <b>it must be accepted as a
hypothesis that postponement of the date can be requested.  There can be no dispute on this point.  It is a well-known principle that
notwithstanding the order of execution and the executory nature thereof on the
date set or at the proper time, the date therefor can be postponed, even in
sentences of death.</b>  Under the
common law this postponement can be ordered in three ways:  (1)  By command of the King; (2)  by
discretion (<i>arbitrio)</i> of the court; and (3)  by mandate of the law.  It
is sufficient to state this principle of the common law to render impossible
that assertion in absolute terms that after the convict has once been placed in
jail the trial court can not reopen the case to investigate the facts that show
the need for postponement.  <b>If one of
the ways is by direction of the court, it is acknowledged that even after the
date of the execution has been fixed, and notwithstanding the general rule that
after the (court) has performed its ministerial duty of ordering the execution
. . . and its part is ended, if however a circumstance arises that ought to
delay the execution, and there is an imperative duty to investigate the
emergency and to order a postponement.  </b>Then
the question arises as to whom the application for postponing the execution
ought to be addressed while the circumstances is under investigation and as to
who has jurisdiction to make the investigation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The power to control the execution
of  its decision is an essential aspect
of jurisdiction.  It cannot be the
subject of  substantial subtraction for
our Constitution</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> vests the e<b>ntirety of
judicial power</b> in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may  be estabished by law.  <b>To be sure, the most important part of a
litigation,  whether civil or criminal,
is the  process of execution of
decisions  where supervening events may
change the  circumstance of the parties
and  compel courts to intervene and
adjust the rights of the litigants to prevent unfairness.  It is because of these unforseen,
supervening contingencies that courts have been conceded the inherent and
necessary power of control of its processes and orders to make them conformable
to law and justice</b>.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> For this purpose, Section 6
of Rule 135 provides that "when by law jurisdiction is conferred on a
court or judicial officer, <b>all</b>  auxiliary writs, processes and other means necessary to carry  it into effect may be employed by such court
or officer <b>and if the procedure to be followed  in the exercise of such jurisdiction is not specifically pointed
out by law or by these rules, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be
adopted which appears conformable to the spirit of said law or rules.</b>"  It bears repeating that what the Court
restrained temporarily is the execution of its own Decision to give it  reasonble time to check its fairness in
light of supervening events in Congress as alleged by petitioner.  The Court, contrary to popular
misimpression, did not restrain the effectivity of a law enacted by Congress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The  more disquieting dimension of the submission of the public
respondents that this Court has no  jurisdiction to restrain the execution of petitioner  is that it can  diminish the independence of the judiciary.  Since the implant of republicanism in our
soil, our courts have been conceded the jurisdiction  to enforce their  final
decisions.  In accord with this
unquestioned jurisdiction, this Court promulgated rules concerning pleading,
practice and procedure  which, among
others, <b>spelled out the rules on execution of judgments.  These rules  are all predicated on the assumption that courts have the inherent,
necessary  and incidental power to  control and supervise  the process of execution of their decisions.</b>  Rule 39 governs execution, satisfaction and
effects of judgments in civil cases.  Rule 120 governs judgments in criminal cases.  <b>  It should be stressed
that  the power to promulgate rules of
pleading, practice and procedure was granted  by our Constitutions to this Court to enhance its independence,</b> for
in the words of Justice Isagani Cruz "without independence and integrity,
courts will lose that popular trust so essential to the maintenance of their
vigor as champions of justice."</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Hence, our Constitutions
continuously vested this power to this Court for it enhances its
independence.  Under the <b>1935</b> <b>Constitution</b>,
the power of this Court to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and
procedure  was granted<b> but it
appeared to be co-existent with legislative power for it was  subject to the power of Congress to repeal,
alter or supplement</b>.  Thus, its
Section 13, Article VIII provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 13.  The Supreme
Court shall have the power to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice
and procedure in all courts, and the admission to the practice of law. Said
rules shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade and shall not diminish,
increase, or modify substantive rights. The existing laws on pleading, practice
and procedure are hereby repealed as statutes, and are declared Rules of Court,
subject to the power of the Supreme Court to alter and modify the same. <b>The
Congress shall have the power to repeal, alter or supplement the rules
concerning pleading, practice and procedure, and the admission to the practice
of law in the Philippines.</b>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The said power of Congress,
however,  is not as absolute as it may
appear on its surface.  In <b>In re
Cunanan</b></span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Congress  in the exercise of its power to amend rules
of the Supreme Court regarding admission to the practice of law, enacted the
Bar Flunkers Act of 1953</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> which considered as a
passing grade, the average of 70% in the bar examinations after July 4, 1946 up
to August 1951 and 71% in the 1952 bar examinations.  <b>This Court struck down the law  as unconstitutiona</b>l.  In his ponencia, Mr. Justice Diokno held that "x x x the disputed
law is not a legislation; it is a judgment - a judgment promulgated by this
Court during the aforecited years affecting the bar candidates concerned; and
although this Court certainly can revoke these judgments even now, for
justifiable reasons, it is no less certain that <b>only this Court</b>, and not
the legislative nor executive department, that may do so. Any attempt on the
part of these departments would be a clear usurpation of its function, as is
the case with the law in question."</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The venerable jurist
further ruled:  "It is obvious,
therefore, that the ultimate power to grant license for the practice of law
belongs <b>exclusively</b> to this Court, and the law passed by Congress on the
matter is of permissive character, or as other authorities say, merely to fix
the minimum conditions for the license."  <b>By its ruling, this Court  qualified  the absolutist tone of
the power of Congress</b> to "repeal, alter or supplement the rules
concerning pleading, practice and procedure, and the admission to the practice
of law in the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The ruling of this Court in <b>In
re Cunanan</b>  was not changed by
the  <b>1973 Constitution</b>.  For the <b>1973 Constitution reiterated</b>

is to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, it is inutile to urge, as
public respondents do, that this Court has no jurisdiction to control the
process of execution of its decisions, a power conceded to it and which it has
exercised since time immemorial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

exercise of his statutory powers, as well as renders nugatory the
constitutional guarantee that recognizes the people's right to information of
public concern, <b>and (b) to ask this Honorable Court to provide the
appropriate relief.<o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The non-disclosure of the
date of execution deprives herein respondent of vital information necessary for
the exercise of his power of supervision and control over the Bureau of
Corrections pursuant to Section 39, Chapter 8, Book IV of the Administrative
Code of 1987, in relation to Title III, Book IV of such Administrative  Code, insofar as the enforcement of Republic
Act No. 8177 and the Amended Rules and Regulations to Implement Republic Act
No. 8177 is concerned and for the discharge of the mandate of seeing to it that
laws and rules relative to the execution of sentence are faithfully observed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
willful omission to reveal the information about the precise day of execution
limits the exercise by the President of executive clemency powers pursuant to
Section 19, Article VII (Executive Department) of the 1987 Philippine
Constitution and Article 81 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, which
provides that the death sentence shall be carried out `without prejudice to the
exercise by the President of his executive clemency powers <u>at all times</u>."  (Underscoring supplied)  For instance, the President cannot grant
reprieve, <i>i.e.,</i> postpone the execution of a sentence to a day certain (<i>People
v. Vera</i>, 65 Phil. 56, 110 [1937]) in the absence of a precise date to
reckon with.  The exercise of such
clemency power, at this time, might even work to the prejudice of the convict
and defeat the purpose of the Constitution and the applicable statute as when
the date of execution set by the President would be earlier than that  designated by the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the deliberate
non-disclosure of information about the date of execution to herein respondent
and the public violates Section 7, Article III (Bill of Rights) and Section 28,
Article II (Declaration of Principles and State Policies) of the 1987
Philippine Constitution which read:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">SEC. 7.  The right of the
people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized.  Access to official records, and to documents
and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as
to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be
afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.</p>

<p class="2Q">SEC. 28.  Subject to
reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a
policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public
interest.</p>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The `right to information'
provision is self-executing. It supplies 'the rules by means of which the right
to information may be enjoyed (Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional
Limitations, 167 [1972]) by guaranteeing the right and mandating the duty to
afford access to sources of information.  Hence, the fundamental right therein recognized may be asserted by the
people upon the ratification of the Constitution without need for any ancillary
act of the Legislature (<i>Id</i>., at p. 165)  What may be provided for by the Legislature are reasonable conditions
and limitations upon the access to be afforded which must, of necessity, be
consistent with the declared State policy of full public disclosure of all
transactions involving public interest (Constitution, Art. II, Sec. 28).  However, it cannot be overemphasized that
whatever limitation may be prescribed by the Legislature, the right and the
duty under Art. III, Sec. 7 have become operative and enforceable by virtue of
the adoption of the New Charter."  (Decision of the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> in <i>Legaspi v. Civil
Service Commission</i>, 150 SCRA 530, 534-535 [1987]."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The same motion to compel Judge
Ponferrada to reveal the date of execution of petitioner Echegaray was filed by
his counsel, Atty. Theodore Te, on December 7, 1998. He invoked his client's
right to due process and the public's right to information.  <b>The Solicitor General, as counsel for
public respondents, did not oppose petitioner's motion on the ground that this
Court has no more jurisdiction over the  process of execution of Echegaray. </b>  This Court granted the relief prayed for by the Secretary of
Justice and by  the counsel of the petitioner
in its Resolution of December 15, 1998. There was not a whimper of protest from
the public respondents and they are now <b>estopped</b> from contending that
this Court has lost its jurisdiction to grant said relief. The  jurisdiction of this Court does not depend
on the convenience of litigants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.  We likewise
reject the public respondents' contention that the "decision in this case
having become final and executory, <b>its execution enters the exclusive ambit
of authority of the executive department x x x.  By  granting the TRO, the
Honorable Court has in effect granted reprieve which is an executive function.</b>"</span><a style="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Public respondents cite as
their authority  for this proposition,
Section 19, Article VII of the Constitution which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in
this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and
pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final
judgment.  He shall also have the power
to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the members of the
Congress."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The text and tone of this
provision will not yield to the interpretation suggested by the public
respondents. The provision  is <b>simply  the source of power</b> of the President to
grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons and remit fines and forfeitures
after conviction by final judgment.  It
also provides the authority for the President to grant amnesty with the
concurrence of a majority of all the members of the Congress.  The provision, however, cannot be  interpreted  as denying the power of courts to control the enforcement  of their decisions after their finality.  <b>In truth, an accused who has been
convicted by final judgment still possesses  collateral  rights and these
rights can be claimed in the appropriate courts.</b> For instance, a death
convict who becomes insane after his final conviction cannot be executed while
in a state of insanity.</span><a style="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> As observed by Antieau,
"today, it is generally assumed that due process of law will prevent the
government from executing the death sentence upon a person who is insane at the
time of execution."</span><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The suspension of such a
death sentence is  undisputably an
exercise of judicial power.  It is not a
usurpation of the presidential power of reprieve though its effect is the same
-- the temporary suspension of the execution of the death convict.  In the same vein, it cannot be denied that
Congress  can at any time  amend  R.A. No. 7659 by reducing the penalty of death to life imprisonment. The
effect of such an amendment is like that of commutation of sentence. But
by  no stretch of  the imagination can the exercise by Congress
of its plenary  power  to  amend laws be considered as a violation of the power of the President to
commute final  sentences of conviction.  <b>The powers of the Executive, the
Legislative and the Judiciary to save the life of a death convict do not
exclude each other for the simple reason that there is  no higher right than the right to life.</b>  Indeed, in various States in the United
States, laws have even been enacted expressly granting courts the power to
suspend execution of convicts and their constitutionality has been upheld over
arguments that they infringe upon the power of the President to grant
reprieves.  For the public respondents
therefore to contend that only the Executive can protect the right to life of
an accused after his final conviction is  to  violate the principle of
co-equal and coordinate powers of the three branches of our government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Third</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.  The Court's
resolution temporarily restraining the execution of petitioner must be put in
its <b>proper perspective </b>as it has been <b>grievously distorted especially
by those who make a living by vilifying courts.</b>  Petitioner filed his Very Urgent Motion for Issuance of TRO on <b>December
28, 1998 </b>at about 11:30 p.m.  He
invoked several grounds, viz:  (1) that
his execution has been set  on January
4, the first working day of 1999; (b)  that members of Congress had either sought for his executive clemency
and/or review or repeal of the law authorizing capital punishment; (b.1)  that Senator Aquilino Pimentel's resolution
asking  that clemency be granted to the
petitioner and that capital punishment be reviewed has been concurred by
thirteen (13) other senators; (b.2) Senate President Marcelo Fernan and Senator
Miriam S. Defensor  have publicly
declared they would seek a review of the death penalty law; (b.3)  Senator Raul Roco has also sought the repeal
of  capital punishment, and (b.4)  Congressman Salacrib Baterina, Jr., and
thirty five (35) other congressmen are demanding review of the same law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When the  Very Urgent Motion was filed, the Court was already in its
traditional recess and would only resume session on January 18, 1999. Even
then, Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. called the Court to a Special Session
on January 4, 1999</span><a style="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> at 10. a.m. to deliberate
on petitioner's Very Urgent Motion.  The
Court hardly had five (5) hours to resolve petitioner's motion as he was due to
be executed at 3 p.m.  Thus, the Court
had the difficult problem of  resolving  whether petitioner's allegations about the
moves in Congress to repeal or amend the Death Penalty Law are mere <b>speculations
or not.</b>  To the Court's majority,
there were good reasons why the Court should not immediately dismiss
petitioner's allegations as mere speculations and surmises.  They  noted that  petitioner's
allegations were made in a pleading <b>under oath</b> and were widely
publicized in the print and broadcast media.  It was also of judicial notice that the 11th Congress is a <b>new
Congress and has no less than one hundred thirty (130) new members whose views
on capital punishment are still unexpressed</b>. The present Congress is  therefore different from the  Congress that enacted the Death Penalty Law
(R.A. No. 7659) and the Lethal Injection Law (R.A. No. 8177).  In contrast, the Court's minority felt that
petitioner's allegations  lacked clear
factual bases.  There was hardly a time
to verify petitioner's allegations as his execution was set at 3 p.m.  And verification from Congress was impossible
as  Congress was not  in session. Given these constraints, the
Court's majority  did not rush to
judgment but took an <b>extremely cautiou</b>s stance by temporarily
restraining the execution of petitioner. The <b>suspension was temporary</b> -
- - "until June 15, 1999, coeval with the constitutional duration of the
present regular session of Congress,<b> unless it sooner becomes certain that
no repeal or modification of the law is going to be made</b>."  The extreme caution  taken by the Court was compelled, among
others,  by the fear that <b>any error
of the Court in not stopping the execution of the petitioner  will preclude any further relief for  all rights stop at the graveyard.</b>  As life was at stake, the Court refused to
constitutionalize haste and the hysteria of some partisans.  The Court's majority felt it needed the
certainty that  the legislature will not
change the circumstance of petitioner as alleged by his counsel.  It was believed that law and equitable
considerations demand no less before allowing the State to take the life of one
its citizens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In their Supplemental Motion to
Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, the Solicitor General cited House Resolution
No. 629 introduced by Congressman Golez entitled "Resolution expressing the
sense of the House of Representatives to reject any move to review R.A. No.
7659 which provided for the reimposition of death penalty, notifying the
Senate, the Judiciary and the Executive Department of the position of the House
of Representatives on this matter and urging the President to exhaust all means
under the law to immediately implement the death penalty law."  The Golez resolution was signed by 113
congressmen as of January 11, 1999.  In
a marathon session yesterday that extended up to 3 o'clock in the morning, the
House of Representatives with minor amendments formally adopted the Golez
resolution by an overwhelming vote.  House Resolution No. 25 expressed the sentiment that the House "x x
x does not desire at this time to review Republic Act 7659." In addition,
the President has stated that he will not request Congress to ratify the Second
Protocol in view of the prevalence of heinous crimes in the country.  In light of these developments,  the Court's TRO should  now be lifted as it has served its legal and
humanitarian purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sure, any debate, even  if it is no more

in a democracy.  <b>But when the debate

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><sup><span style="">SEPARATE OPINION<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">PANGANIBAN,<i> J</i>.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I agree with the Court’s
Resolution that, without doubt, this Court has jurisdiction to issue the
disputed Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on January 4, 1999.  I will not repeat its well-reasoned
disquisition.  I write only to explain
my vote in the context of the larger issue of the death penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the solicitor
general has demonstrated that Congress will not repeal or amend RA 7659 during
its current session which ends on June 15, 1999 and that, in any event, the
President will veto any such repeal or amendment, the TRO should <i>by its own
terms</i> be deemed lifted now.  However, my objections to the imposition of the death penalty transcend
the TRO and permeate its juridical essence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I maintain my view that
RA 7659 (the Death Penalty Law) is unconstitutional insofar as some parts
thereof prescribing the capital penalty fail to comply with the requirements of
“heinousness” and “compelling reasons” prescribed by the Constitution of the Philippines.</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;">*</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span><span style="">This I have repeatedly stated in my
Dissenting Opinions in various death cases decided by the Court, as well as
during the Court’s deliberation on this matter on January 4, 1999.  For easy reference, I hereby attach a copy
of my Dissent promulgated on February 7, 1997.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, I cannot
now vote to lift the TRO, because to do so would mean the upholding and
enforcement of a law (or the relevant portions thereof) which, I submit with
all due respect, is unconstitutional and therefore legally nonexistent.  I also reiterate that, in my humble opinion,
RA 8177 (the Lethal Injection Law) is likewise unconstitutional since it merely
prescribes the manner in which RA 7659 (the Death Penalty Law) is to be
implemented.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Having said that, I
stress, however, that I defer to the rule of law and will abide by the ruling
of the Court that both RA 7659 and RA 8177 are constitutional and that the
death penalty should, by majority vote, be implemented by means of lethal
injection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">FOR THE ABOVE REASONS, I
vote to deny the solicitor general’s Motion for Reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><sup><span style="">SEPARATE OPINION<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">VITUG, <i>J.</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let me state at the
outset that I have humbly maintained that <b>Republic Act No. 7659, insofar as
it prescribes the death penalty, falls short of the strict norm set forth by
the Constitution</b>.  I am some of my
brethren on the Court, who hold similarly, have consistently expressed this
stand in the affirmance by the Court of death sentences imposed by Regional
Trial Courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its resolution of 04
January 1999, the Court resolved to issue in the above-numbered petition a
temporary restraining order (“TRO”) because, among other things, of what had
been stated to be indications that Congress would re-examine the death penalty
law.  <b>It was principally out of
respect and comity to a co-equal branch of the government, i.e., to reasonably
allow it that opportunity if truly minded, that motivated the Court to grant,
after deliberation, a limited time for the purpose.<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">The Court, it must be
stressed, did not, by issuing the TRO, thereby reconsider its judgment
convicting the accused or recall the imposition of the death penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The doctrine has almost
invariably been that after a decision becomes final and executory,  nothing else is further done except to see
to its compliance since for the Court to adopt otherwise would be to put no end
to litigations.  The rule
notwithstanding, the Court retains control over the case until the full
satisfaction of the final judgment conformably with established legal
processes.  Hence, the Court has taken
cognizance of the petition assailing before it the use of lethal injection by
the State to carry out the death sentence.  In any event, jurisprudence teaches that <b>the rule of immutability of
final and executory judgments admits of settled exceptions.  Concededly, the Court may, for instance,
suspend the</b> <b>execution of a final judgment when it becomes imperative in
the higher interest of justice or when supervening events warrant it</b>.</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Certainly, this extraordinary relief cannot be denied
any man, whatever might be his station, whose right to life is the issue at
stake.  The pronouncement in Director of
Prisons vs. Judge of First Instance of Cavite,</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> should be instructive.  Thus –<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“This Supreme Court has repeatedly declared in various decisions,
which constitute jurisprudence on the subject, that in criminal cases, after
the sentence has been pronounced and the period for reopening the same has
elapsed, the court can not change or alter its judgment, as its jurisdiction
has terminated,<i> functus est officio suo,</i> according to the classical
phrase.  When in cases of appeal or
review the cause has been returned thereto for execution, in the event that the
judgment has been affirmed, it performs a ministerial duty in issuing the
proper order.  <b>But it does not follow
from this cessation of functions on the part of the court with reference to the
ending of the cause that the judicial authority terminates by having then
passed completely to the executive.  The
particulars of the execution itself, which are certainly not always included in
the judgment and writ of execution, in any event are absolutely under the
control of the judicial authority, while the executive has no power over the
person of the convict except to provide for carrying out the penalty and to
pardon.<o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Getting down to the solution of the question in the case at bar,
which is that of execution of a capital sentence, it must be accepted as a
hypothesis that postponement of the date can be requested.  There can be no dispute on this point.  <b>It is a well-known principle that,
notwithstanding the order of execution and the executory nature thereof on the
date set or at the proper time, the date therefor can be postponed, even in
sentences of death.</b>  Under the
common law this postponement can be ordered in three ways: (1) By command of
the King; (2) by discretion (<i>arbitrio</i>) of the court; and (3) by mandate
of the law.  It is sufficient to state
this principle of the common law to render impossible the assertion in absolute
terms that after the convict has once been placed in jail the trial court can
not reopen the case to investigate the facts that show the need for
postponement.  If one of the ways is by
direction of the court, <b>it is acknowledged that even after the date of the
execution has been fixed, and notwithstanding the general rule that after the
Court of First Instance has performed its ministerial duty of ordering the
execution, <i>functus est officio suo</i>, and its part is ended, if however a
circumstance arises that ought to delay the execution, there is an imperative
duty to investigate the emergency and to order a postponement.</b><i>  </i>x x x.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
fine, the authority of the Court to see to the proper execution of its final
judgment, the power of the President to grant pardon, commutation or reprieve,
and the prerogative of Congress to repeal or modify the law that could benefit
the convicted accused are not essentially preclusive of one another nor
constitutionally incompatible and may each be exercised within their respective
spheres and confines.  Thus, the stay of
execution issued by the Court would not prevent either the President from
exercising his pardoning power or Congress from enacting a measure that may be
advantageous to the adjudged offender.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I am hopeful,
nevertheless, that Congress will in time find its way clear to undertaking a
most <b>thorough</b> and <b>dispassionate</b> re-examination of the law not so
much for its questioned wisdom as for the need to have a second look at the
conditions <i>sine qua non</i> prescribed by the Constitution in the imposition
of the death penalty.  In People vs.
Masalihit,</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> in urging, with all due respect, Congress to consider
a prompt re-examination of the death penalty law, I have said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<b>The determination of when to prescribe the death penalty
lies, in the initial instance, with the law-making authority, the Congress of
the Philippines, subject to the conditions that the Constitution itself has set
forth;<i> viz</i>: (1)  That there must
be <u>compelling reasons</u> to justify the imposition of the death penalty;
and (2)  That the capital offense must
involve a <u>heinous crime</u>.  It
appears that the fundamental law did not contemplate a simple ‘reimposition’ of
the death penalty to offenses theretofore already provided in the Revised Penal
Code or, let alone, just because of it.  The term ‘compelling reasons’ would indicate to me that there must first
be a marked change in the milieu from that which has prevailed at the time of
adoption of the 1987 Constitution, on the one hand, to that which exists at the
enactment of the statute prescribing the death penalty, upon the other hand,
that would make it distinctively inexorable to allow the re-imposition of the
death penalty.  Most importantly, the
circumstances that would characterize the ‘heinous nature’ of the crime and
make it so exceptionally offensive as to warrant the death penalty must be
spelled out with great clarity in the law, <i>albeit</i> without necessarily
precluding the Court from exercising its power of judicial review given the
circumstances of each case.</b>  To
venture, in the case of murder, the crime would become ‘heinous’ within the
Constitutional concept, when, to exemplify, the victim is unnecessarily
subjected to a painful and excruciating death or, in the crime of rape, when
the offended party is callously humiliated or even brutally killed by the
accused.  The indiscriminate imposition
of the death penalty could somehow constrain courts to apply, perhaps without
consciously meaning to, stringent standards for conviction, not too unlikely
beyond what might normally be required in criminal cases, that can, in fact,
result in undue exculpation of offenders to the great prejudice of victims and
society.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Today, I reiterate the
above view and until the <b>exacting standards</b> of the Constitution are
clearly met as so hereinabove expressed, I will have to disagree, most
respectfully, with my colleagues in the majority who continue to hold the
presently structured Republic Act No. 7659 to be in accord with the Constitution,
an issue that is fundamental, constant and inextricably linked to the
imposition each time of the death penalty and, like the instant petition, to
the legal incidents pertinent thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accordingly, <b>I vote
against the lifting of the restraining order of the Court </b>even as I, like
everyone else, however, must respect and be held bound by the ruling of the
majority.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
