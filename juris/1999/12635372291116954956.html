five (5) meters away from where she lived.  There he asked her to pick lice off his head; she complied.  But later, he told her to lie down in bed as
he stripped himself naked.  He removed
her panty and placed himself on top of her.  Then he inserted his penis into her vagina.  He covered her mouth with his hand to prevent her from shouting
as he started gyrating his buttocks.  He
succeeded in raping her four (4) times on the same day as every time his penis
softened up after each intercourse he would make it hard again and insert it

<blockquote><i>The crux of accused’s defense is that he was not in the place of
the alleged rape in Abanico, Puerto Princesa City when this allegedly
happened.  He denied committing the
crime of rape against the young girl, Jane Vasquez.  After having carefully examined and calibrated the evidence on
record, the Court is convinced more than ever that the accused Edwin Ladrillo
indeed repeatedly raped or sexually abused Jane Vasquez, a girl who was then
only five (5) years old.  This Court has
no reason to doubt the veracity of the testimony of Jane Vasquez given the
straightforward clarity and simplicity with which it was made.  It is highly improbable that a young, 8-year
old girl would falsely testify that her own cousin, the accused herein, raped
her.  She told her mother:  “Ma, hindi ka maniwala sa akin na ang utin
ni Kuya Edwin ay ipinasok sa kiki ko.” Jane also described that after the intercourse
and as the penis of the accused softened, the latter would make it hard again
and then inserted it again into her vagina and this was made four (4)
times.  Jane’s testimony has all the
characteristics of truth and is entitled to great weight and credence.  The Court cannot believe that the very young
victim is capable of fabricating her story of defloration.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

family; (b) finding him guilty of rape considering that the prosecution failed
to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt; (c) not finding that the
prosecution failed to sufficiently establish with particularity the date of
commission of the offense; (d) giving great weight and credence to the
testimony of the complainant; and, (e) failing to consider the mitigating
circumstance of minority in imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,

of time in the Information clearly violates Sec. 11, Rule 110, of the Rules
Court which requires that the time of the commission of the offense must be

accused-appellant has to virtually account for his whereabouts.  Hence, the failure of the prosecution to
allege with particularity the date of the commission of the offense and, worse,
its failure to prove during the trial the date of the commission of the offense
as alleged in the Information, deprived accused-appellant of his right to
intelligently prepare for his defense and convincingly refute the charges

demurrer filed by the accused, holding that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>In the case before us the statement of the time when the crime
is alleged to have been committed is so indefinite and uncertain that it does not
give the accused the information required by law.  To allege in an information that the accused committed rape on a
certain girl between October 1910 and August 1912, is too indefinite to give
the accused an opportunity to prepare for his defense, and that indefiniteness
is not cured by setting out the date when a child was born as a result of such
crime.  Section 7 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure does not warrant such pleading.  Its purpose is to permit the allegation of a date of the
commission of the crime as near to the actual date as the information of the
prosecuting officer will permit, and when that has been done any date may be
proved which does not surprise and substantially prejudice the defense.  It does not authorize the total omission of a
date or such an indefinite allegation with reference thereto as amounts to the
same thing.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her for five (5) minutes despite her

could not remember the month or year when the alleged rape occurred, and yet,
she readily recalled the incident when she was whipped by accused-appellant
with a belt that hit her vagina after she was caught stealing mangoes. <o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>Certainly, time is not an
essential ingredient or element of the crime of rape.  However, it assumes importance in the instant case since it
creates serious doubt on the commission of the rape or the sufficiency of the
evidence for purposes of conviction.  The Information states that the crime was committed &quot;on or about
the year 1992,&quot; and complainant testified during the trial that she was

Puerto Princesa City, a town different from Abanico, Puerto Princesa City, and
had never been to Abanico at any time in 1992 nor was he familiar with the

impossible for accused-appellant to have committed the crime of rape in 1992 <u>at
his house in Abanico, Puerto Princesa City</u>, on the basis of the prosecution
evidence, as he was not yet residing in Abanico at that time and neither did
his family have a home there.  The

court to the effect that it was not physically impossible to be in Abanico from
Liberty when the crime charged against him was committed, is manifestly
incongruous as it is inapplicable.  The

far from each other, both being within the city limits of Puerto Princesa, and

it was physically impossible for accused-appellant to travel all the way to

style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> The answers of Dr.
Aquino to subsequent questions propounded by the prosecutor were very uncertain
and inconclusive. To questions like, &quot;Is she a virgin or not?&quot; and
&quot;So you are now saying that Jane Vasquez was actually raped?&quot; the answers
of Dr. Aquino were, &quot;I cannot tell for sure, your Honor.&quot; &quot;That
is a big probability,&quot; and, &quot;Very likely.&quot;</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>It is clear from the
foregoing that the prosecution likewise failed to establish the medical basis
for the alleged rape.  The failure of
Dr. Aquino to make an unequivocal finding that complainant was raped and that
no healed wound or laceration was found on her hymen seriously affects the
veracity of the allegations of the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><i><u><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>Third</span></u></i><span
style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>, from her testimony, complainant would have
this Court believe that while she was being raped accused-appellant was holding
her hand, covering her mouth and gripping his penis <u>all at the same time</u>.  Complainant’s narration is obviously
untruthful.  It defies the ordinary
experience of man.  The rule is elementary
that evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible
witness but must be credible in itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>And <i><u>fourth</u></i>,
complainant reported the alleged rape to her mother only in 1994 or two (2)
years after its occurrence.  It hardly
conforms to human experience that a child like complainant could actually keep
to herself such a traumatic experience for a very long time.  Perhaps it would have been different if she
were a little older and already capable of exercising discretion, for then, concealment
of the rape committed against her would have been more readily explained by the
fact, as in this case, that she was probably trying to avoid the embarrassment
and disrepute to herself and her family.  Children, on the other hand, are naturally more spontaneous and candid,
and usually lack the same discretion and sensibility of older victims of the
same offense.  Thus, the fact that
complainant, who was only five (5) years old when the supposed rape happened,
concealed her defilement to her mother for two (2) years seriously impairs her
credibility and the authenticity of her story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>We are not unmindful of
the fact that a child of tender years, like complaining witness herein, could
be so timid and ignorant that she could not narrate her ordeal accurately.  But the mind cannot rest easy if this case
is resolved against accused-appellant on the basis of the evidence for the
prosecution which, as already discussed, is characterized by glaring
inconsistencies, missing links and loose ends that refuse to tie up.  The rule that this Court should refrain from
disturbing the conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses,
does not apply where, as in the instant case, the trial court overlooked certain
facts of substance or value which if considered would affect the outcome of the
case; or where the disputed decision is based on misapprehension of facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>Denial and alibi may be
weak but courts should not at once look at them with disfavor.  There are situations where an accused may
really have no other defenses but denial and alibi which, if established to be
the truth, may tilt the scales of justice in his favor, especially when the
prosecution evidence itself is weak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>Let it be made clear,
however, that this opinion does not necessarily signify acceptance of
accused-appellant’s version of the incident.  If complainant was indeed sexually abused, this view should not be
considered a condonation of what was done, as it was indeed reprehensible.  This only indicates that reasonable doubt
has been created as to accused-appellant’s guilt. Consequently, under the
prevailing judicial norm, accused-appellant is entitled to acquittal.  To reiterate, there is in his favor the
constitutional presumption of innocence, which has not been sufficiently dented.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>Rape is a very emotional
word, and the natural human reactions to it are categorical:  sympathy for the victim and admiration for
her in publicly seeking retribution for her outrageous misfortune, and
condemnation of the rapist.  However,
being interpreters of the law and dispensers of justice, judges must look at a
rape charge without those proclivities and deal with it with extreme caution
and circumspection.  Judges must free
themselves of the natural tendency to be overprotective of every woman decrying
her having been sexually abused and demanding punishment for the abuser.  While they ought to be cognizant of the
anguish and humiliation the rape victim goes through as she demands justice,
judges should equally bear in mind that their responsibility is to render
justice based on the law.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn22' href="#_edn22"
