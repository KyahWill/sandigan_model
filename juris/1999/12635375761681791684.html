The case was later transferred to Branch 47 of the same court at Urdaneta.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the case for murder was assigned to Branch 46 of the court, also at Urdaneta. On motion of accused-appellants, the case was consolidated with the carnapping case pending before Branch 47 of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants, who had pleaded not guilty to the charge of carnapping when the case was still pending in Branch 38 at Lingayen, likewise pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder. Thereafter, the two cases were jointly tried.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At the initial presentation of evidence by the prosecution relative to the carnapping case before Branch 38 at Lingayen, Pangasinan, three witnesses testified for the prosecution. Their testimonies are summarized in the following portion of the decision of the trial court:<br><blockquote>1) ROCKY ECLERA, 16 years old, a resident of San Vicente West, Asingan, Pangasinan, testified that on 11 April 1994 at about 7:00 A.M., while he and the accused ALEX HORA, ALEX PANIDA and ERNESTO ECLERA were at the Poblacion of Asingan, Pangasinan, ALEX HORA invited the group to go to San Manuel, Pangasinan. They took a motorized tricycle for their ride from Asingan to San Manuel. It was driven by ANDRES ILDEFONSO.<br><br>Somewhere in Barangay Lomboy, San Manuel, a more or less deserted place, accused ALEX HORA ordered the tricycle driver to stop the vehicle. Suddenly and unexpectedly ALEX HORA repeatedly stabbed the tricycle driver with the use of a knife. Afterwards when the driver appears to be still alive, hit the head of the driver with stone. Thereafter, Alex Hora called the witness and the others, and they boarded the same tricycle with Alex Hora as the driver.<br><br>They proceeded to the irrigation dike at Macalong, Urdaneta, Pangasinan. At such place, ALEX HORA, with the help of ALEX PANIDA and ERNESTO ECLERA detached the sidecar. After the sidecar was detached, they (all four of them) boarded the motorcycle and went to Balite, Tarlac.<br><br>They stayed at Tarlac for three days and three nights. On the third day, upon his urging, he was accompanied by accused ALEX PANIDA to Urdaneta, Pangasinan. At Urdaneta, he parted ways with Alex Panida.<br><br>Accused ALEX HORA and ERNESTO ECLERA were left behind at Tarlac.<br><br>In connection with the cases, he remembered having executed a sworn statement given at the police station at Asingan, Pangasinan. He identified a xerox copy of the same and admitted having signed the statement (EXHIBITS "D", and "D-1", the same exhibit was marked in evidence by the accused as EXHIBIT "1").<br><br>He identified pictures of a motorcycle and a sidecar. The pictures admittedly show the motorcycle stolen and the sidecar that was detached.<br><br>2) ROMULO DE VERA, 38 years old, market vendor, married and a resident of San Nicolas, Agoo, La Union, testified that on May 2, 1994, he saw accused ALEX HORA with VIOLETA BAUTISTA talking with his uncle, Alfredo Gali. The latter informed him that Alex Hora and Violeta Bautista were mortgaging to him a motorcycle, but he does not have money. So Alex Hora and Violeta Bautista pleaded that he instead take the mortgage. The two were badly in need of money. He agreed.<br><br>The motorcycle allegedly was first mortgaged to one Mariano Kuan, a resident of San Nicolas Central, Agoo, La Union for P2,000.00. So what they did was to first pay Mariano Kuan the mortgage obligation of P2,000.00. He gave ALEX HORA another P2,000.00, as he was willing to give P4,000.00 only for the mortgage.<br><br>He and ALEX HORA executed a mortgage document notarized by Arturo dela Rosa. Alex Hora signed for the registered owner Gilbert Eclera because the latter was allegedly arrested at Dagupan City, precisely it was for this predicament that they needed the money.<br><br>On May 22, 1994, police officers from Asingan, Pangasinan accompanied by a police officer from Agoo, went to his place looking for a motorcycle which was allegedly lost. He admitted that the motorcycle that they were looking for was in his possession. It was brought to the police station of Agoo. Thereat, he signed a document known as RECEIPT OF CONFISCATION.<br><br>3) ALFREDO GALI, 64 years old, married, retired government employee, and a resident of San Nicolas Norte, Agoo, La Union, testified that on 02 May 1994, ALEX HORA and Violeta Bautista went to his residence and offered to mortgage a motorcycle. Since he did not have money at that time, when he saw his nephew Romulo de Vera passed by, he called him and informed him of the purpose of Alex Hora and Violeta Bautista. He asked if Romulo had money. The latter answered in the affirmative. So they went to a notary public. At the office of the Notary Public, ALEX HORA and ROMULO DE VERA signed a mortgage document. He was there to witness the mortgage. He saw the parties signed the document. (Citations omitted)</blockquote>The prosecution wanted to present Rocky Eclera<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as witness also in the murder case, but he could not be served with subpoena. Despite an order issued by the trial court for his arrest, the prosecution was not able to present him as witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> For this reason, the prosecution simply adopted the testimony of Rocky Eclera in Criminal Case No. U-8202 (carnapping) as its evidence in the murder case. The defense did not object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The prosecution then presented two additional witnesses, whose testimonies are set forth in the trial court's decision, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>The other witness presented by the prosecution with respect to the carnapping case was SYLVIA ECLERA, 38 years old, married and a resident of Poblacion, Asingan, Pangasinan.

Together with some elements of PNP Asingan, they proceeded to Agoo, La Union. The motorcycle was in the possession of one Romulo de Vera. The latter claimed that the motorcycle was mortgaged to him by one Alex Hora, one of the accused in these cases. This Romulo de Vera showed her a written mortgage contract or Salda in Ilocano, which was the same as Exh. "A". For the recovery of the motorcycle, she was asked to sign a receipt by Romulo de Vera.<br><br>In connection with the funeral and church services of her deceased driver, she spent about P20,650.00.

While they were in San Manuel, they asked Alex Hora where they were going and he just said: "Just keep quiet and I will tell you later."<br><br>They were not able to reach the place of Alex Hora's friend because Alex Hora stabbed the tricycle driver. They got off the tricycle to pacify Alex Hora but he faced them menacingly.

They make capital of the fact that Rocky categorically stated that they did not have any part in detaching the sidecar and in killing the victim but, on the contrary, even tried to stop Hora from committing the crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Hora, on the other hand, questions the reliability of Rocky Eclera's testimonies and sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which he claims are inconsistent and conflicting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Hora points out the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote>(1) Rocky Eclera testified in his testimony in the carnapping case that Alex Hora asked the driver to stop the tricycle, then he repeatedly stabbed the driver. (TSN, Nov. 15, 1994, pp. 4, 10). While in his testimony for the defense of accused Alex Panida and Ernesto Eclera, accused Alex Hora repeatedly stabbed the driver while the tricycle was still running. (TSN, February 12, 1996, p. 13).<br><br>(2) In the carnapping case, accused-appellant Alex, with the help of Panida and Ernesto Eclera, detached the side car of the motorcycle (TSN, Nov. 15, 1994, p. 5) while in his testimony for the defense, it was only Alex Hora who detached the side car (TSN, Feb. 12, 1996, p. 23).<br><br>(3) In his testimony during the stabbing of the driver by Alex Hora, the other co-accused alighted from the tricycle and tried to pacify Alex Hora (TSN, Nov. 15, 1994, p. 10) while in his testimony for the defense, at the time that Alex Hora was stabbing the driver, the two co-accused were inside the tricycle (TSN, 12 February 1994, pp. 17-19).<br><br>(4) In his testimony for the defense of accused Panida and Eclera, Rocky Eclera recanted his implication of the said two co-accused in the killing of the tricycle driver in his sworn statement given to the Asingan PNP and pointed to accused-appellant Alex Hora as the only solely responsible for the crimes committed.</blockquote>Moreover, he claims that his account of what happened on April 11, 1994 is more credible than that of accused-appellants Panida and Ernesto Eclera and witness Rocky Eclera.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Thus, put simply, accused-appellants Alex Panida and Ernesto Eclera, on the one hand, and accused-appellant Alex Hora, on the other, accuse each other of the crimes. They do not claim that other persons were involved. Neither is there any dispute as to the relevant facts. On the contrary, all of them agree that --<br><br>· They were together in the morning of April 11, 1994, immediately prior to the commission of the crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>· They all rode on the tricycle driven by the victim to go to San Manuel where the latter was killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>· The victim was stabbed several times as the autopsy report states.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>· They were all present when the victim was stabbed; no one else was with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>· After the stabbing, all of them rode on the tricycle to go to Urdaneta where the sidecar was detached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>· After the sidecar had been detached, they all rode on the motorcycle to go to Tarlac where they stayed together for three (3) more days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>· Not one of accused-appellants reported the matter to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Hora tries to extricate himself by claiming that he did not know what the others (Alex Panida and Ernesto Eclera) were planning to do and that he was so shocked he fainted at the sight of Andres Ildefonso being killed. However, he could have escaped from the two. Instead, he stayed with them for three more days after the commission of the crimes. Even more telling is the fact that he was the one who mortgaged the very motorcycle taken from the victim, which he admits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, accused-appellants Panida and Ernesto Eclera claim it was accused-appellant Hora who alone killed the victim and detached the sidecar from the motorcycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, when asked why they did not leave accused-appellant Hora if they did really not agree with what he did despite opportunities to do so, the two merely claimed it was because they were scared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This is incredible as the two of them, with Rocky Eclera, could have easily overpowered accused-appellant Hora. At the very least, they could have escaped from him. After all, there is no showing that accused-appellant Hora guarded them every minute of the day. Accused-appellant Panida in fact admitted they were free to go to any place during the time they were together after the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Moreover, if Ernesto Eclera were to be believed, accused-appellant Hora used two kinds of weapons in stabbing the victim 43 times. This is not, however, likely. That three men inflicted 43 stab wounds with the use of more than one weapon is more plausible than that only one person inflicted such wounds with two different weapons.<br><br>Nor does the claim of accused-appellants Panida and Ernesto Eclera that accused-appellant Hora alone detached the sidecar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> inspire belief. It is not easy to detach a sidecar alone. Moreover, a specific tool is needed in order to unscrew the bolts holding the sidecar to the motorcycle, which cannot be assumed that the victim Andres Ildefonso would normally carry around with him on a normal day while plying his route.<br><br>It is apparent that the respective versions of accused-appellants have only one purpose, to escape liability by laying the blame on the other. Considering the relevant facts, the ineluctable conclusion is that all of accused-appellants are guilty of the two crimes. Indeed, in his statement given earlier to the police, the eyewitness Rocky Eclera named all accused-appellants as the perpetrators of the crimes. It is noteworthy that this statement was presented in evidence not only by the prosecution (Exh. D) but also by all of the accused-appellants (Exh. 1).

In his testimony in court, he pointed to accused-appellant Hora alone as the one who committed the two crimes. However, there are reasons for giving his sworn statement weight and believing that what he said in his sworn statement was the truth ¾ not what he stated in court ¾ as to who were guilty of the crimes. The reasons are:<br><br><i>First.</i> Rocky Eclera claims that his statement was actually made by SPO2 Mababa; that it was not translated to him (Rocky Eclera) in Ilocano; and that he was not informed of his constitutional rights. SPO2 Mababa, however, denied this and likewise pointed out that Rocky Eclera was actually accompanied to the police station by his father and Vice Mayor Guillermo Piso of the Municipality of Asingan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Rocky's father in fact urged Rocky to tell the truth according to Vice Mayor Piso.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Vice Mayor Piso himself also debunked Rocky's claims that he did not make the statement in question and that he was simply asked to sign it without first having it explained to him in the Ilocano dialect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>With respect to the claim that Eclera's statement was obtained by the police without giving him the Miranda warnings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> suffice it to say that the statement, as quoted above, shows that he was warned of his rights. At all events, the reliance on Art. III, §12 of the Constitution is baseless since the statement is not being used against the person who made it. It is not in fact a confession of guilt on Rocky's part.<br><br>Indeed, there is nothing in the record to show that Rocky ever complained against policemen who allegedly coerced him to give the sworn statement in question or in any way violated his constitutional rights when he appeared before Judge Suller of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Asingan to swear to his statement. Neither does Rocky claim that policemen had ill-motive to implicate accused-appellants Panida and Ernesto Eclera.<br><br><i>Second.</i> The sworn statement was in fact offered in evidence not just by the prosecution as its Exhibit D, but also by all accused-appellants as their Exhibit 1. Moreover, the affiant, Rocky Eclera, was presented as witness by both prosecution and the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> A sworn statement is hearsay only when the affiant is not presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Both sides had opportunity to cross-examine Rocky Eclera. The defense presented Rocky to dispute his own statement, but the trial court, in a well-reasoned decision, supported by evidence on record,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> found Rocky's retraction to be without merit. The determination of the credibility of witnesses is a task best left to trial courts, given their unparalled opportunity for observation of the deportment of witnesses on the stand. For this reason, their findings are accorded great respect in the absence of any compelling reasons for concluding otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><i>Third.</i> Rocky Eclera tried to retract his statement naming all of accused-appellants as the culprits by pointing to accused-appellant Hora alone as the guilty party, because accused-appellants Alex Panida and Ernesto Eclera are his relatives. Rocky's father and Ernesto's father are cousins, while Alex Panida's mother and Rocky's father are likewise cousins.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Rocky Eclera also testified that he is closer to accused-appellants Panida and Ernesto Eclera and that he only recently met accused-appellant Hora.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>This explains why Rocky Eclera refused to testify for the prosecution in the murder case after once testifying in the carnapping case. As the trial court noted:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote>The Court observes that when presented as witness for the accused ALEX PANIDA and ERNESTO ECLERA, Rocky Eclera evinced hesitancy in his answers. He generalized his denials as to inculpatory matters respecting accused ALEX PANIDA and ERNESTO ECLERA as due to his being confused and frightened.<br><br>This witness comparatively, was the youngest of the group. He was only 16 years old when he testified in Lingayen, Pangasinan before Branch 38. After more than one year, he was presented anew not as witness for the prosecution, but as witness for the defense.<br><br>His recantation was not unexpected, considering his reticence and recalcitrance to testify for the State. In fact, during the time that he testified recanting his testimony in Court as well as his damaging and inculpatory declarations in his sworn statement against the other accused Alex Panida and Ernesto Eclera, he oftenly stammered, pondering with difficulty his recantation.<br><br>In recanting having stated that accused Alex Panida and Ernesto Eclera helped detached the side car of the motorcycle as declared in Court, he wants to ascribe falsification in court proceedings. He claims that the testimony was never made.<br><br>The ease with which he ascribes falsification in so far as his cousins are concerned, but with steadfastness in so far as accused ALEX HORA is concerned, reveals he is being manipulated to pollute the truth inceptually disclosed by him in his Sworn Statement.</blockquote><i>Fourth.</i> A witness' prior inconsistent statement can be used to impeach his credibility, but the converse does not necessarily follow. Retractions are disfavored in law. As this Court held in <i>People v. Ubiña</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><blockquote>The theory of the defense that Francisco's previous testimony is false, as he subsequently declared it to be so, is as illogical as it is dangerous. Merely because a witness says that what he had declared is false and that what he now says is true, is not sufficient ground for concluding that the previous testimony is false. No such reasoning has ever crystallized into a rule of credibility. The rule is that a witness may be impeached by a previous contradictory statement; not that a previous statement is presumed to be false merely because the witness now says that the same is not true. The jurisprudence of this Court has always been otherwise, i.e. that contradictory testimony given subsequently does not necessarily discredit the previous testimony if the contradictions are satisfactorily explained. We have also held that if a previous confession of an accused were to be rejected simply because the latter subsequently makes another confession, all that an accused would do to acquit himself would be to make another confession out of harmony with the previous one. Similarly, it would be a dangerous rule for courts to reject testimonies solemnly taken before courts of justice simply because the witnesses who had given them later on change their mind for one reason or another, for such rule would make solemn trials a mockery and place the investigation of truth at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses. If Francisco says that when he testified for the prosecution he was paid P700, what can prevent the court from presuming that subsequently he testified for the defense because the defendants also paid him to testify for them? The rule should be that a testimony solely given in court should not be lightly set aside and that before this can be done, both the previous testimony and the subsequent one be carefully compared, the circumstances under which each given carefully scrutinized, the reasons or motives for the change carefully scrutinized - in other words, all the expedients devised by man to determine the credibility of witnesses should be utilized to determine which of the contradictory testimonies represents the truth. (Citations omitted)</blockquote><i>Fifth.</i> Rocky Eclera's testimony is basically the same as his sworn statement. His testimony that only accused-appellant Hora is guilty can be disregarded and his statement that actually all three accused-appellants committed the crimes believed. For courts may believe one part of the testimony of a witness and disbelieve another part because courts are not required to accept or reject the whole testimony of a particular witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the particular circumstances enumerated above convince us that Rocky's claim that all three accused-appellants participated in the commission of the crimes as embodied in his sworn statement is the truth and is the more credible. Coupled with admissions by accused-appellants themselves which corroborate and dovetail with Rocky's sworn statement and testimony in relevant aspects, including the elements of the crimes, they fully justify the trial court in giving much weight to Rocky's story in his sworn statement.<br><br><i>The Existence of Conspiracy</i><br><br>The evidence on record indeed indicates, as the trial court correctly found, that there was conspiracy in the case at bar.<br><br>Conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence and may be inferred from the conduct of all the accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In the present cases, the totality of the evidence shows that: accused-appellants together took the tricycle driven by the victim; they were all present at the time of the killing and the taking of the tricycle; the victim was stabbed several times and they were all there when it happened; after the killing, all of the accused-appellants rode the tricycle to Urdaneta and then to Tarlac, and stayed together for three days; all of them took part in detaching the sidecar from the motorcycle; all three accused-appellants stabbed the victim; and the victim suffered 43 stab wounds suggesting they were inflicted by more than one person. Clearly, the inevitable conclusion is that accused-appellants acted in concert.<br><br>Conspiracy being present, all of accused-appellants are liable for the crimes in these cases. For where there is conspiracy, evidence as to who among the accused rendered the fatal blow is not necessary. All conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the intent and the character of their participation, because the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It remains to determine whether the prosecution has proven all the elements of both crimes in order to justify conviction of accused-appellants.<br><br><i>Liability of Accused-Appellants for Murder</i><br><br>Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code in part provides:<br><blockquote>Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Art. 246 [parricide], shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.<br><br>. . .<br><br>6. With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person or corpse.</blockquote>The trial court found all of accused-appellants guilty of murder. Indeed, there is no doubt that the unlawful killing of the victim in the present case has been proven. The autopsy report shows that the victim suffered 43 stab wounds and that as a result he died. Accused-appellants themselves and witness Rocky Eclera admitted that the victim was stabbed several times and hit on the head with a big stone to finish him off. They all admit that the body was pulled towards the mountain immediately thereafter. They likewise admit that the victim was merely bringing them to their destination and was caught by surprise when stabbed. There was no claim of self-defense or accident. Thus, the only question to be determined is whether such killing can be considered murder. Accused-appellants Panida and Ernesto Eclera contend that it is homicide, though without specifying the reason why, while the trial court maintains it is murder in view of the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<br><br>To appreciate treachery, two conditions must be present, to wit: (1) the employment of means of execution that give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate and (2) the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In these cases, there is no question that the means of execution employed by accused-appellants was such that the victim had no opportunity to defend himself. The victim was unsuspecting; as far as he was concerned, he was merely taking passengers from one place to another. He was stabbed with suddenness and from behind, leaving him totally defenseless. All these, coupled with the fact that the victim was unarmed and had no opportunity to defend himself, indubitably demonstrate the treacherous nature of the attack.<br><br>As regards the second requisite, the following facts lead us to no other conclusion than that accused-appellants consciously adopted a mode which would ensure the realization of their purpose without danger to themselves: accused-appellants were already carrying weapons when they rode the tricycle; the victim was first stabbed from behind while he was sitting on the tricycle and thus already wounded and disoriented before he was attacked by all the rest; all three accused-appellants attacked him; he was stabbed 43 times; they continued stabbing him even as he was defenseless and begging for his life; lastly, the victim was stabbed on different parts of his body. Accused-appellants could not have inflicted so many wounds and on different parts of the victim's body had they not consciously adopted such manner of attack. The manner in which the victim was killed and the aforementioned external manifestations of accused-appellants clearly show that they consciously and deliberately adopted the particular method or form of attack to insure the accomplishment of their purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>However, we do not agree with the trial court that the killing was committed with cruelty. The trial court considered the number of wounds and the final blow to the head as basis for its finding. But the number of wounds is not a test for determining whether cruelty is present. The test is whether the accused deliberately and sadistically augmented the victim's suffering. Consequently, there must be proof that the victim was made to agonize before he was killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Here, there is no such proof of cruelty.<br><br><i>Accused-Appellants' Liability for Carnapping</i><br><br>Under R.A. No. 6539, as amended, carnapping is defined as "the taking, with intent to gain, of a motor vehicle belonging to another without the latter's consent, or by means of violence against or intimidation of persons or by using force upon things."<br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution has proven through the testimonies of Sylvia Eclera, Rocky Eclera, and accused-appellants themselves that accused-appellants took the tricycle of Sylvia Eclera. Although only accused-appellant Hora appears to have mortgaged the motorcycle, the intent to gain on the part of all the accused-appellants can be inferred from the unlawful taking of tricycle by them. Moreover, it has been held that it is enough that the other accused intended that any one of them should benefit from the taking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><i>Accused-Appellants' Liability for Damages</i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. U-8202 for carnapping, the trial court ordered accused-appellants to pay the spouses Eclera P20,650.00 representing burial and funeral expenses and P5,000.00 representing expenses incurred in the recovery of the motorcycle and the sidecar.<br><br>The evidence in the record fully supports the award of damages concerning these items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. U-8203 for murder, the trial court correctly awarded the heirs of the victim P50,000.00 as indemnity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> When death occurs as a result of a crime, the heirs of the deceased are entitled to the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity for the death of the victim without need of any evidence or proof of damages. The trial court likewise appropriately awarded P50,000.00 as moral damages to the heirs of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In addition, the evidence in the record sufficiently establishes the basis for an award of unearned income to the heirs of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The employer of the victim testified that the latter's monthly income is P3,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The autopsy report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> shows that the victim was 43 years old at the time of his death.

Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, if the offense is punished by a special law, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate penalty, the maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum term shall not be less than the minimum prescribed by the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Thus, the penalty imposed must be a range.<br><br>The charge being simple carnapping, the imposable penalty is imprisonment for not less than 14 years and 8 months and not more than 17 years and 4 months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> There can be no suppletory effect of the rules for the application of penalties under the Revised Penal Code or by other relevant statutory provisions based on, or applicable only to, the rules for felonies under the Code. While it is true that the penalty of 14 years and 8 months to 17 years and 4 months is virtually equivalent to the duration of the medium period of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, such technical term under the Revised Penal Code is not given to that penalty for carnapping. Besides, the other penalties for carnapping attended by the qualifying circumstances stated in the law do not correspond to those in the Code. The rules on penalties in the Code, therefore, cannot suppletorily apply to Republic Act No. 6539 and special laws of the same formulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> For this reason, we hold that the proper penalty to be imposed on each of accused-appellants is an indeterminate sentence of 14 years and 8 months, as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months, as maximum.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta, Pangasinan, Branch 47 in Criminal Case Nos.
