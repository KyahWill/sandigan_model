				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At about 9:00 p.m. in the evening of July 14, 1992, Crisanto Suarez was at home with his wife and seven (7) children when someone called and asked him to come out as he was hiding a firearm. Crisanto, however, kept silent. As he knelt down beside a table and lighted a kerosene lamp, a man barged into the house and shot him in the face. The gunman then rushed out and was seen fleeing with two (2) other companions.<br><br>For the fatal shooting of Crisanto Suarez y Dangan, Jose Biñas @ Nestor Biñas, together with two other unidentified persons described only as John Doe and Peter Doe were charged with Murder in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which alleges –<br><blockquote>“That on or about July 14, 1992, in the Municipality of Sara, province of Iloilo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and helping one another armed with firearms, with deliberate intent and decided purpose to kill by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot Crisanto Suarez y Dangan with the firearm which one of the accused was then provided, inflicting gunshot wounds on the victim’s brain and cervical spine which caused his death immediately thereafter.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.”</blockquote>Upon arraignment, accused assisted by counsel, entered a plea of “not guilty” to the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The case then proceeded to trial after which the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> against the accused, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, there being sufficient proof establishing the guilt of the accused, Jose Biñas alias “Nestor Biñas”, of the crime of murder with which he is charged beyond the shadow of doubt, he is hereby pronounced guilty thereof and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and the accessory penalties as provided in Article 41 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is also directed to indemnify the family of the victim the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>Dissatisfied, accused interposed this appeal alleging that –<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote>I</blockquote></div>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF EMMA SUAREZ AND CRIS SUAREZ, SAID TESTIMONIES BEING INCREDIBLE INSOFAR AS THE IDENTITY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS CONCERNED.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING ANY CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE AND IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED.</blockquote><br>The prosecution’s version of the incident is summed thus by the Solicitor General in the People’s brief:<br><blockquote>“About 9:00 o’clock in the evening of July 13, 1992, Crisanto Suarez, his wife Emma, and their seven (7) children were all asleep at their house in Sara, Iloilo, when they heard a man beckoning from outside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The man was calling for Crisanto, saying “<i>Agi, come out here, you are hiding some firearm[s]</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Crisanto kept silent, but Emma prodded him to go out and check who was it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Crisanto then got up, went out and knelt beside a table to light a kerosene lamp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As he was lighting the lamp, a man suddenly appeared and shot him on the face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Emma saw the face of the gunman who quickly went out and fled with two (2) other companions who were waiting outside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Their son Cris gave chase, but to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They brought Crisanto to the hospital, but he was declared “dead on arrival.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>A few days after the incident, Police officer Rene Castillo of the Iloilo PNP, went to the Suarez home and asked Emma to go with him to the Sara police headquarters to identify the man suspected of killing her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> At the police station, Emma positively identified Jose Biñas alias “Nestor Biñas” as the same person who shot and killed Crisanto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>”</blockquote>Accused-appellant gave a conflicting account of what happened. He denied having perpetrated the charge against him averring that he does not know the victim and that he only came to know the victim’s wife when he was already arrested and put in jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As culled from his testimony, as early as July 1984, he fled Barangay Pasig, Sara, Iloilo and went to Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur to avoid reprisal for shooting one Tony Apaso.[<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">15]</sup> In Alicia, accused-appellant stayed with his uncle Eulogio Tilog for nearly a year helping the latter harvest palay and other crops.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It was sometime in 1985 that he started cultivating a two-hectare farm, also located in Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur which belonged to Rudy Castor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17] </sup>Since he went to Zamboanga del Sur, accused-appellant never went to Sara and was visited on two occasions by his wife in Alicia particularly in 1988 and 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On July 25, 1992, accused-appellant received a letter from his wife telling him to come home to settle his case with Tony Apaso.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On August 1, 1992, accused-appellant, together with Jerril Castor, the son of his landlord who originally also came from Sara, Iloilo, left Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur and boarded a jeep bound for the town of Imelda also situated in the province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> From there, they rode a bus going to Ipil and from Ipil, they boarded another bus going to Dipolog.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>When they arrived in Dipolog, they proceeded to the wharf and at 6:00 p.m., boarded the ship “Don Joaquin” which was headed for Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Upon their arrival in Dumaguete City at 11:00 p.m., they proceeded to the Ceres Terminal and headed for Victorias, Negros Occidental arriving there at 10:00 a.m. of August 2, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In Victorias, they went to the <i>Daanbanua</i> wharf where they rode a motor launch going to Culasi, Ajuy, Iloilo and from there, they proceeded to Sara arriving there at past 4:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Upon their arrival at Sara, Iloilo, accused-appellant learned that his case with Tony Apaso was settled before the Barangay Captain of Pasig<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and that thereafter the same was eventually dismissed by the Third Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Sara in an order dated August 31, 1992 in Criminal Case No. 141-S.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He was arrested by the police on August 14, 1992 for being implicated in the murder of Crisanto Suarez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Jerril Castor corroborated accused-appellant’s story testifying that he came to know the latter in November 1984 when the latter went to his uncle who lived in the Castor land located in Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Accused-appellant first lived with his uncle but in 1985, he tilled a two-hectare portion of the land owned by Jerril’s father<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>and lived in a house which was twenty (20) meters away from Jerril’s place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Accused-appellant cultivated the land up to 1992 when he asked Jerril’s permission to go to Sara, Iloilo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The latter suggested that he and accused-appellant go together inasmuch as he planned to take a vacation at the place of his uncle who lived in Sara.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Jerril narrated that he and accused-appellant left Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur at 6:00 a.m. of August 1, 1992 and took a one-hour jeep ride for Imelda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> From there, they proceeded to Ipil arriving there after about two (2) hours. Thereafter, they moved on to Dipolog arriving there at past 4:00 p.m. after a seven-hour trip.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> From Dipolog, they took a boat bound for Dumaguete City, arriving there at 11:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> They left Dumaguete City at around 1:00 a.m. of the next day and proceeded to Victorias, Negros Occidental arriving there at 10:00 a.m. of August 2, 1992. At 10:30 a.m., they rode a tricycle going to the <i>Daanbanwa</i> wharf where, at 12:00 noon, they took a motor launch bound for Culasi, Ajuy, Iloilo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> They arrived at Culasi at past 2:00 p.m. and from there they hiked towards the highway where they rode a Ceres bus bound for Sara.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> They finally arrived at Sara at about 4:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In sum, accused-appellant disputes his identification by the prosecution eyewitnesses as the assailant of the deceased. Assailing the credibility of Emma Suarez and Cris Suarez, appellant claims that their identification of him as the gunman who fatally shot Crisanto Suarez is ‘highly questionable’.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In professing his innocence, he insists that at the time the killing took place, visibility inside the Suarez house was nil because as the eyewitnesses themselves testified “the first thing that this intruder did upon entering the house was to brush aside the kerosene lamp on top of the table in the sala, thus plunging the house into total darkness.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>We disagree.<br><br>The issues raised by accused-appellant boil down to the primordial question of credibility. As consistently reiterated by this Court, “…[t]he matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> who had the unmatched opportunity to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility by the various <i>indicia</i> available but not reflected in the record. The demeanor of the person on the stand can draw the line between fact and fancy. The forthright answer or the hesitant pause, the quivering voice or the angry tone, the flustered look or the sincere gaze, the modest blush or the guilty blanch – these can reveal if the witness is telling the truth or lying through his teeth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The trial court which had the opportunity to hear directly the testimony of the two prosecution eyewitnesses, gave credence to their assertion that they saw accused-appellant shoot the victim. Time and again, this Court has ruled that “[t]he credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude. Findings of the trial court on such matters are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In this appeal, accused-appellant has not given this Court sufficient reasons to deviate from this doctrine.<br><br>The court <i>a quo</i> “… [o]bserved that while the wife and son appeared to have quite law (<i>sic</i>) educational attainment and intelligence, they appeared however to be frank, sincere, honest, and that they did not have any grudge, hatred or misunderstanding with the accused as for the Court to suspect them to pervert or distort the truth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Indeed, their testimonies were consistent in their material points and indubitably established the identity of the triggerman as herein accused-appellant Jose Biñas.<br><br>Emma Suarez, one of the prosecution’s eyewitnesses testified as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">“DIRECT EXAMINATION BY ATTY.

In answer to this, Emma, replied that the moon was bright.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> But this answer, says accused-appellant, is belied by Cris who said that at that time, no window in the house was open<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>and while there was a moon outside, it was a quarter moon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> whose light ‘would not be so bright’ and could not filter into the house because all the windows were closed.<br><br>These inconsistencies adverted to by accused-appellant to impeach the credibility of prosecution eyewitnesses Emma Suarez and Cris Suarez are hardly persuasive and will not extricate accused-appellant from his predicament.<br><br>In weighing contradictory declarations and statements, greater weight must generally be given to the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses than to the denials of the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It appears that the victim was shot shortly after he lit a kerosene lamp<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and it has been held that the illumination from a kerosene lamp is sufficient to permit the identification of a malefactor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Furthermore, the eyewitnesses were able to identify the gunman in that span of time the lamp was lit and thereafter when it was suddenly snuffed out, because a startling or frightful experience creates an indelible impression in the mind that can be recalled vividly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Indeed for witnesses of criminal violence, it is even more natural to strive to see the faces and general appearance of the assailants and to observe the manner in which the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Even were we to go along with the argument of accused-appellant that indeed all the windows of the Suarez house were closed, the construction of the house itself which is made up of nipa and bamboo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> usually has interstices between the slats making up its walls which allows light to filter in and to permit identification. In this regard, it must be remembered that –<br><blockquote>“Visibility is indeed a vital factor in the determination of whether or not an eyewitnesses could have identified the perpetrator of a crime. However, it is settled that when conditions of visibility are favorable, and the witnesses do not appear to be biased, their assertion as to the identity of the malefactor should normally be accepted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Illumination produced by kerosene lamp or a flashlight is sufficient to allow identification of persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Wicklamps, flashlights, <i>even moonlight or starlight may, in proper situations be considered sufficient illumination</i>, making the attack on the credibility of witnesses solely on that ground unmeritorious.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote>That Emma and Cris were able to recognize the gunman, can hardly be doubted because relatives of the victim have a natural knack for remembering the face of the assailant and they, more than anybody else, would be concerned with obtaining justice for the victim by the malefactor being brought to the face of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Indeed, family members who have witnessed the killing of a loved one usually strive to remember the faces of the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>As to the inconsistent statements made by the two prosecution eyewitnesses referred to by accused-appellant, it must be borne in mind that there is hardly a witness who can perfectly remember the details of a crime. Human memory is not as unerring as a photograph and a person’s sense of observation is impaired by many factors including the shocking effects of a crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Certainly, a truth-telling witness is not always expected to give an error-free testimony, considering the lapse of time and the treachery of human memory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Errorless testimonies can not be expected especially when a witness is recounting details of a harrowing experience. As long as the mass of testimony jibes on material points, the slight clashing of statements dilute neither the witnesses’ credibility nor the veracity of their testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Verily -<br><blockquote>“… It has been our consistent ruling that minor inconsistencies and contradictions in the declarations of witnesses do not destroy the witnesses’ credibility but even enhance their truthfulness as they erase any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>… The witnesses testifying to the same event do not have to be consistent in every detail as <i>differences in recollection or viewpoints or impressions are inevitable</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></sup> Indeed, if rights were to be lost merely because witnesses, while agreeing on the essential fact, fail to testify harmoniously on all the particulars, a very large proportion of cases involving wrongs would find no redress in law. Hence, <i>variations in the testimony of witnesses</i> on the same side in respect to minor, collateral, or incidental <i>matters do not usually impair the weight of their united testimony to the prominent facts</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote>In sum, the inconsistencies referred to by the defense are inconsequential. The points that mattered most in the eyewitnesses’ testimonies were their presence at the <i>locus criminis</i>, their identification of the accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime and their credible and corroborated narration of accused-appellant’s manner of shooting Crisanto Suarez. To reiterate, inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses that refer to insignificant details do not destroy their credibility. Such minor inconsistencies even manifest truthfulness and candor erasing any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> In further attempting to destroy his identification by the two eyewitnesses, accused-appellant insists that a policeman named Rene del Castillo who “was moving heaven and earth to see to it that accused-appellant is convicted”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> orchestrated his identification. Accused-appellant claims that this policeman supplied his name to the eyewitnesses suggesting that accused-appellant, who was then already detained, was the gunman even going to the extent of telling Cris Suarez to point at him at the time he was in jail. Accused-appellant in effect says that his identification by the two eyewitnesses is doubtful because they did not know his name. As pointed out by this Court in <i>People v. Verzosa</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><blockquote>“This is puerile reasoning. Identification of a person is not established solely through the knowledge of the name of a person. <i>Familiarity with physical features particularly those of the face, is actually the best way to identify a person. One may be familiar with the face but not necessarily the name. It does not follow, therefore, that to be able to identify a person, one must first know his name</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Moreover, it is completely illogical to equate and limit positive identification to a knowledge of the real names of the culprits since more often than not, robbers victimize people who are complete strangers to them and who do not know them by face or name purposely to avoid being recognized and positively identified.”</blockquote>At any rate, it can be readily seen from the quoted excerpts of the testimonies of Emma and Cris that the inconsistencies pointed out by accused-appellant hardly dents the unanimity and the uniformity of their declarations that he shot the victim in the face at close range. Given the foregoing fact, it has been ruled that the credibility of such witnesses is not impaired where there is a consistency in relating the principal occurrence and the positive identification of the assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> In any case, the records bear out the fact that during the trial both Emma Suarez and Cris Suarez were able to clarify their averments and despite the grueling cross-examination they were both subjected to, they managed to consistently and credibly maintain their version of what actually happened.<br><br>All told, an overall scrutiny of the records of this case leads us to no other conclusion but the correctness of the trial court in holding that accused-appellant is guilty of murder. What remains to be determined is whether the elements of the crime of murder has been established.<br><br>At the time the crime was committed on July 14, 1992, murder was punishable by <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Treachery is alleged in the information charging accused-appellant of the crime. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The essence of <i>alevosia</i> is a swift and unexpected attack on the unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the victim’s part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The fact that treachery may be shown if the victim is attacked from behind does not mean it can not also be appreciated if the attack is frontally launched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Even a frontal attack can be treacherous when it is sudden and the victim is unarmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In this case, the suddenness of the shooting without the slightest provocation from the victim who was unarmed and had no opportunity to defend himself, clearly qualified the crime with treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Given the prevailing facts of the case, the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and dwelling must likewise be appreciated in the perpetration of the crime considering that nighttime facilitated the commission of the felony and the evidence shows that accused-appellant and his cohorts took advantage of the darkness to successfully consummate their nefarious plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Dwelling on the other hand is clear from the forcing open of the main door<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> of the Suarez house and the violation of the sanctity of privacy of the victim’s home by trespassing therein with violence or against the will of the owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> It has been said in this regard that –<br><blockquote>“The home is a sort of sacred place for its owner. He who goes to another’s house to slander him, hurt him or do him wrong, is more guilty than he who offends him elsewhere.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></blockquote>It, however, is unnecessary to consider evident premeditation although this has likewise been alleged in the information for the trial court itself did not consider this circumstance much less discuss its presence or absence in the case under scrutiny. In any event for evident premeditation to be appreciated, there must be proof, as clear as the evidence of the crime itself, of the following elements thereof, to wit: 1.] the time the accused decided to commit the crime; 2.] an overt act manifestly indicating that he clung to his determination; and, 3.] sufficient lapse of time between the decision and the execution to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequence of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In this case, the records are bereft of any evidence of any of the above requisites of evident premeditation. There is absolutely no proof of the time accused-appellant decided to commit the crime. Neither is there any showing how the accused-appellant Jose Biñas planned the killing of Crisanto Suarez. Nor is there any showing how much time elapsed before executing his plan. Absent all these, evident premeditation can not be appreciated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Neither may conspiracy be inferred from the facts of the case. There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The existence of a conspiracy may be inferred and proved through acts of the accused that point to a common purpose, a concert of action and a community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> There is no evidence in this case that accused-appellant conspired with his other two unidentified companions to kill the victim. The fact alone that these two unidentified companions waited outside when accused-appellant barged into the house of the victim can not support a conclusion that they shared in the criminal intent of accused-appellant to kill the victim.<br><br>Considering the presence of two aggravating circumstances with no mitigating circumstance, the maximum penalty of death would be imposable under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> However, since the offense was committed during the suspension of the imposition of the death penalty and prior to its re-imposition under Republic Act No. 7659, the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> This penalty is single and indivisible, thus, it shall be imposed regardless of any attending aggravating or mitigating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>The civil indemnity awarded by the trial court must likewise be sustained as the same is in accordance with prevailing case law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is AFFIRMED in all respects.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan</i>, and <i>Pardo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Record, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 115-123.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, 23 April 1993, p. 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> TSN, 21 May 1993, p. 8; 23 April 1993, pp. 20-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, 23 April 1993, p. 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, 21 May 1993, p. 8.1<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> TSN, 23 April 1993, pp. 10, 24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> TSN, 8 April 1994, pp. 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> pp. 3-4, 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 10, 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 6-7, 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 10-13; Exhibits 1 &amp; 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 20, 24-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> TSN, 8 February 1994, pp. 3-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., pp. 3-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 5,<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <i>Id</i>., pp. 11-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <i>Id</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <i>Id.,</i> p. 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Appellant’s brief, p. 12<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Appellant’s brief pp. 9, 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> People v.
