				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the recent case of People vs. Dimapilis,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court spared a convicted accused from the penalty of death because the information charging him with rape <b>mistakenly </b>alleged the victim to be his stepdaughter. The latter, it turned out later when the evidence came in, was the daughter of one with whom the accused merely had a common-law relationship. Here again, for a like thesis, another convicted felon would cheat the extreme punishment of death.<br><br>The accused, Reynaldo Poñado, was charged with three counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code in consonance with the amendatory provisions of Republic Act ("R.A.") No. 7659. The corresponding information read:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 3529 -<br><blockquote>"The undersigned Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Albay, upon written complaint of the offended party, Merinor Bombales, hereby accuses the person of REYNALDO POÑADO of the crime of RAPE defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act 7659, committed as follows, to wit:<br><blockquote>"That on September 8, 1996 at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening, at Sitio Tibangray, Brgy.

Upon agreement of the prosecution and the defense, a joint trial was conducted by the court <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>The spouses Marcelino Bombales and Librada Rectin, 43 years old, had four legitimate children, namely, Maria Ana, Danilo, Merinor, and Marlon. Rectin broke up with and separated from her husband in 1985 when their youngest child was barely six months old. About two years later, Librada started living with appellant, bringing with her the four children, <i>initially</i> in Tablon, <i>then</i> in San Vicente, of the town of Oas, Albay. Reynaldo Poñado himself had four children, Victor, Alvin, Hedgi, and Rosalie, begotten with his wife, since deceased. The union between Poñado and Rectin bore three more children, namely Mark, Andrew, and Angelica.<br><br>Merinor Bombales, also known as Marilou and a grade six pupil of San Vicente Elementary School, is the complainant in the three criminal cases.<br><br>The young Merinor looked up to accused Reynaldo Poñado like a "stepfather" from the time the latter started to care for the family following the separation of her biological father, Marcelino Bombales, from her mother. Narrating the first incident, she testified that at about seven o'clock in the evening of 08 October 1995, she was at home, alone with three-month old Andrew and the accused, studying her lessons for the next school day. Her mother Librada, Marlon and Mark were watching television at a neighbor's house. Ana and Danilo were not in town. Unexpectedly, the accused came in to her room. Without too much ado, he undressed her, made her lie on the bed and then laid on top of her. The accused inserted his penis into her vagina, and there was nothing that she could do about it but cry. She could not shout because the accused covered her mouth. The sexual assault was repeated on 08 September 1996, while she was again alone in the house studying. The accused went into her room, undressed her and made her lie on the bed. He kissed her on the lips and then on the breast down to the vagina until finally taking her. Like before she could only suffer the ordeal in silence. On 07 October 1996, not much different from the two previous occasions, the accused again took the victim in similar fashion. She tried to resist by closing her legs but the accused persisted. He parted her legs, pulled her to the bed and tied her hands and feet with a rope. The accused repeatedly kissed her before entering her.<br><br>On 08 October 1996, the day following the third incident, she went to school as usual but this time she spoke to her classmates and her teachers, Mrs. Aquid, Lea Camba and Mrs. Rempillo, about the sexual molestations she had undergone. The group lost no time in relaying the matter to the barangay officials who, in turn, reported the case to the police.<br><br>The cross-examination gave additional details on the sexual assaults. Merinor testified that during the 07<sup>th</sup> October 1996 incident, the accused held her by the feet, dragged her through the rough cemented floor with her arms touching the surface and then pushed her hard on the bed. He tied her legs and feet with an abaca rope. In the incident of 08 September 1996, she said that she had wanted to go with her mother to watch television but her stepfather did not allow her. Merinor admitted that Victor and his brood were staying with the family at San Vicente around 08 October 1995 and 08 September 1996, and that Victor left their residence only sometime after 07 October 1996. The house in San Vicente, according to her, had two rooms one of which she occupied.<br><br>Dr. Lea Remonte who conducted a medico-legal examination on Merinor on 08 October 1996 gave a fairly exhaustive report on the result of her medical examination. Thus -<br><blockquote>"A medium built individual about 4 ft. and 8 inches tall, weighing 38 kgs., brown complexioned-with above shoulder-length straight hair, clad in white blouse and blue skirt over pink underwear. Patient is conscious, coherent, ambulatory, oriented but most of the time refuses to answer questions.<br><br>"Breast: conical, nipples prominent, pinkish in color, surrounded by areola<br><br>"Abdomen: flat soft, no visible signs of violence such as hematoma or abrasions<br><br>"Genitalia:<br><br>"External Examination: Normal external genitalia, nulliparous introitus, absence of pubic hair over mons pubis.<br><br>"- labia minora slightly projecting beyond the labia majora<br><br>"- clitoris noted, pinkish in color<br><br>"Internal Examination:<br><br>"- Hymen not intact, presence of superficial laceration at 1o'clock position<br><br>"- two fingers inserted with ease<br><br>"- presence of whitish fluid with milk-like consistency coming out of the vaginal canal<br><br>"- absence of blood upon withdrawal of examining finger<br><br>"Obstetrical and Gynecological History:<br><br>"Menarche - at 13 years old date: June 9, 1996<br><br>"Subsequent menses regular, occurring every month.<br><br>"Last Menstrual Period - September 29, 1996 to October 5, 1996."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>In her testimony, Dr. Remonte explained that the "labia minora slightly projecting beyond the labia majora" could have been caused by the passage of clotted menstrual blood, by sexual intercourse or by heavy physical exercise. The presence of a hymenal superficial laceration at a 1 o'clock position and the admission with ease of two fingers when inserted in Merinor's vagina would display a condition consistent with a woman who could have had sexual intercourse. She noted the presence of milk-like fluid coming out of the vaginal canal and upon close examination proved to be "artifacts or debris" not found in the normal discharge of a woman. No spermatozoa, however, nor signs of violence, like hematoma or scratches on the body of Merinor, were noted.<br><br>The accused denied having raped Merinor. He asserted that he was not at home, but in Bacong, Ligao, Albay, during the early evening of 08 October 1995 working with one Celedonio Repeque in fixing the leaking roof of the latter's house. On 08 September 1996, although he was at home that night, he said he could not have raped Merinor since the whole family was there at the time. He gave the same reason to dispute the rape allegedly committed on 07 October 1996. The victim's story, he asseverated, was only concocted and it was really Merinor's own brother, Danilo, who had raped her.<br><br>Artemio Poñado, father of the accused, declared that he had been staying with his son, Nanding (Reynaldo Poñado), in 1993, 1995 and 1996 and on five occasions, he had chanced upon Danilo and Merinor apparently having an illicit affair. On cross-examination, he said that he had failed, however, to tell his son about it due to illness.<br><br>Hadji Poñado, a son of the accused by his deceased wife, testifying for his father, stated that Merinor was like a sister to him although he had known her to be an unfortunate flirt. He intimated that Danilo and Merinor could have been having an illicit relationship. When asked on cross examination why he had thought Merinor to be a flirt, he did not answer but, pressed about it, he explained that Meray was "chasing all the children there."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Assessing the evidence respectively adduced by the prosecution and the defense, the trial court gave this concluding disquisition:<br><blockquote>"After a careful scrutiny of the evidence adduced the Court finds there is not an iota of doubt that the accused Reynaldo Poñado sexually ravished his 14-year old stepdaughter Merinor or Marilou Bombales on three (3) occasions as charged in the three (3) separated informations. It is said that when a woman says she had been raped in effect says all that is necessary to constitute the commission of the offense. This is because human experience tells us, no woman would concoct a story of de[f]loration and allow herself to be subjected to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<br><br>"With the innocence and naivety of a barrio lass, talking sometimes inaudibly with tears in her eyes head bowed, Marilou or Merinor, as she is more popularly called, narrated how from 1993 to 1996 she was abused by her own stepfather, Reynaldo Poñado. In a candid and straightforward manner Merinor described how in October 1995 when almost everybody in their house was out watching TV at their neighbor's house except for 3-month old brother Andrew who was a sleeping, the accused sexually attacked her by covering her mouth she could not shout. Marilou testified that her stepfather again sexually attacked her on September 8 and October 7 both in the same year of 1996 when both her mother, Librada, and brother, Danilo, were in Manila, at 7:00 in the evening when everybody in the house was [a]sleep and all she could do, as her stepfather laid on top of her and satisfied his lust, was cry and cry because her mouth was covered. When on the night of October 7, 1996 again the accused wanted to satisfy his bestial desire, Merinor tried to resist by closing her legs but her stepfather pushed her and pulled her to bed and tied both her hands and feet with an abaca rope and then laid on top of her again and parted her legs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Whereupon, the trial court held the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and ultimately disposed of the case; thus:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration and finding the accused guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of the crime of rape committed against his 14-year old common-law daughter Marilou or Merinor Bombales, the Court hereby sentences Reynaldo Poñado:<br><br>"1. In Criminal Case No. 3529 to suffer the penalty of DEATH; and<br><br>"2. In Criminal Case No. 3530 to suffer the penalty of DEATH; and<br><br>"3. In Criminal Case No. 3531 to suffer the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>"The accused is hereby ordered likewise to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P150,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>"And may God have mercy on his soul.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>With the imposition by the trial court of the death penalty, the records were elevated to this Court for automatic review conformably with Republic Act No. 7659.<br><br>Appellant submits that -<br><br><center>"I</center><blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT (HAS) ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF RAPE ON 3 COUNTS.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>"THE TRIAL COURT (HAS) ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY ON THE ACCUSED CONSIDERING THAT THE DEATH PENALTY LAW VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>The Court affirms the judgment of conviction.<br><br>A careful scrutiny and evaluation of the evidence satisfies the Court that the guilt of appellant has indeed been established beyond reasonable doubt. The young Merinor, who has subjected herself to the rigors of a public trial, allowed herself and her family to suffer humiliation, and agreed to testify in court and thereby relive the outrageous deed done to her, did give a most convincing account of her harrowing experience. Her testimony of the sexual abuse, committed by a person whom she has treated like a second father, is most straightforward and forthright. The Court likewise sees no cogent reason to discard the assessment made by the trial court on Merinor's credibility.

When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br>'The crime of rape shall be punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>'Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>'When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>'When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>'When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.<br><br><b>'The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:</b><br><br>'1. <b>when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender </b>is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity of affinity within the third civil degree, or <b>the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.</b><br><br>'2. when the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.<br><br>'3. when the rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.<br><br>'4. when the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.<br><br>'5. when the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.<br><br>'6. when committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.<br><br>'7. when by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation."</blockquote>The defense, i its Reply Brief, aptly points out, that in all three informations the victim has been stated to be the <b>stepdaughter</b> of the accused; yet, the evidence would indubitably show that Reynaldo Poñado is but a "live-in partner" of the victim's mother, the latter being, in fact, lawfully married to one Marcelino Bombales.<br><br>In People vs. Dimapilis,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court explained:<br><blockquote>"x x x. This Court has successively ruled<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that the circumstances under the amendatory provisions of Section 11 of Republic Act 7659, the attendance of any which mandates the single indivisible penalty of death instead of the standard penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death prescribed in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, are in the nature of qualifying aggravating cannot be proved as such unless alleged,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> a qualifying aggravating cannot be proved as such unless alleged in the information although it may be proved as a generic aggravating circumstance if so included among those enumerated in the Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Obviously, the technical flaw<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> committed by the prosecution in this instance is a matter that cannot be ignored, and it constrains the Court to reduce the penalty of death imposed by the trial court to that of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>."</blockquote>Just recently the Court, in People vs. Nuñez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> has had occasion to give counsel on the matter. Thus -<br><blockquote>"Taking into account the growing number of cases where qualified rape under Section 11 of R.A. 7659, although proven during trial, cold still not be properly penalized because of defects in the Information, We urge the prosecuting fiscals who are charged with the responsibility of preparing Informations to state with particularity the attendant circumstances provided for under Section 11 of R.A. 7659. More specifically, in qualified rape, both the fact of minority of the victim and the actual relationship between the parties, as worded in R.A. 7659, must be alleged in the Information. Otherwise, We shall continue to fail both the law and the victims whom the law have sought to protect."</blockquote>Given the circumstances in the case at bar, the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua. </i>The failure to allege accurately the relationship between appellant and his victim in the information bars his conviction in its qualified form that is punishable with death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The death sentence mated out by the court <i>a quo</i> must, forthwith, be reduced.<br><br>As regards the civil indemnity, this Court has to date consistently ruled that if, in the crime of rape, the death penalty is imposed, the indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> for the victim should be in the amount of P75,000.00; if the death penalty is not decreed by the Court, the victim would instead be entitled to P50,000.00. An Additional award of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages is awarded in favor of a victim who suffers that injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the RTC, 5<sup>th</sup> Judicial Region, Branch 13, Ligao, Albay in Criminal Case No. 3529, No. 3530, and No. 3531 finding the accused Reynaldo Poñado guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, on three counts, is AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the sentence is reduced in each case from DEATH to <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i>. The civil indemnity of P150,000.00 awarded by the trial court for the three counts of rape, is AFFIRMED; in addition, an amount of P50,000.00 for moral damages is hereby awarded.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Qusumbing, Purisima, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes,</i> and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Davide, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup> G.R.
