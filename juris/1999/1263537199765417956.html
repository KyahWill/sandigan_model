Waminal, City Sheriff of Cagayan de Oro, Commercial Credit Corporation and Cagayan de Oro Coliseum, Inc., Respondents</i>," docketed as Special Civil Action No. 6811.&nbsp; The five stockholders sought to enjoin the public sale of the corporate property alleging that the loan was contracted by Diego Imperio, the president of the corporation, without authority from the stockholders; and that the creditor, Santiago Maceren, was corporate treasurer and a member of the Board of Directors of petitioner corporation at the time the loan was obtained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Eventually, the parties, assisted by their respective counsel, entered into a compromise agreement which became the basis of a judgment rendered by the trial court on March 11, 1980, whereby the five stockholders ratified the loan of the corporation to Commercial Credit in the amount of P249,263.23, computed as of February 15, 1980; the corporation bound itself to pay the loan in equal monthly installments of P11,000.00 and agreed that failure to pay any of the installments shall render the judgment immediately executory, with penalty on overdue and unpaid installments at the rate of three per cent (3%) per month plus five per cent (5%) of the outstanding balance as additional attorney's fees.&nbsp; The Compromise Judgment reads as follows:<br><blockquote>The parties in the above-entitled case assisted by their respective counsel, submitted for approval the following Compromise Agreement, to wit:<br><br>COMES NOW, Parties, Petitioners and Respondents, represented by their respective counsels, unto this Honorable Court, most respectfully submit for approval the following Compromise Agreement:<br><ol><br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Commercial Credit alleged that petitioner corporation failed to pay several installments on its loan and left an outstanding balance of P70,152.68, excluding sheriff's expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The trial court granted the motion on March 9, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The following day, the Branch Clerk of Court issued the writ of execution on the personal and real properties of petitioner corporation. On March 11, the deputy sheriff filed a notice of levy on petitioner's title with the Register of Deeds of Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioner forthwith filed a "Motion for Reconsideration of the Order of Execution" alleging that the issuance of the order of execution <i>ex-parte</i> violated petitioner's right to due process; that a hearing should have been conducted on the motion for execution because petitioner had already made payments in the total amount of P419,429.95, resulting in an overpayment of P94,028.12.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In an order dated November 26, 1986, the trial court denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The trial court, however, reduced petitioner's principal obligation from P70,152.68 to P64,956.19 but ordered it to pay the three per cent (3%) monthly penalty charge until full payment and five per cent (5%) of the outstanding balance as additional attorney's fees. Accordingly, the court ordered the issuance of a writ of execution for the collection of said amount:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration filed by respondent Coliseum is DENIED.&nbsp; Let a writ of execution be issued against said respondent for the collection of its outstanding obligation of P64,956.19 with the respondent CCC, including the "three per cent (3%) per month penalty charge until fully paid, plus five per cent (5%) of the outstanding balance as additional attorney's fees" as provided in paragraph 5 of the compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>On December 4, 1986, the Branch Clerk of Court of the trial court issued the writ of execution, which reads:<br><blockquote>You are hereby commanded that of the goods and chattels of respondent Coliseum, Cagayan de Oro City, you cause to be made the sum of P64,956.19 as principal plus 3% penalty per month, plus 5% of the outstanding balance as attorney's fees and all expenses incurred together with your lawful fees for the service of this execution, all in the Philippine currency, which the respondent CCC recovered in this Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental and that you render the said sums to the respondent CCC aside from your own fees on this execution and do likewise return this writ within SIXTY (60) DAYS from receipt hereof with your proceedings endorsed thereon.&nbsp; But if sufficient personal property/ies cannot be found whereof to satisfy this execution and lawful fees thereon, then you are commanded that of the lands and buildings of the said respondent Coliseum you make the said sums of money in the manner required by the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Pursuant to this writ, Deputy Provincial Sheriff Maximiano Mabanag, Jr. published the notice of auction sale scheduled on January 23, 1987.&nbsp; The sale did not proceed on said date, however, due to some internal problems in the office of the sheriff.<br><br>Meanwhile, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals an action for annulment of judgment of the trial court, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 10888, wherein it sought to set aside the compromise judgment on the ground of fraud and misrepresentation which it discovered only in 1983.&nbsp; Petitioner pleaded four causes of action, <i>viz</i>: <i> </i>(1) Of its total obligation of P325,401.83 to Commercial Credit, petitioner had already paid P303,758.15 and left a balance of only P21,647.79, not P70,152.68 as claimed by Commercial Credit.&nbsp; Respondent judge ordered execution of the compromise judgment without a hearing and petitioner's motion for reconsideration was decided three years and seven months later which gave Commercial Credit a longer period to impose the monthly 3% penalty and 5% additional attorney's fees on the increased balance; (2) Two stipulations in the compromise judgment violated the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 116 amending the Usury Law, and Central Bank Circular No. 721 issued on February 25, 1980, prior to the promulgation of the compromise judgment by the trial court on March 11, 1980; (3) Respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in applying portions of the installment payments as past due charges instead of fully applying them to the principal debt; and (4) The Branch Clerk of Court issued a writ of execution and the Deputy Provincial Sheriff issued a notice of auction sale before petitioner received a copy of the order denying its motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Petitioner thus prayed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, herein petitioner prays that judgment be rendered for the following:<br><ol><li>&nbsp;

Ordering respondent Commercial Credit Corporation to return to herein petitioner its overpayment in the amount of P45,049.55;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; Ordering respondents Deputy Clerk of Court Augusto Neri, Jr., Deputy Provincial Sheriff Maximiano Mabanag, Jr. and the Commercial Credit Corporation, to pay damages, jointly and severally, the amount of P50,000.00 and attorney's fees of P10,000.00;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; Ordering further that respondent Commercial Credit Corporation pay the additional damages for the amount of P50,000.00;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; For such other orders and remedies proper under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>On February 13, 1987, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision holding that since petitioner had made payments totalling P303,758.15, it equitably reduced the penalty of three per cent (3%) per month to only one-half per cent (1/2%) per month on the overdue and unpaid installments, and the five per cent (5%) additional attorney's fees to only two per cent (2%) of the outstanding balance.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals declared:<br><blockquote><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As of now, the auction sale has not yet been implemented.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the present petition is DENIED Due Course and is hereby DISMISSED.&nbsp; Effective March 16, 1983, the overdue and unpaid installments shall earn one-half per cent (1/2%) per month penalty charge until fully paid, plus two per cent (2%) of the outstanding balance as additional attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>Meanwhile, on January 19, 1987, herein respondent Sheriff Mabanag issued an Amended Sheriff's notice of sale setting the sale of the property at public auction on February 13, 1987, or on the same day the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision.&nbsp; At the Auction Sale the property was sold to the highest bidder, herein respondent Richard Go King, for the sum of P170,000.00.<br><br>Both parties moved for reconsideration of the decision of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Petitioner argued that:&nbsp; (1) the penalty or past due charges on the obligation be applied only after the payment of the principal and interest, and that the reduced penalty be applied from the time it was to be imposed, instead of from the date the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration; (2) that Commercial Credit, to its advantage, concealed from petitioner the promulgation of C.B. Circular No. 721 before rendition of the compromise judgment, and as a result of the non-application of said Circular, petitioner's obligation ballooned to P170,000.00; (3) that the auction sale was conducted on February 13, 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the day of promulgation of the Court of Appeals' decision substantially amending the amount of judgment debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Petitioner thus prayed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that:<br><br>A.

For such other orders, reliefs and remedies proper and just under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>In a Resolution dated May 19, 1987, the Court of Appeals denied the petitioner's motion.&nbsp; It, however, granted the motion for reconsideration with respect to the public auction sale conducted during the pendency of the case.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals declared the writ of execution, the sheriff's notice of sale, the public auction sale and the certificate of sale null and void insofar as they were in excess of the judgment as modified by its decision. Thus:<br><blockquote>Acting on the said first part of the petitioner's motion for reconsideration as well as the private respondent's comment thereon, the aforestated grounds for said motion having already been taken up by this Court in reaching the said February 13, 1987 decision, and finding no reason to disturb the same, the said motion as to its said first part, is DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>As to the said second part of petitioner's motion for reconsideration, for clarity, the dispositive portion of the February 13, 1987 decision is re-worded to read as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the present petition is GRANTED in the sense that effective March 16, 1983, the overdue and unpaid installments shall earn one half per cent (1/2%) per month penalty charge until fully paid, plus two per cent (2%) of the outstanding balance as additional attorney's fees.<br><br>And in view of such disposition,<br><ol><li>)&nbsp; THE JUDGMENT DATED MARCH 11, 1980 AND THE ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 26, 1986 OF RESPONDENT COURT ARE HEREBY DECLARED MODIFIED CONFORMABLY WITH THE FEBRUARY 13, 1987 DECISION OF THIS COURT; and<br><br></li><li>)&nbsp; THE WRIT OF EXECUTION ISSUED BY RESPONDENT CLERK OF COURT, AND THE SHERIFF'S NOTICE OF SALE, THE PUBLIC AUCTION SALE AND THE CERTIFICATE OF SALE ARE DECLARED NULL AND VOID IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND IN EXCESS OF THE NOW MODIFIED JUDGMENT AND MODIFIED ORDER OF THE RESPONDENT COURT DATED MARCH 11, 1980 AND NOVEMBER 26, 1986, RESPECTIVELY.</li></ol>SO ORDERED.</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Commercial Credit moved for reconsideration, but its motion was denied on March 23, 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Both parties filed separate petitions for review before us.

He was impleaded only in Civil Case No. 89-098 after finality of the decisions in G.R. Nos. 79100 and 78315. Although he obtained his title to the property "subsequent to the commencement of the action," his rights to the property arose as buyer at the said sale, not as a creditor from any direct transaction with or title obtained from Commercial Credit, the judgment creditor. As the highest bidder, respondent Go King was issued&nbsp; a certificate of sale,&nbsp; and subsequently a final deed of conveyance for which TCT No. T-3383 of petitioner was cancelled and TCT No. T-51704 was issued in his name.&nbsp; The second case, Civil Case No. 89-098, was brought against him for the cancellation of his title over the subject property due to irregularities in the execution sale, not from the merits of the compromise judgment.&nbsp; There is therefore no identity of parties in CA-G.R. SP No. 10888 and Civil Case No. 89-098.<br><br>Neither is there identity of subject matter.&nbsp; CA-G.R. SP No. 10888 did not directly involve the property subject matter of this case.&nbsp; It was concerned with the provisions of the compromise judgment and the claim that petitioner was denied due process by the trial court in granting execution.&nbsp; On the other hand, Civil Case No. 89-098 dealt with the validity of the execution proceedings after the validity of the compromise judgment was upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The two cases do not have the same causes of action.&nbsp; The test of identity of causes of action lies not in the form of action but on whether the same facts or evidence would support and establish the former and present causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> extends to facts and conditions as they existed at the time judgment was rendered and to the legal rights and relations of the parties fixed by the facts so determined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The mere fact that the same relief is sought in the subsequent action will not render the judgment in the prior action operative as <i>res judicata</i>, such as when the two actions are brought on different statutes and rules as in the case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>From the pleadings, the causes of action in CA-G.R.

Circular No. 721, as well as the application of payments under the Civil Code.&nbsp; On the other hand, the cause of action in Civil Case No. 89-098 is anchored on the validity of the execution proceedings and the debtor's exercise of the right of redemption under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In its motion for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 10888, petitioner assailed the validity of the writ of execution, the sheriff's notice of sale, the public auction sale of February 13, 1987 and the certificate of sale.&nbsp; A careful examination of said motion for reconsideration reveals that the validity of these documents of execution was assailed with respect to the <u>computation of the amount</u> of petitioner's debt subject of execution for not being in accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In other words, it was the amount subject of execution that was questioned insofar as it did not conform with the reduced rates of interest and penalty charges imposed by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In fact, the Court of Appeals nullified the writ of execution, sheriff's notice of sale, the public auction sale and the certificate of sale insofar as they were in excess of the modified judgment.&nbsp; The computation of petitioner's outstanding balance goes into the substantive provisions of the compromise judgment. Petitioner did not squarely and directly challenge the <u>procedural infirmity</u> of the execution proceedings but pursued the <u>merits</u> of the compromise judgment itself.<br><br>G.R. No. 79100 was dismissed by this Court for late filing and on the ground that the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error. G.R.
