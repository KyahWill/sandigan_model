				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has jurisdiction over corporations organized pursuant to the Corporation Code, even if the majority or controlling shares are owned by the government.&nbsp; Hence, it can competently order the holding of a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing the corporate board of directors.&nbsp; While the SEC may not have authority over government corporations with original charters or those created by special law, it does have jurisdiction over "acquired asset corporations" as defined in AO 59. Specifically, the Philippine National Construction Company (PNCC) may be ordered by SEC to hold a shareholders' meeting to elect its board of directors in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws as well as with the Corporation Code.&nbsp; The chairman and the members of the&nbsp; PNCC Board of Directors hold office by virtue of their election by the shareholders, not by their appointment thereto by the President of the Republic.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (CA) promulgated on October 23, 1997, as well as its subsequent Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated December 2, 1997, denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>The CA effectively affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the October 2, 1996 Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Petition is hereby GRANTED.&nbsp; The President or the Chairman of the PNCC is hereby ordered to call a special stockholder's meeting within thirty (30) days from receipt of this order for the purpose of electing the members of the Board to hold office up to March, 1997 or until the next stockholders' meeting will be held. Accordingly, the Corporate Secretary of PNCC is hereby directed to issue required notices to the stockholders."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>In a subsequent Resolution dated April 11, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> SEC denied reconsideration, clarification and annulment of said Order.<br><blockquote><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>The Court of Appeals adequately narrates the facts in this wise:<br><br>"On September 16, 1994, private respondents <b>Ernesto Pabion</b> and <b>Louella Ramiro</b>, claiming to be stockholders of the <b>PNCC</b>, filed with the SEC a verified petition, therein alleging that since 1982 or for a period of twelve (12) years, there has been no stockholders' meeting of the PNCC to elect the corporation's board of directors, thus enabling the incumbent directors to hold on to their position beyond their 1-year term, in violation of PNCC's By-Laws and the Corporation Code. <b>Pabion</b> and <b>Ramiro</b>, therefore, prayed the <b>SEC</b> to issue an order `ordering the officers of PNCC or, in the alternative, authorizing petitioners, to call and hold a meeting of the stockholders x x x for the purpose of electing new directors x x x'.&nbsp; Docketed as SEC Case No. 09-94-4876, the verified petition was assigned to SEC Hearing Officer Manuel Perea.<br><br>"In due time, <b>PNCC</b> filed its answer.&nbsp; Therein, <b>PNCC</b> claimed that it is a government-owned corporation whose `organizational and functional management, administration, and supervision' are governed by Administrative Order (AO) No. 59, issued by then President Corazon Aquino on February 16, 1988.&nbsp; <b>PNCC</b> asserts that its board of directors does not hold office by virtue of a stockholder's election but by appointment of the President of the Philippines, relying on Article IV, Section 16 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, of AO No. 59, which reads:<br><blockquote>`(1)&nbsp; <b><i>Governing Boards</i></b>.&nbsp; -&nbsp; <i>GOCC (government-owned&nbsp; and/or controlled corporation) shall be governed by a Board of Directors or equivalent body composed of an appropriate number of members to be appointed by the President of the Philippines upon the recommendation of the Secretary of whose Department the GOCC is attached.&nbsp; The Chairman of the board shall likewise be appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary'</i></blockquote>In the same answer, <b>PNCC</b> expressed the fear that if granted, the prayer in the verified petition would amount to a contravention of AO No. 59 and an interference with the President's power of control and appointment over government-owned and/or controlled corporations (GOCCs).&nbsp; PNCC added that under Executive Order No. 399, series of 1951, a GOCC is not required to hold a general meeting of stockholders but, instead, the general manager thereof is merely required to submit an annual report to the President of the Philippines.<br><br>In the ensuing pre-trial conference conducted by Hearing Officer Perea, the parties defined the issues, as follows:<br><blockquote><i>`(a)&nbsp; Whether or not PNCC is a GOCC subject to and governed by LOI 1295 (1983), AO No. 59 (1988) and Executive Order No. 399 (1951), or by its articles-of-incorporation and by-laws only.</i><br><br><i> (b)&nbsp; Whether or not PNCC is required to call a regular annual stockholder's meetings'</i></blockquote>on the basis of which the parties agreed to submit the case for resolution after they shall have filed their respective memoranda, which they did.<br><br>"It appears, however, that in a motion dated September 4, 1995, <b>Pabion</b> and <b>Ramiro</b> prayed for the re-opening of the pre-trial conference on the ground that the `common assumption' on the 75% ownership by several government financial institutions (GFIs) in the PNCC was proved false by their discovery that the GFI[s] are merely a minority among the owners of PNCC.&nbsp; They, therefore, moved that a trial be conducted to determine the extent of ownership by the government in the PNCC.<br><br>"Acting on the aforementioned motion, SEC Hearing Officer Perea issued, on January 30, 1996, the following order:<br><blockquote><i>`In view of the necessity of a prior determination of whether or not respondent Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) is a government owned or controlled corporation before resolving the instant incident, either or both of the parties are hereby directed to secure a ruling/opinion from competent authority as to whether or not the PNCC is a government corporation or not, as the matter does not fall within the competence of the Commission to determine.</i><br><br><i>Unless said ruling/opinion is obtained by either or both parties, further proceedings should be held in abeyance.</i><br><br><i>SO ORDERED'</i></blockquote>"Their motion for reconsideration of the aforequoted order having been denied by the same Hearing Officer in his subsequent order of April 10, 1996, <b>Pabion</b> and <b>Ramiro</b> then went to the Commission <i>en banc via</i> a petition for certiorari.&nbsp; Thus came about <b>SEC-EB No. 495</b> wherein therein petitioners <b>Pabion</b> and <b>Ramiro</b> sought the nullification of Hearing Officer Perea's twin orders of January 30, 1996 and April 10, 1996 for having been allegedly issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; In the same recourse, the two likewise asked the SEC <i>en banc</i> to direct Perea to proceed with the trial on the merits of SEC Case No. 09-94-4876.<br><br>"In its first assailed <b>order of October 2, 1996,</b> the SEC <i>en banc</i> declared Hearing Officer Perea to have acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing his two (2) questioned orders.&nbsp; The Commission ruled that Perea should have conducted a trial on the merits to resolve the factual issue of whether PNCC is majority or only minority-owned by the government. Explains the Commission <i>en banc</i> in its challenged order:<br><br><i>`Sec. 5 [b] of P.D. # 902-A confers on SEC original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide intra-corporate controversies.&nbsp; The main issue in the petition is clearly an intra-corporate dispute as it is a controversy between the petitioners as stockholders of PNCC and respondent corporation PNCC regarding the holding of regular stockholder's meeting.&nbsp; This matter, therefore, falls within the scope of the jurisdiction of the SEC.&nbsp; In resolving the main issue of whether PNCC should hold regular stockholder's meetings, the hearing officer has jurisdiction to resolve the incidental issue of whether PNCC is a GOCC or not.&nbsp; Having validly acquired original and exclusive jurisdiction over the instant petition, the public respondent is mandated to hear and decide all the issues involved in the dispute.'</i><br><br>"In the same order, the Commission <i>en banc</i>, instead of remanding the case to the Hearing Officer to resolve the question of whether PNCC is government-owned or controlled, itself resolved the issue by holding that PNCC, <b><i>`being incorporated under the Corporation Code, is, therefore, subject to Section 50 of the Corporation Code which requires the holding of regular stockholders' meeting for the purpose of selecting PNCC's Board of Directors'</i>,</b> citing, as basis therefor the ruling in PNOC-EDC vs. NLRC, 20 SCRA 487, to the effect that the determination as to what law governs a corporation is the manner of its creation, adding that PNCC is an <b><i>`acquired asset corporation'</i></b> which, by express provision of Section 2 of AO No. 59, <b><i>`is not considered as a GOCC'</i>.</b>&nbsp; And taking judicial notice of PNCC's by-laws thereunder the corporation's directors <b><i>`shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders'</i></b>, the Commission <i>en banc</i> concluded that PNCC <b><i>`is, therefore, required to conduct a regular stockholder's meeting for the purpose of electing its Board of Directors, considering that the Corporation Code and its own By-Laws require the holding of such meeting'</i>.</b><br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>"A timely motion for reconsideration was filed by the PNCC but the same was denied by the Commission <i>en banc</i> in its assailed <b>Resolution of April 11, 1997</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (citations omitted but bold types and italics found in originial)</blockquote><center><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></center><br>Upholding SEC, the Court of Appeals declared that PNCC, though majority-owned by government financial institutions (GFIs), retained its character as a private corporation.&nbsp; As such, PNCC was required under the Corporation Code to hold regular shareholders' meetings to elect its board of directors.&nbsp; The CA ruled:<br><blockquote>"The petition lacks merit.<br><br>"Although the case reached the SEC <i>en banc</i> through a petition for certiorari, the said body is not helpless to resolve the controversy on its substantive merits. There are indications that PNCC is not a GOCC which the SEC <i>en banc</i> cannot ignore.&nbsp; A trial for the purpose of determining the status of PNCC is unnecessary since the issue can be resolved on the basis of records.&nbsp; A remand will only delay the resolution of the case and frustrate the ends of justice.<br><br>"It may be so, as pointed out by petitioner PNCC, that the rule which allows the SEC <i>en banc</i> to correct instances of grave abuse of discretion is patterned after Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, and therefore, it is only proper that the SEC <i>en banc</i> adhere to the pronouncements of the Supreme Court on the proper treatment of petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 65.&nbsp; It is equally true, however, that the rule enunciated in several cases to the effect that the inquiry in a petition for certiorari is limited only to searching for traces of grave abuse [of] discretion is not cast in stone.&nbsp; For sure, the Supreme Court no less has resolved factual issues in certiorari cases on the basis of the records before it.&nbsp; If the Supreme Court can relax the restriction on the disposition of certiorari cases, We see no reason why a mere quasi-administrative body unsaddled by the stringent rules of procedure, like the SEC <i>en banc</i>, cannot follow the High Court's example, more so when, as rationalized by the same Court in <b><i>Gokongwei, Jr. vs. Securities and Exchange Commission, et. al</i>.</b>, 89 SCRA 336, 360, the underlying justification for the relaxation of the rule applies to the instant case as well.&nbsp; Says the High Court in that case:<br><blockquote><i>`It is an accepted rule of procedure that the Supreme court should always strive to settle the entire controversy in a single proceeding, leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation.&nbsp; Thus, in <b>Francisco v. City of Davao</b> (12 SCRA 682), this Court resolved to decide the case on the merits instead of remanding it to the trial court for further proceedings since the ends of justice would not be subserved by the remand of the case.&nbsp; In <b>Republic v. Security Credit and Acceptance Corporation, et. al.</b> (19 SCRA 58), this Court, finding that the main issue is one of law, resolved to decide the case on the merits `because public interest demands an early disposition of the case', and in <b>Republic v. Central Surety and Insurance Company</b>, (25 SCRA 641), this Court denied remand of the third-party complaint to the trial court for further proceedings, citing precedents where this Court, in similar situations, resolved to decide the cases on the merits, instead of remanding them to the trial court where (a) the ends of justice would not be subserved by the remand of the case; or (b) where public interest demand an early disposition of the case; or (c) where the trial court ha[s] already received all the evidence presented by both parties and the Supreme Court is now in a position, based upon said evidence, to decide the case on the merits. xxx'</i></blockquote>"Moreover, it cannot be denied that the parties herein are embroiled in an intra-corporate controversy and the question on the identity of PNCC is only an incident of that controversy. <b>Pabion</b> and <b>Ramiro</b> are among the stockholders of PNCC, a circumstance which classifies the dispute as an intra-corporate controversy.&nbsp; The authority of the Commission to determine whether or not PNCC can be compelled to hold a stockholders' meeting is unquestioned as even PNCC itself concedes that the `issues of the propriety of calling a stockholders' meeting is within the competence of the SEC'.&nbsp; The source of authority of the SEC over the present case can be found in Section 5(b) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 902-A, as amended, which empowers the SEC to hear and resolve cases involving <i>`controversies arising out of intra-corporate or partnership relations, between and among stockholders, members, or associates; between any or all of them and the corporation, partnership or association of which they are stockholders, members or associates, respectively; and between such corporation, partnership or association and the State insofar as it concerns their individual franchise or right to exist as such entity.'</i><br><br>"The finding of the SEC <i>en banc</i> that PNCC is not a GOCC was made in the exercise of its jurisdiction over an intra-corporate controversy.&nbsp; To disallow the Commission to determine the nature of petitioner PNCC is to deprive it of the power to resolve the intra-corporate controversy between the parties.&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the SEC over intra-corporate controversies emanates from law and PNCC cannot divest the Commission of that jurisdiction.&nbsp; As the body charged with exclusive authority over intra-corporate controversies, aside from being possessed under Section 3 of PD No. 902-A, as amended, with absolute jurisdiction over all corporations which are grantees of primary franchise from the government, the SEC <i>en banc</i> can be trusted with the competence to distinguish a private corporation from a GOCC.<br><br>"The second assigned error must likewise fall.<br><br>"Administrative Order No. 59 does not consider the so-called acquired asset corporations, although majority owned by the government, as GOCCs.&nbsp; The salient provisions of AO No. 59 read, as follows:<br><blockquote><i>`SEC. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Definition of Terms</b>.&nbsp; -&nbsp; As used in this Administrative Order, the following terms shall mean:</i><br><blockquote><i>(a)&nbsp; Government-owned and/or controlled corporation, hereinafter referred to as GOCC or government corporation, is a corporation which is created by special law or organized under the Corporation Code in which the government, directly or indirectly, has ownership of the majority of the capital or has voting control; <b>Provided, That an acquired asset corporation as defined in the next paragraph shall not be considered as GOCC or government corporation.</b></i><br><br><i>(b)&nbsp; <b>Acquired asset corporation is a corporation (1) which is under private ownership, the voting or outstanding shares of which (i) were conveyed to the government agency, instrumentality or corporation in satisfaction of debts whether by foreclosure or otherwise</b>, or (ii) were duly acquired by the government through final judgment in a sequestration proceeding; or (2) which is a subsidiary of a government corporation organized exclusively to own and manage, or lease, or operate specific physical assets acquired by a government financial institution in satisfaction of debts incurred therewith, and which in any case by law or by enunciated policy is required to be disposed of to private ownership within a specified period of time.'</i></blockquote></blockquote>"In order to be considered as an <i>acquired asset corporation</i>, the aforequoted provision requires, among other things, that the corporation's conveyance of its outstanding shares to the government must be aimed at the satisfaction of its debts.&nbsp; While, on one breath, petitioner admits that the GFIs gained majority ownership of PNCC by converting their loans into equity, on another breath, petitioner denies that the debt-to-equity conversion resulted in the satisfaction of the outstanding debts of PNCC because it did not pay the loans.&nbsp; If the loans remained unpaid as maintained by PNCC, what then was the effect on its debt when the GFIs converted their loans into equity?&nbsp; It would be the height of irresponsibility for PNCC to surrender majority ownership of its voting or outstanding shares without getting something in return.&nbsp; When PNCC ceded the majority ownership to the GFIs, there could be no other motivation behind the action than PNCC's desire to satisfy its obligation to the creditors.&nbsp; PNCC's effort to ward off the exclusionary proviso of AO No. 59 only produces incongruity in its position.<br><br>"The case of <b>Quimpo vs. Tanodbayan</b>, 146 SCRA 137, cannot assist the petitioner's cause.&nbsp; There, the Supreme Court's inquiry centered on whether or not Petrophil Corporation is a GOCC because an affirmative answer will affirm the Tanodbayan's jurisdiction over the Petrophil employees pursuant to the provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.&nbsp; In declaring that Petrophil is a GOCC, the Supreme Court deemed it crucial to its conclusion that Petrophil was purchased by the government through the Philippine National Oil Corporation, itself a GOCC.&nbsp; The situation of Petrophil bears no parallelism with that of PNCC because the latter was not purchased by the GFIs. The GFIs became majority owners of PNCC because they converted their loans into equity.&nbsp; The manner of partial acquisition of PNCC by the GFIs fits the condition set forth in Section 2, paragraph (b), subparagraph, (1) (i) of AO no. 59, <i>supra</i>.<br><br>"PNCC's position that it cannot be considered as an acquired asset corporation in the absence of law or "enunciated policy" mandating its privatization within a definite period can only be a product of strained interpretation of AO No. 59.&nbsp; The Administrative Order shows that there are only two (2) classes of acquired asset corporations.&nbsp; Although the description of each class is compressed in a single paragraph, the disjunctive word <b>"or"</b> separates the first class from the second class which connotes a variance in their characteristics. The word "or" is a disjunctive term signifying disassociation and independence of one thing from each of the other things enumerated.&nbsp; It should, as a rule, be construed in the sense in which it ordinarily implies, as a disjunctive word.&nbsp; Each class has its own set of conditions.&nbsp; The conversion by the GFIs of their loans into equity in PNOC is sufficient to transform it as an acquired asset corporation.&nbsp; The requirement for a pretender for the status of an acquired asset corporation to be subject to a law or policy that commands its privatization applies to another class of acquired asset corporations which does not include PNCC."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (citations omitted, emphasis in the original)</blockquote><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>Disagreeing with the appellate court, petitioner lodged this recourse before us<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and presents these issues:<br><blockquote>"1. WHETHER OR NOT PNCC IS A GOCC;<br><br>2.&nbsp; WHETHER OR NOT THE SEC HAS JURISDICTION TO ORDER PNCC TO HOLD A STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ELECTING THE MEMBERS OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS;<br><br>3.&nbsp; WHETHER OR NOT PNCC IS REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW TO HOLD A STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING FOR THIS PURPOSE; AND<br><br>4.&nbsp; WHETHER OR NOT THE SEC, IN <i>CERTIORARI</i> PROCEEDINGS, CAN RULE ON THE MERITS OF A CASE EVEN BEFORE THE HEARING OFFICER HAS RECEIVED EVIDENCE."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>We shall take up the above issues in the following sequence:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; whether SEC can determine the corporate status of PNCC,&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; whether SEC has jurisdiction over GOCCs, and&nbsp; 3) whether PNCC is an acquired asset corporation.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The Petition has no merit.&nbsp; Simply stated, PNCC claims that SEC has no jurisdiction over it and that members of the corporation's board of directors hold office, not by virtue of a shareholders' election but by appointment of the President of the Philippines.&nbsp; We hold that SEC has authority over PNCC and that the latter's directors owe their offices to their shareholders and not to presidential fiat.&nbsp; To justify these plain conclusions, we need to wade through rather complicated legal processes and reasoning in resolving <i>seriatim</i> the legal issues raised by petitioners.<br><br><center><b><u>First Issue:&nbsp; <br><i>May SEC Determine <br>Whether PNCC Is a GOCC?</i></u></b></center><br>Underlying this confusing controversy is the misconception that government owned and/or controlled corporations (GOCCs) are beyond the jurisdiction of SEC.&nbsp; From this broad and sweeping assumption, petitioner asserts that SEC is without competence to determine whether PNCC is a GOCC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It insists that such a determination falls solely upon the President of Philippines and is therefore beyond SEC's jurisdiction.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; It is certainly absurd to say that SEC is without jurisdiction to determine if PNCC is a GOCC simply because the latter <i>claims</i> to be one.&nbsp; The President does not "determine" whether a corporation is a GOCC or not.&nbsp; It is the law that does. PNCC's status as a GOCC can be ruled upon by SEC -- as well as by other competent authorities for that matter -- based on law, specifically the Revised Administrative Code of 1987<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which provides <i>inter alia</i> as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 2.&nbsp; <i>General Terms Defined</i>. --- Unless the specific words of the text, or the context as a whole, or a particular statute, shall require a different meaning:<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>(13)&nbsp; <i>Government-owned or controlled corporation</i>&nbsp; --&nbsp; refers to any agency organized as a stock or non-stock corporation, vested with functions relating to public needs whether governmental or proprietary in nature, and owned by the Government directly or through its instrumentalities either wholly, or, where applicable as in the case of stock corporations, to the extent of at least fifty-one (51) per cent of its capital stock: Provided, That government owned or controlled corporations <i>may be further categorized</i> by the Department of Budget, the Civil Service Commission, and the Commission on Audit for purposes of the exercise and discharge of their respective powers, functions and responsibilities with respect to such corporations."

The said administrative order states that "<i>PNCC is one of the corporations slated to be privatized</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>When confronted with the same question, the Department of Justice (DOJ) in DOJ Opinion No. 37, Series of 1995, stated that PNCC was an acquired asset corporation, as follows:<br><blockquote>"At the outset, we note from the attached papers that in its letter dated May 20, 1991 to the PNCC, <i>the Office of the President already declared that PNCC is an `acquired asset corporation as defined in Administrative Order No. 59'</i>."
