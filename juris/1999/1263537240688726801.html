				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for certiorari under Rules 64 and 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure assailing the Resolutions dated October 27, 1998 and December 8, 1998, respectively, of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in Election Protest Case (EPC) No. 96-2.<br><br>The facts that matter are as follows:<br><br>The petitioner and the private respondent were among the candidates during the September 9, 1996 elections for the Regional Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao ("ARMM") representing the Second District of the Province of Sulu.<br><br>On September 10, 1996, petitioner was proclaimed as the third winning Assemblyman with a total of 31,031 votes.&nbsp; Private respondent garnered a total of 29,941 votes, giving the petitioner a winning margin of 1,090 votes.<br><br>Since only three positions for Assemblymen were open, private respondent filed an election protest with the COMELEC alleging rampant substitution of voters, miscounting and/or misreading of ballots by the automated counting machine, and the inclusion in the counting of obviously marked ballots in Precinct Nos. 1, 1A, 2, 10, and 13B of the Municipality of Pata; Precinct Nos. 3, 4, 7, 9, 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 10, 10A, 10B, 11, 12, 21, 21A, 22C, and 22D of the Municipality of Luuk; Precinct Nos. 8, 10, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 27, and 28 of the Municipality of Panamao; Precinct Nos. 1, 1A, 2, 4, 5, 5A, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 11A, 14 and 14A of the Municipality of Tongkil; and Precinct Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 16 of the Municipality of Pandami. Docketed as Election Protest Case No. 96-2, the case was raffled to the Second Division of the COMELEC. Thereafter, petitioner filed his answer with counter-protest questioning the election results in all the precincts of the Municipalities of Panglima Estino, Lugus, Tapul, and Precinct Nos. 2, 2B, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Municipality of Kalinggalan Caluang.<br><br>On September 11, 1997, the COMELEC (Second, formerly First Division) issued an Order directing the Election Records and Statistics Department to undertake a technical examination of the signatures and thumbprints of the voters in the Voter's Registration Records (VRR/CEF No. 1) and the List of Voters with Voting Records or Computerized Voters List (CVL/CEF No. 2) involving the protested and the counter-protested precincts.&nbsp; The examination yielded the following results:<br><br><b>RESULTS OF EXAMINATION FOR PROTESTANT<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (protested precincts):</b><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="83%">"A.

No. L-119846 dated November 2, 1995.&nbsp; Conversely, the Commission is not inclined to discuss the merits of the revision of ballots, the counting thereof having been done by the automated counting machine.<br><br>In keeping with these precedents and the prayer of the parties to subject the election documents to the usual technical examination, the Commission (First Division) issued an Order on September 11, 1997 directing the Election Records and Statistics Department to undertake said task with the instruction to submit its report thereon upon termination thereof.&nbsp; The results of the technical examination are as follows:</blockquote><b></b><blockquote><b>FOR THE PROTESTANT [protested precincts]:</b><br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="83%">A.

Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><i> </i>and <i>Pimping v. Commission on Elections.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The basis of the Resolution of December 8, 1998 is the want of merit of petitioner's motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; There is no need for an extended disquisition with respect to said Resolution of October 27, 1998 as the bases thereof were detailed therein.<br><br>As regards the second issue, it is petitioner's stand that a revision and examination of the ballots, rather than a technical examination of the fingerprints in the voting records, is the proper method for the COMELEC to adopt in resolving the election dispute.&nbsp; Petitioner contends that only through a revision of ballots may the spurious and fraudulent votes be identified.<br><br>Petitioner's contention is untenable.&nbsp; Firstly, petitioner is not really contesting the method of the COMELEC in conducting a technical examination, but only the correctness thereof, petitioner theorizing double deductions in the appreciation of the results.&nbsp; But petitioner is estopped from adopting inconsistent positions.&nbsp; He cannot contest the method of dispute resolution, while at the same time affirm the validity thereof.&nbsp; It is worthy to note that the petitioner is contesting only the correctness of the report and not the method of dispute resolution.&nbsp; Then too, the Court has already sanctioned the method of technical examination of the thumbprints of voters, over revision of ballots, where a recount or revision of the ballots will not be reflective of the sovereign will due to the irregularities committed during the elections:<br><blockquote>"Where due to the stated serious irregularities, there has been, as in this instance, a consequent declaration of nullity of the election itself and the election returns in the voting centers mentioned, no fault whatsoever may be attributed to the action of the Comelec in declining to order a revision of the ballots cast in those election centers. A recount or revision of the ballots in those election centers can no longer possess any significance due to the nullity of the election itself in said places.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br></center>It is, therefore, quite apparent that a revision of ballots is not always mandatory in election protest cases because such revision should be granted by the Commission only when, in the opinion of the Commission, the interest of justice so demands or that the allegations of the parties in the protest cases so warrant the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>"xxx of course, there may be election protests which may be disposed of without a recount of the ballots cast.&nbsp; There may be cases where, by reason of the fraudulent manner on which the entire election was conducted, the Court would be justified in annulling and setting the election aside without an examination of the ballots.&nbsp; There may be cases also where all the ballots used at the election need not be examined."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The election during which the petitioner and the private respondent were candidates was marred by fraud and irregularities that a revision and recount of the ballots cast in the elections would prove futile in determining the true will of the electorate.&nbsp; This is evident from the result of the technical examination of the fingerprints which revealed the following:<br><br>FOR THE PROTESTANT --<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (20,819), only four percent (4%) thereof, or 907 voters, had identical thumbprints in CEF-1/VRR (Voters Affidavits) and CEF-2/CVL (Computerized Voters List).<br><br>2.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (20,819), thirty-eight percent (38%) thereof, or 7,951 voters, had thumbprints in CEF-1/VRR which are not identical with their thumbprints in CEF-2/CVL.<br><br>3.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (20,819), forty-eight percent (48%) thereof, or 9,935 voters, had thumbprints which cannot be analyzed because they were either blurred, smudged, faint, or without sufficient basis for comparison.<br><br>4.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (20819), nineteen percent (19%) thereof, or 4,043 voters, had thumbprints identical with each other using different names.<br><br>FOR THE PROTESTEE --<br><br>1.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (14,833), only four percent (4%) thereof, or 611 voters, had identical thumbprints in CEF-1/VRR (Voters Affidavits) and CEF-2/CVL (Computerized Voters List).<br><br>2.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (14,833), forty-six percent (46%) thereof, or 6,892 voters, had thumbprints in CEF-1/VRR which are not identical with their thumbprints in CEF-2/CVL.<br><br>3.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (14,833), forty-three percent (43%) thereof, or 6,449 voters, had thumbprints which cannot be analyzed because they were either blurred, smudged, faint, or without sufficient basis for comparison.<br><br>4.&nbsp; That of the total number of registered voters (14,833), twenty-two percent (22%) thereof, or 3,224 voters, had thumbprints identical with each other using different names.</blockquote>Since a revision and recount of the votes cast will unearth nothing except the fraudulent and spurious result of the elections, the COMELEC was justified in ordering a technical examination of the thumbprints of the voters based on the voters affidavits and the Computerized Voters List. The COMELEC was well within its authority to order such approach considering the circumstances obtaining in the election dispute.<br><br>Anent the last issue, petitioner claims that the COMELEC effected double deduction in appreciating the results of the technical examination:<br><blockquote>"8.&nbsp; The October 27, 1998 resolution of the Second Division which was affirmed by the Comelec En Banc in the latter's resolution of December 8, 1998, shows that it added the `number of voters whose thumbprints in CEF No. 1/VRR are not identical with their thumbprints in CVL (CEF No. 2)' to the `Number of voters in every precinct, divided into groups whose thumbprints in CVL (CEF No. 2) are identical to each other using different names.' (Please refer to Items `B' and `D' of the Report under the heading `Results of Examination'). This is highly erroneous.&nbsp; It only shows that even respondent Comelec was itself confused on how to appreciate the figures reported by its own technical examiners.&nbsp; By adding these two (2) items together, it resulted in DOUBLE DEDUCTIONS because the voters who were divided into groups in every precinct `whose thumbprints are identical to each other using different names' came from the SAME voters whose thumbprints in CEF 1 are not identical with their thumbprints in CEF 2. Without such DOUBLE DEDUCTIONS which was erroneously made by the respondent Comelec, petitioner herein would still emerge victorious by a comfortable margin as he will discuss later in this petition.&nbsp; xxx<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>9.&nbsp; Hence, granting arguendo that the results of the aforesaid technical examination were correct, petitioner should not be deducted `4,043' votes appearing in Item `D' of the Report from the protested precincts because the same was already included in Item `B' of the same report.&nbsp; By the erroneous double deductions made by respondent Comelec by adding Items `B' and `D' of the Report on the protested precincts, it resulted to a loss of `4,043' votes for the petitioner in the protested precincts which votes should not have been deducted from the same having been already included in the category of voters whose thumbprints are not identical with their thumbprints in CEF 2.&nbsp; Without the aforesaid `double deductions', from the protested and counter-protested precincts, petitioner would still emerge victorious by a slim margin of '31' votes, thus:<br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="60%">&nbsp;</td><td width="22%"><div align="center"><u>Petitioner</u></div></td><td width="18%"><div align="center"><u>Respondent </u></div></td></tr><tr><td>Votes credited upon proclamation </td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">31,031</div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">29,941</div></td></tr><tr><td>Less: Not identical prints (Item `B' of Reports) </td><td valign="bottom"> <div align="right"><u>7,951*</u></div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right"><u>6,892**</u></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">NET RESULTS </div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">23,080 </div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">23,049</div></td></tr><tr><td>VOTE-LEAD OF PETITIONER </td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">31 </div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">votes</div></td></tr><tr><td><p>*From Report on the protested precincts</p></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right"></div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td>**From Report on the counter-protested precincts."</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right"></div></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right"></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The Court discerns no substantiation of petitioner's claim of double deduction.&nbsp; The inference that the voters in Item D, whose thumbprints are identical to each other, using different names, came from the same set of voters in Item B, whose thumbprints in CEF No. 1/VRR are not identical with their thumbprints in CEF No. 2/CVL, has no rational basis.&nbsp; It should be noted that Item B is a comparison of the thumbprints between CEF No. 1/VRR and CEF No. 2/CVL while Item D involves only an examination of the thumbprints in CEF No. 2/CVL.&nbsp; It is possible that double deduction may occur, but absent any specific showing by petitioner of double deduction, the Court cannot grant the relief prayed for. Findings of fact of the COMELEC supported by substantial evidence shall be final and non-reviewable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Factual findings of the COMELEC based on its own assessments and duly supported by evidence, are conclusive upon this Court, more so, in the absence of a substantiated attack on the validity of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The COMELEC, as the government agency tasked with the enforcement and administration of election laws, is entitled to the presumption of regularity of official acts with respect to the elections.&nbsp; Having the expertise and skill of enforcing and implementing election laws, the COMELEC could not have erred as to allow double deductions, thereby frustrating the will of the people.<br><br>In fine, the Court holds that the COMELEC did not act with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the challenged Resolutions.&nbsp; An election protest with flimsy averments cannot prosper; otherwise, the whole election process will deteriorate into an endless stream of crabs pulling each other, racing to disembark from the water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>, and the Resolutions, dated October 27, 1998 and December 8, 1998, respectively, of the Commission on Elections, <b>UPHELD.</b>&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J.,(Chairman), Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago</i> and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Rollo, pp. 45-46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Ibid., pp. 47-48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Composed of Commissioners Julio F.
