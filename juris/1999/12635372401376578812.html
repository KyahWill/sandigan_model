dated June 29, 1999, of the Commission on Elections <i>en banc</i> upholding
the denial by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14, Cotabato City of
petitioner’s motion to dismiss the election protest filed by private respondent
and directing the continuance of the proceedings.</p>

<p class=BODY>The antecedent facts are:</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondent Salambai Ambolodto and Sukarno Samad were
mayoralty candidates in the local elections held on May 11, 1998 in Kabuntalan,
Maguindanao.  Samad was declared
winner.  He and herein petitioner
Salipongan Dagloc, who was elected vice-mayor, were proclaimed on May 14, 1998.</p>

<p class=BODY>On May 23, 1998, private respondent filed a petition in the
COMELEC entitled petition to declare a failure of election and/ or annul the
election results in the municipality of kabuntalan, first district of maguindanao,<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
docketed as SPA No. 98-356.  In
addition, on June 19, 1998, she filed an election protest <i>ex abundanti
cautela</i>,<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
docketed as Election Protest No. 38-98, in the RTC, Branch 14, Cotabato City.</p>

<p class=BODY>On July 6, 1998, private respondent moved to withdraw SPA No.
98-356 in the COMELEC in order to prosecute Election Protest No. 38-98 in the
RTC.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The COMELEC granted her motion in its order dated February 4, 1999.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Meanwhile, Samad filed his answer in Election Protest No. 38-98
in which he sought the dismissal of the protest on the ground that it was filed
more than 10 days from the date of proclamation on May 14, 1998.  He reiterated his motion to dismiss<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn6' href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>in
a subsequent pleading, and, in addition, asked that it be resolved before
private respondent’s motion for technical examination of C.E. Forms 1 and
2.  In an order, dated August 18, 1998,
the trial court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class=BODY>Samad then filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> (SPR No. 37-98)
in the COMELEC, assailing the order of the RTC denying his motion to
dismiss.  While the case was pending,
Samad died, and herein petitioner, who had succeeded him as mayor of
Kabuntalan, was substituted in his place in the pending cases before the
COMELEC (SPR No. 37-98) and the RTC (Election Protest No. 38-98). </p>

<p class=BODY>On June 29, 1999, the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>dismissed SPR No.
37-98 for lack of merit.  It held that
while SPA No. 98-356 filed by Samad was denominated as petition to declare a
failure of election and/or to annul the election results in the municipality of
kabuntalan, first district of maguindanao, the case was actually a petition for
annulment of proclamation which, under §248 of the Omnibus Election Code,
suspended the running of the period for filing an election protest.  Consequently, the filing of Election Protest
No. 38-98 in the RTC on June 19, 1998 was timely as SPA No. 98-356, filed one
day before the lapse of the period for filing an election protest, prevented
the expiration of said period.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hence, this petition.  On
August 10, 1999, we issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the COMELEC
from implementing its questioned resolution in SPR No. 37-98 and the RTC from
taking further action in Election Protest No. 38-98.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner contends that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of
discretion in holding that the filing of private respondent’s petition for a declaration
of a failure of election and for the annulment of election results suspended
the running of the reglementary period for filing an election protest.  He maintains that what is contemplated in
§248 of the Election Code is the filing of a pre-proclamation controversy
praying for annulment or suspension of proclamation.  In addition, petitioner questions the authority of COMELEC
Commissioner Abdul Gani M. Marohombsar who signed the COMELEC resolution in
question on June 29, 1999, when his term had already expired on June 4, 1999.</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondent, on the other hand, contends that §248 of the
Election Code is not limited to the filing of a pre-proclamation controversy
but includes as well a petition for a declaration of the failure of
election.  She argues that “[f]or so
long as there is a prayer for the annulment of a proclamation in a petition
filed with the COMELEC and within the COMELEC’s jurisdiction, the filing
thereof suspends the running of the 10-day period to file an election protest
or <i>quo warranto</i>  proceedings. . .
.  Even the filing of a petition for
disqualification praying for the annulment of proclamation on the ground of
ineligibility would suspend the running of the period to file an electoral
protest.” She also claims that the petition in SPR No. 37-98 filed by
petitioner’s predecessor should have been dismissed by the COMELEC since it is
actually based on the denial by the RTC of a motion to dismiss an election
protest, which motion is a prohibited pleading under Rule 13, §1 of the COMELEC
Rules of Procedure.</p>

<p class=BODY>The primary issue in this case is whether §248 of the Election
Code applies only to the filing of a pre-proclamation controversy.  On the resolution of this issue hinges the
question of whether private respondent’s election protest was timely filed.</p>

<p class=BODY>Sec. 248 reads:</p>

<blockquote><i>Effect of filing petition to annul or to suspend the
proclamation. </i><i><span style='font-family:Symbol'>¾</span> </i>The filing
with the Commission [on Elections] of a petition to annul or to suspend the
proclamation of any candidate shall suspend the running of the period within
which to file an election protest or <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>There is no question that the above provision covers the filing
of pre-proclamation controversies.  This
is clear from §242 of the Election Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote><i>Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction of all pre-proclamation
controversies. </i><span style='font-family:Symbol'>¾</span> The Commission [on
Elections] shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all pre-proclamation
controversies.  It may <i>motu proprio</i>
or upon written petition, and after due notice and hearing, order the partial
or total suspension of the proclamation of any candidate-elect or annul
partially or totally any proclamation, if one has been made, as the evidence
shall warrant in accordance with the succeeding sections.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The reason for this is that unless the proclamation of a winning
candidate is suspended or, if it has been held, set aside, the policy behind
the allowance of pre-proclamation controversies, <i>i.e.</i>, to prevent losing
candidates from grabbing the proclamation and delaying the resolution of the
electoral contest, will be defeated.  Thus, in <i>Esquivel v. Commission on Elections</i>,<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn7' href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that the 10-day period for filing an election protest under §289 of
the former Election Code was suspended by the filing of a petition for
annulment of proclamation.  This Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>The suspension of the 10-day statutory period for the filing of an election
protest until such time as the Commission on Elections has finally decided the
pending pre-proclamation controversy is but logical and just, since if the
protestant prevails in the pre-proclamation controversy, there would be no
further need for him to file a regular election protest. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Court has since the case of Benjamin S. Abalos vs. Ernesto S.
Domingo G.R. No. 52665, Resolution of February 29, 1980] deemed suspended the
10-day statutory period for the filing of an election protest during the
pendency of a pre-proclamation controversy and in all subsequent cases, the
latest of which is its decision of July 25, 1980 G.R. No. 53532, Noli M.
Valenzuela v. Comelec] wherein the losing party in the pre-proclamation
controversy was granted “a period of ten [10] days from receipt of this
Resolution [of dismissal] to file before the proper court a quo warranto suit
or election protest.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn8' href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The filing of pre-proclamation controversies under §248 of the
Omnibus Election Code, however, is not the only ground for the suspension of
proclamation.  Two other instances are
provided in R.A. No. 6646, known as “The Electoral Reforms Law of 1987,” <i>viz</i>.:  (1) Under §6 of the statute, the COMELEC
may, upon motion of the complainant in an action for disqualification, suspend
the proclamation of the winning candidate if the evidence of his guilt is
strong, and (2) under §7 thereof, the COMELEC may likewise suspend the
proclamation of the winning candidate if there is ground for denying or canceling
his certificate of candidacy.  Thus, §6
of R.A. No. 6646 provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>Effect of Disqualification Case</i>. - Any candidate who has
been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and
the votes cast for him shall not be counted.  If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before
an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning
number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with
the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry or protest and, upon motion of the
complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the
suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his
guilt is strong.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:0in'>Sec. 7, on the
other hand, states:</p>

<blockquote><i>Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of
Candidacy. -</i> The procedure hereinabove provided shall apply to petitions to
deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy as provided in Section
78 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>These actions are in the nature of pre-proclamation controversies
and, therefore, like pre-proclamation contests, their filing is a ground for
the suspension of proclamation and, consequently, of the period for filing
either an election protest or a petition for <i>quo warranto.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BODY>However, petitioner is correct that SPA No. 98-356 is not a
pre-proclamation controversy.  Much less
is it a petition for disqualification or for the denial or cancelation of a
certificate of candidacy.  Indeed,
private respondent does not claim that her petition raises pre-proclamation
issues.  She frankly admits that SPA No.
98-356 is a petition filed under §6 of the Omnibus Election Code for a
declaration of failure of election.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn9' href="#_edn9"
name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, her petition clearly states its nature, as it is denominated PETITION
TO DECLARE A FAILURE OF ELECTION AND/OR TO ANNUL THE ELECTION RESULTS IN THE
MUNICIPALITY OF KABUNTALAN, FIRST DISTRICT OF MAGUINDANAO, and alleges the
following:<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn10' href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=NUM>4.1  No valid and
legitimate elections were actually held or conducted in the above-mentioned
municipality;</p>

<p class=NUM>4.2  No valid and/or
legitimate elections were actually held in the said municipality as OFFICIAL
BALLOTS were, in fact, PREPARED BY ONLY a few individuals.  This fact will be shown by the signatures
and thumbmarks affixed in the Voting Registration Records of each of the
precincts in the municipality which do not belong to the registered voters;</p>

<p class=NUM>4.3  The official ballots
having been prepared by persons other than the registered voters, the votes
reflected in the election returns coming from the various precincts of the same
municipality are not truly reflective of the actual and true votes cast in the
said precincts;</p>

<p class=NUM>4.4  Widespread violence
and intimidation were employed to force watchers of the Petitioners to leave
the polling places and thus, giving a chance for the representatives of the
respondent to perpetrate the above allegations.</p>

<blockquote>Attached hereto and marked as Annexes are the sworn affidavits of
witnesses of Petitioners as well as certified true copies of the Voters
Registration Records and the Voter’s Voting Records attesting to the facts of
the allegations above-stated;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Please refer to the Annexes hereto attached.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Voter’s Registration Records duly certified by the Election
Assistant of Kabuntalan, Maguindanao, on May 19, 1998, shows that the Voting
Record at the back thereof is TOTALLY BLANK, meaning entries therein were not
filled up.  The Voter’s Voting Record,
which is likewise, hereto attached, does not match with the Voter’s
Registration Record.  Even with our
naked eye, one can already conclude that there was actually NO voting that took
place in the Municipality of Kabuntalan.</blockquote>

<p class=NUM>5.  By reason of the above
terrorism, fraud and violence committed by the respondent, her supporters and
sympathizers, there was failure of election in Kabuntalan, Maguindanao.  Any proclamation of the respondent is void <i>ab
initio</i> there being a failure of election;</p>

<p class=NUM>6.  There is a need for a
technical examination of the Voter’s Registration Records and the List of
Voters with Voting records for the purpose of determining the massive
substitute voting in the precincts in Kabuntalan, Maguindanao</p>

<p class=BODY>In <i>Matalam v. COMELEC</i>,<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn11'
href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that an action for a declaration of the failure of election is not
in the nature of a pre-proclamation controversy.  The distinction between the two actions was discussed by the
Court in <i>Loong v. COMELEC</i><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn12' href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>While, however, the COMELEC is
restricted, in pre-proclamation cases, to an examination of the election
returns on their face and is without jurisdiction to go beyond or behind them
and investigate election irregularities, the COMELEC is duty bound to
investigate allegations of fraud, terrorism, violence and other analogous
causes in actions for annulment of election results or for declaration of
failure of elections, as the Omnibus Election Code denominates the same.  Thus, the COMELEC, in the case of actions
for annulment of election results or declaration of failure of elections, may
conduct technical examination of election documents and compare and analyze
voters’ signatures and fingerprints in order to determine whether or not the
elections had indeed been free, honest and clean.  Needless to say, a pre-proclamation controversy is not the same
as an action for annulment of election results or declaration of failure of
elections.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY align=left style='text-align:left'>Private respondent, on the
other hand, contends that as long as there is a prayer for the annulment of a
proclamation, the filing of such petition effectively suspends the running of
the period for filing an election protest.  This contention has no merit.  Not all actions seeking the annulment of proclamation suspend the
running of the period for filing an election protest or a petition for quo
warranto. For it is not the relief prayed for which distinguishes actions under
§248 from an election protest or quo warranto proceedings, but the grounds on
which they are based.</p>

<p class=BODY align=left style='text-align:left'>The purpose for allowing
pre-proclamation controversies is to put a stop to the pernicious practice of
unscrupulous candidates of “grabbing the proclamation and prolonging the
protest.” Accordingly, grounds which are proper for electoral protests should not
be allowed to delay the proclamation of the winners.  As this Court pointed out in <i>Dimaporo v. Commission on
Elections</i>:<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It may well be true that that public policy
may occasionally permit the occurrence of “grab the proclamation and prolong
the protest” situations; that public policy, however, balances the possibility
of such situations against the shortening of the period during which no winners
are proclaimed, a period commonly fraught with tension and danger for the
public at large.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In view of the foregoing, we hold that the filing by private
respondent of a petition for declaration of failure of election (SPA No.
98-356) did not suspend the running of the reglementary period within which to
file an election protest or quo warranto proceedings.  The period for private respondent to do so expired on May 24,
1998, 10 days from the proclamation of Sukarno Samad and petitioner as mayor
and vice-mayor, respectively.  The
filing of private respondent’s election protest in the RTC on June 19, 1998 was
made out of time. </p>

<p class=BODY>However, petitioner’s contention that the assailed resolution is
invalid because Commissioner Abdul Gani M. Marohombsar had no authority to sign
the same, because his term had expired when the resolution was promulgated, is
without merit. It appears that Commissioner Marohombsar’s term expired on June
3, 1999 (not June 4, 1999 as alleged by petitioner), while the assailed
resolution was promulgated on June 29, 1999.  The voting was 6-1.  Even
disregarding the vote of Commissioner Marohombsar there was still a
majority.  The resolution in question
is, therefore, valid.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, private respondent contends that the petition
in SPR No. 37-98 filed in the COMELEC by Samad, petitioner’s predecessor,
should be dismissed and stricken out since it is actually based on a motion to
dismiss in Election Protest No. 38-98 in the RTC, which is a prohibited
pleading under the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.</p>

<p class=BODY>The argument is also untenable.  Private respondent apparently refers to the prohibition found in Rule
13, §1 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure,<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn14'
href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:red'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
under Part III entitled initiation of actions or proceedings before the
commission.  As is evident from the said
heading, this provision is applicable only to actions or proceedings before the
COMELEC.  Rule 1, §2 of the COMELEC
Rules states:</p>

<blockquote>These rules, except Part VI, shall apply to all actions and
proceedings brought before the Commission.  Part VI shall apply to election contests and <i>quo warranto</i> cases
cognizable by courts of general or limited jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>The prohibition, therefore, does not
apply to the proceedings in the RTC where the motion to dismiss was filed.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution, dated June 29, 1999, of the
Commission on Elections is SET ASIDE and Election Protest No. 38-98 in the
