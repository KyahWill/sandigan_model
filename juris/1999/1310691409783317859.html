Gavino, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously have carnal knowledge with the said Annabelle R. Gavino against the latter's will and without her consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded "not guilty" to both charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Trial ensued, and, thereafter, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered its decision on January 23, 1995, finding the accused-appellant guilty as charged and sentencing him as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Mauro Suba y Musngi guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in two (2) instances: That one committed on November 9, 1992 and the other on January 24, 1993, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each case and to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P120,000.00 in both cases and to pay the costs of suit.<br><br>The Provincial Warden is hereby ordered to commit the accused to the National Penitentiary within ten (10) days from the promulgation of this Decision and thereafter to make his report unto this Court regarding the said commitment.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The facts as established by the prosecution follows.<br><br>Between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. on November 9, 1992, private complainant Annabelle R. Gavino (hereinafter "Annabelle"), then fourteen (14) years old, was busy cleaning their house in Barangay Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga. She heard someone calling from downstairs. It was accused-appellant, a cousin of her father, who asked to borrow matches. Annabelle answered that she did not have any. She thought that accused-appellant had left. To her surprise, he had gone upstairs. Without a word, he approached her and poked a <i>balisong</i> (fanknife) at her neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>With the knife menacingly pointed at Annabelle's neck, appellant proceeded to undress her. She started to cry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> After undressing her, accused-appellant pushed her down to the floor. As she lay on her back, appellant went on top of her and had sexual intercourse with her. All the while the fanknife was pointed at her neck. After violating Annabelle, accused-appellant left with the threat that if she reported the incident to anyone he would kill her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>A similar incident occurred on January 24, 1993. At mid-morning, appellant called Annabelle from downstairs and asked this time if he could borrow a <i>tambayok </i>(a straight flattened bamboo used on the shoulders to carry two loads on both ends). She told him that she had none and again she thought that he left thereafter. But, he went upstairs and threatened her with a <i>balisong </i>pointed at her neck. Appellant asked Annabelle if she reported what had happened before to anyone to which she answered in the negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant again proceeded to rape Annabelle poking his knife at her neck the whole time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the middle of it all, Annabelle's older brother, Arnold arrived and saw his sister being ravaged by accused-appellant. Alarmed at Arnold's arrival, accused-appellant quickly put on his short pants and ran away. Arnold consoled his sister who was crying. He reported what had happened to his parents as well as the parents of the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> That same day, the Gavino family reported the incident to the barangay authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The next day, January 25, 1993, Annabelle was brought to Lingad Hospital, where Dr. Marissa P. Morales examined her. Said examination yielded the following results:<br><blockquote><center>x x x<br></center><br>LABIA MAJORA:<br><br>LABIA MINORA: coaptated<br><br>HYMEN: (+) healed laceration at 3 o'clock &amp; 9 o'clock position<br><br>PELVIC EXAM:<br><br>I.E. THE FINDINGS: introitus admit 1 finger with ease, ex soft, closed, uterus small, adnexae (-), (-) bleeding<br><br>LABORATORY REQUEST:<br><br>Pregnancy test - negative Smear for Spermatoza - negative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellants defense consists merely of denials and alibi.<br><br>Testifying for his own defense, accused-appellant vehemently denied having had carnal knowledge of Annabelle. In open court accused-appellant narrated that on 24 January 1993, the day of the alleged second rape, he was instructed by his mother to borrow matches from Aling Pacing whose house'was at the back of the complainant's home. He thus passed by the house of Annabelle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He was in the dark as to the allegations of Arnold Gavino that the latter saw him having sexual intercourse with Annabelle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He, however, remembered that on his way back from Aling Pacing, he had bumped into Arnold in front oi the Gavino household. He then tried to borrow Arnold's bicycle as he had to go to the Batasan. Arnold, however, refused to lend him the bicycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Also in the Gavino household at that time was Annabelle's Aunt Emy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Emy even told accused-appellant that it was good that Arnold did not lend him the bicycle as he might just destroy it. That same day Emy recounted to her husband, Benny, accused-appellant's visit to the Gavino household. Accused-appellant surmised that Emy must have told Benny that accused-appellant was fooling Arnold and had cursed her,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> because on his way home from the Batasan. Benny accosted him and hit him with a club.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Fearing that Benny might do him more harm, he went to Zaragoza, Kueva Ecija where he stayed for three months.<br><br>As to the alleged rape on 9 November 1992, the accused-appellant simply remembered seeing Annabelle Gavino with her sisters and friends on the road to their bamo that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>To support his claim, accused-appellant presented his mother Lolita Musngi. She testified that on 24 January 1993, at around 9:00 in the morning, she was doing the laundry at home. Arnold Gavino approached her and asked for the whereabouts of the accused. When she asked him why, Arnold replied that "It seems that Mauro was doing something untoward to my sister." When she asked Arnold if he had actually witnessed what he was talking about, he answered in the negative. After her encounter with Arnold, she proceeded to the Gavino household and saw Annabelle by the table crying. She then asked Annabelle what Mauro did to her saying: "<i>Kinana ka ba</i>? (Did he have sexual intercourse with you?), to which-the young lass replied "No," shaking her head and still crying. Annabelle then explained that the reason why she was crying was because her brother Arnold had boxed her. At the lime of her conversation with Annabelle, her son Mauro was at Baxangay Batasan, San Miguel, Bulacan. However, earlier that day, she had asked Mauro to borrow matches from Aling Pacing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As mentioned earlier, accused-appellant was convicted of the offenses charged against him. In brief, accused-appellant raise the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED GIVING (sic) CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT, ANNABELLE GAVINO THE WAY SHE WAS SUPPOSEDLY RAPED.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT TO THE TESTIMONY OF ARNOLD GAVINO.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING PROPER CONCLUSION ON THE MEDICAL FINDINGS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>The first two assignment of errors refer to the credibility of the witnesses, hence, will be discussed jointly.<br><br>In the futile attempt to assail the credibility of Annabelle, accused-appellant points the portions of her testimony which weaken her allegation that she was raped. He claims that Annabelle could not have possibly been intimidated since, when he allegedly threatened her with a knife, Annabelle was upstairs while appellant was downstairs:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%">Court:</td> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Q -</td> <td>Were you upstairs when Mauro Suba showed you the knife? </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Witness:</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A -</td> <td> Yes, sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">Atty.

He poked his knife at her neck not only while she was being undressed but also while he was raping her. In recounting the November 9, 1992 incident, Annabelle testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Pros.

Hence, accused-appellant's allegation that "she did not resent the undressing" and that "there was no reaction on her part while being allegedly raped" is totally unfounded. She did not do anything as she was afraid because he was holding that balisong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Taking into account the following factors: that a knife was poked at Annabelle's neck; that accused-appellant was an ascendant, being a cousin of her father; and that accused-appellant was reputedly a notorious person who was "much feared in our place;" and known to have even "mauled his brothers;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> it was not abnormal for Annabelle to have reacted as she did.<br><br>Likewise, accused-appellant's claim that Annabelle was raped while standing deserves scant consideration, as she narrated that she was sexually abused after being forced to lie down, thus: <blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Pros.

This is so because it had the better opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Illuminating are the following observations made by the trial court:<br><blockquote>Complainant Annabelle Gavino is a small girl of 16 years of age when she testified in Court on the ugly details of her alleged traumatic experience. She was dark-skinned, shy, timid, abash and a true picture of a barrio lass untouched and unaffected by the modem culture and ways of the present youth. She is a daughter of a marginal family in a remote barno in Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga which, during the rainy season, is not accessible to the Provincial Capital where the Courts are situated thus, in the prosecution of these cases, as gathered by the Court during the ocular inspection of the house of the complainant, she, her mother and brother Arnold have to leave their residence a day before the date set for the hearine and spent the night in a friend's house along the way to be on time for the Court for the hearing the next day.<br><br>In recounting the details of her defloration, and very obviously unaccustomed to the atmosphere of the courtroom, she broke down on several occasions. In all these occasions, however, and despite the Courfs insinuations of a deferment of the hearing because of her emotional deportment, she insisted on proceeding on with the trial. On several occasions, too, she has to be coaxed by the Court to speajc louder as her voice was barely audible. Despite, however, those encumbrances, she was straightforward, honest, and truthful in the narration of facts. She stood firm and steadfast on her assertions, weathering frank and sometimes rough questions too humiliating for a woman of her tender age. She narrated the facts in a most natural way that an impartial mind could be freed from the doubt or suspicion of embellishment, insincerity and untruthfulness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>Not only is Annabelle's testimony free from doubt, or suspicion of embellishment, insincerity and un truthfulness, but the young girl had no reason to falsely incriminate accused-appellant. She has no motive to charge him with a heinous and loathsome offense except "her desire for justice and redress for a terrible wrong inflicted on her." Her testimony that she was raped by the accused-appellant sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused-appellant.<br><br>In a last ditch effort to exonerate himself, accused-appellant claims that the absence of spermatozoa in Annabelle's organ when she was physically examined proves that there was no rape. He adds that inasmuch as there was ejaculation based on the testimonies that "the accused complete (sic) a sexual act on both occasion . . . (I)f it were so, then the doctor should have found seminal fluid."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>A careful examination of the transcript of records reveals that neither Annabelle nor Arnold testified that accused-appellant had an ejaculation during the sexual act. Besides, the absence of spermatozoa in the complainant's vagina does not necessarily negate the commission of rape. There may be a valid explanation for such absence, as when the semen may have been washed away or when the rapist failed to ejaculate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Per current case law. a rape victim is entitled to a civil indemnity of P50,000.00 per count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Seeing no cogent reason why the amount of indemnity should be raised in this particular instance, we find the award of the trial court of P120,000.00 incorrect. We, however, award moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00. As ruled in the case of <i>People v. Prades</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> an additional award of P50,000.00 is due the rape victim notwithstanding the absence of proof of its award, in view of the fact that she has in fact suffered mental, physical and psychological trauma.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision convicting Mauro Suba y Musngi of two counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each crime is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>, with the modification that he is ordered to pay the victim P100,000.00 as civil indemnity; and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.
