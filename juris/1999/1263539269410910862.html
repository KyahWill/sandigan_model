				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision dated September 3, 1992 
of the Regional Trial Court, Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 76, San Mateo, Rizal 
in Criminal Case No. 1667 finding accused Rolly Paranzo alias Lorenzo Parani 
guilty of the crime of rape committed against complainant Anna Liza Jacobe and 
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to 
indemnify her in the amount of P30,000.00 and to pay the costs. 
<p>In a criminal complaint filed by Anna Liza Jacobe, with the assistance of her 
mother Gloria Jacobe, Rolly Paranzo alias Lorenzo Parani was accused of the 
crime of rape committed as follows: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>“That in or about 1:00 a.m., on November 13, 1991, in the Municipality of 
Rodriguez, Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, by means of threats, force and intimidation, did 
then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the 
undersigned complainant Anna Liza Jacobe against her will and consent. </p>
<p>Contrary to law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty. At the ensuing trial, the 
prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: Anna Liza Jacobe, her grandmother 
Rafaela Jacobe and Dr. Jesusa Nieves of the PNP Crime Laboratory Service, Camp 
Crame, Quezon City, who conducted the medical examination of complainant after 
the alleged incident of rape. The defense, on the other hand, presented Anna 
Liza Jacobe as hostile witness and the accused himself. 
</p><p>The trial court summarized the testimonies of the witnesses, as follows: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>“Complainant’s version of the subject incident is as follows: On November 13, 
1991, at around 1:00 a.m., accused Paranzo raped her inside the house of one 
Teresa Rivera located at Yagit, San Rafael, Montalban. While she was sleeping, 
accused lied on top of her. She was awakened and she noticed blood on her 
shorts, the blood coming from her private part. She felt pain in her genital. 
She tried to stop him but he continued doing what he was doing. She did not 
shout because accused was intimidating her, pointing a knife at her neck. </p>
<p>Annaliza further alleged that that was not the first time that accused 
sexually abused her. Accused first raped her in 1990 near the calamansi 
plantation in San Jose, Montalban. She reported it to her mother but the latter 
did not do anything. The second time accused raped her was in the house of 
accused’s brother located at the other side of the river. She did not do 
anything because accused was intimidating her. She was then living with her 
father at Ibayo, Maly but accused brought her to his brother’s house and there 
raped her. The third time accused raped her (November 13, 1991), accused and her 
(complainant’s) mother, who had been living together, were already separated. 
</p>
<p>Complainant’s grandmother, Rafaela Jacobe, testified that complainant is the 
daughter of her (Rafaela’s) son; that in November 1991, complainant was not 
living with her. Complainant started living with her only after the incident 
when she (complainant) was raped in the calamansian in San Jose, Montalban; that 
at the time complainant was raped, she was still eleven (11) years old; that she 
has no personal knowledge of the incident; that after the rape incident, 
complainant’s mother gave complainant to her (Rafaela) because allegedly 
complainant is hardheaded; that she does not have a grudge against her 
daughter-in-law, complainant’s mother, because she is a good woman and it is her 
son who was negligent; that complainant’s mother and accused are not living 
together anymore because complainant’s mother has another husband again, a 
different one. </p>
<p>Dr. Jesusa Nieves of the PNP Crime Laboratory Service, Camp Crame, Quezon 
City, conducted the medical examination of complainant after the alleged 
incident of rape. She testified that at the time of the examination which she 
conducted on November 15, 1991, at around 11:30 a.m., subject (complainant) was 
in a non-virgin state physically but there was no external sign of recent 
application of any form of violence; that there was no sign of infection, 
neither spermatozoa in the vagina and the area surrounding the passage of urine; 
that based on the healed laceration she saw during the examination, it is 
possible that the victim had sexual intercourse seven (7) days or more; It could 
be months or years based on the healed laceration, but based on the findings, 
which is abrasion on the labia menora, it is possible that there was recent 
trauma at the genitalia of the victim, meaning that the abrasion could have been 
caused by a rub or friction of a hard blunt object at the area of the genitalia, 
more or less within five (5) days prior to the examination on November 15, 1991; 
that the loss of victim’s virginity was caused by sexual intercourse. </p>
<p>Subsequently in a surprise turn of events, complainant Annaliza testified for 
the Defense and stated that what she wants is “palabasin na po namin siya dahil 
wala naman pong nangyari sa amin” (TSN, p. 3, August 26, 1992 hearing). In 
connection with the said statement, complainant executed an affidavit of 
desistance. (Exh. 1). Complainant further testified that she lied when she 
testified before in Court and she lied when she executed her affidavit complaint 
in connection with this case; that when she testified, she agreed to tell the 
truth but when she testified before the Court, she was not telling the truth; 
that she is not aware that by giving false testimony, she can be held liable; 
that she executed the affidavit of desistance because of the promise of monetary 
settlement but she had not yet been paid; that were it not for the monetary 
settlement, she would not execute the affidavit of desistance. </p>
<p>Upon the other hand, accused Rolly Paranzo pleaded “NOT GUILTY” to the charge 
when arraigned with the assistance of Atty. Regino Garillo, counsel <em>de 
oficio</em>, on January 23, 1992. He denied the charge against him and claimed 
that on the date and time of the alleged rape, he was working in a 
slaughterhouse in San Jose, Montalban. He reports for work at 4:00 p.m. and 
leaves work at 7:00 a.m. the following day. He works at nighttime. </p>
<p>Accused gave a reason for the filing of this case against him. Thus: the 
child’s mother was borrowing P200.00 from him and since he did not lend her that 
amount, she threatened him by saying: “If you will not lend me that amount, you 
will regret afterwards”. Subsequently, he was arrested by the police but he was 
not told the reason why he was arrested. </p>
<p>Accused further alleged that he was arrested on November 12, 1991, brought to 
Fiscal Nañola on November 13, 1991 and then to the Fiscal’s Office in Pasig on 
November 14, 1991; that he signed the waiver of detention not knowing that it 
was a waiver since he was told by the police that it was regarding the food; 
that the slaughterhouse where he works is far from his place of residence. From 
Sitio Yagit going to San Jose, he would have to take a jeep since it cannot be 
reached by walking.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court found that the accused-appellant raped Anna Liza as charged, 
and held that although there was no sign of violence on her body, rape was 
committed because she was under twelve years of age. 
</p><p>The dispositive portion of the decision states: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Rolly Paranzo alias 
Lorenzo Parani guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined 
and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences him 
to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify complainant 
Anna Liza Jacobe in the amount P30,000.00, and to pay the costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>The accused-appellant appeals to this Court on the following assignment of 
errors: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>“THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT 
THAT THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT WAS NOT CORROBORATED AND TAINTED WITH 
DOUBT. </p>
<p>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING FULL CREDIT AND CONSIDERATION ON (SIC) 
THE AFFIDAVIT OF DESISTANCE AND TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT WHO OPENLY 
TESTIFIED THAT SHE LIED BEFORE THE LOWER COURT. </p>
<p>THAT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN MAINTAINING THAT COMPLAINANT WAS A MINOR 
ALTHOUGH NO PROOF OF BIRTH HAS BEEN PRESENTED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant avers that a conviction for the crime of rape must be based on 
clear and convincing proof of guilt and not merely on the uncorroborated 
testimony of complainant Anna Liza Jacobe which is not clear and free from any 
contradiction. He points out that complainant’s allegation that the rape on 
November 13, 1991 was committed in the house of a certain Teresa Rivera is not 
supported by any showing that she indeed slept at the said house on the night of 
November 12, 1991 and stayed there up to November 13, 1991, and that the 
complainant, sometime in the course of her testimony, retracted and testified 
that what she earlier told the lower court was a pure lie, thereby casting doubt 
on her credibility. 
</p><p>Appellant also contends that except for the testimony of Rafaela Jacobe, 
complainant’s grandmother, no proof was ever presented to show the exact date of 
birth and age of the complainant. Furthermore, accused-appellant adverts to 
certain inconsistencies between the testimony of the complainant and that of Dr. 
Jesusa Nieves, i.e. Dr. Nieves testified that based on the healed laceration she 
saw during the examination, it is possible that the victim had sexual 
intercourse, months or years or not later than seven (7) days or more before; 
that the abrasion found on victim’s labia menora is a recent trauma which could 
have been caused by a rub or friction of a hard blunt object at the area of the 
genitalia, more or less five (5) days prior to November 15, 1991 (TSN, pp. 5-6, 
July 16, 1992), whereas complainant testified that on November 13, 1991 at about 
1:00 A.M., the accused-appellant raped her and as a matter of fact blood came 
out of her private part (TSN, p. 4, March 4, 1992; TSN, pp. 15-16, March 25, 
1992). Thus, it was not possible that complainant was raped on November 13, 
1991, which is only three (3) days before she was physically examined. 
</p><p>The Solicitor General filed brief for the appellee praying for the affirmance 
of the judgment of conviction of the accused-appellant and for the increase in 
the civil indemnity from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00 pursuant to prevailing 
jurisprudence. It is contended that the victim’s testimony that she was raped by 
the accused in the early morning of November 13, 1991 at the ground floor of the 
house of Teresa Rivera, the then live-in partner of the accused-appellant, need 
not be corroborated by statements of other persons including that of Teresa 
Rivera who according to complainant all slept in the second floor of the said 
house that night and did not know that the accused and the complainant were at 
the ground floor. The appellee also contends that there is no inconsistency 
between the testimony of Dr. Jesusa Nieves and that of the complainant regarding 
the sexual assault committed by the accused-appellant. 
</p><p>As regards the alleged failure of the prosecution to establish that the 
complainant was below twelve years of age at the time of the rape incident, 
appellee argues that such contention is of no consequence because under Article 
335 of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a 
woman by, among others, using force or intimidation and the instant case, the 
rape of the complainant was accomplished by using force and/or intimidation. The 
Solicitor General contends that on the two (2) earlier occasions that 
complainant Anna Liza was sexually molested, she was intimidated (TSN, pp. 3-4, 
March 25, 1992) and on the third time that she was ravished, a knife was pointed 
at her neck (TSN, p. 17, March 25, 1992). Whether or not complainant was below 
twelve years of age at the time she was raped is beside the point. 
</p><p>The appellee controverts the argument of the appellant that since Dr. Nieves’ 
findings show that there was no external injury on the private part of Anna 
Liza, sexual intercourse in this case could have been consummated with her 
consent and that the abrasion found at the labia menora could have been caused 
by the complainant herself by scratching her genitalia prior to her medical 
examination. The appellee maintains that as explained by Dr. Nieves, based on 
the healed laceration, it is possible that Anna Liza had sexual intercourse 
seven (7) days or more prior to November 15, 1991, but the abrasion at the labia 
menora could have been caused by sexual intercourse within five (5) days from 
November 15, 1991, the day she conducted the physical examination of Anna Liza 
(see TSN, p. 6, July 16, 1992), meaning that the sexual assault could have 
happened on November 13, 1991. 
</p><p>Finally, as regards the defense of alibi put up by the accused-appellant, as 
well as his contention that the victim’s mother had an axe to grind against him, 
these claims are unavailing in the light of clear and positive evidence of the 
prosecution establishing accused-appellant’s guilt. Besides, it was not 
physically impossible for the appellant to have committed the offense of rape 
imputed to him in or about 1:00 A.M. of November 13, 1991 for the reason that 
Sitio Yagit, Barangay San Rafael, where the rape incident happened and Barangay 
San Jose where the slaughter house (workplace of accused-appellant) is located 
are separated only by Barangay Balite and that these three barangays are located 
in the Municipality of Montalban, (now Rodriguez), Rizal which could be 
traversed by jeep. 
</p><p>We find no merit in the appeal. 
</p><p>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> states: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>“Art. 335. <em>When and how rape is committed</em>. Rape is committed by 
having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. By using force or intimidation; </p>
<p>2. When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and </p>
<p>3. When the woman is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the 
circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present.” 
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Circumstances 1, 2 and 3 are alternative circumstances. When the rape is 
committed by using force or intimidation, the victim does not have to be less 
than twelve (12) years of age. It is only required that the proper complaint and 
information for rape must clearly describe the specific circumstance which would 
make the carnal knowledge of a woman qualify as rape under Article 335. 
</p><p>Otherwise stated, the complaint and information must concretely describe the 
crime of rape in any of the specified forms prescribed in the said Article 335 
so as to duly inform the accused of the nature of the accusation against 
him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>The complaint in the case at bar alleges that the rape was committed by the 
accused-appellant against complainant’s will and consent “by means of threats, 
force and intimidation.” 
</p><p>A careful review of the evidence for the prosecution convinces us that the 
accused had carnal knowledge of the offended party through the use of force and 
intimidation in the early morning of November 13, 1991. 
</p><p>Complainant’s testimony is clear and positive on this point: 
</p><blockquote>

of her, kissing her and she noticed that she no longer has her panty and that 
she tried to shout but the accused pointed a sharp instrument at her neck at the 
time that the witness felt that the accused was on top of her that she was

<p>Contrary to the claim of the appellant, the trial court based its judgment of 
conviction not solely on complainant’s testimony. The testimony of complainant 
Anna Liza Jacobe was corroborated by the Medico-Legal Report (No. M-1652-91) on 
the examination conducted by prosecution witness, Dr. Jesusa Nieves, (Exh. E) to 
the effect that the complainant, when medically examined by her, was found to be 
“in non-virgin state physically; there are no external signs of recent 
application of any form of violence.” Dr. Nieves however, also testified that 
Anna Liza’s hymen was already lacerated since she (Dr. Nieves) was able to 
insert the speculum during the examination; that the laceration of Anna Liza’s 
hymen may be due to sexual intercourse or as a result of its penetration by a 
hard object, like a penis, among others, (Tsn, pp. 5-6, July 16, 1992). Dr. 
Nieves explained that based on the healed laceration, it is possible that Anna 
Liza had sexual intercourse seven (7) days or more prior to November 13, 1991 
but the abrasion at her labia menora could have been caused by sexual 
intercourse within five (5) days from November 15, 1991, when she examined her. 
Dr. Nieves testified thus: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>“Q. At the time you conducted examination upon the person of this Annaliza 
Jacobe, will you state before this Court the possible time that she (ha(d) lost 
her virginity? </p>
<p>A. Basing on the healed laceration which I saw during the examination it is 
possible that the victim had sexual intercourse seven (7) days or more, sir. It 
could be months or years based on the healed laceration but based (on) the 
findings which is abrasion at the labia menora, it is possible that there was a 
recent trauma at the genitalia of the victim, sir. </p>
<p>Q. And when you tell that there is a recent trauma at the genitalia of the 
victim, what do you mean by that? </p>
<p>A. As I have said earlier there was an abrasion at the inner lip so that 
abrasion could have been caused by a rub or friction of a hard blunt object at 
the area of the genitalia, sir. </p>
<p>Q. This could be how many days, more or less prior to the examination that 
you conducted on November 15, 1991? </p>
<p>A. Within five (5) days, sir.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, as clearly declared by the complainant and confirmed by Dr. 
Nieves, it was very possible that sexual intercourse between the 
accused-appellant and the complainant took place on November 13, 1991. 
</p><p>We find that the appellant was able to have carnal knowledge of the 
complainant in the early dawn of November 13, 1991 by using force and 
intimidation, i.e., by the use of a knife pointed at complainant’s neck in the 
third rape incident which is the subject of the present indictment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>The Court has repeatedly held that rape is committed when intimidation was 
used on the victim and the latter submitted against her will because of fear for 
her life or personal safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It is 
not necessary that the force or intimidation employed be so great or of such 
character as could not be resisted because all that is required is that it be 
sufficient to consummate the purpose that the accused had in mind. And in the 
case at bar, there is no need for the prosecution to show or prove that the 
complainant-victim was a minor below twelve years of age, as erroneously claimed 
by the appellant in the third assigned error. 
</p><p>The appellant argues in his second assigned error that the lower court erred 
in not giving full credit and consideration to the affidavit of desistance and 
the testimony of the complainant that she lied when she first testified before 
the lower court. This particular assigned error was not discussed by the 
appellant in his memorandum, which simply stated that when complainant Anna Liza 
Jacobe testified that she lied when she executed her affidavit of desistance 
(Exh. 1) and also when she first testified before the lower court (TSN, p. 3, 
August 26, 1992), doubt is cast on her credibility. 
</p><p>Well settled is the rule that the trial court’s assessment of the credibility 
of witnesses is accorded great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal 
unless a material or substantial fact has been overlooked or misappreciated 
which if properly taken into account may alter the outcome of the case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The credibility given by the trial court 
to a rape victim is an important aspect of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Generally, the courts lend credence to 
the testimonies of young girls especially where the facts point to their having 
been victims of sexual assault. What is important is that the trial court which 
had observed the demeanor of the witnesses during their testimonies, found the 
testimony of the complainant credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In fact, the rape victim’s testimony, 
standing alone, can be made the basis of the accused’s prosecution and 
conviction, if such testimony meets the test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> A victim who says she has been raped 
almost always says all there is to be said<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and it is an accepted rule that the 
credibility of a rape victim is not impaired by some inconsistencies in her 
testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>Furthermore, the testimony of the complainant as to who abused her is 
credible where no motive on her part to incriminate and falsely testify against 
the accused has been shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In rape 
cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the testimony of the complaining 
witness provided such testimony is credible, natural, convincing and otherwise 
consistent with human nature and the course of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In the case at bar, the trial court 
concluded that: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>“[T]he earlier declarations in Court by complainant about the sexual abuse 
she suffered in the hands of the accused cannot be doubted, straight forward and 
detailed as they were and given without any sign of influence having been 
exerted on her.” </p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court stated that only the subsequent declarations made by 
complainant regarding the sexual abuse she suffered in the hands of the accused 
are “dubious, and obviously improperly motivated”. The trial court correctly 
disregarded the said declarations because of the complainant’s admission in open 
court that she executed the Sinumpaang Salaysay sa Pag-uurong ng Demanda or 
Affidavit of Desistance (Exh. 1) because of the promise of monetary settlement; 
that were it not for the monetary settlement, she would not execute the 
affidavit of desistance and that the accused-appellant reneged in his promise to 
pay or make a monetary settlement of the case with the complainant. Moreover, 
complainant was not aware that she could be held liable if she lied and/or gave 
false testimony in court (TSN, pp. 5 and 6, August 26, 1992 Hearing). As stated 
earlier, the assessment of the credibility of the complainant in a rape case 
falls primarily with the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
Discrepancies between statements in an affidavit and those made on the witness 
stand would seldom discredit the declarant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Moreover, ample margin of error and 
understanding should be accorded to young witnesses, like the complainant who, 
much more than adults, would be gripped with tension due to the novelty of the 
experience of testifying before a Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
</p><p>Finally, we agree with the trial court that the defense of alibi put up by 
accused-appellant cannot be sustained. The clear and positive identification of 
the accused made by the complainant cannot be overcome by the accused’s naked 
defense of alibi, especially so that the accused-appellant herein failed to 
present as witnesses the two other persons whom he claimed were with him working 
at the slaughter-house in Barrio San Jose, Montalban, in the afternoon of 
November 12, 1991 up to six o’clock in the morning of November 13, 1991 (TSN, 
pp. 5-7, September 3, 1992). In other words, the physical impossibility of the 
presence of the accused-appellant at the scene of the crime at Sitio Yagit, 
Barangay San Rafael, Municipality of Montalban in or about 1:00 A.M., of 
November 13, 1991, has not been corroborated and credibly established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
</p><p>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction rendered by Branch 76, 
Regional Trial Court, Fourth Judicial Region, San Mateo, Rizal in Criminal Case 
No. 1667. Pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, the civil indemnity granted by 
the trial court to the complainant in the amount of P30,000.00 is modified and 
is hereby increased to P50,000.00. Furthermore, in light of recent 
jurisprudence, the victim shall be indemnified in the amount of P50,000.00 as 
moral damages notwithstanding the absence of proof of its award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the trial court finding the 
appellant guilty of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty 
of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to pay the costs is AFFIRMED with 
modification that the civil indemnity is increased to P50,000.00 and appellant 
shall indemnify Anna Liza Jacobe an additional amount of P50,000.00 as moral 
damages. Costs against appellant. 
</p><p>SO ORDERED.
