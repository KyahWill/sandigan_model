				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A violation of the dignity, purity and privacy of a child who is still innocent and unexposed to the ways of worldly pleasures is a harrowing experience that destroys not only her future but of the youth population as well, who in the teachings of our national hero, are considered the hope of the fatherland. Once again, the Court is confronted by another tragic desecration of human dignity, committed no less upon a child, who at the salad age of a few days past 12 years, has yet to knock on the portals of womanhood, and met her untimely death as a result of the "intrinsically evil act" of non-consensual sex called rape. Burdened with the supreme penalty of death, rape is an ignominious crime for which necessity is neither an excuse nor does there exist any other rational justification other than lust. But those who lust ought not to lust.<br><br>The Court quotes with approval from the People's Brief, the facts narrating the horrible experience and the tragic demise of a young and innocent child in the bloody hands of appellant, as such facts are ably supported by evidence on record:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> *<br><blockquote>"Appellant Larry Mahinay started working as houseboy with Maria Isip on November 20, 1993. His task was to take care of Isip's house which was under construction adjacent to her old residence situated inside a compound at No. 4165 Dian Street, Gen. T. de Leon, Valenzuela , Metro Manila. But he stayed and slept in an apartment also owned by Isip, located 10 meters away from the unfinished house (TSN, September 6, 1995, pp. 5-10).<br><br>"The victim, Ma. Victoria Chan, 12 years old, was Isip's neighbor in Dian Street. She used to pass by Isip's house on her way to school and play inside the compound yard, catching <i>maya</i> birds together with other children. While they were playing, appellant was always around washing his clothes. Inside the compound yard was a septic tank (TSN, August 22, 1995, pp. 29-31; September 6, 1995, pp. 17; 20-22).<br><br>"On June 25, 1995, at 8 o'clock a.m., appellant joined Gregorio Rivera in a drinking spree. Around 10 o'clock in the morning, appellant, who was already drunk, left Gregorio Rivera and asked permission from Isip to go out with his friends (TSN, September 6, 1995, pp. 9-11).<br><br>"Meantime, Isip's sister-in-law, Norgina Rivera, who also owned a store fronting the compound, saw Ma. Victoria on that same day three to four times catching birds inside Isip's unfinished house around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The unfinished house was about 8 meters away from Rivera's store (TSN, September 18, 1995, pp.9-11).<br><br>"On the other hand, Sgt. Roberto Suni, also a resident of Dian Street, went to his in-law's house between 6 to 7 o'clock p.m. to call his office regarding changes on the trip of President Fidel V. Ramos. The house of his in-laws was near the house of Isip. On his way to his in-law's house, Sgt. Suni met appellant along Dian Street. That same evening, between 8 to 9 o'clock p.m., he saw Ma. Victoria standing in front of the gate of the unfinished house (TSN, September 27, 1995, pp. 3-7; 14-17).<br><br>"Later, at 9 o'clock in the evening, appellant showed up at Norgina Rivera's store to buy lugaw. Norgina Rivera informed appellant that there was none left of it. She notice that appellant appeared to be uneasy and in deep thought. His hair was disarrayed; he was drunk and was walking in a dazed manner. She asked why he looked so worried but he did not answer. Then he left and walked back to the compound (TSN, September 18, 1995, pp. 4-8; 12-14).<br><br>"Meanwhile, Elvira Chan noticed that her daughter, Ma. Victoria, was missing. She last saw her daughter wearing a pair of white shorts, brown belt, a yellow hair ribbon, printed blue blouse, dirty white panty, white lady sando and blue rubber slippers (TSN, August 23, 1995, pp. 22, 33).<br><br>"Isip testified that appellant failed to show up for supper that night. On the following day, June 26, 1995, at 2 o'clock in the morning, appellant boarded a passenger jeepney driven by Fernando Trinidad at the <i>talipapa.</i> Appellant alighted at the top of the bridge of the North Expressway and had thereafter disappeared (TSN, September 20, 1995, pp. 4-9; September 27, 1995; pp. 14-17).<br><br>"That same morning, around 7:30, a certain Boy found the dead body of Ma. Victoria inside the septic tank. Boy immediately reported what he saw to the victim's parents, Eduardo and Elvira Chan (TSN, September 6, 1995, p. 13).<br><br>"With the help of the Valenzuela Police, the lifeless body of Ma. Victoria was retrieved from the septic tank. She was wearing a printed blouse without underwear. Her face bore bruises. Results of the autopsy revealed the following findings:<br><blockquote>Cyanosis, lips and nailbeds,<br><br>Contusions, supra pubic area, 6.0 x 3.0 cm., thigh right,<br><br>Anterior aspect, middle third, 4.5 x 3.0 cm.<br><br>Contused-abrasions on the forehead, 5.0 x 5.0 cm, angle of the left eye, lateral aspect, 2.5 x 1.5 cm. left jaw, 13.5 x 7.0 cm. neck, antero-lateral aspect, right, 2.0 x 1.0 cm. and left, 7.0 x 6.0 cm., left iliac area, 9.0 x 5.5 cm. intraclavicular area, left, posterior aspect, 4.0 x 2.0 cm. scapular area, right 4.0 x 4.0 cm. subscapular area, left, 1.5 x 1.5 cm. lumbar area, left 7.0 x 8.0 cm. arm, left, posterior aspect, middle third, 11.00 x 4.0 cm. elbows, right, 4.0 x 3.0 cm. and left 6.0 x 5.0 cm. forearms, left, posterior aspect, lower rd, 5.2 x 4.0 cm. hand, left, dorsal aspect, 0.8 x 0.9 cm. thighs; right antero-lateral aspect, upper 33<sup>rd</sup>, 12.0 x 10.0 cm. right anterior aspect, lower 3<sup>rd</sup> 5.0 x 2.0 cm. and left antero-lower 3<sup>rd</sup> , 5.5 x 2.5 cm. knee, right, lateral aspect, 1.5 x 1.0 cm. lateral mallcolum, left, 3.0 x 3.5 cm. foot, left, dorsal aspect 2.2 x 1.0 cm.<br><br>Hematoma, forehead, and scalp, left, 3.5 x 3.0 cm.<br><br>Hemorrhage, interstitial, underneath nailmarks, neck, subepicardial, subpleural petechial hemorrhages.<br><br>Hemorrhage, subdural, left fronto-parietal area.<br><br>Tracheo-bronchial tree, congested.<br><br>Other visceral organs, congested.<br><br>Stomach, contain 1/4 rice and other food particles.<br><br>CAUSE OF DEATH - Asphyxia by Manual Strangulation; Traumatic Head Injury, Contributory.<br><br>REMARKS: Hymen: tall, thick with complete lacerations at 4:00 and 8:00 o'clock position corresponding to the face of a watch edges congested with blood clots. (TSN, August 18, 1995; p. 4; Record, p. 126)</blockquote>"Back in the compound, SPO1 Arsenio Nacis and SPO1 Arnold Alabastro were informed by Isip that her houseboy, appellant Larry Mahinay, was missing. According to her, it was unlikely for appellant to just disappear from the apartment since whenever he would go out, he would normally return on the same day or early morning of the following day (TSN, September 6, 1995, pp. 6-11-27).<br><br>"SPO1 Nacis and SPO1 Alabastro were also informed that a townmate of appellant was working in a <i>pancit </i>factory at Barangay Reparo, Caloocan City. They proceeded to said place. The owner of the factory confirmed to them that appellant used to work at the factory but she did not know his present whereabouts. Appellant's townmate, on the other hand, informed them that appellant could possibly be found on 8<sup>th</sup> Street, Grace Park, Caloocan City (TSN, August 14, 1995, pp. 8-9).<br><br>"The policemen returned to the scene of the crime. At the second floor of the house under construction, they retrieved from one of the rooms a pair of dirty white short pants, a brown belt and a yellow hair ribbon which was identified by Elvira Chan to belong to her daughter, Ma. Victoria. They also found inside another room a pair of blue slippers which Isip identified as that of Appellant. Also found in the yard, three armslength away from the septic tank were an underwear, a leather wallet, a pair of dirty long pants and a pliers positively identified by Isip as appellant's belongings. These items were brought to the police station (TSN, August 14, 1995, pp. 10-13; August 18, 1995, pp. 3-8; August 23, 1995, pp. 21-25).<br><br>"A police report was subsequently prepared including a referral slip addressed to the office of the Valenzuela Prosecutor. The next day, SPO1 Virgilio Villano retrieved the victim's underwear from the septic tank (TSN, August 23, 1995, pp. 3-8; 14-17).<br><br>"After a series of follow-up operations, appellant was finally arrested in Barangay Obario Matala, Ibaan, Batangas. He was brought to Valenzuela Police Station. On July 7, 1995, with the assistance of Atty. Restituto Viernes, appellant executed an extra-judicial confession wherein he narrated in detail how he raped and killed the victim. Also, when appellant came face to face with the victim's mother and aunt, he confided to them that he was not alone in raping and killing the victim. He pointed to Zaldy and Boyet as his co-conspirators (TSN, August 14, 1995, pp. 13-21)."</blockquote>Thus, on July 10, 1995, appellant was charged with rape with homicide in an Information which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 26<sup>th</sup> day of June 1995 in Valenzuela, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation employed upon the person of MARIA VICTORIA CHAN y CABALLERO, age 12 years old, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with said MARIA VICTORIA CHAN y CABALLERO against her will and without her consent; that on the occasion of said sexual assault, the above-named accused, choke and strangle said MARIA VICTORIA CHAN y CABALLERO as a result of which, said victim died.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>to which he pleaded not guilty. After trial, the lower court rendered a decision convicting appellant of the crime charged, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of death and to pay a total of P73,000.00 to the victim's heirs. The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision states:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding accused Larry Mahinay y Amparado guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, he is hereby sentenced to death by electricution (sic). He is likewise condemned to indemnify the heirs of the victim, Ma. Victoria Chan the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the further sum of P23,000.00 for the funeral, burial and wake of the victim.<br><br>"Let the complete records of the case be immediately forwarded to the Honorable Supreme Court for the automatic review in accordance to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Section 22 of Republic Act No. 7659.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Upon automatic review by the court <i>en banc</i> pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> appellant insists that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution against him is insufficient to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In his testimony summarized by the trial court, appellant offered his version of what transpired as follows:<br><blockquote>"(T)hat on June 25, 1995, around 9:30 a.m. on Dian Street, Gen. T. de Leon, Valenzuela, Metro Manila, he joined Gregorio Rivera and a certain Totoy in a drinking spree. Gregorio Rivera is the brother of Maria Isip, appellant's employer. After consuming three cases of red horse beer, he was summoned by Isip to clean the jeepney. He finished cleaning the jeepney at 12 o'clock noon. Then he had lunch and took a bath. Later, he asked permission from Isip to go out with his friends to see a movie. He also asked for a cash advance of P300.00 (TSN, October 16, 1995, pp. 4-5).<br><br>"At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, appellant, instead of going out with his friend, opted to rejoin Gregorio Rivera and Totoy for another drinking session. They consumed one case of red horse beer. Around 6 o'clock p.m., Zaldy, a co-worker, fetched him at Gregorio Rivera's house. They went to Zaldy's house and bought a bottle of gin. They finished drinking gin around 8 o'clock p.m. After consuming the bottle of gin, they went out and bought another bottle of gin from a nearby store. It was already 9 o'clock in the evening. While they were at the store, appellant and Zaldy met Boyet. After giving the bottle of gin to Zaldy and Boyet, appellant left (TSN, October 16, 1995, pp. 6-7).<br><br>"On his way home, appellant passed by Norgina Rivera's store to buy <i>lugaw. </i>Norgina Rivera informed him that there was none left of it. He left the store and proceeded to Isip's apartment. But because it was already closed, he decided to sleep at the second floor of Isip's unfinished house. Around 10 o'clock p.m., Zaldy and Boyet arrived carrying a cadaver. The two placed the body inside the room where appellant was sleeping. As appellant stood up, Zaldy pointed to him a knife. Zaldy and Boyet directed him to rape the dead body of the child or they would kill him. He, However, refused to follow. Then, he was asked by Zaldy and Boyet to assist them in bringing the dead body downstairs. He obliged and helped dump the body into the septic tank. Thereupon, Zaldy and Boyet warned him that should they ever see him again, they would kill him. At 4 o'clock the following morning, he left the compound and proceeded first to Navotas and later to Batangas (TSN, October 16, 1995, pp. 4-13).<br><br>"Subsequently, appellant was apprehended by the police officers in Ibaan, Batangas. The police officers allegedly brought him to a big house somewhere in Manila. There, appellant heard the police officer's plan to salvage him if he would not admit that he was the one who raped and killed the victim. Scared, he executed an extra-judicial confession. He claimed that he was assisted by Atty. Restituto Viernes only when he was forced to sign the extra-judicial confession (TSN, October 16, 1995, pp. 9-11)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>This being a death penalty case, the Court exercises the greatest circumspection in the review thereof since "there can be no stake higher and no penalty more severe x x x than the termination of a human life."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> For life, once taken is like virginity, which once defiled can never be restored. In order therefore, that appellant's guilty mind be satisfied, the Court states the reasons why, as the records are not shy, for him to verify.<br><br>The proven circumstances of this case when juxtaposed with appellant's proffered excuse are sufficient to sustain his conviction beyond reasonable doubt, notwithstanding the absence of any direct evidence relative to the commission of the crime for which he was prosecuted. Absence of direct proof does not necessarily absolve him from any liability because under the Rules on evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and pursuant to settled jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> conviction may be had on circumstantial evidence provided that the following requisites concur:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> there is more than one circumstance;<br></li><li> the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and<br></li><li> the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.</li></ol></blockquote>Simply put, for circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to support a conviction, all circumstances must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is innocent and with every other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Facts and circumstances consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence, constitute evidence which, in weight and probative force, may surpass even direct evidence in its effect upon the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the trial court gave credence to several circumstantial evidence, which upon thorough review of the Court is more than enough to prove appellant's guilt beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt. These circumstantial evidence are as follows:<br><blockquote>"FIRST - Prosecution witness Norgina Rivera, sister-in-law of Maria Isip, owner of the unfinished big house where the crime happened and the septic tank where the body of Maria Victoria Chan was found in the morning of June 26, 1995 is located, categorically testified that at about 9:00 in the evening on June 25, 1995, accused Larry Mahinay was in her store located in front portion of the compound of her sister-in-law Maria Isip where the unfinished big house is situated buying rice noodle (lugaw). That she noticed the accused's hair was disarranged, drunk and walking in sigsaging manner. That the accused appeared uneasy and seems to be thinking deeply. That the accused did not reply to her queries why he looked worried but went inside the compound.<br><br>"SECOND - Prosecution witness Sgt. Roberto G. Suni, categorically, testified that on June 25, 1995 between 6:00 and 7:00 in the evening, on his way to his in-law's house, he met accused Larry Mahinay walking on the road leading to his in-law's residence which is about 50 to 75 meters away to the unfinished big house of Maria Isip. That he also saw victim Maria Victoria Chan standing at the gate of the unfinished big house of Maria Isip between 8:00 and 9:00 in the same evening.<br><br>"THIRD - Prosecution witness Maria Isip, owner of the unfinished big house where victim's body was found inside the septic tank, testified that accused Larry Mahinay is her houseboy since November 20, 1993. That in the morning of June 25, 1995, a Sunday, Larry Mahinay asked permission from her to leave. That after finishing some work she asked him to do accused Larry Mahinay left. That it is customary on the part of Larry Mahinay to return in the afternoon of the same day or sometimes in the next morning. That accused Larry Mahinay did not return until he was arrested in Batangas on July 7, 1995.<br><br>"FOURTH - Prosecution witness Fernando Trinidad, a passenger jeepney driver plying the route Karuhatan-Ugong and vice versa which include Diam St., Gen. T. de Leon, Valenzuela, Metro Manila, pinpointed the accused Larry Mahinay as one of the passengers who boarded his passenger jeepney on June 26, 1995 at 2:00 early morning and alighted on top of the overpass of the North Expressway.<br><br>"FIFTH - Personal belongings of the victim was found in the unfinished big house of Maria Isip where accused Larry Mahinay slept on the night of the incident. This is a clear indication that the victim was raped and killed in the said premises.<br><br>"There is no showing that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses (sic) fabricated or there was any reason for them to testify falsely against the accused. The absence of any evidence as to the existence of improper motive sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive exists and that the testimonies of the witnesses, therefore, should be given full faith and credit. (People vs. Retubado, 58585 January 20, 1988 162 SCRA 276, 284; People vs. Ali L-18512 October 30, 1969, 29 SCRA 756).<br><br>"SIXTH - Accused Larry Mahinay during the custodial investigation and after having been informed of his constitutional rights with the assistance of Atty. Restituto Viernes of the Public Attorney's Office voluntarily gave his statement admitting the commission of the crime. Said confession of accused Larry Mahinay given with the assistance of Atty. Restituto Viernes is believed to have been freely and voluntarily given. That accused did not complain to the proper authorities of any maltreatment on his person (People vs. delos Santos L-3398 May 29, 1984; 150 SCRA 311). He did not even informed the Inquest Prosecutor when he sworn to the truth of his statement on July 8, 1995 that he was forced, coersed or was promised of reward or leniency. That his confession abound with details know only to him. The Court noted that a lawyer from the Public Attorneys Office Atty. Restituto Viernes and as testified by said Atty. Viernes he informed and explained to the accused his constitutional rights and was present all throughout the giving of the testimony. That he signed the statement given by the accused. Lawyer from the Public Attorneys Office is expected to be watchful and vigilant to notice any irregularity in the manner of the investigation and the physical conditions of the accused. The post mortem findings shows that the cause of death Asphyxia by manual strangulation; Traumatic Head injury Contributory substantiate. Consistent with the testimony of the accused that he pushed the victim and the latter's head hit the table and the victim lost consciousness.<br><blockquote><i>"Pagpasok niya sa kuwarto, hinawakan ko siya sa kamay tapos tinulak ko siya, tapos tumama iyong ulo niya sa mesa. Ayon na, nakatulog na siya tapos ni-rape ko na siya."</i></blockquote>"There is no clear proof of maltreatment and/or tortured in giving the statement. There were no medical certificate submitted by the accused to sustain his claim that he was mauled by the police officers.<br><blockquote>There being no evidence presented to show that said confession were obtained as a result of violence, torture, maltreatment, intimidation, threat or promise of reward or leniency nor that the investigating officer could have been motivated to concoct the facts narrated in said affidavit; the confession of the accused is held to be true, correct and freely or voluntarily given. (People v. Tuazon 6 SCRA 249; People v. Tiongson 6 SCRA 431, People v. Baluran 52 SCRA 71, People v. Pingol 35 SCRA 73.)</blockquote>"SEVENTH - Accused Larry Mahinay testified in open Court that he was not able to enter the apartment where he is sleeping because it was already closed and he proceeded to the second floor of the unfinished house and slept. He said while sleeping Zaldy and Boyet arrived carrying the cadaver of the victim and dumped it inside his room. That at the point of a knife, the two ordered him to have sex with the dead body but he refused. That the two asked him to assist them in dumping the dead body of the victim in the septic tank downstairs. (Tsn pp8-9 October 16, 1995). This is unbelievable and unnatural. Accused Larry Mahinay is staying in the apartment and not in the unfinished house. That he slept in the said unfinished house only that night of June 25, 1995 because the apartment where he was staying was already closed. The Court is at a loss how would Zaldy and Boyet knew he (Larry Mahinay) was in the second floor of the unfinished house.<br><br>"Furthermore, if the child is already dead when brought by Zaldy and Boyet in the room at the second floor of the unfinished house where accused Larry Mahinay was sleeping, why will Boyet and Zaldy still brought the cadaver upstairs only to be disposed/dumped later in the septic tank located in the ground floor. Boyet and Zaldy can easily disposed and dumped the body in the septic tank by themselves.<br><br>"It is likewise strange that the dead body of the child was taken to the room where accused Larry Mahinay was sleeping only to force the latter to have sex with the dead body of the child.<br><blockquote>"We have no test to the truth of human testimony except it's conformity to aver knowledge observation and experience. Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous. (People vs. Santos L-385 Nov. 16, 1979)"</blockquote>"EIGHT - If the accused did not commit the crime and was only forced to disposed/dumpted the body of the victim in the septic tank, he could have apprise Col. Maganto, a high ranking police officer or the lady reporter who interviewed him. His failure and omission to reveal the same is unnatural. An innocent person will at once naturally and emphatically repel an accusation of crime as a matter of preservation and self-defense and as a precaution against prejudicing himself. A person's silence therefore, particularly when it is persistent will justify an inference that he is not innocent. (People vs. Pilones, L-32754-5 July 21, 1978).<br><br>"NINTH - The circumstance of flight of the accused strongly indicate his consciousness of guilt. He left the crime scene on the early morning after the incident and did not return until he was arrested in Batangas on July 7, 1995."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Guided by the three principles in the review of rape cases, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote>1). An accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove;<br><br>2).

Moreover, from appellant's own account, he pushed the victim causing the latter to hit her head on the table and fell unconscious. It was at that instance that he ravished her and satisfied his salacious and prurient desires.

In the words of Vice-Chancellor Van Fleet of New Jersey,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><blockquote>"Evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but must be credible in itself- such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances. We have no test of the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation and experience. Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous, and is outside of judicial cognizance."</blockquote>Ultimately, all the foregoing boils down to the issue of credibility of witnesses. Settled is the rule that the findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses is a matter best left to the trial court because of its unique position of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' department on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In this case, the trial court's findings, conclusions and evaluation of the testimony of witnesses is received on appeal with the highest respect,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the same being supported by substantial evidence on record. There was no showing that the court <i>a quo</i> had overlooked or disregarded relevant facts and circumstances which when considered would have affected the outcome of this case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or justify a departure from the assessments and findings of the court below. The absence of any improper or ill-motive on the part of the principal witnesses for the prosecution all the more strengthens the conclusion that no such motive exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Neither was any wrong motive attributed to the police officers who testified against appellant.<br><br>Coming now to the penalty, the sentence imposed by the trial court is correct. Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. 7659 "when by reason or on occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death." This special complex crime is treated by law in the same degree as qualified rape -- that is, when any of the 7 (now 10) "attendant circumstances" enumerated in the law is <u>alleged and proven,</u> in which instances, the penalty is death. In cases where any of those circumstances is <u>proven though not alleged,</u> the penalty cannot be death <u>except</u> if the circumstance proven can be properly appreciated as an aggravating circumstance under Articles 14 and 15 of the RPC which will affect the imposition of the proper penalty in accordance with Article 63 of the RPC. However, if any of those circumstances proven but not alleged cannot be considered as an aggravating circumstance under Articles 14 and 15, the same cannot affect the imposition of the penalty because Articles 63 of the RPC in mentioning aggravating circumstances refers to those defined in Articles 14 and 15.
