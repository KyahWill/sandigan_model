Antonio Villanueva, Sr. and his son were on their way to their farm in Sitio Taganas, passing by the houses of appellant Camay and Ismael Enero.&nbsp; Antonio Villanueva, Jr. was surprised when appellant Camay suddenly boxed his father twice.&nbsp; Thereafter, appellant Wilson Catampongan held the elder Villanueva, binding the latter's arms crosswise at the back.&nbsp; With his knife, Cassius Catampongan stabbed Villanueva, Sr., hitting him thrice.&nbsp; Appellant Camay picked up a piece of wood and began hitting Villanueva, Sr. at the forehead, cheeks, breast and knees.&nbsp; Villanueva, Jr. who was about thirteen (13) years old at the time, was too afraid to do anything.&nbsp; He ran home and informed his mother of the incident.<br><br>"The incident was also witnessed by Nila Francisco Casas, who was on her way home to Matagangtang from buying viand in Aguada.&nbsp; She saw appellants ganging up on Villanueva, Sr.&nbsp; Appellant Wilson Catampongan was the one who held the victim's arms at the back while Cassius Catampongan stabbed him with a fan knife.&nbsp; Appellant Camay, in turn, clubbed Villanueva, Sr. with a piece of wood.&nbsp; Villanueva, Sr., fell to the ground face down.&nbsp; Casas ran to inform Villanueva, Sr.'s wife, her elder sister, [of] what happened to her husband.&nbsp; There were other people who witnessed the whole incident and they helped in bringing the victim to his house.<br><br>"The postmortem examination conducted on the cadaver of the victim reveals that Villanueva, Sr. sustained two (2) fatal stab wounds at the left side of the chest penetrating the thoracic cavity, and an incise wound near the left wrist.&nbsp; The victim also had multiple abrasion[s] at the right forehead, face, chin, forearm, elbow and both knees, consistent with injuries sustained from being hit by a blunt instrument.&nbsp; The cause of death was listed as `shock due to hemorrhage due to stab wounds on the chest'."<br></blockquote><br><center><u>Version of the Defense</u></center><br><br>Denying criminal responsibility for the death of Antonio Villanueva Sr., appellants narrate the facts as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"The records of this case disclose that the appellants and the victim appeared to be residents of Barangay Mata[g]angtang, Placer, Masbate.&nbsp; In the afternoon of December 9, 1988, appellants Paquito Camay and Wilson Catampongan were s[ea]ted [o]n a bench outside the store of appellant Paquito Camay.&nbsp; While they were talking with each other, both saw Antonio Villanueva, Sr. approaching them who was drunk looking for Paquito Camay.&nbsp; Upon seeing Paquito Camay, the victim boxed him first and then pulled his bolo from his waist and chased Paquito Camay who ran away towards [the area] inside his fence but stumbled while running and then and there [he] stabbed Paquito Camay at the back.&nbsp; Paquito Camay was rendered unconscious because of his stab wound and did not know what happened next.&nbsp; He was brought to the Cataingan Emergency Hospital for treatment and was able to regain consciousness only while he was on the truck on his way to the hospital. The incident was witnessed by the people in the Barangay and the other accused-appellant, Wilson Catampongan, in fact, corroborated Paquito Camay's testimony and asserted that he merely tried to pacify the victim [and keep him from] further attacking Paquito Camay. After appellant Wilson Catampongan failed to pacify the victim the other accused, Cassius Catampongan, arrived and told the victim not to stab Paquito Camay as he was already dead, yet the victim refused to listen so he was stabbed by Cassius Catampongan to prevent him from further stabbing Paquito Camay and then the victim fled bumping upon a tree twice but finally dropped on the ground dead."<br></blockquote><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></center><br><br>The trial court convicted appellants on the strength of the credible testimonies of Nila Francisco Casas and Antonio Villanueva Jr., ruling that they had no ill motive to testify falsely and that their positive assertions prevailed over the negative statements of the defense witnesses.&nbsp; It rejected the claims of appellants thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Further, Paquito Camay's defense of `unconsciousness' is belied by the fact that his back injury is slight in nature as shown by the medico-legal certificate.&nbsp; The truth as declared and proved by the prosecution is that he attacked the deceased with a piece of wood causing several injuries on the body of the victim.&nbsp; In like manner, Wilson Catampongan's defense of `only pacifying the victim' is false on the face of the declaration of the prosecution witnesses that he `pulled the arms of the victim and held him from behind' when Cassius Catampongan stabbed him [t]hus, cooperating in the killing of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Ruling that the testimonies of the defense witnesses were not credible, the lower court explained:<br><br><blockquote>"xxx [T]he testimon[ies] of the accused and their witnesses suffered from biases and/or inconsistencies and x x x they failed to make themselves worthy of belief.&nbsp; Thus, the court has keenly observed, viz:<br><br>"1)&nbsp; The biased testimony of Bibiano Tenorio who lived in another barangay four kilometers from the place of the crime but claimed he was there at Paquito Camay's store to buy goods which were also available in his barrio;<br><br>"2)&nbsp; The coached testimony of Serafin Bedrijo is replete [with] material inconsistencies and [he] admitted that the usual route in going to his house [would] not pass by Paquito Camay's store;<br><br>"3) The biased and evasive testimony of barangay captain Alfreda Gulay (aunt of Paquito Camay)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Assignment of Errors</b></center><br><br>In their Brief, appellants contend that the trial court erred in the following instances:<br><br><blockquote>"1. x x x holding the appellants liable for the crime that appellants did not commit;<br><br>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x holding that appellants conspired and cooperated with [each] another when Cassius Catampongan stabbed and wounded the victim to death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Simply put, the issue is whether the prosecution evidence is sufficient to prove appellants' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>This Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u>Main Issue: <br> <i>Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</i></u></center><br><br>Eyewitness Antonio Jr., son of the victim, narrated in a consistent, clear and straightforward manner how appellants assaulted his father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Pertinent portions of his testimony are reproduced hereunder:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"Q.</div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">While going to your farm together with your father and on your way to the farm, do you remember if there was an unusual incident that occurred?

Well-entrenched is the doctrine that the trial court's factual findings are accorded great respect and are binding on this Court, unless substantial facts and circumstances were overlooked which, if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The defense has failed to show that the trial court committed such error.<br><br>Indeed, there was no proof that the prosecution witnesses testified falsely or unbelievably against the accused.&nbsp; Verily, the fact that Antonio Jr. was the son of the victim rendered his testimony more credible.&nbsp; Expectedly, his primary consideration was to see that justice would be done; hence, it would have been unnatural for him to accuse the wrong persons and thereby let the real culprits go free.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the testimonies of the eyewitnesses that the three accused cooperated in stabbing the victim and hitting him with a piece of wood were supported by the postmortem examination, which revealed the following:<br><br><blockquote>"Multiple abrasions at the right forehead, right cheek, right face, right chin, right elbow, right forearm and both knees[.]<br><br>"Stab wound, about 2.5 cm. long, located 2cm. below the left nipple, penetrating into the thoracic cavity[.]<br><br>"Stab wound, about 2.5 cm. long, located at the left lateral lower chest, penetrating into the thoracic cavity[.]<br><br>"Incised wound about 1.5 cm. long, distal forearm, ulnar side, left[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>Contrary to appellants' contention, the absence of a broken skull or broken knees was not inconsistent with the accounts of the prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; The abrasions on the victim's forehead, right cheek, right face, right chin, right elbow, right forearm and both knees sufficiently supported the claim of the prosecution witnesses that the victim had repeatedly been beaten with a piece of wood.<br><br>Likewise, the trial court was correct in not according credence to the testimonies of the defense witnesses, which consisted chiefly of denials. It is axiomatic that negative assertions cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of credible witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the testimonies of the defense witnesses were not congruent on some important points.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, Appellant Paquito Camay testified that the victim tried to punch him; however, none of the other defense witnesses who claimed to have seen the incident supported his assertion.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, Defense Witness Bibiano Tenorio testified that the victim also tried to stab Casius, but the other witnesses -- Serafin Bedrijo, Alfreda Reoyan Gulay and Wilson Catampongan -- were silent on this point, stating instead that Casius merely tried to pacify the victim.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, contrary to the contention of appellants, Defense Eyewitness Alfreda Reoyan Gulay stated that she did not see Casius stab the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Fourth, </i>Alfreda claimed that she informed Lita Villanueva, wife of the victim, of the incident.&nbsp; However, Lita testified that it was her son Antonio Jr. and her sister Nila Casas who informed her of her husband's death.&nbsp; <i>Fifth</i>, Alfreda also testified that Antonio Sr. stabbed Paquito at the back, on the left side near the waistline.&nbsp; However, the Medico-legal Report submitted by the defense showed that Paquito had a "2 cm stab wound up to the muscle, (L) lumbar area, paraspinal line."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that the defense presented the aforementioned Medico-legal Report to support its claim that the victim had stabbed Appellant Paquito Camay.&nbsp; Such evidence, however, failed to establish that the victim had actually done so.
