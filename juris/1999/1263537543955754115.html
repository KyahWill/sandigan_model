				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Summons to a domestic or resident corporation should be served on officers, agents or employees, who are responsible enough to warrant the presumption that they will transmit to the corporation notice of the filing of the action against it. Rules on the service of motions should be liberally construed in order to promote the ends of substantial justice. A rigid application that will result in the manifest injustice should be avoided. A default judgment against several defendants cannot affect the rights of one who was never declared in default.

The request was approved by the Bureau of Customs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Despite the approval, the customs personnel boarded the vessel when it docked on January 7, 1989, on suspicion that it was the hijacked <i>M/V Silver Med</i> owned by Med Line Philippines Co., and that its cargo would be smuggled into the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The district customs collector seized said vessel and its cargo pursuant to Section 2301, Tariff and Customs Code.

Not having any knowledge of the CA case to which it was not impleaded, petitioner filed with the trial court a Motion to Dismiss <i>ex abutandi ad cautelam </i>on the grounds that (1) the Petition of private respondent stated no cause of action against it, (2) the trial court had no jurisdiction over the case, and (3) <i>litis pendentia</i> barred the suit<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On May 10, 1991, Camañgon levied on petitioner's properties, which were scheduled for auction later on May 16, 1991.

It prayed for the lifting of the levy on its properties or, alternatively, for a temporary restraining order against their auction until its Motion for Reconsideration was resolved by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Acting on petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration, the trial court reversed its Decision of February 18, 1991, holding in its May 22, 1991 Resolution as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><blockquote>"xxx [T]hat xxx Motion For Reconsideration [of the petitioner] was filed on March 14, 1991 (See: page 584, records, Vol.2) indubitably showing that it was seasonably filed within the 15-day time-frame. Therefore, xxx said default-judgment ha[d] not yet become final and executory when the Writ of Execution was issued on March 13, 1991 xxx The rules [provide] that [the e]xecution shall issue as a matter of right upon the expiration of the period of appeal from a judgment if no appeal has been duly perfected (Sec. 1, R-39, RRC). That being the case, VEC has all the right to file as it did xxx the aforementioned reconsideration motion calling [the] attention of the Court and pointing therein its supposed error and its correction if, indeed, any [error was] committed. It is in this light that this Court made an in-depth reflection and assessment of the premises or reasons raised by [petitioner], and after a re-examination of the facts and evidence spread on the records, it has come to the considered conclusion that the questioned default-judgment has been improvidently issued. By the records, the claim of [private respondent] that his January 29, 1990 Ex-Parte Motion To Declare Defendants In Default (pp. 174-177, records, Vol. 1) including VEC had been granted is belied by the February 23, 1990 Order (pp. 214-215, records, ibid) par. 2, thereof, reading to wit:<br><blockquote>`By the foregoing, for reasons stated thereunder respectively, this Court, in the exercise of its judicious discretion, in the sense that the rules should be liberally construed in order to promote their object and to assist the parties, resolves to DENY petitioner's Motion to have the Commissioner of Customs AND OTHER ENUMERATED RESPONDENTS DECLARED IN DEFAULT.' [Emphasis ours].</blockquote>Not even [private respondent's] November 23, 1990 `Ex-Parte Motion To Present [Evidence] Against Defaulting Defendants' (page 489, records, Vol.2) [can] be deemed as a remedy of the fact that there never was issued an order of default against respondents including [petitioner] VEC. Having thus established that there [had] been no order of default against VEC as contemplated by Sec. 1, Rule 18, in relation to Sec. 9, Rule 13, Revised Rules of Court, there could not have been any valid default-judgment rendered against it. The issuance of an order of default is a condition sine qua non in order [that] a judgment by default be clothed with validity. Further, records show that this Court never had authorized [private respondent] to adduce evidence ex-parte against [petitioner] VEC. In sum, the February 18, 1991 decision by default is null and void as against [petitioner] VEC. With this considered conclusion of nullity of said default judgment in question, this Court feels there is no more need for it to resolve Arguments I-A &amp; I-B, as well as III-A &amp; III-B, of the March 14, 1991 Motion for Reconsideration. The Court agrees, however, with said discussions on the non-compliance [with] Sec. 2, Rule 7 (Title of Complaint) and Sec. I, Rule 8 on the requirement of indicating in the complaint the ultimate facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim of defense [--] which is absent in the January 9, Amended Petition (pp. 122-141, records, Vol. I) [--] for it merely mentioned [petitioner] VEC in par. 5 thereof and no more. It abides, likewise, with [Argument] III-B that the Decision in suit award[ed] amounts never asked for in instant petition as regards VEC (Sec. 5, Rule 18, RRC). xxx.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration, and as prayed for, the February 18, 1991 Judgment by Default is hereby reconsidered and SET ASIDE."</blockquote>On June 26, 1992, then Executive Judge Bernardo P.

Its finality becomes a fact when the reglementary period to appeal lapses, and no appeal is perfected within such period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The admiralty case filed by private respondent with the trial court involved multiple defendants. This being the case, it necessarily follows that the period of appeal of the February 18, 1991 RTC Decision depended on the date a copy of the judgment was received by each of the defendants. Elsewise stated, each defendant had a different period within which to appeal, depending on the date of receipt of the Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Omega, Singkong Trading Co. and <i>M/V Star Ace </i>chose to enter into a compromise agreement with private respondent.

Said Decision cannot be said to have attained finality as to the petitioner, which was not a party to the compromise. Moreover, petitioner filed a timely Motion for Reconsideration with the trial court, thirteen days after it received the Decision or two days before the lapse of the reglementary period to appeal. A motion for reconsideration tolls the running of the period to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Thus, as to petitioner, the trial court Decision had not attained finality.<br><br><b><u><i>Exception to the Rule<br>on Notice of Hearing</i></u></b><br><br>Respondent Court and private respondent argue that, although timely filed, petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was a mere scrap of paper, because (1) it did not contain a notice of hearing addressed to the <i>current </i>counsel of private respondent, and (2) the notice of hearing addressed to and served on private respondent's <i>deceased </i>counsel was not sufficient. Admittedly, this Motion contained a notice of hearing sent to Atty. Jesus C. Concepcion who, according to private respondent, had already died and had since been substituted by its new counsel, Atty. Domingo Desierto. Therefore, the appellate court ruled that the said Motion did not toll the reglementary period to appeal and that the trial court Decision became final.<br><br>This Court disagrees. Rule 15 of the Rules of Court states:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 4. <i>Notice.--</i>Notice of a motion shall be served by the applicant to all parties concerned, at least three (3) days before the hearing thereof, together with a copy of the motion, and of any affidavits and other papers accompanying it. The court, however, for good cause may hear a motion on shorter notice, specially on matters which the court may dispose of on its own motion.<br><br>SEC. 5. <i>Contents of notice.--</i>The notice shall be directed to the parties concerned, and shall state the time and place for the hearing of the motion." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote>Ideally, the foregoing Rule requires the petitioner to address and to serve on the counsel of private respondent the notice of hearing of the Motion for Reconsideration. The case at bar, however, is far from ideal. <i>First</i>, petitioner was not validly summoned and it did not participate in the trial of the case in the lower court; thus, it was understandable that petitioner would not be familiar with the parties and their counsels. <i>Second</i>, Atty. Desierto entered his appearance only as collaborating counsel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> who is normally not entitled to notices even from this Court. <i>Third</i>, private respondent made no manifestation on record that Atty. Concepcion was already dead. Besides, it was Atty. Concepcion who signed the Amended Petition, wherein petitioner was first impleaded as respondent and served a copy thereof. Naturally, petitioner's attention was focused on this pleading, and it was within its rights to assume that the signatory to such pleading was the counsel for private respondent.<br><br>The Court has consistently held that a motion which does not meet the requirements of Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court is considered a worthless piece of paper, which the clerk of court has no right to receive and the trial court has no authority to act upon. Service of a copy of a motion containing a notice of the time and the place of hearing of that motion is a mandatory requirement, and the failure of movants to comply with these requirements renders their motions fatally defective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> However, there are exceptions to the strict application of this rule. These exceptions are as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><blockquote>"xxx Liberal construction of this rule has been allowed by this Court in cases (1) where a rigid application will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> especially if a party successfully shows that the alleged defect in the questioned final and executory judgment is not apparent on its face or from the recitals contained therein; (2) where the interest of substantial justice will be served;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (3) where the resolution of the motion is addressed solely to the sound and judicious discretion of the court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and (4) where the injustice to the adverse party is not commensurate [to] the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote>The present case falls under the first exception. Petitioner was not informed of any cause of action or claim against it. All of a sudden, the vessels which petitioner used in its salvaging business were levied upon and sold in execution to satisfy a supposed judgment against it. To allow this to happen simply because of a lapse in fulfilling the notice requirement - which, as already said, was satisfactorily explained - would be a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice.<br><br>A notice of hearing is conceptualized as an integral component of procedural due process intended to afford the adverse parties a chance to be heard before a motion is resolved by the court. Through such notice, the adverse party is permitted time to study and answer the arguments in the motion.<br><br>Circumstances in the case at bar show that private respondent was not denied procedural due process, and that the very purpose of a notice of hearing had been served. On the day of the hearing, Atty. Desierto did not object to the said Motion for lack of notice to him; in fact, he was furnished in open court with a copy of the motion and was granted by the trial court thirty days to file his opposition to it. These circumstances clearly justify a departure from the literal application of the notice of hearing rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In other cases, after the trial court learns that a motion lacks such notice, the prompt resetting of the hearing with due notice to all the parties is held to have cured the defect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Verily, the notice requirement is not a ritual to be followed blindly. Procedural due process is not based solely on a mechanistic and literal application that renders any deviation inexorably fatal. Instead, procedural rules are liberally construed to promote their objective and to assist in obtaining a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of any action and proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> For the foregoing reasons, we believe that Respondent Court committed reversible error in holding that the Motion for Reconsideration was a mere scrap of paper.<br><br><center><b><u>Second Issue: <i>Jurisdiction Over Petitioner</i></u></b></center><br><br><b><i><u>Service of Summons<br>on a Corporation</u></i></b><br><br>The sheriff's return shows that Angliongto who was president of petitioner corporation, through his secretary Betty Bebero, was served summons on January 18, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Petitioner claims that this service was defective for two reasons: (1) Bebero was an employee of Vlasons Shipping, Inc., which was an entity separate and distinct from Petitioner Vlason Enterprises Corporation (VEC); and (2) the return pertained to the service of summons for the amended Petition, not for the "Second Amended Petition with Supplemental Petition," the latter pleading having superseded the former.<br><br>A corporation may be served summons through its agents or officers who under the Rules are designated to accept service of process. A summons addressed to a corporation and served on the secretary of its president binds that corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> This is based on the rationale that service must be made on a representative so integrated with the corporation sued, that it is safe to assume that said representative had sufficient responsibility and discretion to realize the importance of the legal papers served and to relay the same to the president or other responsible officer of the corporation being sued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The secretary of the president satisfies this criterion. This rule requires, however, that the secretary should be an employee of the corporation sought to be summoned. Only in this manner can there be an assurance that the secretary will "bring home to the corporation [the] notice of the filing of the action" against it.<br><br>In the present case, Bebero was the secretary of Angliongto, who was president of both VSI and petitioner, but she was an employee of VSI, not of petitioner. The piercing of the corporate veil cannot be resorted to when serving summons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Doctrinally, a corporation is a legal entity distinct and separate from the members and stockholders who compose it. However, when the corporate fiction is used as a means of perpetrating a fraud, evading an existing obligation, circumventing a statute, achieving or perfecting a monopoly or, in generally perpetrating a crime, the veil will be lifted to expose the individuals composing it. None of the foregoing exceptions has been shown to exist in the present case. Quite the contrary, the piercing of the corporate veil in this case will result in manifest injustice. This we cannot allow. Hence, the corporate fiction remains.<br><br><b><u><i>Effect of Amendment of<br>Pleadings on Jurisdiction</i></u></b><br><br>Petitioner claims that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over it, because the former had not been served summons anew for the Second Amended Petition or for the Second Amended Petition with Supplemental Petition. In the records, it appears that only Atty. Tamondong, counsel for Singkong Trading, was furnished a copy of the Second Amended Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The corresponding sheriff's return indicates that only Omega, <i>M/V Star Ace </i>and Capt. Rada were served summons and copies of said Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>We disagree. Although it is well-settled that an amended pleading supersedes the original one, which is thus deemed withdrawn and no longer considered part of the record, it does not follow <i>ipso facto</i> that the service of a new summons for amended petitions or complaints is required. Where the defendants have already appeared before the trial court by virtue of a summons on the original complaint, the amended complaint may be served upon them without need of another summons, even if new causes of action are alleged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> After it is acquired, a court's jurisdiction continues until the case is finally terminated. Conversely, when defendants have not yet appeared in court and no summons has been validly served, new summons for the amended complaint must be served on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It is not the change of cause of action that gives rise to the need to serve another summons for the amended complaint, but rather the acquisition of jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants. If the trial court has not yet acquired jurisdiction over them, a new service of summons for the amended complaint is required.<br><br>In this case, the trial court obviously labored under the erroneous impression that petitioner had already been placed under its jurisdiction since it had been served summons through the secretary of its president. Thus, it dispensed with the service on petitioner of new summons for the subsequent amendments of the Petition. We have already ruled, however, that the first service of summons on petitioner was invalid. Therefore, the trial court never acquired jurisdiction, and the said court should have required a new service of summons for the amended Petitions.<br><br><b><u><i>Impleading a Party in the<br>Title of the Complaint</i></u></b><br><br>Petitioner further claims that the trial court failed to acquire jurisdiction to render judgment against it because (1) the title of the three Petitions filed by private respondent never included petitioner as a party-defendant, in violation of Rule 7; and (2) the Petitions failed to state any allegation of ultimate facts constituting a cause of action against petitioner.<br><br>We disagree with petitioner on the first ground. The judicial attitude has always been favorable and liberal in allowing amendments to pleadings. Pleadings shall be construed liberally so as to render substantial justice to the parties and to determine speedily and inexpensively the actual merits of the controversy with the least regard to technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>The inclusion of the names of all the parties in the title of a complaint is a formal requirement under Section 3, Rule 7. However, the rules of pleadings require courts to pierce the form and go into the substance, and not to be misled by a false or wrong name given to a pleading. The averments in the complaint, not the title, are controlling. Although the general rule requires the inclusion of the names of all the parties in the title of a complaint, the non-inclusion of one or some of them is not fatal to the cause of action of a plaintiff, provided there is a statement in the body of the petition indicating that a defendant was made a party to such action.<br><br>Private respondent claims that petitioner has always been included in the caption of all the Petitions it filed, which included Antonio Sy, field manager of petitioner. We checked and noted that in the caption and the body of the Amended Petition and Second Amended Petition with Supplemental Petition, Antonio Sy was alleged to be representing Med Line Philippines, not petitioner. Because it was private respondent who was responsible for the errors, the Court cannot excuse it from compliance, for such action will prejudice petitioner, who had no hand in the preparation of these pleadings. In any event, we reiterate that, as a general rule, mere failure to include the name of a party in the title of a complaint is not fatal by itself.<br><br><b><u><i>Stating a Cause of Action<br>in the Complaint</i></u></b><br><br>The general rule is <i>allegata et probata -- </i>a judgment must conform to the pleadings and the theory of the action under which the case was tried.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> But a court may also rule and render judgment on the basis of the evidence before it, even though the relevant pleading has not been previously amended, so long as no surprise or prejudice to the adverse party is thereby caused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the liability of petitioner was based not on any allegation in the four Petitions filed with the trial court, but on the evidence presented <i>ex parte</i> by the private respondent. Since the trial court had not validly acquired jurisdiction over the person of petitioner, there was no way for the latter to have validly and knowingly waived its objection to the private respondent's presentation of evidence against it.<br><br><center><b><u>Third Issue: <i>Judgment By Default</i></u></b></center><br>The trial court Decision holding petitioner liable for damages is basically a default judgment. In Section 18, judgment by default is allowed under the following condition:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><blockquote>"SEC. 1. <i>Judgment by default.--</i>If the defendant fails to answer within the time specified in these rules, the court shall, upon motion of the plaintiff and proof of such failure, declare the defendant in default. Thereupon the court shall proceed to receive the plaintiff's evidence and render judgment granting him such relief as the complaint and the facts proven may warrant. xxxx."</blockquote>Thus, it becomes crucial to determine whether petitioner was ever declared in default, and whether the reception of evidence <i>ex parte</i> against it was procedurally valid.<br><br><b><u><i>Petitioner Was Never<br>Declared In Default</i></u></b><br><br>Petitioner insists that the trial court never declared it in default.<br><br>We agree. The trial court denied the January 29, 1990 Motion of private respondent to declare all the defendants in default, but it never acted on the latter's subsequent Motion to declare petitioner likewise. During the pretrial on January 23, 1993, the RTC declared in default only "Atty. Eddie Tamondong, as well as the other defendants Hon. Salvador Mison, <i>M/V Star Ace</i>, Omega Sea Transport Co., Inc. of Panama and Sinkong Trading Co., [but] despite xxx due notice to them, [they] failed to appear."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Even private respondent cannot pinpoint which trial court order held petitioner in default.<br><br>More important, the trial court, in its Resolution dated May 22, 1991, admitted that it never declared petitioner in default, viz.:<br><blockquote>"xxx It is in this light that this [c]ourt made an in-depth reflection and assessment of the premises or reasons raised by [petitioner] VEC[;] and after a re-examination of the facts and evidence spread on the records, it has come to the considered conclusion that the questioned default-judgment has been improvidently issued. [Based on] the records, the claim of [private respondent] that [its] January 29, 1990 Ex-Parte Motion to Declare Defendants In Default (pp. 174-177, records, Vol. 1) including VEC had been granted is belied by the February 23, 1990 Order (pp. 214-215, records, ibid) par. 2, thereof, xxx<br><br><center>x x x x x x x x x</center><br>Not even petitioner's November 23, 1990 "Ex-Parte Motion To Present Evidence Against Defaulting Defendants" (page 489, records, Vol. 2) [can] be deemed as a remedy [for] the fact that there never was issued an order of default against respondents including [petitioner] VEC. Having thus established that there ha[d] been no order of default against VEC as contemplated by Sec. 1, Rule 18, in relation to Sec. 9, Rule 13, Revised Rules of Court, there could not have been any valid default-judgment rendered against it. The issuance of an order [o]f default is a condition sine qua non in order [that] a judgment by default be clothed with validity. Further, records show that this [c]ourt never had authorized [private respondent] to adduce evidence ex-parte against [Petitioner] VEC. In sum, the February 18, 1991 decision by default is null and void as against [Petitioner] VEC. xxxx."</blockquote>The aforementioned default judgment refers to the February 18, 1989 Decision, not to the Order finding petitioner in default as contended by private respondent. Furthermore, it is a legal impossibility to declare a party-defendant to be in default before it was validly served summons.<br><br><b><u><i>Trial Court Did Not Allow<br>Presentation of Evidence<br>Ex Parte Against Petitioner</i></u></b><br><br>The Order of December 10, 1990, which allowed the presentation of evidence <i>ex</i> <i>parte</i> against the defaulting defendants, could not have included petitioner, because the trial court granted private respondent's motion praying for the declaration of only the foreign defendants in default. So too, private respondent's <i>ex parte</i> Motion to present evidence referred to the foreign defendants only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the reception of evidence <i>ex parte</i> against a non-defaulting party is procedurally indefensible. Without a declaration that petitioner is in default as required in Section 1, Rule 18, the trial court had no authority to order the presentation of evidence <i>ex parte</i> against petitioner to render judgment against it by default. The trial judge must have thought that since it failed to appear despite summons and was in default, it effectively waived any objection to the presentation of evidence against it. This rule, however, would have applied only if petitioner had submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the trial court. The latter correctly declared, in the Resolution just cited, that the default judgment against the former had been improvidently rendered.<br><br><center><b><u>Fourth Issue: <i>Awards Not Paid and Prayed For</i></u></b></center><br><b><u><i>Additional Filing Fees as</i><br><i>Lien on the Judgment</i></u></b><br><br>Had the trial court validly acquired jurisdiction over petitioner, nonpayment of docket fees would not have prevented it from holding petitioner liable for damages. The Court, in <i>Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><i> </i>ruled that a court acquires jurisdiction over any case only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fee, not upon the amendment of the complaint or the payment of the docket fees based on the amount sought in the amended pleading. This ruling, however, was modified in <i>Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> which added:<br><blockquote>"3. Where the trial court acquires jurisdiction over a claim [through] the filing of the appropriate pleading and payment of the prescribed filing fee but, subsequently, the judgment awards a claim not specified in the pleading, or if specified the same has been left for determination by the court, the additional filing fee therefor shall constitute a lien on the judgment. It shall be the responsibility of the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized deputy to enforce said lien and assess and collect the additional fee."</blockquote>Filing fees for damages and awards that cannot be estimated constitute liens on the awards finally granted by the trial court. Their nonpayment alone is not a ground for the invalidation of the award.<br><br><b><u><i>Judgment by Default Cannot<br>Grant Relief Not Prayed For</i></u></b><br><br>A declaration or order of default is issued as a punishment for unnecessary delay in joining issues. In such event, defendants lose their standing in court, they cannot expect the trial court to act upon their pleadings, and they are not entitled to notice of the proceeding until the final termination of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Thus, the trial court proceeds with the reception of the plaintiff's evidence upon which a default judgment is rendered.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 18 provides that after the defendant has been declared in default, "the court shall proceed to receive the plaintiff's evidence and render judgment granting him such relief as the complaint and the facts proven may warrant." The reliefs that may be granted, however, are restricted by Section 5, which provides that a judgment entered against a party in default shall not exceed the amount or be different in kind from that prayed for.<br><br>In other words, under Section 1, a declaration of default is not an admission of the truth or the validity of the plaintiff's claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The claimant must still prove his claim and present evidence. In this sense the law gives defaulting parties some measure of protection because plaintiffs, despite the default of defendants, are still required to substantiate their allegations in the complaint. The judgment of default against defendants who have not appeared or filed their answers does not imply a waiver of all their rights, except their right to be heard and to present evidence in their favor. Their failure to answer does not imply their admission of the facts and the causes of action of the plaintiffs, because the latter are required to adduce evidence to support their allegations.<br><br>Moreover, the trial court is not allowed by the Rules to receive evidence that tends to show a relief not sought or specified in the pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The plaintiff cannot be granted an award greater than or different in kind from that specified in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>This case should be distinguished, however, from that of defendants, who filed an answer but were absent during trial. In that case, they can be held liable for an amount greater than or different from that originally prayed for, provided that the award is warranted by the proven facts. This rule is premised on the theory that the adverse party failed to object to evidence relating to an issue not raised in the pleadings.<br><br>The latter rule, however, is not applicable to the instant case. Admittedly, private respondent presented evidence that would have been sufficient to hold petitioner liable for damages. However, it did not include in its amended Petitions any prayer for damages against petitioner. Therefore, the trial court could not have validly held the latter liable for damages even if it were in default.<br><br><center><b><u>Fifth Issue: <i>Execution of Final Judgment</i></u></b></center><br>Section 1 of Rule 39 provides that execution shall issue only upon a judgment that finally disposes of the action or proceeding. Such execution shall issue as a matter of right upon the expiration of the period to appeal it, if no appeal has been duly perfected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>In the present case, however, we have already shown that the trial court's Decision has not become final and executory against petitioner. In fact, the judgment does not even bind it. Obviously, Respondent Court committed serious reversible errors when it allowed the execution of the said judgment against petitioner.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby <i>GRANTED</i>, and the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <i>REVERSED </i>and<i> SET ASIDE </i>insofar as they affect petitioner.
