				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 78 (Judge Percival Mandap Lopez, presiding), finding accused-appellant Eriberto Maglente y Cabahug guilty of eight (8) counts of rape and sentencing him, in each case, to suffer the penalty of death and to indemnify the victim in the amount of P100,000.00, as moral damages, and P50,000.00, as exemplary damages.<br><br>Complainant Maylene (Mylene) Q. Maglente is accused-appellant's own daughter. She is the eldest child of spouses Eriberto Maglente and Rebecca Q. Maglente.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Mylene and her two other sisters, Monalisa and Maritess, then aged 16 and 14, were left in the care of their father, as their mother Rebecca left on January 2, 1994 to work as a domestic helper in Hongkong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In eight (8) separate complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> filed on September 15, 1995, Mylene accused her father of raping her on eight different occasions in 1995. Except as to the date appearing therein, the complaints commonly allege as follows:<br><blockquote>The undersigned accuses ERIBERTO MAGLENTE y CABAHUG, father of the undersigned, of the crime of Rape, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the [date<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>] in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused by means of force and intimidation, to wit: by then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously undress said MAYLENE MAGLENTE y QUENDANGAN, 17 years of age and put himself on top of her, and thereafter have carnal knowledge with the undersigned complainant against her will and without her consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>When arraigned, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the eight (8) charges of rape against him. The cases were then jointly tried.<br><br>The prosecution presented complainant Mylene Q. Maglente who narrated how, on the eight (8) occasions mentioned in the informations, she was raped by her father. She testified:<br><br>On April 15, 1995, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, while she was asleep in their house at 125 St. Catherine Street, Barangay Holy Spirit, Quezon City, she was awakened by accused-appellant. Thinking that it was time to prepare their breakfast, she proceeded to the kitchen. There, she was grabbed by accused-appellant who covered her mouth and told her not to make any noise, otherwise she would get hurt. Accused-appellant told her not to resist and dragged her to his bedroom. Once inside the bedroom, accused-appellant ordered her to sit on the bed as he placed his hand inside her t-shirt, lifted her bra, and fondled her breasts. Accused-appellant removed her shorts, touched her private parts, undressed her, and forcibly inserted his penis into her private organ. She could not remember how long accused-appellant's penis was inside her private organ because she was afraid and did not know what to do. After she was released, she went to the bathroom and washed herself because she felt dirty. Afterwards, she went under the table and cried.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On April 28, 1995, at about 2 o'clock in the morning, accused-appellant again raped her although, because of her resistance, he failed to achieve full penetration and only succeeded in rubbing his penis ("<i>kiniskis lang po niya pero hindi niya ipinasok</i>") against the opening of her vagina ("<i>doon po sa pinakabuka")</i>. On that day, accused-appellant slept on the same bed with his children because their place was flooded and his bed got wet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On May 1, 1995, accused-appellant again raped her. This was done inside complainant's bedroom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On May 24, 1995, she resisted accused-appellant's sexual attack, but the latter boxed her. Accused-appellant thus succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On June 20, 1995, accused-appellant arrived home drunk. He pulled her from her bed and took her to his bedroom where he ravished her. Accused-appellant also kissed and inserted his fingers into her private parts. As in previous instances, she did not complain to the police for fear that her two younger sisters might suffer the same fate she did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On July 9, 1995, between 3:30-4:00 in the morning, accused-appellant took her to his bedroom where he raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On July 31, 1995, accused-appellant was able to rape complainant despite her resistance by kicking her and thus rendering her helpless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The rape was committed inside accused-appellant's bedroom. On cross and re-cross-examination, she clarified the date to be July 31, 1995, and not July 30, 1995 as stated in her <i>Salaysay</i>, dated September 14, 1995, and in the transcript of stenographic notes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Finally, on September 11, 1995, at about 1 o'clock in the morning, complainant was again raped by accused-appellant inside his bedroom, hours after he had beaten up Mylene and her sisters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On re-cross-examination, complainant said that the date (September 10, 1995) appearing in her <i>Salaysay</i> of September 14, 1995 and in the transcript of stenographic notes should read September 11, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Mylene left their house on September 11, 1995 and stayed in a friend's house. Before doing so, however, she related her ordeals to her sister Monalisa. She kept quiet and never reported these rapes to any other person as she was afraid of accused-appellant until her grandaunt Maria Codera found her. On September 14, 1995, they sought the assistance of two police officers and proceeded to Police Station Six, SIID, CPDC on Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City. Mylene gave her sworn statement (Exh. C)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to PO3 Jovencio Villacorte. Rebecca (complainant's mother) also gave a sworn statement to PO3 Villacorte alleging that the rapes were reported to her by Paz Codera (Maria Paz Codera) when she was still in Hongkong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Mylene wrote down on a piece of paper (Exh. B)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the dates, time, and behavior of accused-appellant when he raped her so that she could tell her mother when the latter arrived from abroad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Mylene reiterated her claim that accused-appellant had raped her on eight (8) different occasions enumerated in a piece of paper (Exh. B).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Complainant's mother, Rebecca, filed a motion in the trial court seeking custody of Mylene as she was then in the care of Paz Codera. The motion was denied after Mylene refused to go with her mother and expressed a desire to live instead with her maternal grandparents, Samiro Quendangan and Auring Bungag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Rebecca Maglente was scheduled to testify, but her testimony was dispensed with after the parties stipulated that Rebecca is legally married to accused-appellant and that Mylene is their daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Dr. Rosaline O. Cosidon, medico-legal officer of the Philippine National Police (PNP), examined Mylene on September 13, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Her report (Exh. D)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> reads in pertinent parts:<br><br><center>FINDINGS:</center><blockquote>. . . .<br><br>GENITAL:<br><br>There is moderate growth of pubic hair. Labia majora are full, convex and coaptated with the congested labia minora presenting in between. On separating the same is disclosed a congested and elastic, fleshy-type hymen with shallow, healed lacerations at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. External vaginal orifice offers moderate resistance to the introduction of examining index finger and the virgin-sized vaginal speculum. Vaginal canal is narrow with prominent rugosities. Cervix is normal in size, color and consistency.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Subject is in non-virgin state physically.<br><br>There are no external signs of recent application of any form of trauma at the time of examination.<br><br>REMARKS:<br><br>Vaginal and peri-urethral smears are negative for gram-negative diplococci and for spermatozoa.</blockquote>Dr. Cosidon testified that Mylene's physical condition ("non-virgin") could have been caused by the insertion of a foreign object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> She stated that the healed lacerations at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions were more than seven days old but, due to the congestion at the labia minora, it was possible there was sexual intercourse two days before the examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In addition, she said, she found contusions in the following areas of Mylene's body: right knee (Exh. E-1), left knee (Exh. E-2), and left elbow (Exh. E-3) as shown in the Medico-Legal Sketch (Exh. E).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The contusions could be more than one day old or, possibly, two to three days old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, she said that the "non-virgin" condition of Mylene was due to the laceration of her hymen which could have been caused by the insertion of a foreign object like an eggplant or by sexual intercourse or masturbation. The laceration was shallow because it did not penetrate the whole width or base of the hymen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>She corrected the statement in her report that "there are no external signs of recent application of any form of trauma at the time of examination." She said that there actually were contusions sustained but through inadvertence she had failed to state this fact. A supplemental anatomical sketch was prepared after examining Mylene last September 13, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>PO3 Jovencio Villacorte of Station 6, PNP, CPDC, SIID, IBP Lane on Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City, said that on September 14, 1995 he conducted an investigation of the alleged rapes and prepared the affidavit of Mylene as well as the referral letter to the City Prosecutor of Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Villacorte said that Mylene was accompanied by Paz Codera to their station. Mylene looked frightened and cried while she gave her statement, but she related her story without any assistance or coaching from Paz Codera.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The defense presented as its sole witness accused-appellant Eriberto Maglente y Cabahug. He testified that he formerly worked as a security guard while his wife Rebecca Maglente worked as a manicurist and hair stylist until she left for Hongkong on January 2, 1994 to work as a domestic helper. The children were left to his care.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Testifying on the eight (8) occasions when he allegedly raped his daughter, accused-appellant said:<br><br>On April 14, 1995, it being a Good Friday, he stayed at home and did not report for work. He did some laundry and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he and his children went to the BF Homes Chapel, returning home at about 7 o'clock in the evening. After supper, they watched television and slept at 10 o'clock. He did not drink liquor before going to sleep. He woke up the following day, April 15, 1995, at 8 o'clock in the morning and did not report for work. He did not get up from bed and go to his children's bedroom before that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>He recalled that the weather was very humid when he arrived home at 9 o'clock in the evening on April 27, 1995. He slept at 10 o'clock and woke up at 6 o'clock the following morning, April 28, 1995. He denied that he got up from his bed before that time and went to the room of his daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On May 1, 1995, it being a non-working day, he did not get up until 8 o'clock in the morning, although his children woke up earlier. He went to bed between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock in the evening of April 30, 1995 and did not get up earlier than 8 o'clock in the morning of the next day in order to go to his children's room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On May 24, 1995, according to him, no unusual incident happened, particularly at 1:30 in the morning. He got up at 6 o'clock in the morning on that day because he had to report for work. He denied having hit his daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On June 20, 1995, he again woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning. He denied he ever went to his children's bedroom before that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>He likewise denied that he went to the room of his children on July 9, 1995 at around 2:30 in the morning. He did not get up from bed until 8 o'clock in the morning, as it was Sunday. He went to the market with his daughter Maritess. Mylene and Monalyn (Monalisa) stayed in the house to clean it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On July 30, 1995, it being a Sunday, he did not get up from bed until it was 8 o'clock in the morning. He denied getting out of his room at about 1 o'clock that morning. He said that his children went to the house of their Aunt Maria (sister of his wife Rebecca) and visited their cousins and other relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On September 10, 1995, he admitted, he had beaten his children (<i>"Napalo ko ang mga anak ko</i>") because they had lost the key to their house. At that time, his three children were already staying with their grandaunt, Paz Codera. Paz Codera is especially close to Mylene because she wanted to have Mylene as her own daughter. According to accused-appellant, after beating and scolding his children, he sent them to bed at 8 o'clock that evening, while he watched television to forget his anger. He went to bed and slept at 10 o'clock. He woke up the following morning, September 11, 1995, at 6 o'clock and then went to work. When he arrived home that night, Mylene had already left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant stated that Mylene probably filed the rape charges against him because he had beaten her. He surmised that Paz Codera instigated her to file the complaints because of a previous misunderstanding he had with her over a P25,000.00 loan which Paz Codera owed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Mylene Q. Maglente was recalled to the stand to disprove the claim of accused-appellant that Paz Codera was behind the filing of the rape charges against accused-appellant. She also denied that there was a misunderstanding between Paz Codera and accused-appellant regarding money matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Mylene stated that her father had advanced the payment for the house of Paz Codera, but the latter had since repaid the loan. She said Paz Codera had been supportive of her since the time of filing of the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The trial court warned complainant that, if proven guilty, her father could be sentenced to death. However, complainant stood by her testimony that accused-appellant indeed raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On April 8, 1996, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused-appellant guilty of all counts of rape. The dispositive portion of its decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds ERIBERTO MAGLENTE Y CABAHUG guilty beyond reasonable doubt for eight (8) counts of rape, defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act 7659 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of:<br><ol type="1"><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63093;<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63094;<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63095;<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63096;<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63097;<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63098;<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63099; and,<br></li><li> DEATH for Criminal Case No. Q-95-63100.</li></ol>Said accused is likewise ordered to pay the complainant the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P100,000.00) PESOS as moral damages and FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS as exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Accused-appellant assails the judgment of conviction, contending that:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE INCONSISTENCIES OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT AND THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE ENTIRE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION.<br><br></li><li> THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO PROVE THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT'S GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</li></ol></blockquote>Accused-appellant's contentions will be discussed <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br>To begin with, it is hardly necessary to say that the trial court's findings carry great weight and deserve respect and will be sustained on appeal unless the court overlooked some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which will alter its findings. The evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor, conduct, and attitude, especially under cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In these cases, the Court notes the categorical, clear, and positive testimony of Mylene regarding every incident of rape committed against her by accused-appellant and how, despite withering cross-examination by the defense counsel, she remained steadfast in her claim that her father had violated her. Our own review of Mylene's testimony confirms the conclusion of the trial court that her testimony deserves full faith and credence.<br><br><center><i>Alleged Inconsistencies in Complainant's Testimony</i></center><br>Accused-appellant claims that the prosecution's evidence is contradictory and is flawed due to serious inconsistencies and improbabilities in material points. He cites the testimony of complainant on direct examination that she remembered the dates she was allegedly raped by accused-appellant because she wrote them down<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and her answer to the question of the court that the dates were written on the piece of paper marked Exhibit B "in one sitting" only. On this point, the transcript of stenographic notes shows the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><blockquote>ATTY.

Thus, although to the question "when did you write those dates?" she answered, "The first time he raped me, sir," when further queried, "You mean to say you already prepared all those dates during the first time that you were allegedly raped by your father?," she categorically said, "No, sir." What is clear is that the dates she wrote on Exhibit B were written "in one (1) sitting" on September 13, 1995 based on what she had previously recorded with respect to some dates and on what she remembered after consulting the calendar.<br><br>The defense also tried to show another seeming contradiction in the testimony of complainant:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY.

The lapses, however, are inconsequential and are doubtless due to the fact that complainant was raped in the wee hours of the morning, between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the morning. A young girl like complainant could easily be mistaken as to the date the incident happened, <i>i.e.,</i> whether it was on July 30 or July 31, 1995 (when complainant was allegedly raped for the seventh time), and whether it was on September 10 or September 11, 1995 (when she was allegedly raped for the eighth time). If the discrepancies amounted to differences in dates in the magnitude of the difference, say, between July 20 and July 31, 1995 or between September 1 and September 11, 1995, there might arise doubt as to the truthfulness of complainant. But that is not so in these cases. The lapses are insignificant and they are to be expected of a young and inexperienced girl like complainant.

In effect, he is saying there was lack of force or intimidation.<br><br>Mylene testified that the sexual assaults by accused-appellant were all attended by force and threats which rendered her resistance futile. Indeed, as this Court said in <i>People v. Matrimonio,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the test is whether the threat or intimidation produces a reasonable fear in the victim that if she resists or does not yield to the desires of the accused, the threat would be carried out. Where resistance would be futile, offering none at all cannot amount to consent to the sexual assault. And, in a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the former's moral ascendancy and influence over the latter sufficiently takes the place of violence or intimidation. That ascendancy or influence flows from the father's parental authority over his children and from the latter's correlative duty to obey and observe reverence and respect towards the former.<br><br>Accused-appellant contends that he could not have raped Mylene inside her bedroom because his two other daughters were sleeping there. Complainant was asked this question and her answer was that if her sisters were in fact awakened by her struggle as her father abused her and they knew what was going on, they did not tell her:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q </td><td width="95%">Is anyone of your sisters awakened when that incident was taking place?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">I am not aware if they were awakened or if they have seen it or they do not just want to tell me if they knew about it, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Indeed, it is common judicial experience that rapists are not deterred from committing their odious act by the presence of people nearby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Lust is no respecter of places,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> it has been said. In these cases, the commission of the crime was effectively aided by the fact of accused-appellant's great moral ascendancy over complainant, which prevented the latter from making an outcry as she could have done were it another person who committed the sexual assaults against her.<br><br>Finally, accused-appellant contends:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><blockquote>It is worthy to note that even prosecution witness, Dr. Cosidon testified on her findings of the physical examination of the private complainant done two days after the alleged rape on September 11, 1995 to the effect that: `<i>There are no external signs of recent application of any form of trauma at the time of examination. The vaginal and peri-urethral smear are negative for gram-negative diplococci and for spermatozoa.'</i> This fact is very material considering the positive testimony of the accused that she was raped two days before said medico-legal examination.<br><br>The accused is well-aware of the fact that jurisprudence has ruled that the absence of spermatozoa when private complainant is examined does not negate the commission of rape. However, it is submitted that this rule applies only when there is a clear evidence to show that said act was committed. In this regard, this rule should not be applied in the case at bar as there is sufficient evidence to show that the complained act did not take place at all. Thus, the absence of spermatozoa should be seriously considered and weighed heavily in the determination of the accused's innocence.</blockquote>As already stated, the evidence of the prosecution shows beyond doubt that accused-appellant raped his daughter eight (8) times. Moreover, such crime is consummated when the penis touches the pudendum, however slightly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In rape cases, a broken hymen is not an essential element thereof.<br><br>Accused-appellant says that Paz Codera, who is childless, is behind the filing of the charges against him. He claims that Paz wants to take Mylene as her own. It will suffice to say that accused-appellant has presented no evidence to prove this assertion, let alone that the allegation is silly.<br><br>The Court is convinced beyond a shadow of doubt that accused-appellant committed the eight (8) counts of rape alleged in the informations against his daughter. The trial court correctly held accused-appellant guilty of each count of rape. Indeed, Mylene spoke in a simple and forthright manner. She maintained her testimony even after the trial court had warned her that her father could be meted out the death penalty if found guilty of the charges. Her testimony is corroborated by medical findings that she suffered lacerations in her hymen. Against such evidence of the prosecution, the bare denial of accused-appellant cannot prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In these cases, complainant's testimony is entitled to greater weight because it is against her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> We cannot believe she would fabricate charges against her father if the charges were not true. At one point, Mylene broke down while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><center><i>Lack of Sufficient Evidence As<br>to Complainant's Age </i></center><br>We think, however, that the trial court erred in applying in these cases the provision of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by §11 of R.A. No. 7659, that the penalty of death shall be imposed on the offender in rape cases if "the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent . . . of the victim." The concurrence of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender is a special qualifying circumstance which should be both alleged<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and proved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> with certainty in order to warrant the imposition of the death penalty. In these cases, complainant never said she was below 18 years of age when she was allegedly raped by her father on any of the dates stated in her complaints, <i>i.e.,</i> April 15, April 28, May 1, May 24, June 20, July 9, July 31, and September 10, 1995. That she was so is merely a deduction (1) from her <i>Salaysay,</i> dated September 14, 1995, and her testimony in court on November 7, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> when, in stating her personal circumstances, she said she was 17 years of age, and (2) from her answer to the question how old she was, when asked by the defense counsel on November 14, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the decision of the trial court contains no express and categorical finding that complainant was below 18 when she was raped to justify the imposition of the death penalty on accused-appellant. The trial court's references to the age of complainant on November 7, 1995 were made in connection with the motion filed by Rebecca Maglente for custody of complainant. Even then, the court's references to complainant's age are equivocal. Thus, in its order, dated November 7, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the court stated it was denying Rebecca's motion for custody for the additional reason that complainant was "more than 17 years of age now [<i>i.e.,</i> November 7, 1995]." In the course of the proceedings for custody held that day, November 7, 1995, the court said:<br><blockquote>Although as I said, the Motion for Custody should be filed before the proper forum and that is the Courts who are designated to try cases regarding Juvenile and Domestic Relations cases. But as you said Atty. Urbano, considering that the rape cases is with this sala, the Presiding Judge could also resolve the pending motion. <u>Now, before resolving the Motion for Custody, I would like to ask the complainant considering that she is past 17 years of age, according to her, where her last birthday is August 21, 1995, she turned 17.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote>The statements complainant was "more than 17 years of age" and "past 17 years of age" are susceptible of varying interpretations. They could mean she was 18 years of age, in which case the death penalty could not be imposed, just as they could mean complainant was 17 years and a few days or months, in which case the imposition of the death penalty would be justified. Of course, the trial court also mentioned August 21, 1995 as complainant's last birthday. The records do not, however, show when complainant said this to be her last birthday or that she said this at all.<br><br>At all events, it is the burden of the prosecution to prove with certainty the fact that the victim was below 18 when the rapes were committed in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty. The fact that accused-appellant has not denied the allegation in the complaints that Mylene was below 18 years of age when any of the crimes was committed cannot make up for the failure of the prosecution to discharge its burden. Because of its failure to discharge this burden and the corresponding failure of the trial court to make a categorical finding as to the minority of the victim, we are constrained to hold that the qualifying circumstance of minority and relationship cannot be appreciated in these cases. It is different with regard to the relationship of the offended party and accused-appellant, because the latter admitted that complainant is his daughter. Perforce, the death penalty imposed by the trial court in each of the eight (8) cases should be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> as provided in the second paragraph of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>The award of damages made by the trial court should likewise be modified. Under present case law, the award of P50,000.00 for civil indemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Hence, accused-appellant should be ordered to pay complainant the total amount of P400,000.00. In addition, he should be ordered to pay in each case moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00. This award is to be given even if there is neither allegation nor evidence presented as basis therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> But the award of exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 should be disallowed for lack of basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 78, is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:<br><br>(1) In Criminal Case Nos.
