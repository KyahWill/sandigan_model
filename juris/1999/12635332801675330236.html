				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an automatic review of the decision dated December 12, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court, 6th Judicial Region, Branch 42, Bacolod City in Criminal Cases Nos. 95-17443, 95-17444, 95-17445 and 95-17450 for four (4) counts of Rape, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the court finds the accused Wilfredo Onabia alias `Odoy' guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed the crime of rape against Raquel B.

Private complainant was in her room at that time. Accused-appellant entered the room of private complainant and told her not to shout, otherwise, he would kill her and the other members of her family<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereupon, he embraced private complainant, forced her to lie down, removed her panty and inserted his penis into her vagina<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>.<br><br>At about 9:00 P.M. of October 7, 1995, accused-appellant called private complainant who was then in her room and requested her to massage him at the sala of their house<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>. Private complainant was hesitant to massage appellant. However, she was constrained to massage accused-appellant because she was told to do so by her mother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>. While private complainant and appellant were at the sala, the latter squeezed the arm of the former and told her not to shout<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thereupon, accused-appellant removed his short pants and brief and private complainant's underwear. Then, he inserted his penis into the vagina of private complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>.<br><br>At about 9:00 P.M. of November 6, 1995, private complainant was in her room. Accused-appellant, who was then in the sala, called private complainant and told her to massage him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Although private complainant was hesitant to massage appellant, she was prevailed upon by her mother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> While both private complainant and accused-appellant were in the sala, she was told by the latter not to shout. Thereupon, appellant forced private complainant to lie down. After removing his brief and the underwear of private complainant, accused-appellant inserted his penis into the vagina of private complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On November 7, 1995, private complainant reported to her brother Jessie the sexual assault perpetrated upon her by appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>. Jessie reported the same to their elder brother Bernabe. Thereupon, Bernabe and private complainant reported the incident to the barangay councilman and the police<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On the following day, November 8, 1995, private complainant was subjected to medical examination by Dr. Dennis Duenas. The medical report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> issued by him on November 15, 1995 showed that private complainant sustained lacerations on her hymen as follows:<br><blockquote><b><sup>.</sup></b> OLD LACERATION AT THE HYMENAL RING 9'2'5'3' POSITION<br><b><sup>.</sup></b> INTROITUS ADMITS 1 FINGER WITH EASE<br><b><sup>.</sup></b> CERVIX *SMALL, CLOSE<br>UTERUS SMALL<br>ADNEXIE (-)</blockquote>Consequently, accused, herein appellant, Wilfredo "Odoy" Onabia was charged separately with four (4) counts of Rape, thus:<br><br><center><u>"CRIMINAL CASE NO. 95-17443</u></center><br><blockquote>The undersigned Provincial Prosecutor, based on the criminal complaint under oath, signed by the offended party, Raquel Eballe Brahin, a minor, 11 years of age, accuses WILFREDO ONABIA alias "ODOY" of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 15th day of February, 1994, in the Municipality of Salvador Benedicto, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the offended party against her will.<br><br><center><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 95-17444</u></center><br>The undersigned Provincial Prosecutor, based on the criminal complaint under oath, signed by the offended party, Raquel Eballe y Brahin, a minor, 11 years of age, accuses WILFREDO ONABIA alias "ODOY" of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 10th day of August, 1994, in the Municipality of Salvador Benedicto, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the offended party against her will.<br><br><center><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 95-17450</u></center><br>The undersigned Provincial Prosecutor, based on the criminal complaint under oath, signed by the offended party, Raquel Eballe y Brahin, a minor, 11 years of age, accuses WILFREDO ONABIA alias "ODOY" of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 7th day of October, 1995, in the Municipality of Salvador Benedicto, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the offended party against her will.<br><br><center><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 95-17445</u></center><br>The undersigned Provincial Prosecutor, based on the criminal complaint under oath, signed by the offended party, Raquel Eballe y Brahin, a minor, 11 years of age, accuses WILFREDO ONABIA alias "ODOY" of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 6th day of November, 1995 in the municipality of Salvador Benedicto, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court; the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the offended party against her will."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>In disowning liability for the offenses charged, accused-appellant simply denied the same and argued that the charges were mere fabrications as a consequence of a quarrel he had with the private complainant's elder brother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, accused-appellant Wilfredo Onabia was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged and was sentenced accordingly. Hence, this case before us for review. In his brief, accused-appellant raises the following errors:<br><br><center>ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS</center><br><center>I.</center><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE RAPE ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED ON 15 FEBRUARY 1994 (CRIM CASE NO. 95-17443) WAS QUALIFIED WITH THE USE OF DEADLY WEAPON.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINING WITNESS RAQUEL B. EBALLE.<br><br><center>III.</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF FOUR (4) COUNTS OF RAPE AND IN ORDERING HIM TO PAY MORAL DAMAGES OF PhP50,000.00 FOR EACH COUNT DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>In his first assigned error, accused-appellant argues that the crime of Rape in Criminal Case No. 95-17443 was not qualified by the use of a deadly weapon. We agree.<br><br>A review of the records at hand reveal that, while accused-appellant was then carrying a bolo in his waist, as he usually does<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (TSN), accused-appellant never used the same to threaten private complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>. The threats made by accused-appellant was never accompanied with the use of his bolo.<br><br>The case of <b><i>People v. Lamberte</i></b>, which was raised by the People to refute accused-appellant's first assigned error, is not applicable for in that case the rape was not qualified by the "use of a deadly weapon" but rather the commission "by two or more persons."<br><blockquote>"The defense also calls attention to the fact that the use of a weapon was not mentioned in the Information filed by the Fiscal. The use of a `knife,' however, was alleged in the earlier complaint CLARISSA had filed before the Municipal Court of Catarman. But even in the absence of such an allegation in the Information, the nature of the offense charged is not altered for the use of force or intimidation in having carnal knowledge of a woman sufficiently constitutes the crime of rape, <b>and its commission by two or more persons qualifies i</b><b>t.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><b> (underscoring supplied)</b></blockquote>While private complainant in the present case did mention the use of a "bladed weapon" in her earlier complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the use of the same, as we found earlier, was never established. Besides, the qualifying circumstance of "commission by two or more persons" is not available unlike in <b><i>Lamberte</i></b>. Hence, the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. 95-17443 cannot be qualified.<br><br>Still on Criminal Case No. 95-17443, we also find the court <i>a quo</i> to have erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstances of: (1) abuse of superior strength; (2) abuse of confidence; and (3) lack of respect on account of age and relationship.<br><br>The second paragraph of Section 14, Article III of the Constitution guarantees the right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The rationale for this was aptly put by Mr. Justice Felix Q. Antonio in the early case of <b><i>Matilde, Jr. v. Jabson</i></b>, thus:<br><blockquote>"Inasmuch as `not only the liberty but even the life of the accused may be at stake, it is always wise and proper that the accused should be fully apprised of the true charges against them, and thus avoid all and any possible surprises which may be detrimental to their rights and interests.' The main purpose of this requirement is to enable the accused to suitably prepare his defense. He is presumed to be innocent and has, therefore, no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense with which he is charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>In the case before us, the above-mentioned aggravating circumstances were neither mentioned in the complaint nor in the information. Consequently, to appreciate the aforementioned aggravating circumstances and to convict the accused of an offense higher than that charged in the complaint or information on which he is tried would constitute an unauthorized denial of his constitutional right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Considering further that the crime is simple rape, which is punishable by a single indivisible penalty of<i> reclusion perpetua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> no ordinary mitigating or aggravating circumstances may affect it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Moreover, in order to appreciate the aggravating circumstance of "abuse of superior strength,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it must be sufficiently established that the same was deliberately taken advantage of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> No such proof was offered in the present case. As regards the aggravating circumstance of "abuse of confidence," it is necessary that the confidence facilitated the commission of the offense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and the same will not hold true if the victim had already lost confidence in the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this case before us, private complainant's hesitance and apparent reluctance to accompany accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> showed her lack of confidence in him. Next, the aggravating circumstance of "lack of respect on account of age" requires that the accused should have deliberately intended to offend or insult the age of the offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Nowhere in the case at bar was it shown that the rape was perpetrated by the accused-appellant with the thought or intention "of heaping contumely or insult upon the child because of her sex or her tender age."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Finally, the stepbrother and stepsister relationship between private complainant and accused-appellant cannot elevate the crime to "qualified rape" under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659 for they are not considered related either by blood or by affinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As regards the second and the third assigned errors, the same will be resolved jointly for being interrelated. In essence, accused-appellant assails the credibility of private complainant.<br><br>In this case before us, appellant interposed the defense of alibi and argued that the first and second incidents of rape could not have happened because he only moved in with his father and the latter's new family on August 24, 1994. While this may be true, the same would not stop accused-appellant from visiting them before he moved in.<br><br>In the 1997 case of <b><i>People v. Bugarin</i></b>, this Court through Mr. Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, pronounced:<br><blockquote>"Now it is settled that when the complainant in a rape case, more so if she is a minor, testifies that she has been raped, she says in effect, all that is necessary to prove the commission of the crime. Care must be taken, however, that her testimony is credible for conviction to be justified based on her testimony alone."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>In the present case, private complainant made a detailed accounting of how accused-appellant molested her on those two incidents.<br><br><center>1<sup>st</sup> Incident of Rape<br>February 15, 1994<br>(Criminal case No.

of rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Her revelation, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and her willingness to undergo public trial where she was compelled to give out the details of the assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It is most improbable that a victim of tender years especially one who is not exposed to the ways of the world would impute a crime as serious as rape if it were not true<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>, and if she was not solely motivated by her desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>As we find private complainant's testimony credible, accused-appellant's defense of alibi must fail. It is well-settled that an affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Moreover, the positive identification made by the complainant of the person who took away her honor has made the defense of alibi unacceptable<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>.<br><br>As regards the third and fourth incidents of rape, accused-appellant presents the improbability of having committed the rape in the living room.

Consequently, rape may be committed even in the most unlikely places.<br><blockquote>"In a long line of rape cases, this Court has held that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises and even inside a house where there are other occupants or where other members of the family are sleeping<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>.</blockquote>With regard to the purported delay in reporting the four incidents of rape, the same finds justification in private complainant's testimony to the effect that accused-appellant threatened her on all four occasions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>.<br><br>Except for the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 95-17443 therefore, We affirm the findings of the trial court and uphold the long established rule that,<br><blockquote>"(T)he assessment of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination. These are the utmost significant factors in evaluating the sincerity of witnesses and in unearthing the truth, especially in the face of conflicting testimonies. Through its observations during the entire proceedings, the trial court can be expected to determine, with reasonable discretion, whose testimony to accept and which witness to disbelieve. Verily, findings of the trial court on such matters will not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted so as to materially affect the disposition of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the modification that (1) in Criminal Case No. 95-17443 the accused-appellant is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, without any of the qualifying circumstances, and is accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in accordance with Republic Act No. 7659 and (2) the accused-appellant shall pay the additional amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages in each of the four (4) cases in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo,</i> and <i>Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Ynares-Santiago, J.,</i> no part.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> RTC Decision, pp. 43-44,<i> Rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, August 13, 1996, pp. 6 and 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> TSNs, August 13, 1996, p.7; September 3, 1996, p. 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, August 13, 1996, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, August 13, 1996, p. 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TSN, August 13, 1996, p. 24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., pp. 24-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 27-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., pp. 29 &amp; 30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> TSNs, August 13, 1996, p. 30; September 3, 1996, p. 33.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Exh., "H", p. 9, Records.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> RTC Decision, pp. 16-17, <i>Rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> TSNs, September 24, 1996, pp. 8-10; September 25, 1996, pp. 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Appellant's Brief, pp. 66-67, <i>Rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> TSNs, August 13, 1996, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> TSN, September 3, 1996, p. 25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> People <i>v</i>.
