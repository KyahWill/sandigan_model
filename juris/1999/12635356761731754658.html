				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ARTHUR DELA CRUZ, ACCUSED APPELLANT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">ARTHUR DELA CRUZ was charged with murder before the Regional Trial Court of Kalibo, Aklan, for the death of Marbel Baptista on 24 October 1994 allegedly committed with treachery and evident premeditation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On 19 June 1997 the trial court adjudged him guilty as charged but qualified only by treachery. Appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the trial court sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered him to pay the heirs of the victim P50,000.00 as death indemnity and P35,000.00 as funeral and burial expenses, and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On 24 October 1994 Diego Pelonio planned an evening party to celebrate the birthday of his younger child. The party was to be held in his house in Brgy. Bay-ang, Batan, Aklan. Arthur dela Cruz, nephew of Diego, helped prepare the food. The guests started to arrive at around 7:30 in the evening. Among them were Arthur's father Felix and townmates Marbel Baptista, Romeo Bitamor, Jerry Paclibare, Felipe Bustamante, Nestor Prado and Pepito Dalipe. They drank <i>tuba</i> and beer. A few minutes past 8:00, Carlita dela Cruz, mother of Arthur, arrived to fetch her husband Felix, after which, the spouses proceeded home.<br><br>Before long, screams of a woman were heard from the national road. Diego and Jerry rushed to where the sound seemingly came from. Arthur followed. When Diego and Jerry returned, they told the other guests in the yard that Felix was boxed by somebody. Arthur thereafter reappeared and approached them clutching a knife. Without uttering a word he stabbed Marbel Baptista several times. Marbel was then sitting with his left leg raised on the bamboo bench and about to light a cigarette. Thus, with this position when stabbed, Marbel was unable to thwart the attack. Marbel fell lifeless on the ground. Arthur ran away. This startling occurrence was witnessed by Diego, Romeo, Jerry and some other guests. The autopsy conducted on the cadaver of Marbel disclosed these findings: (a) chopped wound, 4 x 4 inches, upper posterior left arm; (b) stab wound, 2 x 6 inches, left chest, directed medially along the posterior left axillary line; (c) stab wound, 2 - 1/2 x 3 inches, left lateral chest, below the tip of the left scapula; (d) stab wound, 1-1/2 x 6 inches, below wound No. 2, directed downwards and medially; (e) incised wound, 3 x 1/2 inches, 2 inches below the left ear; (f) stab wound, 2 x 6 inches, 2 inches below the midclavicle, left side, directed downwards; (g) stab wound, 1 x 4 inches, right chest along anterior right axillary line directed downwards; (h) chopped wound, right palm, cutting the right small and ring finger; (i) incised wound, 2 x 1/2 inches, mid forearm, right side; (j) incised wound, 1/2 x 3 inches, anterior right thigh; and, (k) stab wound, 1 x 3 inches, left costal arch directed upwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> According to the examining physician, of the eleven (11) wounds inflicted on Marbel five (5) were mortal since they involved the heart, lungs and abdomen, and all the wounds could have been brought about by a knife or a sharp, bladed and pointed instrument.<br><br>Precy Baptista, widow of Marbel, testified that she spent P35,000.00 for the funeral and burial expenses of her husband.<br><br>Accused Arthur dela Cruz, on the other hand, claimed that while watching television in the house of his uncle Diego at the time of the incident he heard his mother shouting for help. Immediately, he ran towards the direction from where his mother's voice was coming. Some forty (40) meters away from the house of his uncle Arthur found his father lying on the ground being kicked by Marbel. Arthur told Marbel to stop but the latter replied, "<i>Ikaw, maapin ka pa.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Simultaneously, Marbel drew a knife. Arthur ran. Marbel pursued him and lunged his knife at Arthur. While Arthur was able to foil the blow, Marbel slipped and fell down. Arthur, taking advantage of the situation, wrestled with Marbel for the possession of the latter's knife. Arthur succeeded and stabbed Marbel four (4) times. Marbel ran towards the house of Diego. Arthur chased him but desisted when several persons went to the rescue of Marbel upon reaching Diego's house. Arthur had to hide himself behind the bamboo groove until he went home. Later, Arthur surrendered to the Barangay Captain who accompanied him to the police station. Arthur admitted to the Barangay Captain and to the police that he stabbed Marbel but claimed he forgot where he placed the knife.<br><br>The trial court accorded full credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, especially that of Arthur's uncle Diego Pelonio, regarding the manner of the attack on Marbel by Arthur and the place of its commission. On the other hand, it found Arthur's claim of self-defense to have been contrived since he failed to raise it when he surrendered to the authorities. Besides, he also failed to establish the elements of self-defense.<br><br>In this appeal, the question to be resolved is which version should be believed - that of the prosecution asserting that the victim was treacherously killed within the yard of the house of Diego Pelonio, or that of the defense contending that the killing was prompted by defense of one's self and the immediate vindication of a wrong done to the accused's father Felix dela Cruz?<br><br>Accused-appellant maintains that he was justified in stabbing Marbel since he only repelled the aggression of Marbel against Felix dela Cruz, his father. And because of the claimed unlawful aggression, he submits that the deceased was sufficiently forewarned and placed on guard thus destroying the theory of treachery in the killing. He also insists that the testimony of Diego Pelonio should be completely disregarded having failed to submit himself to cross-examination, while Romeo Bitamor should be considered a biased witness being a friend and <i>compadre</i> of the victim. He attacks the credibility of Jerry Paclibare as he gave contradictory narrations in court and in his affidavit regarding the identity of the person who shouted for help.<br><br>That accused-appellant is guilty for the death of Marbel stands on solid ground. The testimony of Romeo Bitamor is clear on this point. He was only three (3) meters away from accused-appellant and his victim and the place was adequately illumined by an electric light. Romeo was afforded the opportunity to view at close range the incident as it unfolded -<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q: </td><td width="95%">And while you were drinking outside of the house of Diego Pelonio, and at around 8:30 that evening, did you hear any shout?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>Yes, sir, at the road.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>x x x x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And how far is (sic) that from the house of Diego Pelonio?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>About 80 meters away.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And whose shout was that?

At around 8:30, Romeo and Jerry heard shouts of a woman coming from the road. Diego and Jerry went to the apparent source of the sound, followed by Arthur. When Diego and Jerry returned they informed the guests that Felix was boxed by somebody. A few minutes thereafter, Arthur also returned and immediately stabbed Marbel. As thus narrated, however, there was a hiatus between the time when Arthur proceeded to the source of the screams and when he suddenly stabbed Marbel. Such lapse in the continuity of the witnesses' accounts is decisive in determining the crime committed by Arthur and the commensurate penalty therefor. We find it unnatural for Arthur to have been suddenly infuriated upon his return to the house of Diego with Marbel as the target of his furor, to the exclusion of the other guests of Diego. It should be recalled that during the drinking session, Arthur was watching television. When he heard the shouts of a woman, he proceeded to the direction where the sound came from. His parents Felix and Carlita must have then disclosed to him the identity of Marbel as the one who boxed Felix, that is why he directed his stab blows solely at Marbel upon his return to the house of Diego. We draw this inference from a consideration of the other portions of the testimony of Romeo manifesting that indeed it was Marbel who physically assaulted Felix on the road. Otherwise, it would be very unnatural for Arthur to stab Marbel for no reason at all. It may be recalled that Arthur was in the house of Diego helping the latter prepare the food for his guests.<br><br>Jurisprudence recognizes that victims of criminal violence have a penchant for seeing the faces and features of their attackers and remembering them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the present case, Marbel was known to Felix, both being residents of Batan, Aklan. Felix must have acquiesced to the infliction by his son Arthur of the injuries Marbel sustained as may be gathered from the testimony of prosecution witness Romeo Bitamor, the fishpond operator and resident of Bay-ang, Batan -<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q:</td><td width="95%"> By the way, after Arthur dela Cruz had already stabbed the victim do you know if his father did anything x x x x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>He came later.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY. ILIGAN:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And what did he say if he said anything?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>He asked persons there who among them is (sic) aggrieved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>A portion of the testimony of Jerry Paclibare was of the same tenor -<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q: </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">After he (appellant) had run away (victim having fallen lifeless to the ground) what else happened?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td><div align="justify">After Arthur dela Cruz ran away the father Felix dela Cruz came back with a bolo on his hand saying, who was still sympathizing with Marbel?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In other words, if the one who boxed Felix was a person other than Marbel, Felix could have remonstrated then and there against the attacked by Arthur on Marbel. Consequently, we find it difficult to sustain the testimony of Romeo and Jerry that when they heard the shouts Marbel was still sitting on the bench. We seriously doubt this particular narration of Romeo and Jerry. The test to determine the value of the testimony of a witness is whether or not such is in conformity with human knowledge and consistent with the experience of mankind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Aside from subjecting the testimony of a witness under the most careful scrutiny, of equal importance is getting the complete picture of the events the witness is narrating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> What is more in accord with the ordinary course of events was that Marbel boxed Felix on the road then returned to the house of Diego, perhaps unaware that Arthur was there. But Arthur must have learned that it was Marbel who boxed his father Felix, so that in immediate vindication of a wrong done to his father, Arthur stabbed Marbel.<br><br>The rule that the factual findings and assessment of credibility of a witness generally binds the court cannot be strictly applied in this case. Significant facts and circumstances were overlooked and disregarded by the trial court which when properly considered affected the result of the case. There were strong and cogent reasons that justified departure from the trial court's finding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> At any rate, only that aspect of the testimonies of Romeo and Jerry is not sustainable. Even where a witness has been found to have deliberately falsified the truth in some particulars, it is not required that the whole of his testimony be rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The testimony of a witness may be believed in part and disbelieved in part, depending upon the corroborative evidence and the probabilities and improbabilities of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>We thus appreciate the mitigating circumstance of vindication of a grave offense under Art. 13, par. 5, of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> or as a circumstance similar in nature or analogous to it, pursuant to Art. 13, Art. 10, of the same code. The circumstance that Felix, Arthur's father, was boxed by Marbel was serious enough to perturb Arthur's mind and diminish the voluntariness of his action.<br><br>Having invoked the justifying circumstance of self-defense, the burden of proof was thereupon shifted to accused-appellant to establish by clear and convincing evidence the elements thereof, namely: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and, (c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Unlawful aggression is an indispensable element, whether in complete or incomplete self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> We note that while accused-appellant clings to self-defense, his argument indeed deviates therefrom and relates instead to defense of a relative. To be specific, he argues that Marbel was an unlawful aggressor when he boxed and kicked Felix and that it was this aggression which he repelled. But this argument of accused-appellant should have been concerned with the alleged unlawful aggression committed against him; and even granting this were so, and we accept his version to the contrary, <i>i.e.</i>, Marbel chased him and lunged a knife at him, still the trial court correctly relegated it to insignificance -<br><blockquote>Even if the Court were to give importance to the pretense of the accused that the victim chased him with a knife (and) when the (victim) slipped and fell to the ground he wrestled for the possession of the knife and then repeatedly stabbed the victim (<i>TSN, May 16, 1996, p. 4</i>) still unlawful aggression cannot be considered. After the accused was able to take possession of the weapon, at that point in time, the unlawful aggression against him, if any, had effectively ceased (<i>People vs. Ganzagan</i>, <i>G.R. No. 113793, August 11, 1995</i>). Clearly, there was no more threat to the life and limb of the accused (<i>Andal vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, <i>G.R. No. 60159, November 6, 1989</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Neither was the second element of self-defense present. The nature, location and number of wounds inflicted on the victim belie and negate the claim of self-defense. If accused-appellant stabbed the victim merely to defend himself, it certainly defies reason why he had to inflict a total of eleven (11) wounds in different vital parts of the body of the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> such as his heart, lungs and abdomen. The gravity of those wounds is indicative of a determined effort to kill and not just to defend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> With the foregoing discussion, it is no longer necessary to dwell on the third element, <i>i.e., </i>lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br><br>As it is, Arthur's version of the incident was scripted way below the level of satisfaction. It has imperfections as to some significant segments so much so that, preliminarily treated in isolation from the prosecution's evidence, it failed to pass the test of credibility. Accused-appellant claimed to have wrestled with Marbel for the possession of the knife after Marbel slipped and fell on the ground, yet he did not have the slightest scratch on his body. The physician opined that the victim could not have traversed a distance of forty (40) meters before falling down considering that his heart was hit. The physician elaborated on this aspect -<br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q: </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">You stated doctor that a person hit by a bladed weapon like a knife on his body piercing the heart you stated that you don't think he can still run a distance of 40 meters, is that correct?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td><div align="justify">But there is a possibility, doctor, that the victim can still run?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td> <div align="justify">Could still run but not that distance.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td><div align="justify">If the victim doctor is strong and robust he could still run that distance of 40 meters, is that correct?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td> <div align="justify">I don't think so because the heart was hit there is an abrupt leakage of blood.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td><div align="justify">Because of abrupt leakage of blood the victim could not run at (sic) a distance of 40 meters but if the victim could stop the leakage of the blood by putting his hand on the wound it is possible that the leakage of blood could be stopped and he could run?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td><div align="justify">The bleeding could not be stopped by pressing the heart or by putting pressure to the heart because the bleeding is not external but internal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Further, no bloodstain was found at the place indicated by accused-appellant as the scene of the crime, not even on the road leading to Diego's house. Further still, he must have discarded the knife and not simply forgot where he placed it, which can only mean that he naturally did not want to produce the evidence that could convict him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> With more reason did accused-appellant's version of the incident fall to pieces when pitted against the testimonies of Romeo Bitamor and Jerry Paclibare.<br><br>Apart from those already mentioned, there exists plausible reason to believe, as did the trial court, that the claim of self-defense was contrived because Arthur failed to raise that defense when he surrendered to the Barangay Captain and the police. He simply admitted that he stabbed Marbel. Such failure is fatal to his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>However, we agree with accused-appellant that the trial court should not have relied on the testimony of Diego Pelonio because he was not cross-examined. After his direct examination, the defense counsel moved for continuance as he was committed to appear before another Branch of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the subsequent hearing, the defense counsel manifested that Diego was not available for cross-examination since he was suffering from severe stomach pain. Diego failed to attend the rest of the hearings. To give weight to his testimony is to gravely violate the constitutional right of accused-appellant to meet the witnesses face-to-face and to subject the source of the information to the rigid test of cross-examination, the only effective means to test their truthfulness, memory and intelligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This notwithstanding, the rejection of Diego's testimony does not produce a crippling effect on the prosecution because the testimony of Romeo as corroborated by Jerry adequately established the guilt of accused-appellant.<br><br>The circumstance that Romeo was the victim's friend and <i>compadre </i>does not automatically impair his credibility nor render his testimony less worthy of credence since no improper motive has been ascribed to him for testifying against accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, whether the woman who was shouting was unidentified, as declared by Jerry in court, or the voice of the woman was that of accused-appellant's mother, as stated in Jerry's affidavit, refers to a trivial matter which cannot in any manner serve to discredit him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Besides, whenever there is an inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight because the affidavit is almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Thus, we hold that accused-appellant Arthur dela Cruz is guilty of homicide, not murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Taking into account the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and immediate vindication of a wrong amounting to a crime, the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal </i>imposable on accused-appellant is reduced to <i>prision mayor</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the range of which is six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum of the penalty shall be taken from the medium period of <i>prision mayor </i>the range of which is eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years, while the minimum shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree which is <i>prision correccional </i>the range of which is six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years. The Court deems it proper to impose upon accused-appellant a prison term of two (2) years and four (4) months of <i>prision correccional </i>minimum as minimum, to eight (8) years and two (2) months of <i>prision mayor</i> medium as maximum. The expenses incurred for the burial and funeral of Marbel amounting to P35,000.00 were adequately proved by his widow.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from finding accused-appellant Arthur dela Cruz guilty of murder is <b>MODIFIED.</b> This Court finds him guilty instead of homicide punishable by <i>reclusion temporal</i>.<i> </i>Appreciating the mitigating circumstances of (a) voluntary surrender and (b) immediate vindication of a grave offense under par. 5, Art. 13, of the Revised Penal Code, the Court imposes upon accused-appellant Arthur dela Cruz a prison term of two (2) years and four (4) months of <i>prision correccional </i>minimum as minimum, to eight (8) years and two (2) months of <i>prision mayor </i>medium as maximum, and orders him to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Marbel Baptista the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity for death and P35,000.00 for funeral and burial expenses.
