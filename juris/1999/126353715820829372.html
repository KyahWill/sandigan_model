Minutes later, appellant approached one of the tables where Florida, the restaurant's cook was drinking beer. Without any warning, appellant pulled Florida's hair and poked a knife on the latter's throat.&nbsp; Florida stood up and pleaded with appellant not to harm him (<u>ibid</u>., p. 7).&nbsp; Appellant relented and released his grip on Florida.&nbsp; Thereafter, he left the restaurant together with his companions. However, a few minutes latter he was back (<u>ibid</u>, p.8).</i><br><br><i>Appellant brandished a gun and menacingly entered the restaurant.&nbsp; Not encountering any resistance, he thus proceeded to the kitchen where Florida worked (<u>ibid</u>).&nbsp; Stealthily approaching Florida from behind, appellant fired six successive shots at Florida who fell down (<u>Ibid.</u>, p. 9).&nbsp; His evil deed accomplished, appellant left the kitchen and fled (<u>ibid</u>).</i><br><br><i>Appellant was chased by a man who while running, shouted at onlookers that the person he was running after was armed and had just killed somebody.&nbsp; Alerted, SPO2 Fernandez, who was then in the vicinity, went into action and nabbed appellant.&nbsp; He frisked appellant and recovered from him a Paltik revolver, caliber. 38, with Serial Number 853169 (Exh. A).&nbsp; He checked the revolver's cylinder and found six empty cartridges (Exhs. T to T-6). He noted that it smelled of gunpowder. He and PO1 Ortega turned over appellant and the confiscated firearm to the Investigation Division of the Baguio Police and then executed a Joint Affidavit of Arrest (Exhibit O).&nbsp; On the same night, Fely Batanes gave her sworn statement (Exhibit E) to the Baguio Police wherein she positively identified appellant as the assailant."</i><br><br><center><i>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</i><br><br><i>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</i></center><br><i>NBI Forensic Chemist Ms. Carina Javier found both hands of appellant positive for nitrates as stated in her Chemist Report No. C-94-22.&nbsp; She conducted a microscopic chemical examination on the subject firearm and found that the gun was fired within one week prior to June 27, 1994.</i><br><br><i>Elmer Nelson Piedad, Ballistician of the Firearm Investigation Division, NBI, Manila, tested and concluded that the slugs recovered from the victim were fired from appellant's firearm.&nbsp; Upon verification from the Firearms Explosive division, Camp Crame, Quezon City, it was found that appellant is not a licensed firearm holder nor, was the subject firearm duly registered with the said office (Exh. A)."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>The autopsy conducted by Dr. John Tinoyan on the cadaver of the deceased yielded a Necropsy Report, which states:<br><br><blockquote><center><i>"POSTMORTEM FINDINGS</i></center><br><i>`Body of a male, 1.66 m. height, medium built, with complete rigor mortis, lividity well developed on the dependent parts, cloudy cornea and dilated pupils with very pale papebral conjunctive.</i><br><br><i>`Gunshot wounds: GSW no.1 measuring 10 x 10 mm. serrated edges, positive powder burns located at the left mid clavicular line, posterior, 2 inches below the shoulder.&nbsp; It was directed downward towards the mid-body, penetrating the skin.

Multiple Gunshot Wound(s) of the body.'</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant admitted shooting the victim but theorized that he acted in self-defense.&nbsp; As embodied in the Appellant's Brief, the defense version runs thus:<br><blockquote><i>"3.01 On June 23, 1994, at a little after five o'clock in the afternoon, appellant, together with two (2) other companions, entered the People's Restaurant in Baguio City to order drinks.&nbsp; They sat at a table next to another then occupied by Marcelino B. Florida, Jr. (`Florida') and a woman companion (TSN, Testimony of Augusto Loreto G. Ringor, Jr., May 4, 1995, pp. 3-6).</i><br><br><i>3.02 Soon after receiving their orders, appellant's companion, Ramon Fernandez, stood up and approached Florida to inquire about his (Fernandez') brother, Cesar.&nbsp; Florida angrily responded to the query and said, `Putang ina ninyo! anong pakialam ko diyan!'</i><br><br><i>3.03 A quarrel thereafter ensued between Fernandez and Florida prompting the appellant to intervene and pacify Fernandez.&nbsp; When Fernandez drew out a gun from his waist, appellant immediately seized the same directing his friend to leave the restaurant before he started hurting other people with his gun.&nbsp; No sooner had Fernandez stepped out, however, Florida, armed with a bolo, came charging in from the kitchen and headed towards the appellant.&nbsp; (Ibid, pp. 6 - 7)</i><br><br><i>3.04 Surprised, appellant shot Florida with the gun he was holding just as the latter was about to hit him with the bolo.&nbsp; Thereafter, appellant put the gun on the table and walked out of the restaurant. Once already outside the restaurant, appellant's other companion, Virgilio, followed him and handed to him the gun he (appellant) left at the table.&nbsp; He then proceeded to surrender the gun and report the incident at the nearest police station.&nbsp; (Ibid, pp. 8 - 9)</i><br><br><i>3.05 Before appellant could reach the police station, however, appellant was already arrested by off-duty policeman who brought him back to the People's Restaurant.&nbsp; Appellant was thereafter incarcerated at the Baguio City Police Station.&nbsp; (Ibid, pp. 10 - 12)"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>On November 13, 1995, the trial court handed down the decision under automatic review.&nbsp; Accused-appellant contends that:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>I</b></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE APPELLANT FOR SIMPLE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS AND SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE OF 17 YEARS AND 1 DAY AS MINIMUM TO 20 YEARS AS MAXIMUM.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF MURDER.<br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT SERIOUSLY ERRED IN SENTENCING THE ACCUSED TO DEATH ON THE GROUNDS THAT: (i) THE CHARGE OF MURDER WAS NOT PROVED BY THE PROSECUTION; AND (ii) ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY APPELLANT, THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE IS RECLUSION PERPETUA THERE BEING NO AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE THE PENALTY TO DEATH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Well-settled is the rule that in interposing self-defense, the offender admits authorship of the killing.&nbsp; The <i>onus probandi</i> is thus shifted to him to prove the elements of self-defense and that the killing was justified;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> otherwise, having admitted the killing, conviction is inescapable. Concomitantly, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>For self-defense to prosper, it must be established that: (1) there was unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) that the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression was reasonable; and (3) that there was lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, accused-appellant failed to prove the element of unlawful aggression.&nbsp; The allegation that the victim allegedly went out of the kitchen armed with a bolo, and was about to hack him (accused-appellant) who was then at an almost prone lying position on the table he was occupying,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> is a self-serving and unconvincing statement which did not in anyway constitute the requisite quantum of proof for unlawful aggression.&nbsp; Prosecution witness Fely Batanes, a waitress in the restaurant where the shooting incident occurred, was firm in her declaration that the victim was in the kitchen unarmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> hen the accused-appellant shot him.&nbsp; The victim had no weapon or bolo.&nbsp; He was neither threatening to attack nor in any manner manifesting any aggressive act which could have imperiled accused-appellant's safety and well-being.<br><br>No improper motive having been shown on the part of Fely Batanes to testify falsely against accused-appellant or to implicate him in the commission of the crime, the logical conclusion is that there was no such improper motive and her testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>What is more, the testimony of Fely Batanes is buttressed by the fact that immediately after the incident, the body of the victim was found lying in the kitchen and not outside; thus weakening further the theory of accused-appellant that he shot the victim while they were at the dining area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Then too, the nature, location and number of gunshot wounds inflicted on the deceased belie accused-appellant's theory of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The deceased sustained three gun shot wounds on the back and one in front.&nbsp; Dr. John Tinoyan, who conducted the autopsy on the cadaver of the victim, testified that the gunshot wound on the frontal portion of the victim's body showed a downward trajectory of the bullet on his chest, penetrating the liver, perforating the stomach down to the small intestine, and then lodged underneath the skin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Verily, such finding negates the claim of accused-appellant that he shot the victim while he was at an almost prone lying position and the victim was standing in front of him about to strike with a bolo.&nbsp; If this were true, the trajectory of the bullet should have been upward or better still, it should have been at the level at which the gun was fired while he (accused-appellant) was in a prone lying position.<br><br>Rather telling are the three gunshot wounds on the back of the victim, which wounds showed traces of gunpowder which, according to Dr. Tinoyan, indicated that the weapon used was at a distance of less than one meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Evidently, accused-appellant stealthily approached the victim from behind and fired at him six successive shots, four of which hit him, to ensure his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> If he shot the victim merely to defend himself, there would have been no cause for accused-appellant to pump several bullets into the body of the victim.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the imputation of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim cannot be believed.&nbsp; Absent the element of unlawful aggression by the deceased, there can be no self-defense, complete or incomplete.&nbsp; If there was no unlawful aggression, there was nothing to prevent or repel and the second and third requisites of self-defense would have no basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The Court <u><i>a quo</i></u> properly appreciated the aggravating circumstance of treachery which qualified the crime to murder.&nbsp; It was clearly established that the accused-appellant fired six successive shots on the victim, suddenly, without warning, and from behind, giving the victim no chance to flee or to prepare for his defense or to put up the least resistance to such sudden assault.&nbsp; There is treachery when the means, manner or method of attack employed by the offender offered no risk to himself from any defensive or retaliatory act which the victim might have taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>All things studiedly considered and viewed in proper perspective, the mind of the Court can rest easy on a finding that accused-appellant Augusto Loreto Ringor, Jr. is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, and did not act in self-defense.<br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, prescribes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death for the crime of murder.&nbsp; When, as in this case, neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance is attendant, the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>has to be applied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in accordance with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>With respect to the conviction of accused-appellant for illegal possession of firearms under P. D. No. 1866, it was held in the case of<b><i> People vs. Molina</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> nd reiterated in the recent case of <b><i>People vs. Ronaldo Valdez,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that in cases where murder or homicide is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, there can be no separate conviction for the crime of illegal possession of firearms under P.D. No. 1866 in view of the amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 8294.&nbsp; Thereunder, the use of unlicensed firearm in murder or homicide is simply considered as an aggravating circumstance in the murder or homicide and no longer as a separate offense.&nbsp; Furthermore, the penalty for illegal possession of firearms shall be imposed provided that no other crime is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In other words, where murder or homicide was committed, the penalty for illegal possession of firearms is no longer imposable since it becomes merely a special aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing, however, that the dismissal of the present case for illegal possession of firearm should not be misinterpreted to mean that there can no longer be any prosecution for the offense of illegal possession of firearms.&nbsp; In general, all pending cases involving illegal possession of firearms should continue to be prosecuted and tried if no other crimes expressly provided in R. A. No. 8294 are involved (murder or homicide, under Section 1, and rebellion, insurrection, sedition or attempted coup d' etat, under Section 3).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code, where the new law is favorable to the accused, it has to be applied retroactively.&nbsp; Thus, insofar as it spares accused-appellant a separate conviction for illegal possession of firearms, Republic Act No. 8294 has to be given retroactive application in Criminal Case No. 13100-R.<br><br>On the matter of the aggravating circumstance of "use of unlicensed firearm" in the commission of murder or homicide, the trial court erred in appreciating the same to qualify to death the penalty for the murder committed by accused-appellant.&nbsp; It should be noted that at the time accused-appellant perpetrated the offense, the unlicensed character of a firearm used in taking the life of another was not yet an aggravating circumstance in homicide or murder; to wit:<br><blockquote>"Neither is the second paragraph of Section 1 meant to punish homicide or murder with death if either crime is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, i.e., to consider such use merely as a <i>qualifying circumstance</i> and not as an offense. That could not have been the intention of the lawmaker because the term `penalty' in the subject provision is obviously meant to be the penalty for illegal possession of firearm and not the penalty for for homicide or murder.&nbsp; We explicitly stated in Tac-an:<br><blockquote><b><u>There is no law which renders the use of an unlicensed firearm as an aggravating circumstance in <i>homicide</i> <i>or</i> <i>murder. Under an information charging homicide or muder</i>, the fact that the death weapon was an unlicensed firearm <i>cannot</i> be used to increase the penalty for the second offense of homicide or murder to death</u></b><i> </i>(or<i> reclusion perpetua </i>under the 1987 Constitution)<i>.&nbsp; </i>The essential point is that the unlicensed character or condition of the instrument used in destroying human life or committing some other crime, is not included in the inventory of aggravating circumstances set out in Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote><b><u>A law may, of course, be enacted making <i>the use</i> <i>of an unlicensed firearm</i> as a qualifying circumstance.</u></b><b>'</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><b> </b>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, before R.A. No. 8294 (which took effect on July 6, 1997) made the use of unlicensed firearm as an aggravating circumstance in murder or homicide, the penalty for the murder committed by accused-appellant on June 23, 1994 was not death, as erroneously imposed by the trial court.&nbsp; There was yet no such aggravating circumstance of use of unlicensed firearm to raise the penalty for murder from <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, at the time of commission of the crime.<br><br>The amendatory law making the "use of an unlicensed firearm" as an aggravating circumstance in murder or homicide, cannot be applied here because the said provision of R.A. No. 8294 is not favorable to accused-appellant, lest it becomes an <i>ex post facto</i> law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision in Criminal Case No. 13102-R is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the modification that accused-appellant Augusto Loreto Ringor, Jr. is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; It is understood that the civil liabilities imposed below are <b>UPHELD</b>.<br><br>Criminal Case No. 13100-R instituted pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1866 is DISMISSED.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago,</i> and <i>De Leon Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman),</i> and <i>Panganiban, J.,</i> in the result.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Penned by Judge Ruben C.
