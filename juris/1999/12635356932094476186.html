				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The resolution of rape cases hinges on the credibility of the victim.

Ibay and respondent Razel G. Cordero were both residents of Barangay Better Living, Paranaque, Metro Manila, in a compound located at 149 Dona Soledad Avenue, where nine (9) other families have been residing in rooms or apartments. (TSN, January 27, 1997, p. 6; TSN, June 16, 1997, p. 2)<br><br>"The [appellant] resides in an apartment of his own, with his wife and two children at the far end of the compound. At the same time, he owns and operates a silk-screen printing shop for T-shirts which adjoins the apartment right in front. (TSN, May 14, 1997, pp. 17-18; Exhibit 14-3) His mother, Filipina D. Ibay, is the registered owner of the 324 square meter lot where the compound is located, and the main house thereon. She rents out some of the rooms in the main house. (TSN, May 14, 1997, pp. 3-6; Exhibit "12-1" &amp; "12-2")<br><br>"Accused-appellant is a man who believes and teaches the Bible as the Word of God, a good husband and [a] devoted father to his two little girls. He was hired as a lay pastor of the Campus Crusade for Christ in the Philippines, until he got married, when he needed to have more and a stable income for his family. (TSN, April 4, 1997, pp. 89, 45, 52 &amp; 53)<br><br>"He was peacefully engaged in raising a family, earning a living and serving the Lord Jesus Christ as a lay minister when he was all of a sudden implicated in the crime of rape. Where before, he was the man emulated in the compound and neighborhood for living a simple but fulfilling life, he was suddenly living a nightmare, thrown into jail with the criminals without any warning whatsoever. x x x He had respite from jail for 3 months, when the inquest officer recommended his release from prison, with the approval of the Provincial Prosecutor for the Province of Rizal. (Exhibit No. 23)<br><br><center>x x x x x x x x x</center><br>"The respondent Razel G. Cordero was occupying the only room on the ground floor of the main house, with her husband, Rolando B. Cordero, as lessee of [appellant]'s mother, Mrs. Filipina Ibay. (TSN, May 14, 1997, pp. 12 &amp; 15) They established residence in said place after their marriage on December 29, 1995 in Pinacbacdao, Western Samar. (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, pp. 5-7).<br><br>"Rolando B. Cordero, husband of private complainant, work[ed] as an insurance inspector [o]f an insurance company, xxx who always got home drunk between midnight and 2:00 a.m., sometimes later, during the entire nine (9) months of their marriage, according to the testimony of private complainant. (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, pp. 7&amp;8) On top of that, he also gambles. (TSN, June 16, 1997, pp. 39-40) Divorced from his first wife while in the United States, he came back to the Philippines and married private complainant (TSN, May 14, 1997, pp. 26 &amp; 27). He is the son of Atty. Nonito Cordero, who acted as one of the private prosecutors in this case.<br><br>"A dominant husband who was usually heard shouting at his wife who never answered back, Rolando Cordero hardly showed any regard or respect for his wife, and once even had a male officemate sleep with them in their small single bedroom. She seemed willing to submit to his every whim and caprice, and was even scared to venture out of her room. (TSN, May 14, 1997, pp. 27-30; May 21, 1997, pp. 13,14, 25-27-29, 32,33)<br><br>"The accused-[appellant] was arrested on October 8, 1996, while attending to his printshop business, at about 11:00 a.m., for the crime of rape allegedly committed midnight of October 4, 1996. The arrest was attended [by] an unusually big force, a composite force of three (3) policemen and several barangay tanods, without a warrant of arrest. While the arresting office testified that it was not an arrest, but merely an invitation to the police-precinct for the accused-[appellant] to answer some questions, the cross-examination showed that said police officer actually wanted to insure the arrest of [appellant], even stating that failing to make the arrest would be tiresome on his part. It is odd to note that the arresting [team] comes from the Kababayan Center No. 6 of Barangay Sun Valley, although they brought the accused-appellant to the Cops-in-the Block at Barangay Better Living. Rolando B. Cordero, husband of the private complainant led the group, and upon seeing the accused, [appellant] started throwing stones at him, who was taken completely by surprise. (TSN, Feb. 10, 1997, pp. 10, 22-25; TSN, April 16, 1997, p. 23). The [appellant] suffered a head wound that required 3 stitches as a result. The commotion that ensued made the arresting officer fire a warning shot in the air. However, another shot was pointed at the men working with accused-[appellant] as they moved towards him instinctively, in an attempt to come to his aid. The [appellant] was then forcibly taken to the Cops-in-the-Block, located at 92 Dona Soledad, Betterliving Subdivision, Paranaque, Metro Manila, and was not allowed even a chance to put on a shirt or slippers (TSN, June 16, 1997, pp. 9, 14-16; Exhibit "21-1"; April 16, 1997, pp. 19-22).<br><br>"At the Cops-in-the-Block, respondent Razel G. Cordero and her father-in-law, Atty. Nonito Cordero, were already there waiting for them to arrive. Then and there, the complaining witness was asked to identify the [appellant], which she did only after much hesitation on her part. It required the prodding of her husband, Rolando B. Cordero and her father-in-law, Nonito Cordero, as well as the investigating officer before she finally identified the [appellant] as the person who raped her (TSN, June 16, 1997, pp. 17 &amp; 18)<br><br>"Atty. Cordero tried to provide an explanation of the hesitation on the part of private complainant as resulting from fear of the [appellant], in the way of cross examination. (TSN June 16, 1997, p. 70) The actuation of the private complainant during the inquest hearing, however, after the confrontation at the Cops-in-the-Block, did not indicate such fear. On the contrary, the private complainant demonstrated the absence of any fear towards the accused-[appellant] when without any hesitation whatsoever, she squeezed herself in to sit beside the accused-[appellant] on the bench right in front of the inquest officer. The father-in-law , who represented her as counsel at the inquest, immediately sensing how this action of the private complainant raised eyebrows among those present in the hearing, brazenly and harshly pulled her out of the seat, and made her sit down beside him on the receiving chair beside the inquest officer's desk. (TSN, June 16, 1997, p. 30) x x x<br><br>"At the inquest hearing, Inquest Asst. Prosecutor Renato Garcia, definitely took note of the private complainant's actuation, and because of lack of any evidence other than her testimony, recommended the release of the accused-[appellant] from custody, pending preliminary investigation, and which recommendation was concurred in by the Provincial Prosecutor for the Province of Rizal. (Exhibits `23', `23-1' &amp; `24')<br><br>"Aggrieved by the decision of the Inquest Officer, complaining-witness, Razel Cordero, with counsel Atty. Nonito Cordero, through an affidavit, asked the Inquest Officer to inhibit himself from conducting the preliminary investigation. In deference to this request the Inquest Officer, Hon. Renato Garcia inhibited himself from continuing with the preliminary investigation that he set, after which, the case was reassigned to Hon. Elizabeth Yu-Guray, 2nd Assistant Prosecutor.<br><br>"The preliminary investigation was conducted with the defense using the date stated in the "Sinumpaang Salaysay" (Sworn Statement) by the private complainant, i.e. midnight of 5 October 1996. (Exhibits 1 &amp; 1-A) Consequently, the facts and circumstances in this investigation based on said particular date and hour were completely different from the facts and circumstances obtaining on the midnight of 4 October 1996. And this was the date, subsequently clarified to be the date of the alleged rape, in the direct testimony of the private complainant, during the trial of the case. (TSN, Jan. 27, 1997, p. 9). Even the Resolution of the Investigating Prosecutor stated: `Complainant, a 22 year old housewife, alleged tha[t] on October 5, 1996; at about midnight ...`(Resolution, 2nd paragraph) and which was the basis upon which the complaint was investigated. It is evidence that there was misapprehension of facts during the preliminary investigation, to the detriment of accused-appellant.<br><br>"With the Resolution of the Investigating Fiscal approved by the Provincial Fiscal, the complaint was then filed, on the basis of which the Warrant of Arrest was issued. A personal appeal made to the Hon. Presiding Judge of the Lower Court to defer the issuance of the warrant of arrest pending appeal of the Resolution indicting [a]ccused-[a]ppellant xxx [to the Department of Justice] proved of no avail. However, a speedy trial was promised. Soon after the warrant of arrest was signed by the respondent Hon. Presiding Judge of Branch 259, of the Regional Trial Court of Paranaque, the [a]ccused-[a]ppellant readily presented xxx himself to the Hon. Court, in accordance with a commitment made earlier."</blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The trial court relied heavily, in fact almost entirely, on the complainant's testimony. Contrasting this with the appellant's evidence, it held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>"1. It is indeed difficult for the complainant to prove an accusation of rape particularly in the case at bar where the only evidence that she has presented was her testimony of alleged depredation. There [was] no other direct or circumstantial evidence showing that accused Jaime Ibay committed the crime of rape. There were no injuries, no mutilation, not even a torn undergarment. There was no commotion, no sign of any struggle and no deadly weapon was introduced as evidence to prove the alleged intimidation. There was only silence when the alleged incident happened in the wee hours of October 5, 1996. Complainant Razel Cordero did not scream. She did not shout for help and nobody heard her crying and sobbing while she squatted in pain on the cement floor of her small bedroom for several hours while waiting for her drunkard of a husband.<br><br>"In contrast, accused Jaime Ibay presented an array of witnesses for his defense, including his wife Astrid Payumo Ibay, his mother Filipina Ibay, his brother Danilo Ibay and a coterie of his own employees and friends belonging to their religious congregation. In sum, they portrayed accused Jaime Ibay as a good and religious man and that he and his wife attended the birthday celebration of Marita San Diego at the latter's house in Hungary Street, Betterliving Subd., which [was] about five minutes driving distance from the house of the accused in Doña Soledad, also in Betterliving. These witnesses particularly Astrid Ibay, testified that accused Jaime Ibay was in the house by 12:30 a.m. of October 5, 1996, thus implying that he could not have possibly committed the crime of rape as alleged by victim Razel Cordero."</blockquote>In upholding complainant's testimony and rejecting appellant's alibi, the trial court ruled:<sup> </sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote>"Throughout the trial, the Court carefully observed the demeanor and reactions of both the victim and the accused, hoping perhaps to see [from] the glimmer of the their eyes and their facial expressions any clue or sign of who could be telling the truth. In the drama that unfolded with the presentation of their respective versions of the incident, Razel cried in pain in recalling her [ordeal] at the hands of her attacker, while Jaime the accused maintained his composure, nay even chin up as if telling the whole world that he was not guilty, that he did not do it. Occasionally, there would be some outburst of anger especially from Astrid, the wife of the accused on one hand and the subdued anguish on the part of Rolando Cordero, husband of the victim on the other hand.<br><br>"But Razel seated herself quietly but obviously tormented throughout the proceedings except when she testified on how she was ravished mercilessly by the [attacker].<br><br>"She cried and cried and it was at a certain point of the cross-examination when the court became convinced that she was speaking the truth and truly incapable of webbing any lie. In tears, Razel recalled that she squatted at the corner of her [cemented] bedroom xxx floor for several hours after she was raped. She was completely devastated and if only her drunkard husband had arrived earlier instead of coming home at about 5:00 in the morning of October 5, he would have surely seen the pathetic and spiritually exhausted Ra[zel].<br><br>"No, Ra[z]el could not have been mistaken about the identity of Jaime Ibay as her attacker. She recognized his voice. She saw him quite clearly leaving the place after she was raped. There was never any indication of doubt that Jaime Ibay was her attacker when she testified and pointed to Jaime Ibay as the culprit. Such positive identification cannot be overcome by the denial and defense of alibi interposed by accused Jaime Ibay.<br><br>"Ra[z]el testified that she was raped at about 12:00 in the morning of October 5, 1996. She did not categorically state however, the exact time when she was raped between 12:00 midnight to anywhere before 1:00 a.m. of October 5, 1996. It should also be noted that the attack happened in a short period of time as it took only about two minutes for him to satisfy his lust. Ibay therefore had the time and opportunity to commit the crime from the time that he and his wife arrived allegedly at about 12:30 a.m. of October 5, 1996 up to the time that he went to sleep with his wife Astrid.<br><br>"On the contentions of the defense that there was no rape committed because of the medical findings that there were no evident signs of extragenital physical injury noted on the body of the victim at the time of the examination and that no knife allegedly used in threatening Ra[zel] was ever produced or presented in court, it can only be said that rape victims usually cower in fear at the mere sight of dangerous weapons more so in the case at bar where the knife was immediately poked at her and naturally she became submissive and less resistant to the attack. And certainly, there will be no signs of extragenital physical injury considering that the examination was conducted several days after the rape and considering further that the victim is a housewife who had long lost her maidenhood.<br><br>"On the motive of the complainant as theorized by the defense that the claim of rape was made to cover up acts of indiscretion on her part, suffice it to say that no other motive can be ascribed to complainant in filing the rape charge except that of a desire for justice and redress for a despicable wrong inflicted and that no decent Filipina would publicly admit that she had been raped unless that is the truth.<br><br>"On the alleged violation of the [c]onstitutional rights of the accused, it should be stressed that counsel for the accused himself manifested that said accused voluntarily surrendered after the warrant of arrest was issued by the Court. Such voluntary surrender can therefore be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance under Art. 13 of the Revised Penal Code."</blockquote><center><b><u>The Alleged Errors</u></b></center><br>Appellant ascribes the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote>"1. The trial court erred in convicting the accused-appellant as [the] prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>"2. The lower court gravely erred in convicting the accused without taking into account the alibi which was fully supported by testimonial and documentary evidence, as against the weak evidence of the prosecution.<br><br>"3. The lower court gravely erred in denying the motion for reconsideration, citing an ocular inspection supposedly conducted by the investigating fiscal, evidence of which was never presented during the hearing, clearly showing a bias in favor of complainant-appellee.<br><br>"4. The lower court gravely erred in convicting the accused who was prejudiced because of unreasonable bias that [was] clearly evident during the trial of the case.<br><br>"5. The lower court gravely erred in awarding moral and exemplary damages not supported by any evidence, fact or law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>In essence, this case will turn on two points: (1) credibility of the witnesses and (2) sufficiency of the prosecution evidence.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br><center><b><u>First Issue:<br><br><i>Credibility of Witnesses</i></u></b></center><br>In prosecutions for rape, the testimony of the victim is generally scrutinized with great caution, for the crime is usually known only to her and the rapist. Indeed, it is well-settled that conviction always rests on the strength of the evidence of the state, never on the weakness of the defense.<sup> </sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The foregoing rule finds application in the present case, for the prosecution relied mainly on the testimony of Complainant Razel Cordero. Its other witnesses testified on matters pertaining to what happened after the alleged rape: Dr. Erlina M. Marfil and Brenda Tablizo testified on their analysis of the alleged victim's psychological make-up; P/Chief Insp. Mario dela Vega and SPO2 Angel Nieves testified on the circumstances surrounding appellant's apprehension; and Renato C. Bautista testified on the results of Cordero's physical examination.

She admitted that the room was dark and she was asleep when he entered the room; in fact, in her stupor she thought that he was her husband. She allegedly realized that something was amiss, only when the rapist forced himself on her with the use of a knife which she likewise did not see, but which she felt pressed to her chin.<br><br>The assertion of complainant that she recognized appellant's voice during the rape could not be given full faith and credence. The evidence on record shows that her room was adjacent to her neighbor's; hence, the culprit must have spoken in a hushed, menacing tone -- one not used in normal, everyday conversation -- for to have done otherwise would have attracted unwanted attention. She and appellant had maintained their distance from each other; indeed, Cordero even testified that she kept to herself most of the time, opting to stay inside the rented room she shared with her husband, rather than mingle with her neighbors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, it cannot be said that they were familiar with the nuances of each other's voice.<br><br>Likewise, Cordero's claim of having seen the appellant through her window after the rape is belied by the evidence on hand. The sketch<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><sup> </sup><sup> </sup>of complainant's room presented in court shows that the bed and the window were located on opposite sides, and that a long wooden table and a washing machine were placed against the wall where the window was located. Moreover, the lower part of the curtained window was wrapped in aluminum foil,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and it would have been difficult for Cordero to look through such window. In other words, given these circumstances she could not have seen her rapist clearly, at least not clearly enough to recognize him.<br><br>Considering the foregoing and the fact that the room of the Cordero spouses was beside the passageway of the compound, we cannot find any logical explanation why appellant, whose room was just a few feet away from Cordero's,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> would linger in the corridor and risk being seen.<br><br><sup>Dubious Narration of Rape</sup><br><br>Cordero's dubious account of how the rape occurred likewise detracts from her credibility.

Cordero's account, although seemingly detailed and cohesive, is implausible. The supposed simultaneous actions of appellant are hard to believe; worse, she maintained that he was also holding a knife all the while. Complainant's account also reveals that she had several opportunities to shout for help and, if she did, someone could have come to her rescue considering the location of her room; according to her, however, she never cried out.<br><br><b><i><u>Questionable Behavior<br>of Complainant</u></i></b><br><br>The Court also finds it odd that even after complainant had supposedly sobbed and sulked for four hours after the rape, her husband did not notice any telltale signs of anguish. Stranger still is the fact that for three days, she acted as if nothing had happened. She said that on the morning of October 5, 1996, she woke up at 12:00 noon, cooked lunch, ate with her husband, and stayed in their room the whole day watching television until she arose to cook dinner. The following day, neighbors even saw her washing dirty clothes in the laundry area located near appellant's print shop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> True, she should not be expected to act in a particular manner, for after all, people react differently to a given situation; still, we cannot help but be bewildered that she would embrace normalcy so quickly after a supposedly harrowing incident.<br><br>Cordero alleges that she had to tell her husband about the rape to explain her refusal to have intercourse with him on the night of October 8, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> However, the records show that she filed her Complaint in the afternoon of the same day. While this discrepancy may be viewed as insignificant, it fits the pattern of inconsistency and improbability in her accusation of rape against the appellant.<br><br><b><center><u>Second Issue:<br><br><i>Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</i></u></center></b><br>It is a legal truism that in criminal prosecutions, the State has the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. It has to prove the identity of the accused as the malefactor, as well as the fact of the commission of the crime for which he is alleged to be responsible. The importance of this doctrine was underscored in <i>People v. Galera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in which we held:<br><blockquote>"A significant, if not perhaps the primordial concern in the criminal prosecution of an accused is the correct identification of the author of the crime and the other, of course, would be the actuality of the commission of the offense in which he is shown to be responsible or has participated. The guilt of the accused must be proved by the State beyond reasonable doubt, on the strength of its evidence and without solace from the weakness of the defense. Thus, even if certain inculpatory facts appear imputable to the offender, the same are inconsequential if, in the first place, the prosecution fails to discharge the onus on his identity and culpability. The constitutional presumption of innocence dictates that it is for the prosecution to demonstrate the guilt, and not for the indictee to establish innocence.<br><br>"xxx to be sure, an accused may be convicted even on the basis of the testimony of one witness; the rule, however, is subject to the <i>conditio precedens</i> that such testimony is credible, natural and convincing, and otherwise consistent with human nature and the course of things. In order to suffice for conviction, her testimony must be free of serious contradiction, and ring true throughout. In the assessment of the testimonial credit of the wronged woman, evidence of her conduct immediately after the alleged assault is of critical value."</blockquote>Because the prosecution was not able to prove its case sufficiently, appellant's alibi assumes importance. Thus, even though the witnesses he presented were related to him, it cannot be denied that their testimonies were consistent, cohesive and, more important, believable.<br><br>That Cordero did not seem to have any ill motive in accusing appellant of rape does not negate the fact that her testimony did not prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Even granting that she was indeed raped, the identity of her rapist was not sufficiently established. Consequently, appellant must be acquitted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque is hereby <i>REVERSED </i>and <i>SET ASIDE.</i> On reasonable doubt, Appellant Jaime D.
