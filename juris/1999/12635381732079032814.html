Hence, this will be the subject matter of evidence in Court;<br><br>"7.- The one year period allowed by law within which the delinquent borrowers should have exercised their right to redeem expired without any redemption by them. Consequently, on March 24, 1980 the bank consolidated its title on the property and became the registered owner of said property under TCT No. T-259923 issued by the Register of Deeds of Bulacan on March 24, 1980;<br><br>"8.- In September 24, 1980, defendant-Bank sold the property to the spouses Angel S.
