				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">It was a celebration which started with revelry and ended in tragedy. The fatalities were 13-year old Gerardo Valdez y Torres and 29-year old Perlita Ferrer y Mamorno. Accused of having killed the two victims was Cipriano De Vera, Sr., an uncle of Gerardo, who was charged in three separate informations, inclusive of a charge for illegal possession of firearm, hereinbelow recited:<br><br><u>In Criminal Case No. U-7809 -</u><br><blockquote>"That at past 12:00 o'clock midnight of December 31, 1993 and at dawn on the 1st day of January, 1994, or thereabouts, at barangay Cayambanan, municipality of Urdaneta, province of Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a firearm, with intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one Perlita Ferrer y Mamorno, inflicting upon the latter fatal wounds in the head, which directly caused her death, to the damage and prejudice of her heirs.<br><br>"Contrary to Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><u>In Criminal Case No. U-7810 -</u><br><blockquote>"That at dawn on the 1st day of January, 1994 and past 12:00 o'clock midnight of December 31, 1993, or thereabouts, at barangay Cayambanan, municipality of Urdaneta, province of Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, armed with a firearm, taking advantage of nighttime and the sporadic burst of firecrackers on New Year's day, with evident premeditation, treachery and deliberate intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot Gerardo Valdez y Torres, a 13-year old boy, inflicting upon him fatal wounds in the head, which directly caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.<br><br>"Contrary to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><u>In Criminal Case No. U-7811 -</u><br><blockquote>"That at dawn on the 1st day of January, 1994 and past 12:00 o'clock midnight of December 31, 1993, or thereabouts, at barangay Cayambanan, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, custody and control one (1) firearm with ammunitions without authority of law; which firearm he used in shooting Gerardo Valdez y Torres, a 13-year old boy, and Perlita Ferrer y Mamorno, on the above-cited date, time and place.<br><br>"That accused is indicted in two (2) separate Informations for the crime of Murder for the fatal shooting of Gerardo Valdez y Torres and Homicide for the fatal shooting of Perlita Ferrer y Mamorno, before this Honorable Court.<br><br>"Contrary to P.D.

Belen of the Regional Trial Court of Lingayen, Pangasinan, Branch 38, found the accused guilty as charged and so sentenced him, thusly:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, in the light of the considerations discussed above, the court hereby, renders judgment in the above-entitled cases as follows:<br><br>"In Criminal Cases Nos.

Minutes later, he was startled by a gunshot, followed by the falling body of his brother, Gerardo, to the ground. When he looked around, he saw the accused, whom he clearly recognized, holding a long-barreled gun, about one meter long, also locally known as "<i>sumpak</i>." The accused was about 8 to 9 meters away from him. Just as he started to assist his brother, Neil heard shouts, about 40 to 50 meters away, that Perlita was also dead ("<i>aynatay metten ni Perlita</i>"). He learned moments later that Perlita was shot on the left side of the forehead above the left eye. The accused tried to flee from the scene. Neil proceeded to give chase but he was not able to overtake the accused. He speculated that the shooting was an offshoot of the land dispute between his father and the accused.<br><br>Samuel Nicer testified that a few days before the incident, he saw the accused sporting a gun. Around midnight of 31 December 1993, he, together with Rodrigo Gallardo, Raffy Bustamante and some other friends, again chanced upon the accused holding the same one-meter long gun, which the latter, in fact, pointed at them. At about 12:10 a.m. of 01 January 1994, while on his way home, the witness saw the accused walking towards the east, in front of the Dominguez ricemill, still carrying his "<i>sumpak</i>."<br><br>Jesusa Valdez, sister of Gerardo, stated that at about 10:45 p.m. of 31 December 1993, she and Gerardo were invited by Mary Ann, daughter of the accused, to partake of the New Year's meal at the latter's house. While thereat, they were warned by the accused not to go out of their house that night because there would be a traitor (<i>judas</i>) in the vicinity. Later, at their own house, she was at the terrace watching Neil and Gerardo explode firecrackers when she saw the accused, then under a mango tree, shoot Gerardo, using a firearm about 2-1/2 feet long. While she went to succor her brother, she saw the accused going eastward. She attested to the existence of a feud between her father and the accused.<br><br>SPO1 Asterio Dismaya, a member of the Philippine National Police and duty investigator, said that their office received in the morning of 01 January 1994 a report on the shooting incident. He proceeded to Cayambanan, Urdaneta, with one Sgt. Reyes and conducted a "spot investigation." A sketch of the surroundings showed that the bullet traveled from the east to the west direction and that there was no obstruction between Gerardo and Perlita, the fence along the road being only about one meter high. The accused was fingered to be the culprit responsible for the shooting incident. The latter's wife told the police officers that the accused had already left for Manila at midnight of 31 December 1993. SPO1 Dismaya was later to learn that the accused had "surrendered" to Sgt. Prudencio Cawagan of the Urdaneta Police.<br><br>Dr. Ramon Gonzales, Jr., Rural Health Officer of Urdaneta, Pangasinan, declared having conducted an autopsy examination on 01 January 1994 and 03 January 1994, respectively, on the remains of Gerardo Valdez and Perlita Ferrer. Gerardo had sustained three gunshot wounds; <i>viz</i>: The first wound, on the right parietal region, behind the right ear, was rounded, about 8 mm. x 7 mm., directed inwards with a point of entry but no point of exit; the pellet was found on the muscle liner at the left temple of the victim. The second wound, 17 mm. x 12 mm., at the mid-parietal region, middle part of the lower neck just above the nape, also indicated a point of entry but no point of exit; the slug was found in the right occipital of the brain. The third wound, 15 mm. x 9 mm., in the mid-occipital region, at the back of the neck above the second wound, likewise had a point of entry and no point of exit; the slug was found in the cranial cavity. Dr. Gonzales testified that the distance between the first and second wounds was approximately two inches and about an inch between the second and third wounds. The first slug went through the brain and stopped at the left temple; the second went through the brain and caused bleeding; and the third penetrated the skull and entered the brain. According to him, all the wounds were fatal. The slugs were kept in his office since he was not asked to turn them over to the police. The autopsy on Perlita revealed that she had suffered a gunshot wound on the left eyebrow. It had a point of entry but no point of exit, and the slug was found at the right parietal lobe of the brain. The wound was fatal. He said that the slugs he recovered from Gerardo Valdez were similar to the slugs he recovered from Perlita Ferrer which he also kept in his office.<br><br>Angelita Ferrer, the mother of Perlita, upon learning that the latter had been shot, repaired at once to the hospital but Perlita had already expired by the time she arrived. At the time of her death, Perlita was 29 years old, single, and earning P8,000.00 a month as the manager of a restaurant in Quezon City. The witness said that she spent P16,995.00 for her daughter's night vigils and P15,000.00 for the funeral.<br><br>Dalia Ferrer stated that she and her sister Perlita were in Cayambanan for the New Year's celebration at the invitation of Julito De Vera. The house of Gerardo was about 40 to 50 meters from where her sister was standing when shot. Perlita was brought to the Sacred Heart Hospital where Neil Valdez informed her that the assailant was the accused.<br><br>Renato Valdez, the father of Gerardo, confirmed that he and the accused, a cousin, had a dispute over the land given to Renato's father by their grandfather of which the accused wanted a share. At about 12:05 in the morning of 01 January 1994, he was at the house of his friend Meni in Nancalabasaan, Urdaneta, when informed by his son Neil that Gerardo had been shot by the accused. He promptly proceeded to the Sacred Heart Hospital but he was unable to reach his son alive. He spent P2,375.30 for Gerardo's hospitalization, P4,200.00 for the vigil, P4,000.00 for the <i>lompos</i>, P3,000.00 for the tomb, P300.00 for the <i>lapida</i>, P200.00 for the church rites, P10.00 for the burial permit and P5,000.00 for the funeral expenses. Gerardo was in first year of high school when he died.<br><br><u>Evidence For the Defense.</u><br><br>Cipriano De Vera, Jr., a son of the accused, claimed that around 9:00 p.m. of 31 December 1993, he was on guard duty at the Iglesia ni Cristo Chapel in Cayambanan with Neil Valdez, Jovito Opinion and Julius De Vera. Neil left at around 10:00 p.m. after being informed that his brother Gerardo had been shot. Neil returned at 12:15 a.m. of 01 January 1994 and stayed with the group until 2:00 a.m. The witness said that Neil used to be a member of the church until he was expelled therefrom.<br><br>Glenda De Vera testified that on the eve of 31 December 1993, she celebrated the coming of the New Year with her family, relatives and some guests. It was her father, the accused, who prepared the food for them. Her father, as well as some of the visitors, left the house at around 10:00 p.m. When her father failed to return, her sister looked for him in Barangay Paurido where she was informed by relatives that he already had left for Manila. She testified that the accused had worked in Manila and would go home to Urdaneta only thrice a year. At around 1:00 a.m. of 01 January 1994, she learned that one of their neighbors had been hit by a stray bullet. When she and her sister Grace were informed that their father was being sought by the police, Grace went to Manila to apprise the accused about it. Her father was not able to return to Pangasinan immediately but later he "surrendered" to the police authorities.<br><br>Romeo Barcelona, a relative of the wife of the accused, stated that in the evening of 31 December 1993, at about 11:00 p.m., the accused was at their house in Barangay Paurido, where he helped prepare the food they would partake for the evening celebration. The accused finished cooking at 1:00 a.m. of 01 January 1994. After eating, they went to bed and woke up at around 6:00 a.m. Shortly thereafter, the accused left for Manila.<br><br>The accused, Cipriano De Vera, Sr., asserted that he arrived in Urdaneta from Manila on 27 December 1993. In the evening of 31 December 1993, he cooked the food for his family. After taking their supper at about 8:15 p.m., his children went to the Iglesia ni Cristo chapel while he departed for Barangay Paurido, Urdaneta, to cook for his cousin, Felicidad Barcelona. He arrived in Barangay Paurido at 10:30 p.m., celebrated with his relatives and there spent the night. He woke up at 6:00 a.m., and left for Manila after taking a bath and having his breakfast. He arrived in Manila in the afternoon of 01 January 1994 and proceeded to work the next day. When he returned from his work that day, he was surprised to find his daughter, Grace, who went to see him about a pending warrant for his arrest. He was able to return to Urdaneta only on 06 January 1994. After attending a religious service at the Iglesia ni Cristo chapel, he proceeded to Barangay Paurido. He went to the Urdaneta police station on 08 January 1994 to inquire about a warrant of arrest issued against him on a pending rape charge but he was promptly put to jail.<br><br>The accused sought to discredit the testimony of Neil Valdez and surmised that the latter had testified against him for his having given previously a warning against Neil's visits to his daughter and also because the Valdez family would want him to vacate the lot which he and his family were occupying. On the other hand, prosecution witness Samuel Nicer, the accused claimed, also held grudges against him (the accused). Nicer suspected that Glenda and Grace, daughters of the accused, to be the persons responsible for the expulsion of Nicer from the Iglesia ni Cristo.<br><br>Neil Valdez and Samuel Nicer were presented on rebuttal. Neil said that neither Cipriano De Vera, Jr., nor the accused was a member of the Iglesia ni Cristo, either in Cayambanan or in Nancalabasaan, Urdaneta. Nicer, for his part, denied having been expelled from the Iglesia ni Cristo. Also presented at the witness stand was Isagani Pagaduan, Cayambanan Secretary of the Iglesia Ni Cristo from 1985 to 1993 who attested that Neil Valdez had never been expelled from the church. He also declared that on 31 December 1993, Neil Valdez stayed at the Iglesia ni Cristo chapel only until 10:00 p.m., and that the latter did not come back that night after leaving the place.<br><br>As aforesaid, the court <i>a quo</i>, presided over by Judge Antonio M. Belen, found for the prosecution and convicted the accused. Forthwith, the case was elevated to this Court for automatic review pursuant to Republic Act No. 7659 on account of the imposition by the trial court of the death penalty.<br><br>In challenging the decision that has convicted him of all the charges, accused-appellant contends that -<br><blockquote>"I.

In this instance, the Court sees no justification to set aside the conclusions arrived at by the trial court and its holding that accused-appellant indeed is responsible for the death of the two victims.<br><br>Neil Valdez, testifying before the trial court, categorically pointed to the accused to be the perpetrator of the killings.

This assertion, however, was convincingly rebutted by Isagani Pagaduan, a former secretary of the Iglesia ni Cristo, who attested to the fact that Neil had left the chapel at around 10:00 p.m. and never returned that evening.<br><br>The Court cannot look with favor at the <i>alibi</i> proffered by the accused for not only is it considered one of the weakest defenses, obviously due to its being capable of easy fabrication,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> but also because it may not prevail over witnesses' positive identification that points to him as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> At all events, for the defense of <i>alibi</i> to prosper, it is not enough that the accused can prove his being at another place at the time of its commission; it is likewise essential that he can show physical impossibility for him to be at the <i>locus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Appellant himself has averred that Paurido, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, is just about eight to nine kilometers away from Cayambanan, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, and could be reached by a tricycle in just about twenty to thirty minutes.<br><br>Neither can the Court agree with appellant that the witnesses for the prosecution have been goaded by improper motives in testifying against him. Nothing of substance has here been presented to convince the Court that the prosecution witnesses would deliberately lie, send the wrong man to jail or even to the gallows, and set the real malefactor scot-free.<br><br>The trial court has correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery against appellant. Treachery exists when the means of execution employed by the accused gives the victim no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate, and the means of execution are deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It has been amply shown in this instance that the victims have been totally unprepared for the sudden and unexpected attack. It is also evident that appellant has placed himself at a safe distance in firing at his victims, indeed hiding behind the noise and merriment of the New Year's celebration, to avoid any risk to himself and then to cover up his nefarious deed.<br><br>The contention of the defense that the trial court has erred in not appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in favor of appellant has no merit. The essence of voluntary surrender is spontaneity and the intent of the accused to give himself up and submit himself unconditionally to the authorities either because (1) he acknowledges his guilt, or (2) he would wish to save the State of having to itself effect his capture and arrest pertinent to the crime with which he is charged and in regard to which that mitigating circumstance is invoked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Voluntary surrender is not a mitigating circumstance where it appears that the purpose of the accused in going to the authorities is for an entirely different matter.<br><br>In the case at bar, appellant himself said that he had gone to the police station in Urdaneta merely to inquire about a warrant of arrest in connection with a pending case against him for rape.

The right to preliminary investigation, however, may be waived, and it will be deemed to have been waived by failing to invoke it prior to, or at least at the time of, the arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The question of whether there has been a preliminary investigation, or whether it has been properly conducted, should be interposed prior to the plea of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General is correct in contending that it would now be late in the day for appellant to raise the issue for the first time in this appeal before the Court.<br><br>Anent the allegation that appellant could not have been responsible likewise for the death of Perlita Ferrer, the Court agrees with the observations of the trial court that -<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">(1) </td><td width="95%">the slug extracted from the right parietal lobe of Perlita's brain is similar to the pellets extracted from the head of Gerardo;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(2) </td><td>the wounds sustained by the two victims were caused by gunshot and the ammunitions used are pellets, like the ones used in a shotgun;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(3)</td><td><p> Perlita was standing on the same line of direction as Gerardo when accused-appellant fired his <i>sumpak -</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>along with the fact that Perlita would appear to have fallen at just about the same time as Gerardo did after the shot was delivered, are circumstances that all point just to the contrary.<br><br>The trial court erred, however, in convicting appellant for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunitions. In People vs. Valdez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court, citing People vs. Molina<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and People vs. Feloteo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> held that there could be no separate conviction for Illegal Possession of Firearms under Presidential Decree No. 1866 in view of the amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 8294 and that the illegal possession of firearms should thenceforth be taken as an aggravating circumstance pursuant to Section 1 of the amendatory law. Nevertheless, the alleged use of an unlicensed firearm as a special aggravating circumstance in Criminal Case No. U-7809 and Criminal Case No. U-7810 would be improper. While it was established by the testimonies of Neil and Jesusa Valdez that appellant used a <i>sumpak</i> in shooting the victims, it was not equally established that appellant had no license to possess it. The fact that the firearm appeared to be a homemade gun or illegally manufactured would not dispense with the requirement of proof that it was unlicensed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Besides, Republic Act No. 8294 took effect only on 06 July 1997 and could only be given retroactive effect if favorable to the accused, such as in its application to Criminal Case No. U-7811, but not when it would aggravate the criminal liability of the accused.<br><br>Finally, appellant raises the issue of whether or not the trial court has acted rightly or has erred in convicting him for the complex crime of murder with homicide. Here, the Court finds for accused-appellant and quotes with approval the observation made by the Office of the Solicitor General, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>"The record of the case will show that three separate informations were filed against appellant, one for the murder of Gerardo Valdez, the second for homicide for the death of Perlita Ferrer, and the third for illegal possession of firearms. This Honorable Court has held that `while the trial court can hold a joint trial of two or more criminal cases and can render a consolidated decision, it cannot convict the accused of a complex crime consisting of the various crimes alleged on the two informations' (People vs. Legaspi, 246 SCRA 206, 213). Thus, appellant cannot be held liable for the complex crime of murder with homicide but should be held liable separately for these crimes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>In People vs. Legaspi,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> abovecited by the Solicitor General, the appellants were charged with two separate informations, one for double murder (Criminal Case No. C-28760 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[87]</span> and the other for violation of R.A. No. 6539 (Criminal Case No. C-28761 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[87]</span>). The Court there held:<br><blockquote>"x x x Their conviction can only be limited to the crime alleged or necessarily included in the allegations in the separate informations. What controls is the description of the offense, as alleged in the information (Santos vs. People, 181 SCRA 487 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1990]</span>). While the trial court can hold a joint trial of two or more criminal cases and can render a consolidated decision, it cannot convict the accused of a complex crime constitutive of the various crimes alleged in the two informations. Thus, the accused were deprived of their constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them (1987 Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 14<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span>)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>There is, nevertheless, a need to modify the award of damages awarded by the trial court to the heirs of the victims. In <b>People vs. Alberto Nullan</b>, <b>et al.</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court had occasion to restate the rules; <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>"With respect to damages, the recovery of actual damages must be premised upon competent proof and best evidence obtainable by the injured party showing the actual expenses incurred in connection with the death, wake or burial of the victim. Courts cannot simply assume that damages are sustained by the injured party, nor can it rely on speculation or guesswork in determining the fact and amount of damages. In the case at bench, the Court accepts as having been incurred the amount of P52,851.96 for doctor fees, hospital bills, funeral cremation, burial services and the cost of the tomb of the victim for which supporting receipts are on record. The alleged reasonable miscellaneous expenses of P40,000.00 are disallowed for not having been sufficiently proved. The actual damages awarded by the trial court should be thus reduced to only P52,851.96. Relative to the amount of damages for loss of earnings, the trial court has fixed the amount of P1,000,000.00 based on the victim's life expectancy of 65 years. This Court has consistently used the formula: [2/3 x (80 - age of victim at time of death)] in determining life expectancy. The victim in this case therefore can be said to have had a life expectancy of [2/3 x (80 - 46)] 23 years. The trial court has aptly estimated his annual income to be close to P120,000.00 from which amount should be deducted the necessary and incidental expenses which the victim would have incurred if he were alive, estimated at 50%, to about a balance of P60,000.00 net annual income. In computing the loss of earning capacity of the victim, several factors are considered besides the mathematical computation of annual income times life expectancy. Allowances are also made for circumstances which could reduce the computed life expectancy of the victim like the nature of his work, his lifestyle, age and state of health prior to his death, and the rate of loss sustained by the heirs of the victim. All taken, the sum of P1,000,000.00 for loss of earning capacity of the deceased victim awarded by the trial court must be increased to P1,380,000.00. The award of moral damages of P100,000.00 arising from the mental anguish suffered by the surviving spouse, Julie Gotanci, and testified to by her, is reasonable."</blockquote>Angelita Ferrer, mother of Perlita, said that she had spent a total of P31,995.00 for the vigil and funeral expenses of her daughter. The trial court awarded her the sum of P35,000.00. Only the amount of P15,000.00 for funeral expenses, however, was duly receipted. Renato Valdez, father of Gerardo, stated that the family had spent a total of P19,085.30 for Gerardo's wake and funeral. The trial court awarded him P20,285.00 but the receipted amount, however, totaled only P7,785.30. The awards made by the court <i>a quo</i> must thus be reduced correspondingly. Relative to the award of damages for loss of earning capacity to the heirs of Perlita Ferrer, using the formula in People vs. Nullan, the entitlement thereto should be modified by reducing it to the amount of P1,632,000.00 from P2,040,000.00. The award of moral damages by the trial court in favor of the heirs of Gerardo, being justified, can be sustained.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision, dated 20 April 1995, of the Regional Trial Court of Lingayen, Pangasinan, Branch 38, is MODIFIED thusly:<br><br><b>In Criminal Case No. U-7809</b>, accused-appellant Cipriano De Vera, Sr., is found GUILTY of Homicide for the death of Perlita Ferrer y Mamorno and is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate imprisonment term of from nine (9) years and one (1) day of <i>prison mayor</i> to fifteen (15) years and six (6) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> and ordered to pay the heirs of Perlita Ferrer y Mamorno civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> of P50,000.00, actual damages of P15,000.00, and P1,632,000.00 for loss of earning capacity.<br><br><b>In Criminal Case No. U-7810</b>, accused-appellant Cipriano De Vera, Sr., is found GUILTY of Murder for the death of Gerardo Valdez y Torres and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered to pay the heirs of Gerardo Valdez y Torres civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> of P50,000.00 and actual damages of P7,785.30.
