Accused John Doe was later on identified as one Raquel Vergara together with accused-appellant Honorio Cantere arrived on board a motorcycle at the basketball court.<br><br>Accused Vergara was armed with a .45 caliber pistol. Without provocation he fired his gun in the air. The spectators and basketball players scampered away. At that time Nogra was answering the call of nature. His back was thus turned towards the basketball court. Vergara stood behind Nogra and then shot the latter hitting him on the nape and on the left side of the chest. Roberto Nogra died on the spot.<br><br>Accused Vergara then left the scene on board the motorcycle being driven by accused-appellant Cantere.<br><br>The prosecution presented five (5) witnesses, to wit: Louie Arcega, Orlando Antonio, Eduardo Nogra, Dr. Dorio Gajardo, and Isabelita Nogra. The first three witnesses were present at the scene of the crime. Dr. Dario Gajardo is a medico-legal officer who attended to the deceased and confirmed the cause of death as well as the relative positions of the wounds of the victim. Isabelita Nogra, the mother of the victim, testified on the funeral expenses incurred by the family.<br><br>The defense denied the accusation and raised the defense of alibi. Aside from accused-appellant Honorio Cantere, four other witnesses were presented to corroborate his alibi, to wit: Amparo Padiernos, Rico Santillan, Milagros Cantere, and Maricel Cantere.<br><br>After the presentation of evidence, the trial court found the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and promulgated its decision on June 26, 1996, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, without any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and hereby sentences said accused to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of reclusion perpetua and to pay the heirs of the said deceased victim damages in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) [People vs. Jose Adriano y Vargas, G.R.

He alleged that he was at his residence at Ilang-Ilang St. in Barangay Amparo Capri, Novaliches, Quezon City the whole day of December 22, 1991. He also testified that he did not have any quarrel with the victim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that he had never owned a motorcycle and he does not know how to drive one;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that he does not know Raquel Vergara;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that he knows of no reason why the family of the victim identified him as the assailant of the victim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that he is a friend of the victim but they are not that close;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that the distance between Sinagtala, Barangay Bahay Toro and Barangay Amparo Capri is more or less fifty (50) kilometers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The following are the witnesses for the defense and their testimonies:<br><br>(a) Amparo Padiernos -- She is a neighbor of the accused-appellant. She testified that at about 11:00 o'clock in the morning of December 22, 1991 she saw Cantere pass by her house to go to the neighborhood bakery purportedly to buy bread;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that five minutes thereafter she saw him again when he passed by her house on his way home;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that Honorio Cantere does not own a motorcycle and that she had not seen him riding on one or driving one;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that she is not a close friend of Honorio Cantere and his family;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that she and the accused have been neighbors for nine years;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>(b) Rico Santillan -- He testified that while attending a cockfight he witnessed the shooting incident; that he saw a motorcycle with two persons, one went down and the other remained on the motorcycle; that the man who went down fired a shot upwards;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> that the victim Nogra ran away and the assailant gave chase;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that the unknown assailant was not able to catch Nogra so he fired his gun in the direction of the latter thereby hitting him;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that it was not accused Cantere who drove the motorcycle used by the unknown assailant to speed away from the scene of the crime;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> that he has known Cantere for about four years;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> that he did not tell his relatives in whose house he was living at the time what he witnessed on that morning of December 22, 1991;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> that it was his friend Lotlot who is the sister-in-law of the accused who told him about Honorio Cantere being the one accused of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>(c) Milagros Cantere -- She is the wife of the accused-appellant. She testified that on December 22, 1991 her husband was resting in their house as he was then not feeling well;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> that the only time her husband left the house was when he bought bread;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that her sister arrived at their house on that day between the hours of 11:00 to 12:00 o'clock in the morning looking for her husband (appellant Cantere);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that she and her husband do not own a motorcycle;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that her husband does not know how to drive a motorcycle;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> that her family and the family of Boy Nogra do not have any ill-feeling towards each other<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> even after Boy Nogra died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>(d) Maricel Cantere -- She is the daughter of the accused. She corroborated the testimony of her mother, Milagros Cantere as to the whereabouts of her father on December 22, 1991; that they do not own a motorcycle and that her father does not know how to drive one. She further testified that her auntie Lotlot came to their house asking if her father went out of the house because somebody was killed at Sinagtala, Barangay Bahay Toro<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and that her father was a suspect in that killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>After a thorough evaluation and scrutiny of the evidence on record, we arrived at the conclusion that the guilt of the accused-appellant was established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The alibi offered by the accused-appellant, does not deserve credence. To be believed, alibi must be supported by the most convincing evidence as it is an inherently weak though paradoxically volatile, if allowed to go unchecked, human argument that can be easily fabricated to suit the ends of those who seek its recourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>We find that the alibi resorted to by the appellant is worthless in the face of his being positively identified by the prosecution witnesses. These prosecution witnesses have not been found to have any reason or motive to falsely testify. Their testimonies, according to the trial judge who heard them, were clear, positive, straightforward and devoid of signs of artificiality, leaving no doubt in the mind of this Court as to their veracity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In the light of the positive identification by the witnesses who have no motive to falsely testify, accused-appellant's alibi and denial are rendered worthless.<br><br>Furthermore, the court looks with caution upon the defense of alibi especially when it is corroborated mainly by relatives and friends of the accused for alibis are so easy to fabricate and concoct. This Court in the case of <b><i>People vs. Jerez,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><b><i> </i></b>has had the occasion to rule that:<br><blockquote>"Where an accused's alibi is established only by himself, his relatives and friends, his denial of culpability should be accorded the strictest scrutiny - they are necessarily suspect and cannot prevail over the testimonies of the more credible witnesses for the prosecution."</blockquote>Also, for the defense of alibi to prosper, it does not suffice to prove the whereabouts of the accused at the time the crime was committed; he must prove, not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus delicti</i> or within its immediate vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the appellant testified that he was at home at the time of the incident. His home in Barangay Amparo Capri in Novaliches is about ten (10) kilometers from Sinagtala, Barangay Bahay Toro, the scene of the crime or an hour's drive away by public transport. We find that no physical impossibility exists for accused-appellant Honorio Cantere to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<br><br>It is noteworthy to stress anew that positive identification was made by the prosecution's witnesses squarely placing accused-appellant at the scene of the crime as the driver of the motorcycle which borne the man who gunned down Roberto Nogra. These witnesses could not have been mistaken because they had known the accused-appellant for a number of years.<br><br>We affirm the trial court in ruling that conspiracy existed between Honorio Cantere and the gunman identified as one Raquel Vergara in the commission of the crime. This was shown when accused-appellant took the gunman to the basketball court at Sinagtala, Barangay Bahay Toro, waited until the latter had shot the victim and thereafter left with the gunman Vergara. Such concerted action indubitably established conspiracy in this case.<br><br>It is a well-settled rule that conspiracy need not be shown by direct proof of an agreement by the parties to commit the crime. The conduct of the malefactors before, during or after the commission of the crime is sufficient to prove their conspiracy. Once proved, the act of one becomes the act of all. All shall be answerable as co-principals regardless of the extent or degree of their participation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Bellosillo, (Chairman), Puno, Mendoza,</i> and <i>Quisumbing, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Orig.
