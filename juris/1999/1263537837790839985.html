Lacson downgraded to mere accessory-after-the-fact the case is now without a principal accused with the requisite rank and salary grade that would confer on the Sandiganbayan the jurisdictional requirement to try the said case.<br><br>"In the Order dated March 14, 1996, the Sandiganbayan resolved to consider the jurisdictional issue submitted for decision. On March 26, 1996, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 121-96, respondent Justices Garchitorena and De Leon were designated Special Members of the three-man Second Division composed of Justices Balajadia, Demetriou and Lagman, for purposes of Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057.

The amendatory bill sought among others to delete the word "principal" from the phrase "principal accused" in Section 4 of the old law so that offenses involving any high-ranking official, regardless of the extent of his participation in the crime charged, whether as principal, accomplice or accessory would fall within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>"On September 26, 1996, a counterpart bill was filed before the Senate by Senator Raul Roco as Chairman of the Senate's Committee on Justice and Human Rights.

Garchitorena who filed a Motion to Dismiss Petition as Against Justice Sabino R. de Leon which in essence sought his exclusion as respondent and exemption from participation in any further proceedings in this case. This was concurred in by no less than the complainant himself, who, in his Comment, <i>motu proprio</i>, dated September 1, 1997 asserted that he has no objection thereto and in fact joins in moving to dismiss the petition as against respondent Justice Sabino R. de Leon Jr. Complainant further reaffirmed his position on the matter in his required Comment dated October 7, 1997 substantially reiterating and confirming his non-objection to the aforesaid motion.<br><br>"The failure of respondent Justice de Leon to file a Rejoinder to complainant's Reply does not warrant any administrative/disciplinary sanction as it is clear under the circumstances that he was not furnished a copy of said Reply upon which such Rejoinder should be based. Moreover, the need for such Rejoinder on the part of respondent Justice de Leon may not find any practical or useful purpose anymore, considering that the complainant had already acquiesced to the motion dismissing the case against Justice de Leon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>Having disposed of the foregoing incidents, we now pass upon the questions raised by complainant which may be reduced to the primordial issue of whether or not the respondent Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice is administratively liable for having long deferred action on the motion for reconsideration of the Resolution dated May 8, 1996 admitting the amended information and delaying the transfer of Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057 to the RTC of Quezon City.<br><br>In sum, complainant invokes this Court's disciplinary authority over the respondent Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice praying that he be held accountable for having `tarried overlong' in resolving the motions for reconsideration and for `stonewalling' Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057 in violation of: 1.] Section 7, P.D. No. 1606; 2.] Rule VIII of the Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan; 3.] Rules 1.02, 2.01, 3.01 and 3.05 of the Canons of Judicial Conduct. Complainant also faults the respondents with gross misconduct for `knowingly and deliberately delaying' the transfer of the said criminal cases to the RTC of Quezon City.<br><br>The imputation of administrative culpability insofar as the first three (3) charges are concerned is well-taken.<br><br>Section 7, P. D. No. 1606 provides, among others, that:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. <i>Form, finality and enforcement of decisions. - </i>Decisions and final orders of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> shall contain complete findings of facts on all issues properly raised before it.<br><br>"A petition for reconsideration of any final order or decision may be filed within fifteen (15) days from promulgation or notice of the final order or judgment, and such petition for reconsideration <i>shall be decided within thirty (30) days from submission thereof. </i> xxx"</blockquote>Similarly, Rule VIII of the Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan states that -<br><blockquote>"Within fifteen (15) days from the promulgation or notice of a judgment or final order of a division of the Sandiganbayan, unless said judgment or order had in the meantime otherwise attained finality, a motion for new trial or reconsideration thereof may be filed upon the grounds, in the form and subject to the requirements, for motions for new trial in criminal cases under Rule 121 of the Rules of Court, and <i>such petition for reconsideration shall be decided within thirty (30) days from submission thereof." </i>(Italics provided)</blockquote>Rules 1.02 of Canon 1 and 3.05 of Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct state in no uncertain terms that -<br><blockquote>"Rule 1.02. - A judge should administer justice impartially and <i>without delay."</i><br><br>"Rule 3.05. - A judge shall dispose of the court's business <i>promptly </i>and decide cases <i>within the required periods."</i></blockquote>The Court has not, likewise, been remiss in laying down administrative guidelines to ensure that the mandates on the prompt disposition of judicial business are complied with. Thus, SC Administrative Circular No. 13-87 states, <i>inter alia, </i>that:<br><br><center>"xxx xxx xxx.</center><blockquote>"The reorganized judiciary is tasked with the tremendous responsibility of assisting parties litigants in obtaining [a] just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their cases and proceedings as directed in Rule 1, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Delay is a recurring complaint of every litigant.

XVIII of the 1987 Constitution mandating the adoption of a systematic plan to expedite the decision or resolution of cases or matters pending in the Supreme Court and the lower courts prior to the effectivity of the Constitution on February 2, 1987, the following directives must be complied with strictly by all concerned.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx xxx</center><br>6. <i>Motions and Other Interlocutory Matters.</i><br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx xxx</center><br>6.1 All Presiding Judges must endeavor to <i>act promptly</i> on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts. xxx"</blockquote>The Court in a litany of cases has reminded members of the bench that the unreasonable delay of a judge in resolving a pending incident is a violation of the norms of judicial conduct and constitutes a ground for administrative sanction against the defaulting magistrate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Verily, this Court has consistently impressed upon judges the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously on the principle that justice delayed is justice denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Delay in the disposition of cases erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary, lowers its standards and brings it into disrepute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the fact that respondent tarried too long in acting on the motions for reconsideration hardly becomes open to question, considering that the subject motions remained pending for <i>almost ten (10) months</i> despite several pleas made for the early resolution thereof. The ten-month hiatus becomes even more glaring when viewed <i>vis-Ã -vis </i>the fact that the Sandiganbayan's Second Division came out with the assailed thirty-page May 8, 1996 Resolution in less than two (2) months from submission thereof, indeed after barely six (6) weeks from the time respondent Justices Garchitorena and de Leon were designated Special Members of the said Division to complete the five-man composition thereof.<br><br>Once again we reiterate that tired old legal maxim, justice delayed is justice denied. It need not be overemphasized that this oft-repeated adage requires the expeditious resolution of disputes much more so in criminal cases where an accused is constitutionally guaranteed the right to a speedy trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>, which, as defined is one "[c]onducted according to the law of criminal procedure and the rules and regulations, free from vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The primordial purpose of this constitutional right is to prevent the oppression of the accused by delaying criminal prosecution for an indefinite period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It, likewise, is intended to prevent delays in the administration of justice by requiring judicial tribunals to proceed with reasonable dispatch in the trial of criminal prosecutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Delay in the disposition of cases undermines the people's faith in the judiciary. Hence, magistrates are enjoined to decide cases with dispatch. Their failure to do so constitutes gross inefficiency and warrants the imposition of administrative sanctions on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Indeed -<br><blockquote>"Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to dispose of their court business promptly and <i>within the periods prescribed by law or the rules. </i>It needs hardly be said that delays in court undermine the people's faith and confidence in the judiciary and bring it into disrepute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>All told, we find respondent's delay in resolving the motions inexcusable and the same can not be condoned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Justices and judges alike, being paradigms of justice, have been exhorted time and again to dispose of the court's business promptly and to decide cases within the required periods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Delay not only results in undermining the people's faith in the judiciary from whom the prompt hearing of their supplications is anticipated and expected; it also reinforces in the mind of the litigants the impression that the wheels of justice grind ever so slowly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>While indeed, respondent is administratively culpable for unreasonable delay in acting on the subject motions for reconsiderations, this however does not amount to gross or serious misconduct.<br><br>Misconduct is defined as any unlawful conduct on the part of a person concerned in the administration of justice prejudicial to the rights of parties or to the right determination of the cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It generally means wrongful, improper or unlawful conduct motivated by a premeditated, obstinate or intentional purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The term, however, does not necessarily imply corruption or criminal intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> On the other hand, the term "gross" connotes something "out of all measure; beyond allowance; not to be excused; flagrant; shameful".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>For administrative liability to attach it must be established that the respondent was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred or some other like motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As defined -<br><blockquote>"Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill-will; it partakes of the nature of fraud (Spiegel v. Beacon Participation<i>, </i>8 NE 2nd Series, 895, 1007). It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill will for ulterior purposes (Air France v. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155, 166-167). Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>A circumspect scrutiny of the record fails to show that respondent was moved by ill will in delaying his action on the motions for reconsideration. Complainant has not presented convincing proof to show that bad faith attended the delay. Bad faith is not presumed and he who alleges the same has the onus of proving it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>There is no showing that respondent deferred acting on the motions in bad faith or with a conscious and deliberate intent to perpetrate an injustice..<br><br>It must be pointed out that the participation of respondent Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice in the controversy involving the so-called <i>Kuratong Baleleng </i>cases was only because of the lack of unanimity in the proposed amendment by the prosecution of the Information therein. The issues then were whether or not the amendment of the Information which resulted in the downgrading of the liability of accused Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson (from being a principal to being merely an accessory) was correct and whether or not that was an issue which was reviewable by the Sandiganbayan or one which was within the exclusive domain of the prosecution at any time before the arraignment.<br><br>Respondent Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Francis E. Garchitorena and Associate Justice Jose S. Balajadia had dissented from the majority opinion arguing that the downgrading of the liability of Lacson was not appropriate and that the Sandiganbayan had the authority to pass upon the question before admitting the amended Information. In the motion to reconsider the resolution, the issues were broadened to those flowing from the original postulates raised herein. The participation of respondent Presiding Justice Garchitorena, however, remained the same: <i>i.e.</i> he and Justice Sabino R. de Leon, Jr. were to participate in the cases only as additional members to resolve the impasse created by Justice Balajadia's dissent which respondent Presiding Justice joined in a separate opinion. Upon the resolution of the motion for reconsideration, respondent and Justice de Leon would have nothing further to do with these cases. The proceedings, even if the cases were to remain with the Sandiganbayan, would proceed with the regular members of the Second Division which does not include respondent Presiding Justice.<br><br>Thus, no benefit or gain would accrue to respondent whether the Sandiganbayan retained jurisdiction over the cases or not. Conversely, if the cases were to be remanded to the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, no prejudice would befall respondent. Likewise no lawful benefit would accrue to complainant nor to any of the other accused. Succinctly stated, retaining the case with the Sandiganbayan by allegedly waiting for the passage of R.A. No. 8249 into law would neither prejudice complainant Canson or his co-accused, nor would it benefit the Sandiganbayan. If at all, complainant's obvious eagerness and insistence to have the cases transferred from the Sandiganbayan to the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City only raises the suspicion that his preference to have said cases tried in the latter court stems from dubious rather than noble motives, which is not only unflattering but also unfair to the latter tribunal.<br><br>As a matter of public policy, in the absence of fraud, dishonesty or corruption, the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are generally not subject to disciplinary action, even though such acts are erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As has been stated in the recent case of <i>Santos v. Judge Jose Orlino</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote>"The fundamental propositions governing responsibility for judicial error were more recently summarized in <i>In Re: Joaquin T. Borromeo </i>241 SCRA 405-467 (1995). There the Court stressed <i>inter alia </i>that given the nature of the judicial function and the power vested in the Supreme Court and the lower courts established by law, administrative or criminal complaints are neither alternative nor cumulative to judicial remedies where such are available, and must wait on the result thereof. Existing doctrine is that judges are not liable for what they do in the exercise of their judicial functions when acting within their legal powers and jurisdiction (<i>Alzua, et al. v. Johnson, </i>21 Phil. 308, 326; Sec. 9, Act No. 190). Certain it is that a judge may not be held administratively accountable for every erroneous order or decision he renders (<i>Rodrigo v. Quijano,</i>79 SCRA 10 [1977]). To hold otherwise would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment (SEE <i>Lopez v. Corpus, </i>78 SCRA 374 [1977]; <i>Pilipinas Bank v. Tirona-Liwag, </i>190 SCRA 834 [1990]). The error must be gross or patent, deliberate and malicious or incurred with evident bad faith (<i>Quizon v. Balthazar, Jr., </i>65 SCRA 293 [1975])."</blockquote>In sum, since the alleged error can not amount to gross misconduct and the record is bereft of any persuasive showing of deliberate or malicious intent on the part of respondent Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice to cause prejudice to any party, the instant administrative complaint against him, insofar as the charge for gross misconduct is concerned, must be dismissed for want of factual basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The penalty for gross inefficiency, on the other hand, ranges from reprimand and admonition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> to removal from office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of all the foregoing, respondent is hereby <b>ADMONISHED</b> and <b>STERNLY WARNED</b> that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall be dealt with more severely.
