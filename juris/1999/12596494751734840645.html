				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, petitioners ABS-CBN Broadcasting&nbsp; Corp. (hereinafter ABS-CBN) seeks to reverse and set aside the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of 31 October 1996 and the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of 10 March 1997 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 44125.&nbsp; The former affirmed with modification the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of 28 April 1993 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 80, in Civil Case No. Q-12309.&nbsp; The latter denied the motion to reconsider the decision of 31 October 1996.<br><br>The antecedents, as found by the RTC and adopted by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:<br><blockquote>In 1990, ABS-CBN and VIVA executed a Film Exhibition Agreement (Exh. “A”) whereby Viva gave ABS-CBN an exclusive right to exhibit some Viva films.&nbsp; Sometime in December 1991, in accordance with paragraph 2.4 [<i>sic</i>] of said agreement stating that-<br><blockquote>1.4 ABS-CBN shall have the right of first refusal to the next twenty-four (24) Viva films&nbsp; for TV telecast under such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto, provided, however, that such right shall be exercised by ABS-CBN from the actual offer in writing.</blockquote>Viva, through defendant Del Rosario, offered ABS-CBN, through its vice-president Charo Santos-Concio, a list of three (3) film packages (36 title) from which ABS-CBN may exercise its right of first refusal under the afore-said agreement (Exhs. “1” par. 2, “2,” “2-A” and “2-B – Viva).&nbsp; ABS-CBN, however through Mrs. Concio, “can tick off only ten (10) titles” (from the list) “we can purchase” (Exh. “3” – Viva) and therefore did not accept said list (TSN, June 8, 1992, pp. 9-10).&nbsp; The titles ticked off by Mrs. Concio are not the subject of the case at bar except the film “Maging Sino Ka Man.”<br><br>For further enlightenment, this rejection letter dated January 06, 1992 (Exh “3” – Viva) is hereby quoted:<br><blockquote>6 January 1992<br><br>Dear Vic,<br><br>This is not a very formal business letter I am writing to you as I would like to express my difficulty in recommending the purchase of the three film packages you are offering ABS-CBN.<br><br>From among the three packages I can only tick off 10 titles we can purchase.&nbsp; Please see attached.&nbsp; I hope you will understand my position.&nbsp; Most of the action pictures in the list do not have big action stars in the cast.&nbsp; They are not for primetime.&nbsp; In line with this I wish to mention that I have not scheduled for telecast several action pictures in our very first contract because of the cheap production value of these movies as well as the lack of big action stars.&nbsp; As a film producer, I am sure you understand what I am trying to say as Viva produces only big action pictures.<br><br>In fact, I would like to request two (2) additional runs for these movies as I can only schedule them in out non-primetime slots.&nbsp; We have to cover the amount that was paid for these movies because as you very well know that non-primetime advertising rates are very low.&nbsp; These are the unaired titles in the first contract.&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="TOP" width="10%" align="LEFT">1.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"><p> Kontra Persa [<i>sic</i>]</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">2.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">Raider Platoon</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">3.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> Underground guerillas</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">4.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> Tiger Command</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">5.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> Boy de Sabog</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">6.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> lady Commando</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">7.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> Batang Matadero</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">8.</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> Rebelyon</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>I hope you will consider this request of mine.<br><br>The other dramatic films have been offered to us before and have been rejected because of the ruling of MTRCB to have them aired at 9:00 p.m. due to their very adult themes.<br><br>As for the 10 titles I have choosen [sic] from the 3 packages please consider including all the other Viva movies produced last year, I have quite an attractive offer to make.<br><br>Thanking you and with my warmest regards.<br><br><div align="RIGHT">(Signed)<br><br>Charo Santos-Concio</div></blockquote>On February 27, 1992, defendant Del Rosario approached ABS-CBN’s Ms. Concio, with a list consisting of 52 original movie titles (i.e., not yet aired on television) including the 14 titles subject of the present case, as well as 104 re-runs (previously aired on television) from which ABS-CBN may choose another 52 titles, as a total of 156 titles, proposing to sell to ABS-CBN airing rights over this package of 52 originals and 52 re-runs for P60,000,000.00 of which P30,000,000.00 will be in cash and P30,000,000.00 worth of television spots (Exh. “4” to “4-C” – Viva; “9” – Viva).<br><br>On April 2, 1992, defendant Del Rosario and ABS-CBN’s general manager, Eugenio Lopez III, met at the Tamarind Grill Restaurant in Quezon City to discuss the package proposal of VIVA.&nbsp; What transpired in that lunch meeting is the subject of conflicting versions.&nbsp; Mr. Lopez testified that he and Mr. Del Rosario allegedly agreed that ABS-CBN was granted exclusive film rights to fourteen (14) films for a total consideration of P36 million; that he allegedly put this agreement as to the price and number of films in a “napkin” and signed it and gave it to Mr. Del Rosario (Exh. D; TSN, pp. 24-26, 77-78, June 8, 1992).&nbsp; On the other hand.&nbsp; Del Rosario denied having made any agreement with Lopez regarding the 14 Viva films; denied the existence of a napkin in which Lopez wrote something; and insisted that what he and Lopez discussed at the lunch meeting was Viva’s film package offer of 104 films (52 originals and 52 re-runs) for a total price of P60 million.&nbsp; Mr. Lopez promising [sic]to make a counter proposal which came in the form of a proposal contract Annex “C” of the complaint (Exh. “1” – Viva; Exh “C” – ABS-CBN).<br><br>On April 06, 1992, Del Rosario and Mr. Graciano Gozon of RBS Senior vice-president for Finance discussed the terms and conditions of Viva’s offer to sell the 104 films, after the rejection of the same package by ABS-CBN.<br><br>On April 07, 1992, defendant Del Rosario received through his secretary , a handwritten note from Ms. Concio, (Exh. “5” – Viva), which reads: “Here’s the draft of the contract.&nbsp; I hope you find everything in order,” to which was attached a draft exhibition agreement (Exh. “C” – ABS-CBN; Exh. “9” – Viva p. 3) a counter-proposal covering 53 films, 52 of which came from the list sent by defendant Del Rosario and one film was added by Ms. Concio, for a consideration of P35 million.&nbsp; Exhibit “C” provides that ABS-CBN is granted film rights to 53 films and contains a right of first refusal to 1992 Viva Films.”&nbsp; The said counter proposal was however rejected by Viva’s Board of Directors [in the] evening of the same day, April 7, 1992, as Viva would not sell anything less than the package of 104 films for P60 million pesos (Exh. “9” – Viva), and such rejection was relayed to Ms. Concio.<br><br>On April 29, 1992, after the rejection of ABS-CBN and following several negotiations and meetings defendant Del Rosario and Viva’s President Teresita Cruz, in consideration of P60 million, signed a letter of agreement dated April 24, 1992, granting RBS the exclusive right to air 104 Viva-produced and/or acquired films (Exh. “7-A” - RBS; Exh. “4” – RBS) including the fourteen (14) films subject of the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>On 27 May 1992, ABS-CBN filed before the RTC a complaint for specific performance with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order against private respondents Republic Broadcasting Corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (hereafter RBS), Viva Production (hereafter VIVA), and Vicente del Rosario.&nbsp; The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-92-12309.<br><br>On 28 May 1992, the RTC issued a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> enjoining private respondents from proceeding with the airing, broadcasting, and televising of the fourteen VIVA films subject of the controversy, starting with the film <i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i>, which was scheduled to be shown on private respondent RBS’ channel 7 at seven o’clock in the evening of said date.<br><br>On 17 June 1992, after appropriate proceedings, the RTC issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> directing the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction upon ABS-CBN’s posting of a P35 million bond.&nbsp; ABS-CBN moved for the reduction of the bond,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> while private respondents moved for reconsideration of the order and offered to put up a counterbond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, private respondents filed separate answer with counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> RBS also set up a cross-claim against VIVA.<br><br>On 3 August 1992, the RTC issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction upon the posting by RBS of a P30 million counterbond to answer for whatever damages ABS-CBN might suffer by virtue of such dissolution.&nbsp; However, it reduced petitioner’s injunction bond to P15 million as a condition precedent for the reinstatement of the writ of preliminary injunction should private respondents be unable to post a counterbond.<br><br>At the pre-trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> on 6 August 1992, the parties upon suggestion of the court, agreed to explore the possibility of an amicable settlement.&nbsp; In the meantime, RBS prayed for and was granted reasonable time within which to put up a P30 million counterbond in the event that no settlement would be reached.<br><br>As the parties failed to enter into an amicable settlement, RBS posted on 1 October 1992 a counterbond, which the RTC approved in its Order of 15 October 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On 19 October 1992, ABS-CBN filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the 3 August and 15 October 1992 Orders, which RBS opposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On 29 October, the RTC conducted a pre-trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Pending resolution of its motion for reconsideration, ABS-CBN filed with the Court of Appeals a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> challenging the RTC’s Order of 3 August and 15 October 1992 and praying for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the RTC from enforcing said orders.&nbsp; The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 29300.<br><br>On 3 November 1992, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to enjoin the airing, broadcasting, and televising of any or all of the films involved in the controversy.<br><br>On 18 December 1992, the Court of Appeals promulgated a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dismissing the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 29300 for being premature.&nbsp; ABS-CBN challenged the dismissal&nbsp; in a petition for review filed with this Court on 19 January 1993, which was docketed s G.R. No. 108363.<br><br>In the meantime the RTC received the evidence for the parties in Civil Case No. Q-92-12309.&nbsp; Thereafter, on 28 April 1993, it rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> in favor of RBS and VIVA and against ABS-CBN disposing&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, under cool reflection and prescinding from the foregoing, judgment is rendered in favor of defendants and against the plaintiff.<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">(1) </td><td colspan="2"><p>The complaint is hereby dismissed;</p></td></tr><tr><td>(2)</td><td colspan="2"> Plaintiff ABS-CBN is ordered to pay defendant RBS the following:</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td width="10%">a) </td><td><p align="JUSTIFY">P107,727.00 the amount of premium paid by RBS to the surety which issued defendants RBS’s bond to lift the injunction;</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>b)</td><td><div align="JUSTIFY">P191,843.00 for the amount of print advertisement for “Maging Sino Ka Man” in various newspapers;</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>c)</td><td>Attorney’s fees in the amount of P1 million;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>d)</td><td> P5 million as and by way of moral damages;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>e)</td><td> P5 million as and by way of exemplary damages;</td></tr><tr><td>(3)</td><td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">For the defendant VIVA, plaintiff&nbsp; ABS-CBN is ordered to pay P212,000.00 by way of reasonable attorney’s fees.</div></td></tr><tr><td>(4)</td><td colspan="2"> The cross-claim of defendant RBS against defendant VIVA is dismissed.</td></tr><tr><td>(5)</td><td colspan="2"> Plaintiff to pay the costs.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote></blockquote>According to the RTC, there was no meeting of minds on the price and terms of the offer.&nbsp; The alleged agreement between Lopez III and Del Rosario was subject to the approval of the VIVA Board of Directors, and said agreement was disapproved during the meeting of the Board on 7 April 1992.&nbsp; Hence, there was no basis for ABS-CBN’s demand that VIVA signed the 1992 Film Exhibition Agreement.&nbsp; Furthermore, the right of first refusal under the 1990 Film Exhibition Agreement had previously been exercised per Ms. Concio’s letter to Del Rosario ticking off ten titles acceptable to them, which would have made the 1992 agreement an entirely new contract.<br><br>On 21 June 1993, this Court denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> ABS-CBN’s petition for review in G.R. No. 108363, as no reversible error was committed by the Court of Appeals in its challenged decision and the case had “become moot and academic in view of the dismissal of the main action by the court a quo in its decision” of 28 April 1993.<br><br>Aggrieved by the RTC’s decision, ABS-CBN appealed to the Court of Appeals claiming that there was a perfected contract between ABS-CBN and VIVA granting ABS-CBN the exclusive right to exhibit the subject films.&nbsp; Private respondents VIVA and Del Rosario also appealed seeking moral and exemplary damages and additional attorney’s fees.<br><br>In its decision of 31 October 1996, the Court of Appeals agreed with the RTC that the contract between ABS-CBN and VIVA had not been perfected, absent the approval by the VIVA Board of Directors of whatever Del Rosario, it’s agent, might have agreed with Lopez III.&nbsp; The appellate court did not even believe ABS-CBN’s evidence that Lopez III actually wrote down such an agreement on a “napkin,” as the same was never produced in court.&nbsp; It likewise rejected ABS-CBN’s insistence on its right of first refusal and ratiocinated as follows:<br><blockquote>As regards the matter of right of first refusal, it may be true that a Film Exhibition Agreement was entered into between Appellant ABS-CBN and appellant VIVA under Exhibit “A” in 1990 and that parag. 1.4 thereof provides:<br><blockquote>1.4&nbsp; ABS-CBN shall have the right of first refusal to the next twenty-four (24) VIVA films for TV telecast under such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto, provided, however, that such right shall be exercised by ABS-CBN within a period of fifteen (15) days from the actual offer in writing (Records, p. 14).</blockquote>[H]owever, it is very clear that said right of first refusal in favor of ABS-CBN shall still be subjected to such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties thereto, and that the said right shall be exercised by ABS-CBN within fifteen (15) days from the actual offer in writing.<br><br>Said parag. 1.4 of the agreement Exhibit “A” on the right of first refusal did not fix the price of the film right to the twenty-four (24) films, nor did it specify the terms thereof.&nbsp; The same are still left to be agreed upon by the parties.<br><br>In the instant case, ABS-CBN’s letter of rejection Exhibit 3 (Records, p. 89) stated that it can only tick off ten (10) films, and the draft contract Exhibit “C” accepted only fourteen (14) films, while parag. 1.4 of Exhibit “A” speaks of the next twenty-four (24) films.<br><br>The offer of VIVA was sometime in December 1991, (Exhibits 2, 2-A, 2-B; Records, pp. 86-88; Decision, p. 11, Records, p. 1150), when the first list of VIVA films was sent by Mr. Del Rosario to ABS-CBN.&nbsp; The Vice President of ABS-CBN, Mrs. Charo Santos-Concio, sent a letter dated January 6, 1992 (Exhibit 3, Records, p. 89) where ABS-CBN exercised its right of refusal by rejecting the offer of VIVA.&nbsp; As aptly observed by the trial court, with the said letter of Mrs. Concio of January 6, 1992, ABS-CBN had lost its right of first refusal.&nbsp; And even if We reckon the fifteen (15) day period from February 27, 1992 (Exhibit 4 to 4-C) when another list was sent to ABS-CBN after the letter of Mrs. Concio, still the fifteen (15) day period within which ABS-CBN shall exercise its right of first refusal has already expired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, respondent court sustained the award factual damages consisting in the cost of print advertisements and the premium payments for the counterbond, there being adequate proof of the pecuniary loss which RBS has suffered as a result of the filing of the complaint by ABS-CBN.&nbsp; As to the award of moral damages, the Court of Appeals found reasonable basis therefor, holding that RBS’s reputation was debased by the filing of the complaint in Civil Case No. Q-92-12309 and by the non-showing of the film “<b>Maging Sino Ka Man</b>.”&nbsp; Respondent court also held that exemplary damages were correctly imposed by way of example or correction for the public good in view of the filing of the complaint despite petitioner’s knowledge that the contract with VIVA had not been perfected.&nbsp; It also upheld the award of attorney’s fees, reasoning that with ABS-CBN’s act of instituting Civil Case No. Q-92-12309, RBS was “unnecessarily forced to litigate.”&nbsp; The appellate court, however, reduced the awards of moral damages to P 2 million, exemplary damages to P2 million, and attorney’s fees to P500,000.00.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent Court of Appeals denied VIVA and Del Rosario’s appeal because it was “RBS and not VIVA which was actually prejudiced when the complaint was filed by ABS-CBN.”<br><br>Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, ABS-CBN filed the petition in this case, contending that the Court of Appeals gravely erred in<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>…&nbsp; RULING THAT THERE WAS NO PERFECTED CONTRACT BETWEEN PETITIONER AND PRIVATE RESPONDENT VIVA NOTWITHSTANDING&nbsp; PREPONFERANCE OF EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY PETITIONER TO THE CONTRARY.<br><br><center>II</center><br>…&nbsp; IN AWARDING ACTUAL AND COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN FAVOR OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT RBS.<br><br><center>III</center><br>…&nbsp; IN AWARDING MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN FAVOR OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT RBS.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>…&nbsp; IN AWARDING ATORNEY’S FEES OF RBS.</blockquote>ABS-CBN claims that it had yet to fully exercise its right of first refusal over twenty-four titles under the 1990 Film Exhibition Agreement, as it had chosen only ten titles from the first list.&nbsp; It insists that we give credence to Lopez’s testimony that he and Del Rosario met at the Tamarind Grill Restaurant, discussed the terms and conditions of the second list (the 1992 Film Exhibition Agreement) and upon agreement thereon, wrote the same on a paper napkin.&nbsp; It also asserts that the contract has already been effective, as the elements thereof, namely, consent, object, and consideration were established.&nbsp; It then concludes that the Court of Appeals’ pronouncements were not supported by law and jurisprudence, as per our decision of 1 December 1995 in <i>Limketkai Sons Milling, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which cited <i>Toyota Shaw, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Ang Yu&nbsp; Asuncion v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and&nbsp; <i>Villonco Realty Company v. Bormaheco, Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Anent the actual damages awarded to RBS, ABS-CBN disavows liability therefor.&nbsp; RBS spent for the premium on the counterbond of its own volition in order to negate the injunction issued by the trial court after the parties had ventilated their respective positions during the hearings for the purpose.&nbsp; The filing of the counterbond was an option available to RBS, but it can hardly be argued that ABS-CBN compelled RBS to incur such expense.&nbsp; Besides, RBS had another available option, <i>i.e.</i>, move for the dissolution of the injunction; or if it was determined to put up a counterbond, it could have presented a cash bond.&nbsp; Furthermore under Article 2203 of the Civil Code, the party suffering loss injury is also required to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family to minimize the damages resulting from the act or omission.&nbsp; As regards the cost of print advertisements, RBS had not convincingly established that this was a loss attributable to the non-showing of “<i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i>”; on the contrary, it was brought out during trial that with or without the case or injunction, RBS would have spent such an amount to generate interest in the film.<br><br>ABS-CBN further contends that there was no other clear basis for the awards of moral and exemplary damages.&nbsp; The controversy involving ABS-CBN and RBS did not in any way originate from business transaction between them.&nbsp; The claims for such damages did not arise from any contractual dealings or from specific acts committed by ABS-CBN against RBS that may be characterized as wanton, fraudulent, or reckless; they arose by virtue only of the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; An award of moral and exemplary damages is not warranted where the record is bereft of any proof that a party acted maliciously or in bad faith in filing an action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In any case, free resort to courts for redress of wrongs is a matter of public policy.&nbsp; The law recognizes the right of every one to sue for that which he honestly believes to be his right without fear of standing trial for damages where by lack of sufficient&nbsp; evidence, legal technicalities, or a different interpretation of the laws on the matter, the case would lose ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> One who, makes use of his own legal right does no injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> If damage results from filing of the complaint, it is <i>damnum absque injuria</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Besides, moral damages are generally not awarded in favor of a juridical person, unless it enjoys a good reputation that was debased by the offending party resulting in social humiliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>As regards the award of attorney’s fees, ABS-CBN maintains that the same had no factual, legal, or equitable justification.&nbsp; In sustaining the trial court’s award, the Court of Appeals acted in clear disregard of the doctrine laid down in <i>Buan v.

P36 million or P35 million?&nbsp; This weakens ABS-CBN’s claim.<br><br>FOURTH.&nbsp; Mrs. Concio, testifying for ABS-CBN stated that she transmitted Exhibit “C” to Mr. Del Rosario with a handwritten note, describing said Exhibit “C” as a draft.”&nbsp; (Exh. “5” – Viva; tsn pp. 23-24, June 08, 1992).&nbsp; The said draft has a well defined meaning.<br><br>…<br><br>Since Exhibit “C” is only a draft, or a tentative, provisional or preparatory writing prepared for discussion, the terms and conditions thereof could not have been previously agreed upon by ABS-CBN and Viva.&nbsp; Exhibit “C” could not therefore legally bind Viva, not having agreed thereto.&nbsp; In fact, Ms. Concio admitted that the terms and conditions embodied in Exhibit “C” were prepared by ABS-CBN’s lawyers and there was no discussion on said terms and conditions….<br><br>As the parties had not yet discussed the proposed terms and conditions in Exhibit “C,” and there was no evidence whatsoever that Viva agreed to the terms and conditions thereof, said document cannot be a binding contract.&nbsp; The fact that Viva refused to sign Exhibit “C” reveals only two [sic] well that it did not agree on its terms and conditions, and this court has no authority to compel Viva to agree thereto.<br><br>FIFTH.&nbsp; Mr. Lopez understand [<i>sic</i>] that what he and Mr. Del Rosario agreed upon at the Tamarind Grill was only provisional, in the sense that it was subject to approval by the Board of Directors of Viva.&nbsp; He testified:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">Q</td><td><p align="JUSTIFY"> Now, Mr. Witness, and after that Tamarinf meeting … the second meeting wherein you claimed that you have the meeting of the minds between you and Mr. Vic del Rosario, what happened?</p></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Vic Del Rosario was supposed to call us up and tell us specifically the result of the discussion with the Board of Directors.</div></td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>And you are referring to the so-called agreement which you wrote in [<i>sic</i>] a piece of paper?</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td> Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td> So, he was going to forward that to the board of Directors for approval?</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td> Yes, sir (Tsn, pp. 42-43, June 8, 1992)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div align="CENTER">…</div></td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td> Did Mr. Del Rosario tell you that he will submit it to his Board for approval?</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td> Yes, sir.&nbsp; (Tsn, p. 69, June 8, 1992).</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>The above testimony of Mr. Lopez shows beyond doubt that he knew Mr. Del Rosario had no authority to bind Viva to a contract with ABS-CBN until and unless its Board of Directors approved it.&nbsp; The complaint, in fact, alleges that Mr. Del Rosario “is the Executive Producer of defendant Viva” which “is a corporation.” (par. 2, complaint).&nbsp; As a mere agent of Viva, Del Rosario could not bind Viva unless what he did is ratified by its Directors.&nbsp; (Vicente vs.Geraldez, 52 SCRA 210; Arnold vs. Willets and Paterson, 44 Phil. 634).&nbsp; As a mere agent, recognized as such by plaintiff, Del Rosario could not be held liable jointly and severally with Viva and his inclusion as party defendant has no legal basis.&nbsp; (Salonga vs. Warner Barnes [sic],COLTA, 88 Phil. 125; Salmon vs. Tan, 36 Phil. 556).<br><br>The testimony of Mr. Lopez and the allegations in the complaint are clear admissions that what was supposed to have been agreed upon at the Tamarind Grill between Mr. Lopez and Del Rosario was not a binding agreement.&nbsp; It is as it should be because corporate power to enter into a contract is lodged in the Board of Directors.&nbsp; (Sec. 23, Corporation Code).&nbsp; Without such board approval by the Viva board, whatever agreement Lopez and Del Rosario arrived at could not ripen into a valid binding upon Viva (Yao Ka Sin Trading vs. Court of Appeals, 209 SCRA 763).&nbsp; The evidence adduced shows that the Board of Directors of Viva rejected Exhibit “C” and insisted that the film package for 104 films be maintained (Exh. “7-1 – Viva).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></b><br><br>The contention that ABS-CBN had yet to fully exercise its right of first refusal over twenty-four films under the 1990 Film Exhibition Agreement and that the meeting between Lopez and Del Rosario was a continuation of said previous contract is untenable.&nbsp; As observed by the trial court, ABS-CBN’s right of first refusal had already been exercised when Ms. Concio wrote to Viva ticking off ten films.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he subsequent negotiation with ABS-CBN two (2) months after this letter was sent, was for an entirely different package.&nbsp; Ms. Concio herself admitted on cross-examination to having used or exercised the right of first refusal.&nbsp; She stated that the list was not acceptable and was indeed not accepted by ABS-CBN, (Tsn, June 8, 1992, pp. 8-10).&nbsp; Even Mr. Lopez himself admitted that the right of first refusal may have been already exercised by Ms. Concio (as she had).&nbsp; (TSN, June 8, 1992, pp. 71-75).&nbsp; Del Rosario himself knew and understand [<i>sic</i>] that ABS-CBN has lost its right of first refusal when his list of 36 titles were rejected (Tsn, June 9, 1992, pp. 10-11).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>However, we find for ABS-CBN on the issue of damages.&nbsp;
