				<H3>EXECUTIVE JUDGE AIDA RANGEL-ROQUE, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT (METC), MANILA, COMPLAINANT, VS. GERARDO S. RIVOTA, BRANCH CLERK OF COURT, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT (METC), BRANCH 11, MANILA, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a complaint charging respondent Gerardo S. Rivota, branch clerk of court, Branch 11 of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Manila, with dishonesty, gross violation of existing rules and regulations, and conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The complaint was filed by Executive Judge Aida Rangel-Roque of the MeTC of Manila, on the basis of a letter, dated January 16, 1997, of Judge Lydia Querubin Layosa, pairing judge of Branch 11 of the MeTC of Manila.<br><br>In her letter, Judge Layosa reported that in the course of a hearing on a motion to withdraw rental deposits held in Civil Case No. 128131-CV (<i>Teofista Pilapil v. Jorge Disuanco</i>) on December 19, 1996, respondent admitted that he deposited in his personal account in the Land Bank of the Philippines the rentals in the total amount of P170,199.54, covering the period March 1991 to November 1996, which the defendant in that case had consigned in court and that, in another case (Civil Case No. 149361-CV, <i>Ester V. Manlicon vs. Cetus Development, Inc.</i>), he did not turn over to the clerk of court the money given to him by the plaintiff as rentals, totalling P8,000.00, for the period from August 1995 to November 1996 until December 20, 1996.<br><br>Upon the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), respondent was required to answer the charges and, in the meantime, was placed under preventive suspension. The matter was likewise referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for possible criminal prosecution of respondent.<br><br>In his answer, respondent alleged that he deposited the rentals in Civil Case No. 128131-CV in his personal account upon the insistence of defendant Jorge Disuanco and without objection from the plaintiff Teofista C. Pilapil; that the total amount of P172,444.20 was later paid by him to the plaintiff on January 29, 1997; and that in depositing the rentals in his personal account, he realized he committed a "blunder," but it was made in good faith. Respondent did not answer allegations that, in another case (Civil Case No. 149361-CV), he received rentals for deposit during the period August 1995 to November 1996 but did not turn over the amounts to the clerk of court until December 20, 1996. Respondent pleaded for "mercy," stating that he had been in the government service for thirty years and that an "unblemished record" is his only "legacy to his children." He pointed out that none of the parties in Civil Case No. 128131-CV ever complained against his having deposited the rentals in his personal account.<br><br>In reply, Judge Roque contended that by asking for indulgence from this Court respondent practically admitted his guilt.<br><br>On January 14, 1998, the Court referred the case to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report, and recommendation.<br><br>On April 14, 1998, the OCA submitted its report recommending that respondent branch clerk of court be dismissed from the service with forfeiture of his retirement benefits and with prejudice to employment in any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the Government, including any government-owned or controlled corporation.<br><br>The Court finds the recommendation well taken.<br><br>Circular No. 13-92, which took effect on March 1, 1992, provides in pertinent part:<br><br><center>CIRCULAR NO. 13-92</center><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="20%">TO:</td><td width="80%"><div align="justify">ALL EXECUTIVE JUDGES AND CLERKS OF COURT OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS AND SHARI'A DISTRICT COURTS.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SUBJECT:</td><td><div align="justify">COURT FIDUCIARY FUNDS</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">....</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Conformably herewith, Circular No. 5, dated November 25, 1982, is hereby revoked and declared of no further force or effect.

In that hearing, respondent admitted that during the period March 1991 to December 1996, he received from the defendant Jorge Disuanco monthly rentals of P2,466.66 and that he deposited the rentals in his personal account, first in the Philippine National Bank and later in the Land Bank of the Philippines. He claimed that he later paid to the plaintiff in the case, Teofista Pilapil, the amount of P172,444.20.

The amount is evidenced by a receipt issued by the court to the plaintiff in that case. Respondent did not deny this.<br><br>Respondent is guilty of violating Circular No. 13-92, which, as already noted, requires that rental deposits should be deposited immediately upon receipt by the clerk of court in a government depository bank; that the deposits should be made in the name of the court in which the case is pending; and that the clerk of court keep the passbook, informing the executive judge of the name of the bank, the branch thereof, and the account number. As held in <i>Madrid vs. Ramirez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the fact that Circular No. 13-92 is addressed to executive judges and clerks of court does not excuse other court personnel, like respondent branch clerk of court, from non compliance with it. In the case at bar, respondent had no excuse for his failure to turn over the rentals received by him from the defendant Jorge Disuanco to the clerk of court of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila. He claims ignorance of Circular No. 13-92 yet he also claims that it was in Civil Case No. 128131-CV that he deposited rentals in his personal account for the first time.<br><br>At the hearing on the motion for the withdrawal of rental deposits, the defendant in the civil case, Jorge Disuanco, produced receipts for 66 months, which, at the rate of P2,466.66 per month, represent a total payment of P162,799.56. But the MeTC found that in fact the defendant paid the total amount of P172,666.20, representing monthly rentals for 70 months from March 1991 to December 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Indeed, respondent paid the plaintiff the amount of P172,444.20 on January 27, 1991, leaving a balance of P222.00. In addition, respondent admitted that he withdrew P100,000.00 from his account on June 10, 1996 to help a relative. At that time, the balance of his account in the bank, as shown in his passbook, was P209,298.61 while the monthly rentals totalled P155,399.58 (at P2,466.66 monthly for 63 months from March 1991 to May 1996). It follows therefore that respondent used part of the money deposited by him as monthly rentals since his personal funds were insufficient to cover the withdrawal of P100,000.00. That respondent paid the plaintiff in the civil case the amount of P172,444.20 (which is short of P222.00 since he received P172,666.20 as rentals for 70 months) does not relieve him of administrative liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In addition, as already noted, in Civil Case No. 149361-CV respondent received rentals during the period August 1995 to November 1996 but did not pay the amount to the clerk of court until December 19, 1996.<br><br>What this Court said in <i>Gano vs. Leonen</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> cannot be overemphasized:<br><blockquote>"Public service requires the utmost integrity and strictest discipline. Thus, a public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity. No less than the Constitution sanctifies the principle that a public office is a public trust, and enjoins all public officers and employees to serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency. The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards For Public Officials and Employees additionally provides that every public servant shall at all times uphold public interest over his or her personal interest."</blockquote>Public office is indeed a public trust. No position demands greater moral righteousness and uprightness from its occupant than does the judicial office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Those connected with the dispensation of justice bear a heavy burden of responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Clerks of court in particular must be individuals of competence, honesty, and probity, charged as they are with safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings. For failing to live up to these exacting standards, respondent should be dismissed. This is not the first time the Court has ordered the dismissal of clerks of court and other court personnel for failure to deposit fiduciary funds in authorized government depository as required by rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>That none of the parties in the MeTC complained against respondent is of no moment. For the fact is that , as a result of respondent's use of the rentals for personal gain, public trust was violated and public confidence in the judiciary was placed in serious danger.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Branch Clerk of Court Gerardo S. Rivota GUILTY of grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and hereby orders his immediate DISMISSAL from the service with FORFEITURE of all leave credits and retirement benefits due. In addition, he is hereafter DISQUALIFIED from reemployment in the government service, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo, Buena,</i> and <i>Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 254 SCRA 376 (1996).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> This was so stated by Judge Lydia Querubin Layosa in her order dated December 19, 1996 in Civil Case No. 128131-CV.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Judiciary Planning and Implementation Office vs. Calaguas, 256 SCRA 690 (1996).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 232 SCRA 98, 101-102 (1994).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rabe vs. Flores, 272 SCRA 415 (1997).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Belvis vs. Fernandez, 256 SCRA 55 (1995).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>See, e.g.,</i> Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao del Norte, A.M.
