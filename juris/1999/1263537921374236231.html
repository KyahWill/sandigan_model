				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">It is not for human to ravish what they produced. The rape committed by a father against his own daughter regardless of whether it is done under the cloak of parental discipline has no place in our society. That is why, it is considered as a heinous felony meted with the supreme penalty of termination of the assailant's life. For indeed those who lust must not last.<br><br>Once again the Court is saddled with another nightmare of lustful and incestuous defloration committed by one from whom the victim expects protection. The facts given credence by the trial court and quoted by both the prosecution (with page reference) and the defense in their respective Briefs, which are ably supported by evidence on record happened this wise:*<br><blockquote>"Sheryl Silvano is a beautiful mestiza (as may be shown in the pictures, Exhs. "T" to "T-5"), and already 5'6 tall at her age of sixteen (16) years, having been born on January 20, 1980. (Exhs. F and F-1) Her height have been inherited from her parents as her father is 6'2 tall and her mother is a mestiza. She is the legitimate daughter of David Silvano y Hayag, the accused in this case, and Shirley Ann G. Pedrosa, as evidenced by a marriage contract (Exhs. "E" &amp; "E-1"). Sheryl is the eldest and the only girl with two brothers, namely: John David, who was born on July 29, 1984 and Noel William, who was born on April 16, 1986. (pp. 1-5, tsn, August 14, 1996)<br><br>"On January 23, 1996 at 10:30 in the evening, while Sheryl was sleeping in her room at the second floor of their house located at 134-C Scout Rallos Street, Barangay Sacred Heart, Quezon City,** she was awakened by her father, the accused in this case. The accused then started scolding Sheryl for her coming late. (pp. 6-7, tsn, <i>ibid</i>.) The accused who appeared tipsy, started undressing Sheryl by lifting her T-shirt, as a form of punishment for her coming home late, which punishment she has been experiencing from the accused since she was 13 years old. After lifting Sheryl's T-shirt, as she was not then wearing any bra, the accused started holding Sheryl's breast at the same time kissing it. As Sheryl was practically leaning on the bed, the accused dragged Sheryl at the edge of the bed so that she would be facing the accused a little bit. The accused then knelt down on the floor and continued holding the breast of Sheryl with one hand while the other hand was holding the private organ of Sheryl. Sheryl tried to prevent the accused from doing what he was doing but the accused told Sheryl "you did something wrong and I told you I would do that as a punishment to you" (p. 7, tsn. ibid.). Despite the pleas of Sheryl, the accused continued kissing her breasts. Afterwards, the accused pulled Sheryl at the side of the bed and the accused removed her pair of short pants and panty. After removing the pair of short pants and panty of Sheryl, the accused grasped the hips and waist of Sheryl and pulled her towards him. Thereafter, when the accused was already in between the thighs of Sheryl, the accused started kissing the private organ of Sheryl, the accused was at the same time inserting his finger into Sheryl's vagina (p. 8, tsn, ibid.). Thereafter, the accused stood up a bit, pulled down his short pants and knelt down at the side of the bed. The accused then got a hold of Sheryl's two feet and placed them on top of his shoulders. The accused once again grasped the hips of Sheryl and pulled her nearer to him. When Sheryl was pulled nearer to the accused, the accused inserted his private organ into Sheryl's private organ. Although 'Sheryl tried to free herself by pushing the shoulders of the accused with her two feet and telling the accused to stop what he was doing to her, the accused, in order to have a full grip, got hold of the legs of Sheryl and placed them in between the arms of the accused (pp. 8-9, tsn, ibid.). After inserting the accused's private organ into the private organ of Sheryl, the accused performed a pumping motion. Subsequently, the accused's private organ was removed from the private organ of Sheryl and the accused rubbed his organ with the private organ of Sheryl. Thereafter, Sheryl felt something cold which was a sticky liquid emitted from the private organ of the accused and which the accused scattered in between Sheryl's private organ and on her stomach. Later on, the accused got a tissue paper and wiped the liquid-like substance. The accused then put on his pair of pants and left the room (pp. 9-11, tsn, ibid.). The following morning, Sheryl went to school at Jose Abad santos Memorial School (JASMS) in Quezon City.</blockquote>On February 12, Sheryl who could no longer bear the punishment in the form of sexual abuse she had been getting from her father as in fact she was first raped when she was thirteen (13) years of age, left their house at Scout Rallos, Quezon City, and stayed at her maternal grandmother's house at Scout Lozano, Quezon City. When she was asked to go back to her parents' house at and settle her differences with the accused, Sheryl confided to her mother and grandmother the real reason why she did not like to go back to their house. Thereupon, her mother and grandmother immediately sought the assistance of General Hercules Cataluña, Chief of the Central Police District Command, who happens to be married to a cousin of the mother of Sheryl."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Consequently, appellant was charged with rape by his own daughter to which he pleaded not guilty when arraigned. Prior to the presentation of evidence for the prosecution, the complaint was amended without objection from appellant, who when re-arraigned entered the same plea. The amended complaint reads:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 23rd day of January, 1996 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused who is the father of the Complainant by means of force and intimidation, to wit: then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, undressing the undersigned complainant who is under eighteen (18) years of age and putting her legs on top of his shoulders, and thereafter have carnal knowledge with the undersigned complainant against her will and without her consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>After the prosecution presented its case, appellant filed a motion for leave to file demurrer to evidence on the ground that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt, which motion, however, was denied by the lower court. Appellant thus presented evidence for his defense. Thereafter, the lower court rendered judgment convicting appellant of the crime charged, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of death, and ordered him to indemnify the victim. The dispositive portion of the decision <i>a quo</i> states:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this court finds the accused David Silvano y Hayag guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined in and penalized by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of death and to pay the costs. The accused is hereby ordered to indemnify the victim, Sheryl P. Silvano, the amount of P50,000.00, as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>"SO ORDERED".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Upon automatic appeal to this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> appellant assails his conviction by insisting on his innocence. He denied the accusation arguing that the charge leveled against him was a mere ploy of his wife and the latter's relatives for the purpose of severing their marital relationship.<br><br>In the review of death cases, foremost in the mind of the Court is the heavy penalty which an accused faces. Aware that life once taken, is like virginity which once defiled, can never be restored,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> a thorough scrutiny of the case is in order. Against the proffered excuses of appellant, however, and guided by the three principles in the review of rape cases, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote>a.) An accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove;<br><br>b.) In view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape, where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and<br><br>c.) The evidence of the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense.</blockquote>The fundamental presumption of innocence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> enjoyed by appellant was overcome with the requisite quantum of proof in criminal cases and his guilt sufficiently established by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The qualified rape of an underaged relative for which appellant was charged is classified as a heinous crime and penalized under Section 335 of the Revised Penal code (RPC), as amended by Section 11, Republic Act (R.A.) 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which provides:<br><blockquote>"<i>When and how rape is committed - </i>Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br>1.) By using force or intimidation;<br><br>2.) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>3.) When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br>The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1.) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim;<br><br>2.) When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities;<br><br>3.) When the rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity;<br><br>4.) When the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old;<br><br>5.) When the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease;<br><br>6.) When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency;<br><br>7.) When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation. (emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>In proving such felony, the prosecution must allege and prove the ordinary elements of 1.) sexual congress 2.) with a woman 3.) by force and without consent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and in order to warrant the imposition of death penalty, the additional elements that 4.) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape and 5.) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim should also be alleged and proven. All such elements are undisputedly present in this case. The victim herein at the age of sixteen (16) years was subjected to forced sexual intercourse by appellant, as duly shown in her testimony:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q. </td><td width="95%"><p>While you were sleeping at 10:30 in the evening of January 23, 1996, what happen?***</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY.

Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which a man keeps a woman in a state of fear and humiliation.

There is also no merit in his assertion that the victim's two younger brothers - one of whom is deaf - who were sleeping in the same room, would have been awakened when she struggled against the advances of appellant. Suffice it to say, however, that while the brutish sexual assault on the victim was being committed under the cloak of the night and disguised as a form of parental sanction, it is "not impossible nor incredible for the members of the complainant's family to be in deep slumber and not to be awakened."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> because rape can be committed in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> His argument that it is "unusual" and "improbable" for the rape to occur at about 10:30 in the evening since people are not "yet soundly sleep"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> lacks merit.

Precisely, he scolded her to make a good pretext that any noise created thereafter was nothing but part of the parental sanction and discipline on an allegedly erring child and thus, distract, if not mislead, possible assistance once he performs his evil instincts. Appellant likewise argues that the rape is "implausible, improbable if not impossible"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> considering that the series of acts allegedly lasted for about 40 minutes - 15 minutes for kissing and sucking her breast and nipples, 15 minutes for kissing her private parts and about 15 to 20 minutes for doing the motion.

If somewhere along the motion, she stopped resisting, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the fear is still there or that fatigue had intervened in her tenacity to fight the rapacity. A victim who cries rape, more so if she is a minor, almost always says all that is needed to signify that the crime has been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The intimate flow of revelations from a daughter to a mother of a father's outrageous conduct impelled them to seek assistance from their relatives including a police General.

With respect to his denial, it is inherently a weak defense which cannot prevail over positive identifications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Otherwise, the same is self-serving and deserves no greater evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It should be noted that affirmative testimony, like that of the victim's, is stronger than a negative one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> His excuse regarding support is <i>non-sequitur</i>. The fact that he supports her does not give him the license to rape her. It is his obligation to give support to her daughter as provided in Article 195(2,3) as well as his right and duty under Article 220(1) of the Family Code which expressly provides:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><blockquote><b>Article 195</b>. "Subject to the provisions of the succeeding Articles, the following are obliged to support each other to the whole extent set forth in the preceding Article:<br><br>xxx xxx xxx<br><br>(2).

The parents x x x shall have with respect to their unemancipated children or wards the following rights and duties:<br><br>(1). To x x x support" (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>The victim testified that appellant told her that she will be punished for coming home late at night and the punishment is to have sex with him. This ratiocination is the product of a sick mind of an equally sick parent who does not deserve to be such. It is clear from the provisions of Article 209 of the Family Code that from the mere status of being a parent flows one's "natural right and duty" not only of the "caring for" and the "rearing of" their unemancipated children but above all "the development of their moral, mental, and physical character and well-being." Although the Family Code recognizes the parents' rights and duties to "impose discipline" on their unemancipated children; "Supervise their activities, recreation and association with others x x x; and prevent them from acquiring habits detrimental to their x x x morals",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> it does not authorize them to force their offspring to copulate with them under the mask of discipline, or invade their honor and violate their dignity nor does it give them the license to ravish the product of their marital union. Appellant's way of punishment comes not in the form of correction but of an insane sexual gratification. Sex with one's own child is <i>per se</i> abhorrent and can never be justified as a form of parental punishment. The practice of sexual exploitation of the youth in the guise of disciplinary action is not a solution to juvenile curiosity which is part of growing up. His gratification instills an unnamed trauma in the child's innocent mind when she still cannot understand the meaning of sexual behavior.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Moreover, instead of instructing and educating his own daughter with "the right precept and good example", appellant provided her with perversed and distorted "moral and spiritual guidance"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> to the extent of brainwashing her that sex with one's father is nothing but a disciplinary sanction and "part of sex education"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> which the latter teaches her. Worse, the daughter herein even entertained doubts as to the normality and abnormality of her father's deplorable acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is also appellant's duty under the Family Code to give her "love and affection, advice and counsel, companionship and understanding."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Yet what she got was the humiliation and the destruction of her life, good future and the very essence of her existence.<br><br>Appellant further contends that her daughter's acts after the alleged rape, such as going to school the next day, leaving their home after more than two weeks had lapsed since the incident and reporting the same only when confronted by her mother are inconsistent with the behavior of a rape victim. The contention is without merit. The behavior and reaction of every person cannot be predicted with accuracy. It is a time-honored precept that "different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation and there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful experience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Not every rape victim can be expected to act conformably to the usual expectations of every one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Some may shout; some may faint; and some may be shocked into insensibility; while others may openly welcome the intrusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The failure of the victim to immediately reveal his father's incestuous acts is not indicative of fabricated charges. It should be noted that:<br><blockquote>"Many victims of rape never complain or file criminal charges against their rapists. They prefer to bear the ignominy and pain rather than reveal their shame to the world or risk rapists making good their threats to kill or hurt their victims."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote>The victim herein is in no case different. Her shame and genuine fear of what appellant might do to her or her brothers had temporarily sealed her lips. This is why she left their home, the scene of her defilement where her appellant father resides and went to her maternal grandmother's place. Only when confronted why she would not come back to their house did she reveal the avalanche of shame and degradation that had befallen her at that tender age of 16 years from her very own father. It is not uncommon for a young girl at such age to be intimidated into silence and conceal for sometime the violation of her honor, even by the mildest threat against her life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Silence is not an odd behavior of rape victims who do not always immediately go to the rooftop and denounce their assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> This "natural reticence or aversion of the victims to reveal the humiliation attaching to the crime" is a "stigma they will have to bear indefinitely thereafter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The fear of these young victims of reprisals upon them or their families easily cows them into submission and silence. Worse, in incestuous rape, that fear which compels non-revelation is further reinforced by the moral ascendancy of the rapist over his ravished relative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> As the father of the victim, appellant whom she called "Daddy" had assumed parental authority over her during her formative years. Undisputedly, he exerts strong moral influence over complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The imputation by appellant of wrongful motive to his wife who allegedly used their daughter as an instrument in concocting the rape just to sever their marital ties is too shallow. It is unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as an engine of malice especially if it will subject her to embarrassment and even stigma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> No mother in her right mind would subject her child to the humiliation, disgrace and trauma attendant to a prosecution for rape, if she were not motivated solely by the desire to incarcerate the person responsible for her child's defilement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> or if the same is not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> In the same vein, a mother would not expose her daughter to such an ignominy merely to end her relationship with her husband or to retaliate against him for his transgressions as a family man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> And it is unbelievable for a daughter to charge her own father with rape at the expense of being ridiculed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Accordingly, as the defense failed to prove that the principal witness was moved by improper motive, the presumption is that she was not so moved and her testimony entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>The contention that he cannot be convicted on the sole testimony of his daughter with respect to the rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> easily crumbles in the light of the doctrine that only two people are privy to the crime of rape and the evaluation of the evidence presented ultimately resolves around the credibility of complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The trial court, giving full faith and credence to the victim's testimony found it to be "logical, straightforward and candid manner, without any artificialities or pretensions that would tarnish the credibility of her testimony".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> It even observed that she "shamelessly cried as she was narrating the tragic experience" and her "stern demeanor evinces the hatred she had for the accused".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Notwithstanding that the victim's testimony is uncorroborated, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof so long as it meets the test of credibility,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and the prosecution is not bound to present witnesses other than the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>It is highly unlikely that the victim, a 16-year old high school student, presumably a virgin, an innocent and unsophisticated girl, unexposed to the ways of the world, would concoct a reprehensible story of defloration, no less than against her own father, allow an examination of her private parts and then subject herself to the rigors, trouble, inconvenience, ridicule and scandal of a public trial, where she has to bare her harrowing and traumatic experience, and be subjected to harassment, embarrassment and humiliation during cross-examination, unless she was in fact raped and deeply motivated by her sincere desire to do so solely to seek justice and obtain redress for the unforgivable and wicked acts committed upon her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> This Court has repeatedly ruled that no young and decent Filipina would publicly admit that she was ravished unless that is the truth for it is her natural instinct to protect her honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Complainant's tender age further lends to her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>"Apparent from the Court's decisions in rape cases with the offended parties being young and immature girls from the ages of twelve to sixteen, x x x is (the) considerable receptivity on the part of this Tribunal to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which such a grueling experience as a court trial, where they are called upon to lay bare what perhaps should be shrouded in secrecy, did expose them to. This is not to say that an uncritical acceptance should be the rule. It is only to emphasize that skepticism should be kept under control."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></blockquote>Ultimately, all the foregoing boils down to the issue of credibility of witnesses. Jurisprudential annals is replete with the rule that the findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses is a matter best left to the trial court because of its unique position of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> subject to certain exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> none of which, however, is attendant in this case.

No cogent reason was shown that the court <i>a quo</i> had overlooked or disregarded material facts and circumstances which when considered would have affected the result of this case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> or justify a departure from its assessments and findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Coming now to the award of damages.
